{"Headline": "Zuckerberg Takes Steps to Calm Facebook Employees", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica, featuring one of Facebook\u2019s lawyers, Paul Grewal. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed employees directly, according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Mr. Zuckerberg also spoke with staff on Friday at a regularly scheduled employee meeting, said two people who attended the event.Facebook declined to comment on the meetings.Earlier this week, some Facebook employees had said that colleagues had started looking to transfer from the main social network product to other branches of the company, such as to messaging app WhatsApp and photo-sharing site Instagram, which have been relatively unscathed by the recent scandals.One Facebook recruiter, who declined to be identified because of a nondisclosure agreement, said there were concerns that top talent might choose other Silicon Valley companies over Facebook.When Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.When he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.Mr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to \u201clarge amounts of information\u201d from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers\u2019 access and would notify users whose data had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica.Of the #DeleteFacebook campaign, Mr. Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview, \u201cI think it\u2019s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that.\u201dOn Friday, Facebook\u2019s senior managers promised an open line of communication as the company continued to re-evaluate its privacy and security measures, said two employees.There was a feeling, said one of the people, that Facebook wanted to take aggressive steps to make sure it could regain user trust. And over all, he said, confidence was up.Cecilia Kang and Scott Shane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 New York City Firefighters Killed in Iraq Helicopter Crash", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA day after a United States military helicopter crashed during a troop transport mission in western Iraq, the grim news traveled nearly 6,000 miles west, back to New York: Two city firefighters were among the service members killed.Officials said that four crew members were from the New York unit. The others onboard included a combat rescue officer, and active and reserve airmen, whose job is to find and recover downed aircrews and evacuate the wounded.As the hours passed on Friday, the names and backgrounds of the two victims came into focus.One, Christopher J. Raguso, 39, was appointed as a firefighter in 2005, and worked for many years in Ladder Company 113 in Flatbush, Brooklyn, before being promoted to lieutenant in 2016, and going to work in Queens. Decorated six times for bravery and saving lives, he was a volunteer firefighter on Long Island, where he lived with his wife, Carmella, and two young daughters.The post went on: \u201cChris was always there to help anyone with anything, he would never say no.\u201dThe other New York City firefighter who died was identified by his parents and city officials as Christopher Tripp Zanetis, 37, who was on leave from the department, where he had been a marshal in the Bureau of Fire Investigation.\u201cHe went by Tripp,\u201d said his father, John Zanetis, 73. \u201cEverybody called him Tripp.\u201dMr. Zanetis said a military chaplain and an Air Force major came to the home of his wife\u2019s mother in Nashville to convey the news.The parents, speaking together by telephone, said their son grew up in central Indiana and graduated from New York University. He was a sophomore there on Sept. 11, 2001, and, \u201cI think that\u2019s what made him become a New York City fireman,\u201d said his mother, Sarah Zanetis, 63, who said he had lived three blocks from the World Trade Center.Appointed as a firefighter in 2004, he was assigned to Engine Company 28 on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. In 2013, Firefighter Zanetis was promoted to fire marshal and the following year was recognized for his bravery as part of an investigative unit. Around then, his parents said, he joined the military and then pursued a career in law while on unpaid leave from the Fire Department.Mr. Zanetis said his son left for Iraq in the second week in January for his third tour. His father said his son was \u201ca pilot, flies a rescue helicopter, is a cross-fit trainer and he was in excellent health. He was unbelievable. Unbelievable.\u201d\u201cHe loved everyone and everyone loved him,\u201d Mr. Zanetis said.In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said both firefighters would be mourned. \u201cThey are truly two of New York City\u2019s bravest,\u201d he said. \u201cRunning into danger to protect and defend others, both in New York City and in combat overseas.\u201dThe New York Fire Department has more than 1,400 members who are either military reservists or veterans, and 62 of them are currently on active duty overseas, said James Long, a department spokesman. Firefighter Engeldrum, who died in 2004, was a sergeant in the First Battalion of the 105th Infantry and was the first New York City employee to die serving in Iraq.In Iraq, people who live near Thursday\u2019s crash said the helicopter went down shortly after takeoff, Ahmed al-Mahilawi, the mayor of Qaim, said in a telephone interview. The American military uses a base in the area as a logistics center and resupply hub.Coalition forces sealed off the site, in Anbar Province near Syria, an area that poses an continuing threat to the American-led effort against the Islamic State.Preliminary findings indicated that the helicopter may have had a technical malfunction before hitting the ground about 18 miles southeast of Qaim, near a phosphate factory and a railroad station. Among other questions are whether the aircraft could have struck overhead power lines, whose locations are difficult to map.In a Twitter post, President Trump offered his condolences and said the troops\u2019 sacrifice \u201cwill never be forgotten.\u201dThe helicopter that crashed is typically flown by the United States Air Force for search-and-rescue missions and medical evacuations. The aircraft, a modified version of the Black Hawk helicopter, is frequently used by Special Operations pararescue specialists.American forces and Iraqi partners have been winding down their operations against the Islamic State, but fighters pushed from urban centers in Iraq have escaped to the desert along the border with Syria.Eileen Sullivan and Falih Hassan contributed reporting.Eileen Sullivan and Falih Hassan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jews Who Dreamed of Utopia", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookNow comes another question: Was it good for the Jews?The museum has certainly got into the bolshie spirit. A pair of red ensigns with hammer and sickle will hang until May Day from its stately facade, and the galleries of \u201cComrade. Jew\u201d have been refitted with a bold, Constructivist design, featuring cantilevered walls painted white and red. But this is no agitprop showcase; it\u2019s a deeply researched dive into the lives of men and women who believed in something with the force others reserved for religion, and could hardly imagine how badly it would turn.Most Jews, of course, were not revolutionaries. But Jews did make up a disproportionate percentage of leftist utopians. To this show\u2019s list, we could add Karl Kautsky, Gyorgy Lukacs, Walter Benjamin, Isaac Deutscher, and many Americans. And for poor East European Jews \u2014 especially the millions in western Russia who faced political repression and frequent pogroms \u2014 the international workers\u2019 movement offered a tantalizing freedom. A red flag in the exhibit screams \u201cDown with the Tsarist constitution!\u201d in Yiddish. Election banners advocate the Poale Zion, a Jewish party aligned with the Mensheviks. A copy of the Russian newspaper Pravda, edited by the exiled Trotsky (born Lev Davidovich Bronstein) from Vienna, bellows for workers of the world to unite.In the early days of the Soviet Union, Jews not only held top political positions but also occupied central positions in the artistic avant-garde. The director Dziga Vertov, in films like \u201cMan With a Movie Camera,\u201d set about creating a cinematic language for a new world. El Lissitzky, who earlier printed folksy lithographs of Passover stories, now painted geometric collisions such as \u201cBeat the Whites with the Red Wedge\u201d (1920).It was after World War II, and especially after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, that Stalin\u2019s erratic stances toward Jews turned into full-bore anti-Semitism. This section is perhaps too shy about the gulag, evoking the black years through documents of crimes like the Night of the Murdered Poets in 1952, (in which Yiddish writers and others were executed in a Moscow prison), and a tangentially relevant clip from Costa-Gavras\u2019s anti-Stalinist film \u201cThe Confession.\u201dThe 1960s and 1970s saw substantial Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union to the United States and to Israel. Several of them became leading figures of Moscow Conceptualism, the most important art movement of the later years of the Soviet Union. Some Jewish artists, such as Ilya Kabakov and the pair of Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid produced parodies of Communist agitprop that is at once satirical and nostalgic. Other remain in the new Russia, including Erik Bulatov \u2014 who closes this show with \u201cSunrise or Sunset\u201d (1989), a bitingly ironic painting from the days of perestroika, in which the state emblem of the Soviet Union sits ambiguously where the sea meets the sky.Comrade.

{"Headline": "Dropbox\u2019s First-Day Pop Should Give Investors Pause: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Good Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Dropbox\u2019s valuation gives investors reason for caution.\u2022 Dropbox rises 45 percent in its first day of trading.\u2022 President Trump signs spending bill.\u2022 Bank of America Merrill Lynch paid $42 million to settle with N.Y.\u2019s attorney general over trading practices.\u2022 How bad will the U.S.-China trade fight be?Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn\u2019t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox\u2019s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn\u2019t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year\u2019s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.Of course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.Still, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.After Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.\u2014 Peter EavisDropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.At Friday\u2019s close, Dropbox is valued at $12.5 billionHere are some more numbers to put the I.P.O. market into perspective:\u2022 So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That\u2019s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.\u2022 The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.\u2022 The average gain for tech I.P.O. this year is 43%;\u2022 Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.The three best performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 Armo Biosciences (+126 percent)\u2022 CueBiopharma (+120 percent)\u2022 Menlo Therapeutics (+102 percent)The three worst performing I.P.O.s in 2018\u2022 ADT (-38 percent)\u2022 Corporacion America Airports (-39 percent)\u2022 Solid Biosciences LLC (-48 percent)The closer investors look at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.\u2014 Peter EavisEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.From this morning:Julie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.He elaborated:The question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.So it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. \u201cI would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,\u201d he told Ms. Segall.After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won\u2019t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have clashed on artificial intelligence, space travel and the direction of technology.On Friday, Mr. Musk showed just how little love lost there was between the two tech titans.They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.\u2014 Stephen GrocerThe purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.But Fast Company cautioned, \u201cThe companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward.\u201d And Courtney Reagan of CNBC, citing an unnamed source, threw cold water on the idea:The deals flyaround\u2014 Michael J. de la MercedThe decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.Peter Eavis\u2019s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China\u2019s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.Critics\u2019 cornerThe state\u2019s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients\u2019 trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.More from Mr. Schneiderman:\u201cAs Wall Street firms offer increasingly complex electronic trading services, they cannot use new technology to exploit their clients in service of their business relationships with large industry players.\u201dHe has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.The tech flyaroundHere\u2019s what its C.E.O., Mike Corbat, told Tiffany Hsu of the NYT:\u201cBanks serve a societal purpose \u2014 we believe our investors want us to do this and be responsible corporate citizens.\u201dAn internal series of interview with C.E.O.s and others has become \u201cTalks at GS,\u201d featuring the likes of Bob Iger of Disney, Magic Johnson and the novelist Andr\u00e9 Aciman, who wrote \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d (Lloyd Blankfein, one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest history buffs, spent 46 minutes interviewing Ron Chernow of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame.)More from Michael:\u201cInternally, there\u2019s a real interest in giving people a real opportunity to learn from the leaders and thinkers who are shaping the public discourse,\u201d Elizabeth Bowyer, Goldman\u2019s co-head of content strategy, said in an interview.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Spielberg\u2019s \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 Plays the Nostalgia Game", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd not only video games. \u201cReady Player One,\u201d written by Mr. Cline and Zak Penn, dives into the magma of fan zeal, male self-pity and techno-mythology in which those once-innocent pastimes are now embedded. Mr. Spielberg, a digital enthusiast and an old-school cineaste, goes further than most filmmakers in exploring the aesthetic possibilities of a form that is frequently dismissed and misunderstood.Aided by his usual cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, and by the production designer Adam Stockhausen, he turns a vast virtual landscape of battling avatars into a bustling pop-cultural theme park, an interactive museum of late-20th- and early-21st-century entertainment, a maze of niche tastes, cultish preoccupations and blockbuster callbacks. Mr. Spielberg navigates this warehouse with his usual dexterity, loading every frame with information without losing the clarity and momentum of the story.Nonetheless, the toy guns of social media and pop-up kulturkritik are locked and loaded. Mr. Spielberg will be accused of taking games and their players too seriously and not seriously enough, of pandering and mocking, of just not getting it and not being able to see beyond it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the voracious protoplasm that has, over the past three or four decades, swallowed up most of our cultural discourse. Whatever you call it \u2014 the revenge of the nerds, the franchising of the universe, the collapse of civilization \u2014 it\u2019s a force that is at once emancipatory and authoritarian, innocent and pathological, delightful and corrosive.Mr. Spielberg and some of his friends helped to create this monster, which grants him a measure of credibility and also opens him up to a degree of suspicion. He is the only person who could have made this movie and the last person who should have been allowed near the material.That material has issues of its own. Mr. Cline\u2019s book \u2014 readable and amusing without being exactly good \u2014 is a hodgepodge of cleverness and clich\u00e9. Less than a decade after publication, it already feels a bit dated, partly because its dystopian vision seems unduly optimistic and partly because its vision of male geek rebellion has turned stale and sour.In the film, set in 2045, Wade Watts (a young man played by the agreeably bland, blandly agreeable Tye Sheridan) lives in \u201cthe stacks,\u201d a vertical pile of trailers where the poorer residents of Columbus, Ohio (Oklahoma City in the book), cling to hope, dignity and their VR gloves. Humanity has been ravaged by the usual political and ecological disasters (among them \u201cbandwidth riots\u201d referred to in Wade\u2019s introductory voice-over), and most people seek refuge in a digital paradise called the Oasis.In the real world, IOI encourages Oasis fans to run up debts that it collects by forcing them into indentured servitude. Sorrento\u2019s villainy sets up a battle on two fronts \u2014 clashes in the Oasis mirroring chases through the streets of Columbus \u2014 that inspires Mr. Spielberg to feats of crosscutting virtuosity. The action is so swift and engaging that some possibly literal-minded questions may be brushed aside. I, for one, didn\u2019t quite understand why, given the global reach of the Oasis, all the relevant players were so conveniently clustered in Ohio. (If anyone wants to explain, please find me on Twitter so I can mute you.)Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the bigger references you need to know before watching Steven Spielberg\u2019s film.The most fun part of \u201cReady Player One\u201d is its exuberant and generous handing out of pop-cultural goodies. Tribute is paid to Mr. Spielberg\u2019s departed colleagues John Hughes and Stanley Kubrick. The visual and musical allusions are eclectic enough that nobody is likely to feel left out, and everybody is likely to feel a little lost from time to time.Nostalgia? Sure, but what really animates the movie is a sense of history. The Easter egg hunt takes Parzival and his crew back into Halliday\u2019s biography \u2014 his ill-starred partnership with Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), his thwarted attempts at romance \u2014 and also through the evolution of video games and related pursuits. The history is instructive and also sentimental in familiar ways, positing a struggle for control between idealistic, artistic entrepreneurs (and their legions of fans) and soulless corporate greedheads.Halliday is a sweet, shaggy nerd with a guileless Northern California drawl and a deeply awkward manner, especially around women. Sorrento is an autocratic bean counter, a would-be master of the universe who doesn\u2019t even like video games. These characters are clich\u00e9s, but they are also allegorical figures.In the movie, they represent opposing principles, but in our world, they are pretty much the same guy. A lot of the starry-eyed do-it-yourselfers tinkering in their garages and giving life to their boyish dreams back in the \u201970s and \u201980s turned out to be harboring superman fantasies of global domination all along. They shared their wondrous creations and played the rest of us for suckers, collecting our admiration, our attention and our data as profit and feudal tribute.Mr. Spielberg incarnates this duality as perfectly as any man alive. He is the peer of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and a Gandalf for the elves and hobbits who made Google, Facebook and the other components of our present-day Oasis. He has been man-child and mogul, wide-eyed artist and cold-eyed businessman, praised for making so many wonderful things and blamed for ruining everything. His career has been a splendid enactment of the cultural contradictions of capitalism, and at the same time a series of deeply personal meditations on love, loss and imagination. All of that is also true of Halliday\u2019s Oasis. \u201cReady Player One\u201d is far from a masterpiece, but as the fanboys say, it\u2019s canon.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Casual Indian Restaurants, It\u2019s Party Time", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookIn retrospect, it should have been obvious that the source of Babu Ji\u2019s popularity is the way it mimics a big, informal dinner at a friend\u2019s house. Its owners, Jessi Singh and his wife, Jennifer, project gloriously hallucinatory Bollywood numbers on the wall. You\u2019re encouraged to \u201chelp yourself\u201d to beer from a refrigerator case in the dining room. (Fear not, this will be recorded on your check.) On top of the refrigerator is a stuffed peacock. Gallery-quality framed photographic portraits of Indian men set the geographic theme without falling into clich\u00e9. The food, overseen by Mr. Singh, is dressed for a party: The kitchen is fond of tossing flowers, sprouts and other garnishes on dishes that would otherwise be a study in browns.Old Monk, which took over Babu Ji\u2019s original space in the East Village, is decorated with a different set of photographic portraits of men. This time they are monks from around Asia; one is taking a picture and another is holding a smartphone to his ear. The beer fridge is gone, but there is a long beer list, drawn from the more mainstream wing of the craft-brewing movement, like Fat Tire, Flying Dog, etc. (The wine list takes more chances.)Old Monk has kept this idea, in a $55, four-course dinner called You\u2019re in Good Hands. I didn\u2019t try it, because my head was turned by the rest of Navjot Arora\u2019s menu: fine pork-stuffed Tibetan momos with a ferocious garlic-chile sambal; tandoori lamb chops marinated in rum and ginger; a slow-cooked dal of mixed lentils that is inspired by Sikh temple cooking and is very delicious.Badshah\u2019s chef, Charles Mani, used to cook at Babu Ji, and even claims to have come up with its General Tso\u2019s Cauliflower, a spin on the classic Chinese-Indian fried cauliflower in chile sauce. In his new job, he calls it Badshah Cauliflower. I\u2019ve eaten just one quick dinner at Badshah so far, and while I was content with the Kashmiri-style goat curry, I was less thrilled by the refrigerator-cold sauces spooned over hot potato croquettes.More often, the flavors are vivid and unexpected. With a chaat of fried artichoke hearts and edamame in a fruity and sour sauce of tamarind and pomegranate molasses, Mr. Pandya showed that he could infuse non-Indian ingredients with flavors that are very true to Indian cooking. There is a captivating appetizer of dark-meat chicken in a basil-chile sauce called Tulsi Chicken, and an inexplicably good snack of Melba toasts under chopped shishito peppers mixed with melted Amul cheese, a processed and highly shelf-stable product that\u2019s everywhere in India. And I\u2019m slightly in awe of his tandoori skate, a pristine hunk of fish cooked so it just slides off its cartilage and coated with a yogurt sauce so rife with cinnamon and cloves that it tastes like A.1. Sauce that some gifted cook had improved almost beyond recognition.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the chef at Old Monk. He is Navjot Arora, not Navjut.Advertisement"}

ACT UP was starting out, and she embraced its mission, which used direct action and outrage to keep the issue front and center. \u201cI had wanted to be in the civil rights movement, but I was a bit too young,\u201d she said. \u201cI was too young for the demos about the Vietnam War. I wasn\u2019t happy there was an AIDS crisis, but I was happy to be part of a movement and see how we as a people can get things done.\u201dSome of her strongest images from those early days of the crisis were deeply political, given the prejudice and lack of official urgency at a time when the disease was essentially a death sentence. Her images were surreal, with saturated and inverted tones. She called the process \u201ccross-color,\u201d in which landscapes seemed ablaze and figures like pale phantoms. They could appear menacing, even. She stumbled on the process after deciding she had wasted enough paper \u2014 and money \u2014 on Cibachrome prints. At school, she found a stock of negative paper that allowed her to print her slides in a different way.The emotional toll of those years \u2014 during which funerals for young lives cut short by AIDS became a painful routine \u2014 led her to move to London in the 1990s, where she went to graduate school. She started covering events for a gay publication, as well as falling in with \u201ca bunch of leather girls\u201d she began to photograph. She also turned to more traditional portraiture as she began exploring various themes that she turned into projects. Her portrait series since then have included explorations of skin tone among black people, accomplished women over 70 years of age, people who challenged traditional concepts of gender, and trendsetters in the urban underground cultural scene. She had a drive to present her point of view \u2014 that of a queer black woman \u2014 in a way that defied expectations. \u201cThe queer black voice had a very separate experience than white queers,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the time white photographers would sprinkle in people to say they are being inclusive. I do that purposefully in all my projects because I wanted to level the playing field. It\u2019s like tit for tat. It\u2019s my way of showing more people of color in a more beautiful way and showing white people how it feels to be tokenized.\u201dYet the older she gets, the more Flash, 59, wants to produce work for her own community, giving its members portrayals in which they see themselves at their strongest. She is also determined to show them naturally, without lighting or processing tricks. \u201cI wanted to show the beauty in my community to my community,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to preach to the converted, since for so many years that was not part of my existence. I hate the idea of being tolerated. I like being accepted. Now there is a climate to look and accept, or at least wrestle with it.\u201dWhile her show is billed as a retrospective, Flash has no intention of slowing down her production of deeply felt images that delve into questions of identity, race and gender. And she will continue to ask her subjects to reflect on a question she asks right before each sitting \u2014 think about power and pride \u2014 where sometimes the answer can be startling, as when she did a portrait of the photographer Carrie Mae Weems.\u201cI asked her to think about someone she really admired,\u201d Flash said. \u201cCarrie was like, \u2018O.K., I\u2019ll think about you.\u2019 With that, I went under my dark cloth and told myself to keep it together. I was shaking and blushing. Come on girl, you got this.\u201dShe does.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadians Share Quebec Tips, Infused With a Love of La Belle Province", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuebec Road TripI recently moved back to Montreal after living abroad for nearly three decades and will be setting off next week on a 10-day, five city journey to rediscover Quebec. In the meantime, I have asked Canadian readers to advise me on who I should meet, and what I should do if I want to get a sense of Quebec\u2019s identity and aspirations.This being Canada, a country with a vast tapestry of people and geography, the outpouring of ideas for my trip has been both varied and enthusiastic. And in addition to Canadians, more than a few American readers and Quebec-philes have also chimed in.The advice, infused with a love of \u201cla belle province,\u201d has been as eclectic as it\u2019s been personal. Some readers recalled honeymoons in the Gasp\u00e9sie, hikes in the Eastern Townships, their own road trips across Quebec or memorable sunsets on the Port of Montreal during long summer nights.Among the hundreds of suggestions so far, there were appeals to visit historic convents near Quebec City, to go on a sugaring off expedition and to visit the Royal Montreal Curling Club in Montreal, which was founded in 1807 and is the oldest curling club in North America. I am hoping to add all of that to my itinerary.Ms. Lambert, who is known as Montreal\u2019s \u201cJoan of Architecture,\u201d founded the pioneering Canadian Center for Architecture and played a leading role in commissioning Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to build the towering Seagram headquarters in New York in the 1950s. The building became a memorable emblem of modernism. She also has shaped the architecture of contemporary Montreal like few others.Many readers suggested that any road trip through Quebec would be incomplete without examining the state of the contemporary Catholic church. During the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, Quebecers revolted against the domination of the church, and this secular streak has formed an important part of Quebec identity. With that in mind, I plan to visit a slew of cathedrals across the province, including a church in Montreal that has been converted into a sports club (I work out there!).I will also keep you posted as things take shape. I finish packing this weekend and kick off the road trip on Monday. It\u2019s time to start this adventure!A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Lean In\u2019: Five Years Later", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor some, Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book has been a powerful manifesto. Others have dismissed it as na\u00efve and irrelevant. What is its actual legacy?For its legions of readers and circle attendees, \u201cLean In\u201d has been a powerful mentor, one that has helped shape the arc of their careers. Senior executives, both male and female, say they have noticed a shift in attitude in recent years, particularly among their younger employees.\u201cFive or six years ago, younger job candidates would accept the first offer given to them,\u201d said Eliot Kaplan, a former vice president of talent acquisition at Hearst Publishing and now a career coach. \u201cSince then, 90 percent want to negotiate \u2014 usually money, but also vacation time, responsibilities and so forth. Some would actually say, \u2018Sheryl Sandberg says I have to.\u2019\u201dHow to measure, five years later, the impact of \u201cLean In\u201d on the millions of women who read it (and one who wrote it), and the workplace culture they tried to navigate? We recently talked to a range of women \u2014 from a Navy commander to Senator Amy Klobuchar to a recent college graduate working for an NGO \u2014 about the book\u2019s legacy.Chief operating officer of Facebook, author (with Nell Scovell) of \u201cLean In\u201d and founder of LeanIn.orgCelebrate the five-year anniversary? [Laughs.] No, that never even occurred to me. What I\u2019ve always wanted is equality \u2014 equal pay, equal responsibility at home. Five years is not very much time for that to happen. Sometimes these things take a long time, but I remain hopeful and optimistic. And there are lots of reasons. There are more women running for public office in 2018 than ever before. And #MeToo has helped take steps toward true and real equality.Nuclear engineer and commanding officer of the Manchester, a Navy shipWhen I look back on the past five years, I realize the \u201cLean In\u201d movement defined my professional life. I attribute much of my confidence to what I learned there. Five years ago, I was a student coming off shore duty. I had a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old. I was then made the second in command to the commanding officer on a different warship, in charge of 440 sailors. My husband and I were juggling two careers with kids. I was hungry for connection and professional development, but the question was: How am I going to be a leader?I\u2019ve co-founded four \u201cLean In\u201d circles for military personnel \u2014 two of which are coed \u2014 and they\u2019re fantastic. Mine is not on the ship, because I wanted the freedom to go beyond the chain of command. People come and go, but the beauty of these circles is that you have something to anchor you. It\u2019s not a cookie-decorating contest. It\u2019s not group therapy. It\u2019s professional development.Senior program associate for Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization in WashingtonWhat I walked away with was a strategy for living your life, including your personal life. For example \u2014 and I was just arguing about this with my grandmother, who says, \u201cA real man always pays\u201d \u2014 I feel more comfortable splitting the tab when I\u2019m on a date. I always feel something is owed when someone pays, and I don\u2019t like that feeling. I like Sandberg\u2019s ideas about full sharing. It just jibes with the way I feel. Basically she\u2019s saying, \u201cDon\u2019t let the history of gender define what happens in the future, and don\u2019t left it define your future.\u201dAlso, she talks a lot about how being ambitious and bossy have negative connotations for women historically. Well, she makes it more than just O.K. to be ambitious. Right now I\u2019m a program associate, working really hard to get that promotion. Where I see myself in 10 years is not just being a program manager. I should be running my own NGO.Administrative director for patient access and financial clearance services at Stanford Health CareOver time, I became more comfortable, of course. I graduated, went on to get a master\u2019s degree and became one of the most decorated people in my field. About two and a half years ago, I read \u201cLean In\u201d when a friend recommended it. It was very exciting to me, its ideas about leadership, and when I went to the website, I saw the possibility of starting a circle. And when I turned 50, I did a self-assessment. I had checked a bunch of \u201csuccess\u201d boxes, but I hadn\u2019t checked the \u201cgiving back\u201d box. I needed a sense of success in that way, too. I had the intention of helping others, but I didn\u2019t know how. \u201cLean In\u201d provided me that platform.United States senator from MinnesotaHere\u2019s some perspective. Ten years ago, there were 16 women in the Senate \u2014 and they were calling them the \u201csweet 16.\u201d Now there are 22. This doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, and it\u2019s not \u2014 but that number is almost half the number of women who\u2019ve been in the Senate in the entire history of our country. So that\u2019s a dramatic change.This is even more telling to me: The number of women in leadership positions \u2014 either chairs or ranking members \u2014 has dramatically increased. In the last five years, we\u2019ve seen them lead the Budget Committee, the Agricultural Committee, the Appropriations Committee, the Health Committee, the Environmental Committee, Appropriations and the Health Committee. (I\u2019m the ranking member on the Rules Committee.) With attrition, as men left or were defeated, that\u2019s been a major shift.Plus, we\u2019re making certain changes on Senate rules. For example, With Tammy Duckworth having her second child at 50, we\u2019re changing some rules so that in case there\u2019s a late-night vote, she can bring her baby. Children will be allowed on the Senate floor.Chief executive officer of Sunny Bates Associates, a management consulting firmWhat\u2019s powerful about Sheryl\u2019s writing is that she\u2019s honest. It\u2019s easy to dump on her because of her privilege. But she is self-effacing and self-questioning; she was always asking herself, whenever there was a problem, \u201cWhat\u2019s my role in this?\u201d And that\u2019s what she gave us, too: She put language to some workplace issues we all know exist but don\u2019t always know how to talk about. The idea of \u201cleaning in\u201d is extremely useful. For example, when we\u2019re feeling excluded at work, when someone isn\u2019t including us in a discussion or a project, we\u2019re all so uncomfortable. That\u2019s when we want to lean back and just ignore it. And that\u2019s exactly the time to lean in. Sheryl makes it very clear how we all grow through discomfort. Think about this as a parent. When I had fights with my one of my daughters when she was younger, my thoughts would drift toward sending her to boarding school. If we both went into our rooms and shut the door, nothing happened. It\u2019s when I leaned into the conflict and forced more discussion, painful as it was, that\u2019s when things got resolved.It\u2019s interesting. What satisfies me at my age \u2014 some board representation, some women in the C suite or on the management team \u2014 does not feel like enough to my millennial daughters. We were talking about this recently, and they were like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Representation should be at least 50 percent, they say. And they\u2019re not wrong.Associate creative director at Frog Design (and a daughter of Sunny Bates)But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. Over the next three years, the company continued to look at the issue, brought in an outside consultant that allowed us to address gender and diversity issues \u2014 and ultimately there was real change. Five years later, I\u2019m one of those women in middle management now, and one of the reasons is the \u201cLean In\u201d movement. Even for those who didn\u2019t read it and make it a part of their lives in a conscious way, it had an effect.One example: I just got engaged. The whole conversation Sandberg put forth about having an equal partner is more, well, sort of part of so many people\u2019s DNA now. My partner and I, one of the reasons we believe that we\u2019re so well suited for each other is that we are passionate about our own work and support each other in our interest and time and energy spent on it. It was incredibly important for me to find someone who respected the career I wanted to have. In fact, he talks about being a stay-at-home dad. On one of our first few dates, I had told him I was going to take over the world. He likes to remind me of that.Partner and founder of Sclar Law GroupFormer magazine editor (Sunset, Reader\u2019s Digest, More) and now an industry consultantI could always tell when the young editors on my staff had read the book \u2014 more than one said, \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to \u2018Lean In,\u2019 so \u2026\u201d That was the \u201ctake a deep breath\u201d phrase before opening a frank discussion. My ability to give raises was limited: Almost always I would have a pool of, say, 2.5 percent that I could divvy up until the money was gone. So giving to person Y meant going light on person X. But often the discussion, if well timed, would sway me by a percentage point if the person had reminded me what they had achieved and made it clear they were up for more challenges. I actually loved it when staffers wanted to talk about their career paths \u2014 and sometimes I would even say: \u201cGo get some experience. You will be more valuable when you come back.\u201d To me, the \u201cLean In\u201d conversation was a marker of a young woman who was taking herself and her career seriously.I always found it odd that women were so fearful about these money conversations \u2014 not that this is how raises necessarily work, but you do need to learn to ask. So on balance I think Sandberg\u2019s book made a dent in helping women see what might be in their control.These interviews have been edited for space and clarity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Friends and Family Wonder: Why Did the Austin Bomber Choose Us?", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Conditt\u2019s first victim, Anthony Stephan House, got his hair cut at Delton\u2019s, too.Yet on Saturday, questions about how the bomber had chosen his targets continued to reverberate. And the lack of answers has hurt those closest to the victims most.Elliot House, whose son Anthony was killed on March 2 when he picked up a package on his doorstep, heard about the barbershop connection in recent days , when a local news reporter contacted him. The elder Mr. House thought it might be a coincidence.\u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing, and I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Mr. House said. \u201cI need to find out, how did he pick his subject?\u201dMayor Steve Adler of Austin said that investigators were continuing to churn through evidence. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Conditt left behind evidence of potential future targets before he died, but that they appeared to have no connection to one another.Mr. House said that Mr. Conditt\u2019s death left him feeling \u201cnumb but relieved,\u201d and also wondering if there were accomplices. \u201cI just can\u2019t grasp that a 23-year-old home-schooled guy put together his devices,\u201d he said of Mr. Conditt, who was raised in an evangelical family in Austin\u2019s northern suburbs. \u201cI really, really question how did he select his subjects.\u201dAt a news conference on Saturday, Manley, the interim police chief, said investigators were leaving open the possibility of questioning Mr. Conditt\u2019s two roommates again, and added that more arrests in the case could still be made.\u201cThis investigation continues,\u201d Mr. Manley said.On Thursday, Sean Philips, a neighbor of Anthony Stephan House, posted what he called a \u201cdark and gory\u201d account of the attack on Facebook.Mr. Philips woke up his children to get them ready for school, and then heard, at 6:50 a.m., a sound like a truck slamming into a dumpster.\u201cI immediately ran outside to see what it was. I looked to the left and saw my next-door neighbor, Stephan, (who also happens to be the father of my daughter\u2019s best friend) standing, covered in blood, with shrapnel lodged all throughout his body and his hands nearly blown off,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHis face had a large gash on the lower side, it looked as if he was hit with an ax. He had a glazed over look on his face, but his eyes were open. Within five seconds, he looked at me and collapsed onto his side.\u201dMr. Philips said he had administered rescue breaths, but could not perform chest compressions because Mr. House\u2019s body was full of shrapnel.\u201cAll around me, the neighborhood was in utter chaos, but I heard not a sound other than the sound of his gurgling blood,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMeanwhile, there were screaming neighbors, and worse, the screams of \u201cMy daddy is dead! My daddy is dead!\u201d coming from his little angel who saw him like that.\u201dLater, he wrote, he was questioned by the police as if he were a potential suspect. He wrote of the mental and emotional trauma that plagued him afterward. Even though the police have not tendered a motive, Mr. Philips assumed that Mr. Conditt had been motivated by the conservative political beliefs he had espoused in a blog several years ago.\u201cHere is the headline I would like to see: 23-year-old conservative Christian turns his hatred and judgments into a murderous bombing spree,\u201d Mr. Philips wrote.Frustration, in recent days, has been more evident than clarity or consensus. The owner of the Pflugerville barber shop, Delton Southern, told the Austin American-Statesman that he thought the presence of both victim and perpetrator in his shop was a coincidence. Mr. Southern, who is black, also told the paper that Mr. Conditt\u2019s presence in his shop seemed to work against the theory that the attacks were fueled by racism.\u201cIf he was a white supremacist he wouldn\u2019t have come in here,\u201d he said.On Saturday morning, the barber shop was doing a brisk business with a largely African-American clientele, and Mr. Southern sternly gave notice that he was through conducting interviews.\u201cI have nothing left to say,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to run a business.\u201dMore than 25 miles southwest of Pflugerville, in the wealthy and predominately white neighborhood where two young men were injured by Conditt\u2019s tripwire bomb on March 18, a no-trespassing sign was posted on a tree outside the family home of one of the victims, William Grote III.\u201cDo not enter or come upon this private property,\u201d the sign declared. \u201cWe have no comment.\u201dBrad Napp, a next-door neighbor, said the family seemed grateful to be alive. \u201cWhy were they hit by the bomb?\u201dMr. Napp said there appeared to have been no ties between Mr. Conditt and the two men. And there was no indication, he said, \u201cthat they crossed paths at any time.\u201dHe thought that Mr. Conditt had chosen the neighborhood randomly. He noted that it had few security cameras and was close to two major freeways, allowing an intruder to \u201cvery quickly\u201d enter the neighborhood, commit an act of destruction and then flee, he said. \u201cThey could be up to 60 miles per hour in two minutes,\u201d Mr. Napp said.In East Austin Saturday, Jesse E. Washington warmly recalled Mr. Conditt\u2019s second victim, 17-year-old Draylen Mason, whom Mr. Washington had watched grow from boyhood. Draylen was a student of martial arts from an early age, Mr. Washington said, which had instilled in him \u201cself-control and respect.\u201dDraylen\u2019s other passion was music. He played the piano and the bass, and had just been accepted to the prestigious Oberlin Conservatory of Music. He was killed by one of Mr. Conditt\u2019s package bombs on March 12, when his mother brought it from the front porch to the kitchen. His mother was also injured in the blast.Mr. Washington said he knew the family was struggling.\u201cThey\u2019re just so torn up about it they don\u2019t know which way to go or what to think,\u201d he said.Dave Montgomery reported from Pflugerville, Tex.; Richard Fausset from Austin, Tex.; and Jess Bidgood from Boston.

I recently discovered that my millennial colleagues know little about the history of feminism. When I told them how much I was looking forward to the TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d their eyes went blank. I\u2019ve been greeted with the same expression at any mention of Gloria Steinem, Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan\u2019s \u201cThe Feminine Mystique.\u201dTo fix this, I\u2019m starting a book club that will focus on feminist texts, beginning with something light and easy and not overly academic.Too much of the literature I studied in college comes from a white middle-class American perspective. The women in this group are mostly Asian (Singaporean, Chinese, Filipino, Indonesian, Malaysian), and don\u2019t really read nonfiction.Do you have any ideas for our first steps?Dear Judy,Your zeal is contagious and your wisdom speaks volumes: Since you\u2019re determined to engage the members of your nascent book club, you\u2019re smart not to turn your reading list into a syllabus. No matter how lofty your aims, the impulse to press foundational books into the hands of the uninitiated can backfire. Required reading inspires few people once school\u2019s out.Drawing FireEven the most contemplative graphic novels offer a kinetic sense of play guaranteed to hook your colleagues\u2019 interest. Why not launch your feminist exploration with an illustrated book set in a place that may be unfamiliar to all of you? Marguerite Abouet\u2019s six-volume \u201cAya\u201d comics series, set in Ivory Coast in the 1970s (illustrated by Abouet\u2019s husband, Cl\u00e9ment Oubrerie, and translated by Helge Dascher), follows the lives of its ambitious but dutiful namesake protagonist and her more freewheeling friends, Bintou and Adjoua. In \u201cAya: Love in Yop City\u201d \u2014 which encompasses the last three chapters in the series \u2014 Aya, now a medical student, is sexually assaulted by her biology professor. The shame she feels in the wake of her attack shifts over the course of the book as she plans a fiery revenge.In her illustrated story collection \u201cBoundless,\u201d Jillian Tamaki flips the script: To read the first and last of her kooky and elegant tales, you often must rotate the book 90 degrees.

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica Had a Role in Kenya Election, Too", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe revelations come only weeks after Mr. Kenyatta and his chief rival, Raila Odinga, reconciled after months of contention.In the video, Mark Turnbull, a Cambridge Analytica executive, said the company twice rebranded Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s political party, wrote his campaign speeches and his political platform, and twice conducted surveys of 50,000 people to ascertain Kenyan voters\u2019 hope and fears.A spokesman for Mr. Kenyatta referred inquiries to his party, the Jubilee Party, whose top official did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday night.Mr. Kenyatta won re-election last October after two presidential votes. The first, in August, was nullified by the Supreme Court, which cited widespread irregularities and ordered a second election. Mr. Odinga pulled out of the second vote, which was held in October, saying the process was unfair.Moses Karanja, a researcher on a project at Strathmore Law School in Nairobi about social media and misinformation during the presidential election, said the recent reports about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in Kenya, and its abuse of Facebook data globally, reinforced concerns raised in his own work about how Kenyans\u2019 personal data was accessed by political parties and even by government institutions, like the elections commission.He said targeted text messages that he and others received during the campaign season suggested that individuals\u2019 voter registration information, social media data and telephone numbers were being independently linked \u2014 although it\u2019s still unclear how.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how they accessed this data, or how it all ended up being linked to phone numbers and such,\u201d Mr. Karanja said. \u201cFor me that\u2019s scary. Those are questions those platforms should answer.\u201dGacheke Gachihi, who leads the Mathare Social Justice Center in Nairobi, said Cambridge Analytica\u2019s branding for Mr. Kenyatta was \u201cdivisive propaganda,\u201d raising ethnic enmity.\u201cThe way you paint your opponent, you paint also his supporters,\u201d he said, \u201cand you and your ethnic base will feel like, \u2018This man is a devil.\u2019 That undermines the work we are trying to do for social justice.\u201dLocal news media had reported last spring that Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s party had retained Cambridge Analytica for his re-election campaign. And David Murathe, the vice chairman of the Jubilee Party, told Reuters on Tuesday that SCL helped the campaign with branding last year.The company also said it targeted youth voters with a social media campaign.Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent group, SCL, described similar activities on an archived page of its website, and said it also advised on communications, branding and strategy during the electoral period.Cambridge said its survey was \u201cthe largest political research project ever conducted in East Africa.\u201d Mr. Turnbull told Channel 4\u2019s undercover reporter that it repeated the survey in 2017.Those survey results, Mr. Karanja said, could reverberate beyond social media campaigns and \u201cbe translated into non-Internet platforms like radio, television advertisements and billboards.\u201dHe said his research team documented several examples of misinformation spreading on WhatsApp and other social media and filtering down to local talk radio shows or newspaper articles.Advertisement"}

But officials said there would not be new elections and the ruling party would remain in power.Leaders of the protests released a statement saying that leaders of the parties in the governing coalition had \u201chumiliated and misled the whole public with their decision.\u201d They plan to hold protests in more than 30 cities on Friday.Prime Minister Robert Fico, of the Smer-S.D. party, had faced three weeks of unrest and demands that he step down, and his governing coalition threatened to collapse if he remained at the helm. President Andrej Kiska had said that Slovakia needed either a deep restructuring of the government or new elections, and for several days it seemed that elections would result.But on Wednesday, Mr. Fico said at a news conference that he had gone to Mr. Kiska, along with the leaders of the smaller parties in his coalition, \u201cand offered to solve the political crisis by resigning my post as prime minister.\u201d He delivered the resignation on Thursday.Earlier this week, the interior minister, Robert Kalinak, stepped down, and the justice minister and culture minister, among other officials, will also be replaced. Mr. Kalinak oversaw the police, and was a primary target of protesters, who insisted that a credible investigation could not be conducted under him.Peter Pellegrini, a former speaker of the Parliament who has also served as deputy prime minister, will succeed Mr. Fico.On Thursday, another journalist, Lukas Milan, was sentenced in a defamation case to either 18 months in prison or a three-year probation during which he would be banned from journalism. The case stemmed from a magazine article he wrote linking high-ranking government officials to corruption. Mr. Milan is appealing.The new ministers in Slovakia\u2019s government will be from the same coalition parties as those resigning, and in some cases, are close to their predecessors.Mr. Kuciak\u2019s and Ms. Kusnirova\u2019s families are among those calling for deeper change.\u201cJan and Martina have given us a chance to change this country so I ask you, use it,\u201d Maria Kuciakova, Mr. Kuciak\u2019s sister, wrote on Facebook. \u201cIndifference won\u2019t change anything, the current government might make a change, but not a good one.

{"Headline": "Facebook Vowed to End Discriminatory Housing Ads. Suit Says It Didn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook, an advertising behemoth with more than two billion users a month, provides advertisers with the ability to customize their messages and target who sees them by selecting from preset lists of demographics, likes, behaviors and interests, while excluding others.Pet food companies, for example, could send their ads specifically to people who had indicated an interest in dogs, while excluding cat and bird fanciers.When it comes to housing and employment ads, Facebook, in response to criticism over the last 17 months, has repeatedly promised that it would crack down on advertisers who use those same tools to show housing or employment ads to whites only.Diane L. Houk of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, a lawyer who worked on the lawsuit, said the groups want the court to require Facebook to take action.\u201cWe want the court to order Facebook to develop a plan to remove any ability for advertisers to access Facebook\u2019s checklists for excluding groups of people in the posting of housing-related ads,\u201d Ms. Houk said. \u201cBecause of Facebook\u2019s impact on the housing market, we\u2019ll ask the court to implement a plan of community education and outreach to housing providers to inform them of their obligation not to discriminate.\u201dThe suit says Facebook\u2019s actions are a violation of the Fair Housing Act, which makes it illegal to publish housing ads that indicate preferences or limitations based on race color, religion, handicaps, familial status or national origin.\u201cFacebook\u2019s ability to customize an online audience for advertisements based on its vast trove of user data has made it the biggest advertising agency in the world \u2014 the advertising platform of choice for millions of businesses,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cBut Facebook has abused its enormous power.\u201dThe criticisms go directly to the heart of Facebook\u2019s business. The social network earned nearly all of its more than $40 billion in revenue in 2017 by selling ads on its network.\u201cThere is absolutely no place for discrimination on Facebook. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.State and federal regulators are now assessing whether the transfer of data violated privacy agreements struck under prior consent decrees. Facebook is the subject of privacy investigations in Europe as well. As a result, the company\u2019s stock price has swooned with investors fearing the prospect of new regulations.\u201cFacebook is essential to the information flow that comprises our public discourse,\u201d said Olivier Sylvain, a law professor at Fordham Law School, who is not involved in the suit. \u201cBut in that role, they should take on the responsibility of minding the flow of information, including the algorithms that produce the results.\u201dTo test its case, the National Fair Housing Alliance created an ad for a fictitious apartment rental in Washington, D.C., using Facebook\u2019s features to exclude \u201ccorporate moms,\u201d \u201cstay-at-home moms\u201d and other categories that would eliminate women from the ad\u2019s potential audience. Facebook estimated that the ads would reach 48,000 to 820,000 people, the lawsuit said.In New York, the Fair Housing Justice Center created an ad for a rental apartment by selecting \u201cno kids\u201d and \u201cmen\u201d from the inclusion list and \u201cmoms of grade school kids\u201d and other groups from the exclusion list. Facebook estimated that the ad would reach 280,000 people.The lawsuit says that Facebook also provides \u201cinterests\u201d categories for housing ads that permit a landlord or real estate agent to exclude users based on disability-related factors, like \u201cInterest in Disabled Parking Permit,\u201d or \u201cdisabled veteran,\u201d and on the basis of national origin, by eliminating those with, say, an \u201cInterest in Telemundo,\u201d the Spanish language television network, or English as a second language.\u201cThe way people find housing in 2018 is radically different than when the Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968,\u201d said Robert Schwemm, a law professor at the University of Kentucky and author of \u201cHousing Discrimination: Law and Litigation.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthe Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to target certain groups while excluding others.\u201d\u201cThe courts have taken discriminatory housing ads very seriously,\u201d he said.Some online companies accused of discrimination have cited the 1996 Communications Decency Act as a defense. That law essentially says that platforms that merely allow third parties to post material cannot be held liable for something that is discriminatory.But, Mr. Schwemm said, Facebook is another matter.\u201cBy allowing housing advertisers to click certain boxes in order to refine their ads and exclude certain protected groups, Facebook is more than just a neutral conveyor of information, like, say, a phone company, which is not liable for its customers\u2019 discriminatory ads or statements.\u201dThat got the attention of the National Fair Housing Alliance, which sent a letter to Facebook saying that its ad practices appeared to violate fair-housing laws and asked for a meeting. In November 2016, Facebook said it would disable the use of \u201cethnic affinity marketing for ads that we identify as offering housing employment or credit.\u201dA year ago, Facebook said its policy expressly forbid ads that have discriminatory content.\u201cWe thought they were sincere,\u201d said Lisa Rice, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. \u201cBut they have not changed their content, their platform and their systems to preclude advertisers from discriminating. When you think that Facebook has over two billion active users, that\u2019s pretty significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bouncy Noodles, Bright Greens, Quick Broth: A Perfect Bowl", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenAt the top of my list of satisfying meals that nurture body and soul is a big, steaming bowl of noodles in broth.My introduction to the Japanese version came on my first trip to Japan, 30 years ago, to visit American friends living in the town of Matsuyama in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Matsuyama (which means Pine Mountain) is known for its historic traditional bathhouse, Dogo Onsen. On a cold, drizzly day, I gladly bathed in its steaming hot waters.Afterward, we lunched at an ancient noodle house, with great blackened ceiling beams, heavy wooden tables and impressive pottery. All the noodles were served in beautiful large, heavy handmade bowls, which to my untrained eye seemed like priceless museum pieces. The whole place (and its menu) appeared unchanged for centuries, despite the fact that the hip young waiters used what was then a high-tech electric notebook to take our order.There were over two dozen choices of noodle soup, some with slender buckwheat soba noodles, others with fat white chewy udon noodles. I hadn\u2019t encountered udon before, so I ordered a bowl of them with shiitake mushrooms. The broth was sensational. The noodles were delightfully chewy. My one mistake as a novice eater of Japanese noodles was continuously sprinkling my bowl with shichimi togarashi, a red chile spice mixture that was new to me. By the time I reached the bottom, the last few spoonfuls of broth were incendiary.The mushroom soup was fitting, since we had just visited a mushroom farm and observed shiitakes growing. Rather than cultivate them in a cave, the locals drill holes in logs and inoculate them with spores. Then the logs are placed in the woods so the mushrooms grow in a natural setting.Last week, to satisfy my sudden craving for a bowl of udon, I set to the task of making broth. Cooking from memory, with no ingredients on hand to make a proper Japanese dashi broth from kombu (dried kelp) and shaved bonito tuna, I improvised a vegetarian version using dried shiitakes and miso. I did have dried seaweed and udon noodles in the cupboard, bought at my favorite Japanese grocery. I started off with a not-very-Japanese saut\u00e9 of leeks in butter, a favorite base for vegetarian soups. Fresh shiitake mushrooms, greens and tofu filled out the dish.As we devoured our noodles and broth, I remembered how my American friend\u2019s Japanese pals teased her mercilessly, because she couldn\u2019t master the polite art of slurping noisily, the preferred way to eat noodles at their best.As with other acquired skills, the way to become proficient is to practice daily. That\u2019s an assignment I don\u2019t mind at all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian Stocks Tumble as Sell-Off Over Trade Fears Continues", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A brewing trade war between China and the United States sent markets reeling across Asia on Friday, following a sell-off on Wall Street overnight.By the close of trading on Friday, shares had fallen 3.4 percent in Shanghai and 4 percent in Shenzhen. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the market. South Korean stocks fell 3.1 percent.\u201cThis can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly,\u201d Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.Europe looked poised for a similar sell-off, with futures flashing red for major markets.After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year.The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were expected to take effect.The potential ripples of the trade actions have unsettled investors.Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201d The Ministry of Commerce announced plans to slap tariffs on 128 products that would collectively be worth $3 billion in imports from the United States, including a 15 percent tariff on steel pipes, wine and fresh fruit, and a 25 percent tariff on pork.Some American businesses in China also voiced concern. \u201cOur members do not want to see a trade war,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. \u201cThe stakes are too high and there would be no winner,\u201d Mr. Jarrett said.But he added that American businesses in China wanted \u201cfairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation.\u201dIn the United States, shares of large exporters, whose fortunes could be harmed by a trade war, were hit especially hard on Thursday and looked ready to bear the brunt of more selling on Friday. Shares of Boeing, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, and Caterpillar, which counts China as an important market, both fell by more than 5 percent.Amid the dip in stocks, money flowed to government bonds as investors sought safety, briefly driving yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 2.8 percent. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Commodities heavily geared toward global growth also fell. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, slipped 1.2 percent. Copper, an important industrial metal, dropped 0.9 percent.Thursday\u2019s decline is the latest in a series of jolts to stock markets in the past two months.More recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.A growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.Now, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy. On Thursday, for example, the Bank of England warned that the erection of international trade barriers could have a \u201csignificant negative impact\u201d on global growth.Stock markets around the world have reflected the worries. A leading European index, the Stoxx 600, fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday. In Germany, whose economy is dependent on exporting products all over the world, the DAX index dropped 1.7 percent.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Matt Phillips from New York.

But scale is just part of the equation,\u201d Dr. Agus said in a statement. \u201cTo properly nourish the world, we need to consider how nutritious that food is. This is where Sensei is focused.\u201dIts first customer is Hawaii, which imports the majority of its food. Sensei said that it can provide the state fresh food within 24 hours of harvesting, compared with over a week for imported vegetables.But the company is also eager to tout its tech bona fides. Its farm runs off solar power provided by Tesla panels. And it claims to use just 10 percent of the water used in traditional farming methods.\u201cFor so long, agriculture has been one of the least digitized industries,\u201d Daniel Gruneberg, Sensei\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cNow, we can combine software, sensors and robotics to make giant leaps in sustainable farming and perhaps, more importantly, the quality of our food.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFacebook\u2019s stock had its worst day in about four years.Shares of the social media giant finished down about 7 percent after the NYT reported that a political data firm with ties to 2016 Trump campaign harvested private information from over 50 million user profiles.The news reports raised the specter of greater government scrutiny and potential regulatory action toward the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry\u2019s profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.Facebook\u2019s stock is now down more than 12 percent from its all-time high hit at the start of February.Facebook\u2019s woes showed signs of spreading, too.The S.&P. 500 tech sector is the worst performing of the index\u2019s 11 sectors.Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed down about 3.2 percent. Amazon fell around 1.7 percent and Apple finished off 1.5 percent.In all, Monday\u2019s slide wiped more than $80 billion off the market value of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Facebook accounted for more than $35 billion of that total. In fact, the company is no longer among the five biggest companies in the S.&P. 500 by market capitalization.Given the outsized role the tech sector has played in the aging bull market, its declines Monday dragged down the broader stock indexes.Is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s unusually powerful position at Facebook in part to blame for the latest backlash against the company?These look like the reactions of a leader who thinks he is not going anywhere. Indeed, through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Facebook, of course, has taken steps to address the abuse of its network. It has added hundreds of new employees to help police posts, and it has implemented artificial intelligence technology to spot material that falls afoul of the company\u2019s guidelines. Such initiatives cost money. Mr. Zuckerberg earlier this year said that such initiatives would have a significant impact on Facebook\u2019s profitability. Indeed, there\u2019s a strong argument to make that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s protected position will allow the company to press ahead with expensive investments in the face of any shareholder grumbling that may arise.In the near term, though, it\u2019s hard to envision shareholders applying significant pressure on Facebook to be more responsive to the political and legal risks. They may believe Facebook\u2019s extraordinary profitability \u2013 its operating profits are roughly equivalent to 40 percent of its revenue \u2013 will help the stock ride what they see as a passing storm.\u2014 Peter EavisCritic\u2019s cornerJeffrey Goldfarb of Breakingviews writes:\u201cFacebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across his website didn\u2019t influence the U.S. election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his startup into a serious corporation.

We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\u201d an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement.The fatal crash will most likely raise questions about regulations for self-driving cars. Testing of self-driving cars is already underway for vehicles that have a human driver ready to take over if something goes wrong, but states are starting to allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver\u2019s seat.

That means these companies can get the liquidity they need along with the corporate governance structure that they want, according to the LTSE\u2019s founder, Eric Ries.What the principles include\u2022 Letting so-called \u201ccitizens,\u201d or investors who plan on sticking with companies for the long term, eventually accumulate more voting power over the years than \u201ctourists\u201d who plan on sticking around for a shorter time.\u2022 Blocking the use of certain kinds of compensation, including short-term bonuses paid to executives based on metrics like reaching a certain milestone for quarterly earnings.\u2022 Banning short-term guidance.\u2022 Having long-term investors register their holdings with the company. \u201cThe company will know effectively in real time who their long-term investors are,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2022 Reporting requirements that include disclosing earnings per share net of buybacks, to provide a more accurate way of measuring how a company is doing without factoring in financial engineering.The context\u2022 Mr. Ries has spoken of the need to reward long-term investors. \u201cMost of the listing standards are designed to align managers and long-term shareholders,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat frees up management to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\u2022 It comes as companies continue to bemoan short-term thinking in the stock markets that has C.E.O.s focused more on meeting a quarter\u2019s targets than longer-term goals.\u2022 LTSE\u2019s goal is to eventually become a stock exchange on which companies list their shares. But for now, it wants to be allowed to create a special kind of listing for IEX that lets companies go public under its principles.\u2022 LTSE also plans to promote itself as serving companies first and foremost and to make money more from listing fees and tools and services for its companies, rather than from trading offerings and data aimed at investors.The caveatIt\u2019s a long road ahead. Not just for the rule-change process, but also in convincing start-ups to adopt these rules when they go public.\u201cWhat we have promised our venture investors is not that this is going to instantly transform the market overnight,\u201d Mr. Ries said.\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u201cThe livelihood of America\u2019s consumers, businesses, farmers, and ranchers are at risk if the administration proceeds with this plan.\u201dCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with the Trump administration and tour several cities this week.

Fewer devote themselves to the plight of Kurds in Syria\u2019s brutal civil war. Fewer still travel there to join the fighting, and those who do are usually men.But Anna Campbell, a young woman from southern England, did all of that. Last week, as the Turkish military and its Syrian rebel allies hammered their way into Afrin, in northwestern Syria, Ms. Campbell died for her commitment \u2014 the eighth Briton and the first British woman to be killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces.\u201cShe was somebody who saw the injustices of the world and the plight of the weak and vulnerable and disempowered, and she also saw the idealism, the amazing utopian vision of Rojava, and she found those two elements irresistible,\u201d her father, Dirk Campbell, said in an interview. \u201cShe wanted to prevent that from being stamped out, which Turkey and Syria are trying to do.\u201dMs. Campbell, whose mother died several years ago, grew up in East Sussex, in southeastern England. She studied at Sheffield University, but academics did not suit her, her father said, and she dropped out, worked as a blacksmith and trained as a plumber.\u201cShe knew the risk she was facing,\u201d said Ahed Elhendi, an adviser in Washington to the Syrian Democratic Council, the political group that controls northeast Syria and is allied with the Y.P.G. \u201cWhen Afrin was being shelled by the Turkish Army, she asked to join the fight there many times until she finally made it there.\u201dMr. Elhendi, who said he met Ms. Campbell last October in Syria, added, \u201cWe thought she could be a great asset to voice our dilemma, but her answer was always, she came for resistance, to fight.\u201dThe Syrian war, now seven years old, features a complex array of forces. Kurdish-led militias, backed by the United States, are fighting another American ally, Turkey, which claims that the Y.P.G. is an extension of a Kurdish insurgent group, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, also known as the P.K.K., that has been labeled a terrorist organization.The Kurds are also fighting the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, which is backed by Russia, Iran and Iranian-sponsored Shiite militias, and has increasingly reasserted control over the country.Each of those factions has, to varying degrees, also fought the Islamic State group, now all but eliminated as a military force in Syria. And other rebel groups round out the picture, including Sunni Islamists who oppose all the major parties.\u201cI knew she was tough, but I never saw her as pointing a gun,\u201d said Mr. Campbell, who learned of his daughter\u2019s death on Sunday. \u201cNow the bottom has dropped out of my world.\u201dKaram Shoumali contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Several minutes later, he told the group a separate story about the deathlike \u201cstatic peace\u201d he felt while tripping on the drug DMT.(My contribution to the discussion: sharing how self-conscious I feel about what to say or do at funerals.)\u201cAs frightening as it may seem,\u201d Ms. Cunningham said that night, \u201cthere are many amazing things that can occur and ways to grow and carry grief through the next chapters of your life, and this is the way we evolve \u2014 through moments that seem so painful but then have hidden miracles of ecstasy.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:The rest of the week is looking warmer but wetter.It\u2019s Holy Week.To honor several holidays this spring, the New York Public Library, the Morgan Library & Museum and the CUNY Graduate Center have created an exhibition exploring the religious spaces shared by Jews, Christians and Muslims \u2014 a set of displays that tell tales of interfaith tolerance and coexistence.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Japan, Voters Are Wary of Mothers in Public Office", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Takako Suzuki is the youngest of the 707 lawmakers in Japan\u2019s Parliament and the latest of a handful of members to give birth while in office.When Ms. Suzuki, a 32-year-old member of the House of Representatives from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, announced last summer that she and her husband were expecting their first child, not everyone was supportive.Critical comments were posted on various online platforms. \u201cAre you abandoning your job?\u201d or \u201cYou lack awareness as a person holding a public office,\u201d some of them said, according to Ms. Suzuki.Her father, Muneo Suzuki, a former longtime member of Parliament, rushed to her defense: \u201cI understand that people have different ways of understanding things. But I cannot agree with the view that [she is] abandoning her duties,\u201d he wrote on his blog.Ms. Suzuki said that she had never taken a day off while Parliament was in session and that she had never skipped any of her public duties.In September, Ms. Suzuki gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Family members take turns looking after the child while Ms. Suzuki juggles frequent business trips between Tokyo and Hokkaido, the electoral district she represents.These days, Ms. Suzuki is focused on policy measures such as allowing elected officials to take time off when they are injured or sick. She\u2019s also pushing to allow proxy voting for such lawmakers.Ms. Suzuki said she was confronted almost daily with questions about her daughter. \u201cWhy was she working when she had a baby to take care of,\u201d she recalled being asked. \u201cI get a lot of \u2018I feel sorry for your baby.\u2019 Or, \u2018Don\u2019t you need to be at home with your baby?\u2019 Or, \u2018A mother not being with their child at this stage could negatively affect how the child grows up.\u2019 It\u2019s discouraging.\u201dMs. Suzuki has chosen not to breast-feed and that, too, has drawn criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s easiest to not say anything when I get these types of comments, and many people don\u2019t realize these are just their own beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cI try very hard to let them know my child is fine and we\u2019re doing very well.\u201cUnless I reassure them, new mothers following my footsteps will also have to endure this criticism.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the number of women who have become mothers while holding political office is minuscule.\u201cThey are a novelty in Japan,\u201d said Hiroko Nagano, the founder of a Facebook group called Network for Politicians Giving Birth (While in Office). Ms. Nagano is an assemblywoman from Tokyo\u2019s City of Toshima district.A survey conducted by Ms. Nagano and her team found that out of 874 city councils and other municipal-level assemblies in Japan, just 140 female politicians have given birth while in office in the last 72 years. In 90 percent of these city councils and assemblies, no woman has ever given birth while in office.Ms. Nagano formed her social media group in December, and she started a hotline in February to help widen her network\u2019s reach.The aim of the Facebook group, which has 52 members so far, has been to make women who become pregnant while holding jobs more of the norm in Japan. The network, composed of mostly municipal-level politicians, aims to share experiences, identify policy initiatives and advocate to carry out the policies in their communities.\u201cAlthough we are community leaders, we are always needing to apologize for our own actions as a result of being pregnant, delivering a baby or being a working mother,\u201d Ms. Nagano said. \u201cWe felt it made sense to advocate for all the other mothers in the communities we serve so there is no apology needed.\u201dHiromi Suzuki, 34, an assemblywoman from Tokyo\u2019s City of Shinjuku district, is part of this Facebook group. Ms. Suzuki, who is not related to Takako Suzuki, has been advocating for maternity leave for all municipal-level governments.While many voters in Ms. Suzuki\u2019s community were supportive of her pregnancy, others expressed their disapproval.After Hiromi Suzuki had her first baby four years ago, some of her campaign posters were defaced with vulgar and sexist remarks.Ms. Ogata said she received a thousand emails, letters, phone calls and social media posts after the November incident, about half of which were supportive.Ms. Ogata said she felt most affected by negative feedback from other women, particularly the older generation of working mothers. One called Ms. Ogata \u201carrogant\u201d and said that women needed to earn respect from men by \u201cworking harder than men\u201d and not asking for more.Motherhood has been blamed for some harsh consequences for female politicians.During parliamentary elections last October, Megumi Kaneko, 40, a two-term Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker from Niigata, lost her seat in the lower house.Ms. Kaneko had been criticized for using government vehicles occasionally to transport her toddler to and from the day care facility inside the government building where she worked.Many Japanese voters said online that her actions were \u201cnot a problem\u201d and having her child ride with her \u201cmade sense.\u201d However, many of Ms. Kaneko\u2019s voters in Niigata frowned on her use of government vehicles, calling her \u201cprivileged.\u201d Ms. Kaneko ultimately apologized.Controversy caused by her husband, Kensuke Miyazaki, may have also tainted her image. In 2016, Mr. Miyazaki, then a lower house Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker, was praised for being the first lawmaker to ever take paternity leave. But he quickly lost support when news broke that he was having an extramarital affair while his wife was pregnant. Mr. Miyazaki resigned from his seat. Ms. Kaneko, in turn, was also criticized when it became clear she had decided not to divorce him.Hiroko Miyashita, president of Yokohama-based Maternity Harassment Prevention Network, said: \u201cIf a woman in Japan becomes pregnant, they are almost seen as damaged goods in their workplaces. They are seen to no longer be as productive as those without children.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spy Contractor\u2019s Idea Helped Cambridge Analytica Harvest Facebook Data", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridge\u2019s psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app \u2014 a mobile-phone-based personality quiz \u2014 to gain access to Facebook users\u2019 friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.Cambridge Analytica has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports about the firm\u2019s data harvesting were published this month in The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian.The connections between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica were thrust into the spotlight by Mr. Wylie\u2019s testimony on Tuesday. Both companies are linked to tech-driven billionaires who backed Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign: Cambridge is chiefly owned by Robert Mercer, the computer scientist and hedge fund magnate, while Palantir was co-founded in 2003 by Mr. Thiel, who was an initial investor in Facebook.The Palantir employee, Alfredas Chmieliauskas, works on business development for the company, according to his LinkedIn page. In an initial statement, Palantir said it had \u201cnever had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica, nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Palantir revised its account, saying that Mr. Chmieliauskas was not acting on the company\u2019s behalf when he advised Mr. Wylie on the Facebook data.\u201cWe learned today that an employee, in 2013-2014, engaged in an entirely personal capacity with people associated with Cambridge Analytica,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are looking into this and will take the appropriate action.\u201dThe company said it was continuing to investigate but knew of no other employees who took part in the effort. Mr. Wylie told lawmakers that multiple Palantir employees played a role.Documents and interviews indicate that starting in 2013, Mr. Chmieliauskas began corresponding with Mr. Wylie and a colleague from his Gmail account. At the time, Mr. Wylie and the colleague worked for the British defense and intelligence contractor SCL Group, which formed Cambridge Analytica with Mr. Mercer the next year. The three shared Google documents to brainstorm ideas about using big data to create sophisticated behavioral profiles, a product code-named \u201cBig Daddy.\u201dA former intern at SCL \u2014 Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Eric Schmidt, then Google\u2019s executive chairman \u2014 urged the company to link up with Palantir, according to Mr. Wylie\u2019s testimony and a June 2013 email viewed by The Times.\u201cEver come across Palantir. Amusingly Eric Schmidt\u2019s daughter was an intern with us and is trying to push us towards them?\u201d one SCL employee wrote to a colleague in the email.Ms. Schmidt did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica.In early 2013, Alexander Nix, an SCL director who became chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and a Palantir executive discussed working together on election campaigns.A Palantir spokeswoman acknowledged that the companies had briefly considered working together but said that Palantir declined a partnership, in part because executives there wanted to steer clear of election work. Emails reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Nix and Mr. Chmieliauskas sought to revive talks about a formal partnership through early 2014, but Palantir executives again declined.In his testimony, Mr. Wylie acknowledged that Palantir and Cambridge Analytica never signed a contract or entered into a formal business relationship. But he said some Palantir employees helped engineer Cambridge\u2019s psychographic models.\u201cThere were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,\u201d Mr. Wylie told lawmakers. \u201cAnd we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir.\u201d He did not provide an exact number for the employees or identify them.Palantir employees were impressed with Cambridge\u2019s backing from Mr. Mercer, one of the world\u2019s richest men, according to messages viewed by The Times. And Cambridge Analytica viewed Palantir\u2019s Silicon Valley ties as a valuable resource for launching and expanding its own business.In an interview this month with The Times, Mr. Wylie said that Palantir employees were eager to learn more about using Facebook data and psychographics. Those discussions continued through spring 2014, according to Mr. Wylie.Mr. Wylie said that he and Mr. Nix visited Palantir\u2019s London office on Soho Square. One side was set up like a high-security office, Mr. Wylie said, with separate rooms that could be entered only with particular codes. The other side, he said, was like a tech start-up \u2014 \u201cweird inspirational quotes and stuff on the wall and free beer, and there\u2019s a Ping-Pong table.\u201dMr. Chmieliauskas continued to communicate with Mr. Wylie\u2019s team in 2014, as the Cambridge employees were locked in protracted negotiations with a researcher at Cambridge University, Michal Kosinski, to obtain Facebook data through an app Mr. Kosinski had built. The data was crucial to efficiently scale up Cambridge\u2019s psychometrics products so they could be used in elections and for corporate clients.\u201cI had left field idea,\u201d Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote in May 2014. \u201cWhat about replicating the work of the cambridge prof as a mobile app that connects to facebook?\u201d Reproducing the app, Mr. Chmieliauskas wrote, \u201ccould be a valuable leverage negotiating with the guy.\u201dThose negotiations failed. But Mr. Wylie struck gold with another Cambridge researcher, the Russian-American psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built his own personality quiz app for Facebook. Over subsequent months, Dr. Kogan\u2019s work helped Cambridge develop psychological profiles of millions of American voters.Carole Cadwalladr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Blended Scotch Still Have a Place in the Modern Bar?", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpirits of The TimesMy parents did not drink much, but they maintained a full liquor cabinet, either out of a sense of hospitality or because they received a lot of nice gifts.Not surprisingly, the array of spirits fascinated me. I remember the red-velvet-covered bottle of cherry heering, the coffee-scented Kahlua and the herbal Dubonnet that my father liked. But what most impressed me was the Scotch, and the famous, evocative names like Cutty Sark, Dewar\u2019s and Chivas Regal.Later on, as I started to work and came to understand that bars were an essential companion to the newspaper business, I saw how people adopted specific brands of Scotch as their own, drinking solely J & B or Ballantine\u2019s, just as one smoked Marlboros or Salems. Personally, I preferred beer.Those names do not mean as much today, at least to those who are drawn to whisky by the flavors rather than the brand connotations. Any discussion of Scotch whisky nowadays is dominated by the single malts, which hardly existed as a category back when I was stealthily sniffing from the bottles in my parents\u2019 cabinet.Blended Scotch combines malt whisky, either a single malt or many, with grain whisky. The whiskies must be aged at least three years in oak barrels, and if a bottle carries an age statement, like \u201c8 Years Old,\u201d it means that the youngest whisky in the blend is that old.While the malt components are the crucial elements, the grain whisky is not just neutral spirit, like vodka. It, too, takes on character as it ages.One other important Scotch category exists, blended malt whisky, a combination of two or more single malts. These whiskies, which used to be called vatted malts, can be wonderful and complex. But they differ from blended Scotch as they do not contain any grain whisky.\u201cMalts are about intensity of character,\u201d he writes. \u201cSingle-malt bottlings are about maximizing this singularity. Blends are about creating a totality.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Broom\u2019s book devotes just three pages to blended Scotch and more than 150 to single malts. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a lot of celebration,\u201d Robert said.David noted that efforts are made periodically to talk up blended Scotch, but they never really take hold, particularly among younger consumers. \u201cBlended Scotch doesn\u2019t have the craft imprimatur,\u201d he said, \u201ceven though some are really good, like Pinch, if you can even find it.\u201dSadly, we did not have Pinch among our 20 bottles.We all found a lot to like among these blended Scotches. I was drawn to their mildness and restraint. It was easy to see how they would satisfy people who prefer whisky that is not as aggressive as many single malts.Nonetheless, we preferred the whiskies that had assertive malt characters, with creamy textures and lingering flavors.The differences among many of them were small and incremental. David said he was expecting more variation among them, and recalled that years ago blended Scotches were maltier and peatier. Robert felt that, as producers are able to blend any whiskies they want, they might have missed an opportunity to stand out from the crowd.\u201cBut they are making these whiskies for an audience,\u201d he said, \u201cso they are obliged to satisfy.\u201dTeacher\u2019s was on the cusp of what the trade refers to as value and premium brands, the lower end of the price spectrum and the categories of Scotch that are declining the fastest. Any growth in blended Scotch, the Distilled Spirits Council said, is coming among high-end premium and especially super premium, the most expensive categories. Super premium includes brands like Johnnie Walker Blue Label, which, at $150 or so a bottle, exceeded our $100 cap.I\u2019m not sure any of us were convinced enough by the tasting to trade in distinctive single malts for mild blends. \u201cIt\u2019s not an exciting group,\u201d David said. \u201cThey\u2019re for drinkers who do not want to be challenged.\u201dAside from those, I\u2019ll always have my fragrant memories.Smoky, rich and creamy, with discernible malt flavors that linger.

Most will be familiar to anyone who has seen the food court boom in Manhattan.Here is hanger steak, rugged on the outside and blushing within, slaked with house-made sriracha.

They\u2019re simmered in a curry loosely based on Indonesian rendang, heady from curry paste, makrut lime leaves and galangal.Dishes change daily, so, while there is always chicken (thigh and leg, \u201cbecause Asians don\u2019t like white meat,\u201d Mr. Yiu said), it might be Hainanese poached chicken on one visit and Filipino chicken inasal the next, a glaze of sweet soy sauce and sesame oil giving way to vinegar and calamansi (a Filipino citrus tarter than lime).Steak is cut to order, revealing a ruby interior at a midpoint between chewy and tender. Salmon is perhaps the simplest dish and the loveliest, brined with salt and sugar, then pan-seared and finished in the oven. Although the kitchen isn\u2019t yet equipped with gas, Mr. Liu and Mr. Syham get the texture right: The salmon emerges delicate, with a little shimmer.Sides include both Chinese smashed cucumbers \u2014 labeled spicy, but skewing sweet \u2014 and Thanksgiving-table potatoes bearing stitches of rosemary and thyme. Alongside a charred avocado is Filipino sinigang, a soup suffused with tamarind, sour enough to make you shiver before reaching for a second spoonful, and creamy tofu in an inky near-syrup of crumbled preserved yolk and a 1,000-year-old egg, its yolk gone green and its white black, pulverized in a blender with sweet soy sauce.Ok Lah! may not be a destination for people coming from other boroughs. But it brings a fresh perspective to Flushing: healthy, thoughtfully priced food that speaks to the experience of young Americans of Asian heritage who have found a way to unite multiple cuisines without collapsing their distinctions.\u201cWe want to bridge the gap between Western culture and old-school Flushing Chinese society,\u201d Mr. Yiu said.

{"Headline": "Think Cryptocurrency Is Confusing? Try Paying Taxes on It", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThe room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren\u2019t nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets.No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to pay them.\u201cI\u2019ve lost sleep over it,\u201d said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year\u2019s cryptocurrency profits on his taxes. Shaun, who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past, said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the I.R.S. to pay special attention to cases like his.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be made an example of,\u201d he said.This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation. For an hour, the audience peppered them with tax-prep questions that ranged from common (Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I haven\u2019t sold yet?) to esoteric (If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen, can I deduct my losses?). By the end of the hour, there seemed to be many more questions than answers.For answers to some common questions about cryptocurrencies and taxes, see my colleague Tara Siegel Bernard\u2019s column on the topic.\u201cIt\u2019s complicated as heck,\u201d said Mike Schreibman, an I.T. consultant who attended. Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis.\u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. \u201cBut the I.R.S. is the one agency you don\u2019t want to mess with.\u201dTaxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into \u201cprivacy coins,\u201d such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users\u2019 transactions.Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology\u2019s stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it\u2019s possible for users to conceal their identities.All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon.Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business.\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,\u201d Mr. Costanz said.Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year.\u201cA lot of crypto investors are younger and don\u2019t have a lot of experience trading stocks,\u201d she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, \u201ca lot of people are kind of shocked.\u201dPart of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else \u2014 whether you\u2019re cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee \u2014 you\u2019re creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for.Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year\u2019s cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year\u2019s market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year\u2019s gains.Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. \u201cNow they\u2019re stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don\u2019t have the capital to pay it.\u201dEven the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren\u2019t planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains.\u201cThis is the smallest crypto event I\u2019ve been to,\u201d said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. \u201cNo one believes they\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201dAll the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one.Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year\u2019s tax season had come as a jolt of reality.\u201cIt\u2019s not Monopoly money anymore,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Low-Profile Engineer Is Set to Take Power in Peru", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 Peru\u2019s first vice president, a low-profile engineer who also doubles as his country\u2019s ambassador to Canada, was poised on Thursday to assume power after the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a corruption scandal.Peru\u2019s Congress debated Thursday night whether to accept the resignation or to proceed with formal impeachment, which would be a particularly humiliating turn for Mr. Kuczynski, 79, an economist who worked for international institutions for many years.A vote was set for Friday. A number of representatives said they would not accept Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s resignation unless he rewrote his letter offering to step down. In the letter, Mr. Kuczynski admitted no wrongdoing and accused Congress of \u201chindrances and attacks.\u201dEither way, the first vice president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, 55, is expected to take power.He was also a part of Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s first cabinet, becoming minister of transportation and communications, but was forced to resign after opposition lawmakers questioned his plans for a planned airport in Cusco, Peru\u2019s most important tourist destination. After his resignation, he was appointed ambassador to Canada.Even as Mr. Vizcarra was being summoned home from Ottawa, the scandal over Mr. Kuczynski continued to shake Peru. On Thursday, a Peruvian judge said he would consider a request to bar Mr. Kuczynski from leaving the country if the opposition-controlled Congress decided to accept the resignation, which would end his presidential immunity and make him vulnerable to prosecution.Peru has a long history of presidents entangled in corruption scandals.Alberto K. Fujimori diverted tens of millions in government funds in the 1990s to buy politicians and journalists, and until recently was imprisoned in Peru; Alejandro Toledo, was accused of receiving a $20 million bribe in the early 2000s from the construction giant Odebrecht; and Ollanta Humala and his wife were placed in pretrial detention over allegations of laundering $3 million in Odebrecht funds to support his 2011 presidential campaign.It was Mr. Fujimori who, after complaining that Congress did not let him govern, helped establish the current political system. He sent tanks to shut down Parliament in 1992, and later blessed a Constitution that established a unicameral Parliament, doing away with the Senate.\u201cA system of government requires checks and balances, and we lost those with our current Constitution,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Landa, a constitutional lawyer. \u201cHaving a single chamber of Congress is not part of our democratic tradition.\u201dIn 2016, Mr. Kuczynski narrowly defeated Mr. Fujimori\u2019s daughter Keiko, but her right-wing party, the Popular Force, went on to dominate Congress. The president\u2019s party won only a small minority.\u201cMr. Kuczynski was politically isolated and a virtual hostage to the demands of Keiko Fujimori\u2019s sector,\u201d said Cynthia McClintock, a professor of political science at George Washington University.Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s weak government tested the limits of Peru\u2019s fragile democratic institutions. During his 19 months in office, Congress either fired or forced the resignation of three ministers and at one point it fired the entire cabinet, and lawmakers tried to fire the attorney general and four judges of the Constitutional Court. Twice it accused Mr. Kuczynski of \u201cpermanent moral incapacity\u201d and each time scheduled a vote to determine his fate.Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s enemies denied that Congress had overstepped its powers.\u201cI think we have strengthened democracy,\u201d said Ursula Letona, a lawmaker with the Popular Force. \u201cWe haven\u2019t broken the entire government \u2014 we\u2019ve simply paved the way for an orderly and constitutional presidential transition.\u201dWhether Mr. Vizcarra will be given more room to govern is still an open question. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d said Carlos Tubino, also a Popular Force congressman.There are several proposals that would reinstate the Senate, which would make it harder for a single group to have as much legislative power. But they could face an uphill battle.\u201cThe people don\u2019t want two chambers of Congress because it means extra spending,\u201d said Ms. Letona, who runs the congressional committee in charge of constitutional amendments. \u201cAnd we are not a government branch that is particularly loved.\u201dMr. Kuczynski\u2019s political fortunes were closely associated with the Fujimori family.Then old-style Fujimori tactics seemed to emerge.An ally of Keiko Fujimori\u2019s sought meetings with Kenji Fujimori and his allies, claiming to be considering switching sides to back the president. He secretly recorded Mr. Fujimori and his aides bragging that those who supported Mr. Kuczynski reaped big rewards.Ms. Fujimori\u2019s party released the covert videos on Tuesday, dealing a final blow to Mr. Kuczynski and potentially ending her brother\u2019s political aspirations. Congress is considering expelling Kenji Fujimori.The arm-twisting and secret surveillance were reminiscent of the tactics used by Alberto Fujimori\u2019s top adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, a former spy chief who became infamous for filming hundreds of meetings where he handed out bribes, building pyramids of cash as he carried out negotiations. It was one of Mr. Montesinos\u2019s videos that set off the downfall of Mr. Fujimori in 2000.This month, Mr. Montesinos weighed in on the family fight. \u201cIn the 1990s, I used to speak more with Keiko Fujimori, not so much with Kenji,\u201d Mr. Montesinos said on Facebook through his lawyer. \u201cSo, if I have left a mark on anyone, it\u2019s on Keiko.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Whatever news the 90th Academy Awards ceremony makes, the editors on The New York Times\u2019s social media team stand ready to spot it and share it.Dozens of Times reporters, editors and photographers will be covering different aspects of the biggest awards show of the year. One part of the social team\u2019s work is to pull all that reporting together. Using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the team begins coverage just before the red carpet entrances at 5 p.m. Eastern and works until the end of the show, typically around 11 p.m. Each platform serves as a home for different mediums, depending on timeliness: Twitter for live breaking news, Facebook for comprehensive coverage and Instagram for photography. The Styles, Culture, video and photography departments all collaborate to complete a full report. \u201cNobody has our Styles expertise, our cinematic expertise, and in this case our political and investigative reporting expertise,\u201d said Cynthia Collins, The Times\u2019s editor for social media and community. \u201cSo all of these forces are coming together to make the Times be this essential resource for all things Oscars.\u201dBefore the carpet is even laid down, Michael Gold, a social strategy editor, begins combing archives from across the newsroom for related coverage to the films. Social media language is often prepared days in advance.Those posts help locate the Oscars inside the constellation of The Times\u2019s politics and culture reporting. \u201cWe just have a lot of great reporting on most of these nominees that we can resurface and push out there,\u201d Mr. Gold said. \u201cIt adds extra context.\u201d The team will share reviews of nominated films, for instance, or a critic\u2019s take on a nominated song. They even have explainers for jokes ready, for when a host\u2019s esoteric punch line leaves viewers scratching their heads at home.In the newsroom, a war room of sorts will be set up, with more than 30 people assigned to various tasks. The social media team acts as a kind of journalistic front line \u2014 scouring various platforms for anything newsworthy from celebrities as they get ready for the main event. The model and TV host Chrissy Teigen, for example, always provides great material, Mr. Gold said. Others on the team like Eleanor Stanford, a staff editor for Watching, the Times\u2019s viewing guide for film and TV, will help point readers to Times coverage of nominated films they might have seen and where to stream movies starring a particular nominee.There will also be staffers on hand simply to transcribe sound bites. \u201cSomeone\u2019s acceptance speech can be one of the biggest lines of the night,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want our take, they just want to know what was said.\u201dShowstoppers might not be confined to the stage, as was the case at the Golden Globes, when Debra Messing was interviewed by E! reporters, only to criticize the network for its pay disparity between men and women.\u201cI\u2019m still not over that moment,\u201d said Bonnie Wertheim, a staff editor in Styles who will be posting from the department\u2019s Twitter account.\u201cWe spend a lot of time transcribing quotes now because at least from what we\u2019ve seen on previous red carpets, there tends to be more substantive conversation,\u201d Ms. Wertheim said.

For years, it seemed that the demographic change in Orange County might push the suburban enclave to shed its image as a conservative island. And in 2016, voters chose a Democrat candidate for president for the first time since the Great Depression.But now, political leaders there seem poised to reclaim their role as a counterpoint to much of the rest of California. On Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors took two significant votes: One scrapped a previously approved plan to open temporary shelters for the homeless in the wealthy towns of Huntington Beach, Irvine and Laguna Niguel. In the other, the board voted to join a lawsuit from the Trump administration against California\u2019s so-called sanctuary state law. Both votes from the all-Republican board were unanimous, though one member was not present.\u201cWe cannot let the state begin cherry-picking which federal laws it decides to follow,\u201d Supervisor Michelle Steel said in a statement after the meeting. Immigrant rights advocates called the vote \u201cshameful\u201d and said they were \u201cscapegoating our own communities.\u201d Other opponents reminded the jurors that Orange County was a leader in backing Proposition 187, an anti-illegal immigrant measure that was later struck down by the courts.It is unclear how the county will now deal with the hundreds of people it forced out of a homeless encampment along the Santa Ana River earlier this year, but county leaders say they expect local leaders to discuss options at a court hearing on Tuesday.We want to hear from you: Do you think city and county governments have the right to challenge state laws?

Again.", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionFran\u00e7ois Hollande, then president, echoing a chorus of European leaders, pushed back hard, appealing to his country\u2019s Jews: \u201cYour place is here, in your home. France is your country.\u201dIs it?This is a question worth seriously asking following the barbaric murder last week of Mireille Knoll.Ms. Knoll, 85, believed Mr. Hollande. France was her place, her home, her country. And Paris was her city.She remained in her apartment in the 11th arrondissement when, suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, she was stabbed 11 times. Her apartment was then set on fire. Firefighters found the burned body on Friday night.Parisian authorities are investigating the murder as being motivated by the \u201cmembership, real or supposed, of the victim of a particular religion.\u201d But euphemisms should have no place in describing the nature of Mireille Knoll\u2019s death. She was murdered by men apparently animated by the same hatred that drove Hitler.Two suspects, a 29-year-old and a 21-year-old, have been arrested. The older man is a neighbor Ms. Knoll has known since he was a child. The younger, according to reports, is homeless. One of the suspects told the investigators that the other had shouted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d while killing Ms. Knoll, according to Le Monde. (A lawyer for the Knoll family, Gilles-William Goldnadel, confirmed that in a phone call.) On Tuesday, G\u00e9rard Collomb, the interior minister, told Parliament that one of the attackers had told the other: \u201cShe\u2019s a Jew. She must have money.\u201dIt\u2019s a neighborhood that has already borne witness to a nearly identical crime. Almost exactly a year ago, a 65-year-old Jewish widow named Sarah Halimi was murdered by her neighbor, 27-year-old Kobili Traor\u00e9. Other neighbors said they heard Mr. Traor\u00e9 scream \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he beat Ms. Halimi, a retired doctor, to near death in the early hours of April 4, 2017. He then threw her body into the courtyard below.This time, French authorities have been quick to call the crime by its proper name. On Monday, President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \u201cI would like to express my shock at the appalling crime committed against Mrs. Knoll. I reaffirm my absolute determination to fight anti-Semitism.\u201d On Wednesday, he said that she was murdered \u201cbecause she was Jewish\u201d at a tribute to a police officer killed in an Islamist attack. Mr. Macron has been widely praised by the country\u2019s Jewish community for his moral clarity in describing anti-Zionism as a \u201creinvented form of anti-Semitism.\u201dAnti-Semitism was supposed to be a disease of the far right. But the people actually killing Jews in France these days are not members of the National Front. They are Islamists.\u201cThe major crimes against the Jewish community \u2014 Ilan Halimi, the Toulouse killings, the Hyper Cacher killings, Sarah Halimi \u2014 all of them have all been carried out by radicalized Muslims,\u201d Robert Ejnes, the executive director of CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish groups, told me in a call from Paris. \u201cThese young people have French identity cards, but they hate what France stands for. This is the nature of the problem we are facing. And it\u2019s very hard to talk about.\u201dIn the wake of Ms. Knoll\u2019s murder, all of the usual lines are being repeated. Anti-Semitism is the hatred that never dies. Violence that begins with the Jews never ends with them.All of this is true. What\u2019s also true is that anti-Semitism is the oldest hatred in the world because individual people have sustained it in every generation. It cannot be defeated until we look these people and their ideologies in the face.Every French Jew \u2014 like millions of Jews throughout history \u2014 will have to make their own choice about whether to leave their homes for safer shores or to stay and fight for their rightful place in a country that prides itself on being a beacon of liberty and fraternity. But perhaps the better part of wisdom is with one of Mireille Knoll\u2019s granddaughters, Noa Goldfarb. Following her grandmother\u2019s murder, she wrote in a Facebook post from Israel: \u201cTwenty years ago, I left Paris knowing that neither my future nor that of the Jewish People is to be found there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I did not want to endure the taunts and trash talk of my friends who cheer for Duke.I do this often. When I need to focus on a project or relax a bit, I turn off the noise that comes from Facebook \u2014 the constant stream of disturbing faces, angry comments and shallow pulls on my precious attention. I also lose the lovely pictures of puppies and babies. But sometimes it\u2019s worth it to retreat from the addictive torrent of stimuli framed in blue.If you feel the same way about how Facebook affects your daily life, by all means suspend or even delete your account (not that Facebook makes it easy to). But don\u2019t pretend it will make a difference to Facebook or to the state of the world.A Twitter movement known as #DeleteFacebook is motivated by the stream of terrible things that Facebook has been involved in, including the proliferation of hate speech, harassment and propaganda meant to undermine trust in democratic institutions. The final spark was the news that the British political data firm Cambridge Analytica had acquired Facebook data on 50 million Americans.But even if tens of thousands of Americans quit Facebook tomorrow, the company would barely feel it. Facebook has more than 2.1 billion users worldwide. Its growth has plateaued in the United States, but the service is gaining millions of new users outside North America every week. Like most global companies, Facebook focuses its attention on markets like India, Egypt, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil and Mexico. At current rates of growth, it could reach three billion users by 2020.People in those countries are getting value out of Facebook; in some places, it\u2019s one of the few reliable ways to keep in touch. In much of the developing world, Facebook is also the only news source that matters. This should horrify us. But it\u2019s not a problem that will be solved by indignant Americans leaving the service.Moreover, quitting Facebook lets Google and Twitter off the hook. It lets AT&T and Comcast and its peers off the hook. The dangers of extremist propaganda and hate speech are just as grave on YouTube, which is owned by Google. Russian agents undermining trust in institutions and democracy are even more visible on Twitter. And every major telecommunications firm, as well as Google and Twitter, relies on surveillance systems similar to the one Facebook uses to run targeted advertising. Facebook is bigger and better at all of this than the others, but its problems are not unique.Facebook\u2019s problems are not peripheral, not just some rough edges that can be sanded down. Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that\u2019s true, don\u2019t expect Facebook to fix itself.Hope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.The Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.The European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won\u2019t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.As with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won\u2019t repair the sins of the past. But it\u2019s something.Regulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.If we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it\u2019s a terrible tool for deliberation.So go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse. Deactivation is the opposite of activism.Siva Vaidhyanathan is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAntisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The social network, which was once Silicon Valley\u2019s pride and joy, is now facing a new scandal over data privacy \u2014 and the fallout has been intense and keeps widening.Let\u2019s recap how it all unfolded:Where have Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders been in all of this, you may ask? Good question. The top brass at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park have been silent for days.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things, but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system: \u201catmospheric river\u201d and \u201cPineapple Express.\u201dSo which one is it?\u201cPineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast,\u201d said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist affiliated with U.C. San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \u201cAbout 15 years ago we recognized that there\u2019s a broader definition called an atmospheric river, and those happen all over the planet.\u201dFor non-scientists, atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually.\u201cIf you look from space from a satellite, it does look like a sinuous river,\u201d said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A. \u201cIt\u2019s a colorful term, and it\u2019s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process.\u201dBut while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers, not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms.The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands, hence the playful \u201cPineapple Express.\u201d Not everyone agrees, though, that this storm falls under that category.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this one a Pineapple Express. The storm is coming from the West, but the tail of this atmospheric river didn\u2019t come from Hawaii, it came from east of Hawaii,\u201d Mr. Ralph said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this. The modern term is atmospheric river.\u201dNomenclature aside, Mr. Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue. Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard, it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County. The forecast is severe, and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides.\u201cThe forecast is for a really, really big rain,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity. Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "The 28-Year-Old Socialist Who Could End the Merkel Era", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 The man who could topple Chancellor Angela Merkel wears hooded sweatshirts, loves amateur soccer and has yet to finish his politics degree. His nickname is \u201cbaby face.\u201d His real name is Kevin K\u00fchnert.Three months ago, few people had heard of Mr. K\u00fchnert. Now, his boyish face with its rebellious cowlick is ubiquitous. He is a regular on prime time talk shows and routinely described as a rising star of German politics.But he is also an enfant terrible for Europe\u2019s political elites, who breathed a sigh of relief when Ms. Merkel announced last month that she had secured a governing deal, seemingly ending five months of political limbo in Europe\u2019s most important capital.But that left one major obstacle, and partly because of Mr. K\u00fchnert\u2019s spirited campaign it has been growing taller by the day: The grass roots of the Social Democracts still need to approve the deal.The result of the vote will be announced Sunday. If the 463,000 members reject the coalition, Germany faces the prospect of an unstable minority government or new elections or both. In any case, it would likely spell the end of the Merkel era. That would be fine with Mr. K\u00fchnert.\u201cGoing into another coalition with Merkel is bad for social democracy and bad for democracy,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said, summing up his pitch as he rushed to another campaign stop in an eastern district of Berlin.Many in his party agree. One recent afternoon Mr. K\u00fchnert arrived at its headquarters in Berlin wrapped in a thick scarf and nursing a cup of peppermint tea. He was not feeling well. Back-to-back speaking events in 23 cities with multiple television interviews every day, not to speak of Facebook Lives and podcasts, were taking their toll.While a volunteer dabbed makeup on his blotched cheeks in preparation for a camera interview, Mr. K\u00fchnert recounted how energized he had been when his party had campaigned against Ms. Merkel last year on the premise that they would either win or go into opposition.The leadership had reiterated that pledge on election night, after they had just got the worst election result since World War II. But the mood was combative, upbeat even. They would rebuild in opposition, they would come back.\u201cIt felt like a new beginning,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert recalled.That feeling did not last. Within weeks, the party leadership spectacularly reversed course and entered coalition talks with the chancellor. \u201cHow can voters trust us if we can\u2019t even trust our own leaders?\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said.The makeup was done. Mr. K\u00fchnert checked his watch and popped an aspirin. He was, he said, \u201cready for the next round.\u201dIt is a battle between hope and fear. It pits those, like Mr. K\u00fchnert, urging the party to regroup in opposition with the hope of growing back into the formidable political force it once was, against those who fear that new elections now might just kill it.\u201cSuicide for fear of death,\u201d has become a common refrain for those urging comrades to work with Ms. Merkel one more time.Mr. K\u00fchnert sees it differently. \u201cBeing a dwarf today so we can be giants in the future,\u201d is one thing he likes to say. And, \u201cIf we do politics because we\u2019re scared, we\u2019re lost.\u201dThe Social Democrats are Germany\u2019s oldest party. In its proud 155-year-history it has fought for workers\u2019 rights, battled fascism and helped shape Germany\u2019s postwar welfare state. But like many of its sister parties elsewhere in Europe, it has been self-destructing at an alarming pace.Its vote share has halved over the past two decades. Many blame the cozy working relationship with Ms. Merkel, which critics say has stripped the party of its identity and its place as the leading voice of opposition.The Social Democrats were still winning 34 percent of votes when they entered their first coalition with Ms. Merkel in 2005; in September that had shrunk to 20 percent.In one poll last week, the far-right Alternative for Germany, pulled ahead of them for the first time.Mr. K\u00fchnert was born in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Capitalism had beaten communism. Trickle-down economics, already the default ideology on the right, was embraced by the left, too. Some say that is when the problems of social democracy began.Mr. K\u00fchnert joined his party when he was 15, the same year Ms. Merkel became chancellor and formed her first coalition with the Social Democrats.Like a whole generation of young Germans, he came of age in a period when the traditionally opposing camps on left and right governed jointly, blunting political debate and pushing voters in search of an opposition to the extremes.\u201cAnyone who is in their mid-20s today has pretty much only known Merkel and these grand coalitions,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert said in an interview. \u201cShe embodies this style of politics.\u201dAs for the Social Democrats, he said, \u201cWe have become the party that governs with the conservatives, the party that makes things get worse a little more slowly.\u201dIn Mr. K\u00fchnert\u2019s view, the Social Democrats have failed to offer distinctive answers to the most pressing issue of the day: The future of the welfare state.The tension over migration, he argues, is in large part a proxy conflict at a time when large parts of the population feel neglected by the state and see migrants as competing for scarce public goods.Later, addressing an attentive crowd in Berlin, he boiled down his argument to a question. \u201cWhy should we exist as a party in the 21st century?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat do voters get from us that they don\u2019t get anywhere else? Right now: Nothing.\u201dPolitics has been a keen interest for him since childhood. According to his grandmother, Mr. K\u00fchnert watched parliamentary debates on television when he was in primary school. (He is a little embarrassed about that.)The only child of two civil servants, he was named after Kevin Keegan, an English soccer player his mother adored, and soccer has shaped his politics. His team, a plucky little 5th league club called Tennis Borussia Berlin, has a proud Jewish history and several Turkish players, and regularly encounters anti-Semitism and racist slurs from hostile fans.The club\u2019s purple colors sometimes draw homophobic jeers, too. Mr. K\u00fchnert is himself gay, but he never talks about it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do identity politics,\u201d he said.Breathless commentators already compare him to Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former chancellor, who had also been a leader of the party\u2019s youth wing. The tabloid Bild recently printed extracts of Mr. K\u00fchnert\u2019s high school yearbook, where friends bet he would be chancellor one day.He dismisses such predictions as \u201cmedia hysteria\u201d but rules nothing out.If Mr. K\u00fchnert prevails on Sunday, it would not be the first time he beat the odds and his elders. As a freshman in high school, he was elected student representative on the back of a rousing speech, beating his contenders, who were all seniors.Later, aged 20, when his local soccer club faced financial problems, he convened an extraordinary members\u2019 meeting and persuaded them to fire the entire board. He then founded a charity to raise money for the club, printing T-shirts and selling them for $25 a piece.What worries Mr. K\u00fchnert most is that once again too many party members might opt for short-term stability over long-term democratic revival.One party member recently challenged him during a rally. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d the young man said, noting that the coalition deal gives the Social Democrats three powerful ministries and a governing program which by some estimates contains a majority of their proposals.Why reject this?\u201cWe should not just worry about the next four years but about the next 40,\u201d Mr. K\u00fchnert replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last generation that had an SPD.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s Grim Reality: Public Fury Over Children\u2019s Deaths in Mall", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Putin traveled to the town of Kemerovo to lay flowers next to a memorial for the at least 64 people, many of them children, who died in the fire on Sunday. Some of them died as they banged on locked exit doors and screamed into cellphones for help from their parents.\u201cHow could this ever happen?\u201d Mr. Putin asked local officials, echoing a question now being asked across Russia by a population that just recently voted overwhelmingly to re-elect a president who, during his previous 18 years in power, repeatedly boasted of making Russia strong and safe.Public anger at the fire \u2014 and claims that official bungling and corruption played a part \u2014 drowned out the Kremlin\u2019s fury over Monday\u2019s expulsion of Russian diplomats by 23 countries. Even on state-controlled television, news about the fire pushed aside routine denunciations of the West just as four more countries ordered out diplomats over a nerve-agent attack for which London has blamed Moscow.Normally, the Kremlin would have used the diplomatic crisis to stoke patriotic fervor and promote its view of Russia as a fortress besieged by \u201cRussophobic\u201d foreigners.Russia-24, a round-the-clock state news channel, tried early Monday to stick to its usual fare of patriotic programming, broadcasting a panel \u201cdiscussion\u201d featuring fiery tirades against the West. But even that exercise had to pause to give the announcer time to express condolences over the deaths in Siberia.By afternoon, however, the coverage was focused almost entirely on the shopping mall tragedy and a tightly choreographed visit by Mr. Putin to Kemerovo, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow.Eager to keep control of the story, Mr. Putin warned people to stick to official information. \u201cYou know it very well that social media is a murky source unfortunately,\u201d he told officials and relatives in Kemerovo. \u201cWe need to rely on the results of the actual inquiry.\u201dThat Russia is far from being a monolithic one-party state, despite Mr. Putin\u2019s lopsided re-election, was clear Tuesday evening in the two events organized to mourn the dead in Kemerovo.One was state-sponsored, near the Kremlin; the other was held in Pushkin Square, by Muscovites who wanted no part in the official gathering. The alternative wake began as a solemn vigil with mourners burning candles and laying flowers, some of them in tears, but gradually turned into a small-scale political rally with chants of \u201cRussia without Putin!\u201d \u201cCorruption kills!\u201d \u201cShame on television!\u201d and \u201cSilence means death!\u201dInstead of fuming at the United States and its allies, Mr. Putin, during his Siberia trip, used another tool in his repertoire of responses to most problems: He set the security apparatus to work, telling relatives of the victims that the Investigative Committee, Russia\u2019s answer to the F.B.I., had deployed 100 investigators and would find those responsible for the fire and punish them.He blamed \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d and \u201cslovenliness\u201d for the blaze, which started in a children\u2019s play area and then swept through nearby cinemas crowded with young people.The regional governor, Aman Tuleyev, a relic of the Soviet era, begged for forgiveness and accused opposition activists of trying to exploit the tragedy for political ends. \u201cIt\u2019s sacrilege when there\u2019s grief and you use it to solve your own problems,\u201d the governor said.Mr. Putin avoided mention of what many, including those who lost family members, believe was the real cause of the fire: a state system, including multiple agencies responsible for limiting fire and other risks, eaten away by corruption and incompetence.Russia has strict building codes and elaborate safety regulations but, instead of being enforced, they are frequently skirted with the help of corrupt officials willing to turn a blind eye to violations in return for cash bribes and favors. Law enforcement officers, who are supposed to prevent this, are themselves often on the take or under pressure from powerful political barons not to investigate.Asserting that the mall, called Winter Cherry, should never have been allowed to open because of \u201cblatant safety issues,\u201d he accused an unnamed deputy mayor of signing off on the shopping center\u2019s opening in 2013 after receiving a bribe. \u201cHis eyes were closed by money,\u201d the legislator contended.Government investigators, added Mr. Vostrikov, \u201cwill find a scapegoat, and the issue will be done with, but the threats \u2014 incompetence, widespread corruption, alcoholism and total degradation of society \u2014 will go nowhere.\u201dJust a few yards from the regional government offices where Mr. Putin met local officials, thousands of people gathered in Kemerovo\u2019s central square and called on the governor to resign, pouring scorn on those who repeated an official death toll that many believe undercounted the real number of victims.Mr. Putin and the governor, Mr. Tuleyev, stayed away from the square. The governor\u2019s deputy, Sergei Tsivilev, did visit and, according to the news website Znak, was met with cries of \u201cThe truth!\u201d \u201cResign!\u201d and demands that Mr. Putin come and address the throng.Public distrust generated by the Kursk tragedy was then reinforced by multiple disasters involving the authorities\u2019 incompetent and brutal response to hostage takings by terrorists at a Moscow theater in 2002, during a performance of a musical called \u201cNord-Ost,\u201d and at a school in the southern Russian town of Beslan in 2004.Increasingly tight control of the news media, ratcheted up after each such tragedy, has done little to dissipate this distrust and may even have aggravated it.\u201cEven if the official death toll reflects reality, at the end of the day people know how the government lied in Beslan, Nord-Ost, Kursk and many other places. So they have themselves to blame for the spiraling level of distrust,\u201d said a post on Twitter by Kaloy Akhilgov, a lawyer and former government official.State television largely ignored Tuesday\u2019s gathering in Kemerovo\u2019s central square, focusing instead on Mr. Putin\u2019s visit to a hospital ward and his solemn expressions of condolences.It also showed him pointing a finger at lowly local officials and strenuously avoiding the question of whether a system addled by corruption might be the real problem.Mr. Putin made no mention of Russia\u2019s lamentable and well-known fire safety record, but instead expressed puzzled outrage that the shopping mall had gone up in flames and killed so many people.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d Mr. Putin said in a highly scripted meeting with Kemerovo officials. \u201cThis isn\u2019t war, it\u2019s not a spontaneous methane outburst. People came to relax, children. We\u2019re talking about demography and losing so many people.\u201dInstead of calming the throng, the deputy governor only inflamed it by suggesting that some people were exploiting the tragedy to attract attention. This drew a furious retort from Mr. Vostikov, the author of the social media post denouncing corruption.\u201cI have lost my sister Sabadash Alyona Igorevna; my wife, Vostrikova Elena Sergeevna; three children \u2014 5, 7 and 2 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here for self-promotion, did I?\u201dMatthew Luxmoore and Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

One in four Anglophones in Quebec marry French Quebecers.I live on Plateau-Mont-Royal, a predominantly Francophone neighborhood in the east of Montreal. Twentysomething Francophone shopkeepers answer me in fluent English when I address them in French, and residents of all linguistic persuasions seem more obsessed by their search for the perfect latte than whether you order it in the language of Shakespeare or Moli\u00e8re.Today\u2019s younger generation, he said, had discarded the hang-ups of their parents.\u201cThere is a shift in the younger generation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case, English meant Hollywood, it was film, it was \u2018Titanic,\u2019 so I wanted to speak English as quickly as I could.\u201d\u201cToday the French speak English and the English speak French, and that didn\u2019t exist when you had the two solitudes,\u201d he said.Today, gaggles of French, English, Chinese and Indian students sit hunched over computers at cafes, chatting on Facebook or writing on Twitter.But \u2014 a Berlin Wall of the mind lingers.While the younger generation of Anglophone residents will confidently pronounce \u201cSt.-Laurent,\u201d some of their parents stubbornly cling to \u201cSt. Lawrence.\u201dWhen her daughter was 9 years old, Ms. O\u2019Neill sent her to a French elementary school, where, she recalled, she was chided by a teacher for speaking English with a Russian girl in the schoolyard.Then there are the political fissures.Half of the districts to the east, where a majority of Francophone Montrealers live, have been won by separatist parties like the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois or, more recently, the leftist Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire.Chloe Molson, a university student with a Francophone mother and an Anglophone father, said that when she sometimes used English to greet customers at the Westmount supermarket where she works part-time, they sometimes rebuked her.\u201cOne woman said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t you understand French?!\u2019\u201d she said.But her Anglo friends sometimes become panicked when addressed in French.Still, walking down St. Laurent Boulevard shows the unity, not the division of the city.\u201cYou still have people on both sides who can\u2019t talk to one another, but in everyday life the barriers have come down.\u201dA few streets farther east on Avenue du Mont-Royal, Marie Bouchard, a 23-year-old political science student at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, was munching on a sandwich at a cafe.She said her favorite television show was the British science fiction series \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d while she loved French Quebecois pop music and adored her large group of Anglo friends.\u201cI love French, it\u2019s my language,\u201d she said, quickly adding, \u201cBut if I only spoke French, it would limit my horizons.\u201dJasmin Lavoie contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Soul-Searching From Ad Group That Lauded Cambridge Analytica", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its \u201cbig data\u201d work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used.\"We\u2019ve tended to assume that because you can do something, you should,\u201d Scott McDonald, chief executive of the ad group, said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place.Mr. McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the group\u2019s annual convention in New York.Things were much different last year, when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundation\u2019s David Ogilvy Awards, which have been given annually since 1994. The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign, in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters.The selection, made by a jury of ad industry leaders, was \u201cvery controversial because of the nature of the campaign,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. But the ad group viewed itself as \u201cSwitzerland,\u201d he said, and was simply conducting \u201ca scientific evaluation of the quality of work.\u201d\u201cNobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered,\u201d he said. Mr. McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and \u201csee if the accusations are sustained\u201d before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award.The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them.The Advertising Research Foundation, which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected, said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information.

{"Headline": "A Quiet Exodus: Why Black Worshipers Are Leaving White Evangelical Churches", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFORT WORTH \u2014 Charmaine Pruitt wrote the names of 12 churches on a sheet of paper, tore the paper into 12 strips, and dropped them into a Ziploc bag. It was Sunday morning and time to pick which church to attend.This time of the week two years earlier, there would have been no question. Ms. Pruitt, 46, would have been getting ready for her regular Saturday afternoon worship service, at a former grocery store overhauled into a state-of-the-art, 760-seat sanctuary. In the darkened hall, where it would have been hard to tell she was one of the few black people in the room, she would have listened to the soaring anthems of the praise bands. She would have watched, on three giant screens, a sermon that over the course of a weekend would reach one of the largest congregations in the country.But Ms. Pruitt has not been to that church since the fall of 2016. That was when she concluded that it was not, ultimately, meant for people like her. She has not been to any church regularly since.Ms. Pruitt pulled one of the slips out of the Ziploc bag. Mount Olive Fort Worth. O.K. That was where she would go that day.In the last couple of decades, there had been signs, however modest, that eleven o\u2019clock on Sunday morning might cease to be the most segregated hour in America. \u201cRacial reconciliation\u201d was the talk of conferences and the subject of formal resolutions. Large Christian ministries were dedicated to the aim of integration, and many black Christians decided to join white-majority congregations. Some went as missionaries, called by God to integrate. Others were simply drawn to a different worship style \u2014 short, conveniently timed services that emphasized a personal connection to God.The fruits could be seen if you looked in the right places, particularly within the kind of nondenominational megachurches that gleam from the roadsides here in the sprawl of Dallas-Fort Worth. In 2012, according to a report from the National Congregation Study, more than two-thirds of those attending white-majority churches were worshiping alongside at least some black congregants, a notable increase since a similar survey in 1998. This was more likely to be the case in evangelical churches than in mainline Protestant churches, and more likely in larger ones than in smaller ones.Then came the 2016 election.Black congregants \u2014 as recounted by people in Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Fort Worth and elsewhere \u2014 had already grown uneasy in recent years as they watched their white pastors fail to address police shootings of African-Americans. They heard prayers for Paris, for Brussels, for law enforcement; they heard that one should keep one\u2019s eyes on the kingdom, that the church was colorblind, and that talk of racial injustice was divisive, not a matter of the gospel. There was still some hope that this stemmed from an obliviousness rather than some deeper disconnect.Then white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump by a larger margin than they had voted for any presidential candidate. They cheered the outcome, reassuring uneasy fellow worshipers with talk of abortion and religious liberty, about how politics is the art of compromise rather than the ideal. Christians of color, even those who shared these policy preferences, looked at Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Mexican immigrants, his open hostility to N.F.L. players protesting police brutality and his earlier \u201cbirther\u201d crusade against President Obama, claiming falsely he was not a United States citizen. In this political deal, many concluded, they were the compromised.\u201cIt said, to me, that something is profoundly wrong at the heart of the white church,\u201d said Chanequa Walker-Barnes, a professor of practical theology at the McAfee School of Theology at Mercer University in Atlanta.Early last year, Professor Walker-Barnes left the white-majority church where she had been on staff. Like an untold number of black Christians around the country, many of whom had left behind black-majority churches, she is not sure where she belongs anymore.\u201cWe were willing to give up our preferred worship style for the chance to really try to live this vision of beloved community with a diverse group of people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cEverything we tried is not working,\u201d said Michael Emerson, the author of \u201cDivided by Faith,\u201d a seminal work on race relations within the evangelical church. \u201cThe election itself was the single most harmful event to the whole movement of reconciliation in at least the past 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about to completely break apart.\u201dMs. Pruitt had been a churchgoing Christian since the mid-1990s, first joining a mostly black megachurch in Dallas, where she was on the dance team. Inspiration began to flag after some years there, and one night she was drawn to a pastor whom she saw on television. He was, she later learned, Robert Morris of Gateway Church.Gateway started nearly 20 years ago with a prayer group in Pastor Morris\u2019s living room, and has in the past two decades grown to become a $140 million ministry, drawing upward of 31,000 people a week to six campuses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.The scale and thoroughness of the operation are extraordinary: the attractive ledgestone-and-wood arena \u2014 with a coffee kiosk serving a Gateway blend \u2014 at the church\u2019s Southlake, Tex., headquarters; the worship music booming over a first-class sound system; the robust programs for children, single parents and a host of other groups.Above all, for many members, there are Pastor Morris\u2019s weekly messages themselves: wry, often self-deprecating, sprinkled with biblical scholarship and often affectingly personal.\u201cThis is what I need right now,\u201d thought Ms. Pruitt, moved to tears when she first went to orientation programs at the church. Members who happened to sit near her at worship came to ask about her when she missed a service, and some came to her grandmother\u2019s wake. One couple began to refer to her as a daughter.The congregation is mostly white, but not entirely; the pastors at two of the six satellite campuses are black men. Church videos and promotional materials are intentionally filled with people of color. The goal, says Pastor Morris, who is white and has a black son-in-law, is to have a church that looks like heaven as described in the book of Revelation: \u201cfrom every nation, tribe, people and language.\u201dThe general whiteness of the congregation is not something that every black worshiper dwells on anyway. To grow up black, said Carla McKissic Smith, who started going to Gateway in 2009, is to get used to being in the minority.As the headlines of the outside world turned to police shootings and protest, little changed inside majority-white churches. Black congregants said that beyond the occasional vague prayer for healing a divided country, or a donation drive for law enforcement, they heard nothing.Tamice Namae Spencer, who used to attend a mostly white church in Kansas City, said her fellow congregants did not seem to even know the name Trayvon Martin, the black teenager killed in Florida at the hands of George Zimmerman in 2012. And when Ms. Spencer brought up his death, she said white church members asked why she was being divisive.\u201cIt\u2019s not even on your radar and I can\u2019t sleep over it,\u201d she remembered thinking. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019m being vocal, you think I\u2019ve changed.\u201dAt Gateway, black worshipers would discreetly ask one another if they were the only ones who noticed that one could talk about seemingly anything but racism, a feeling one former congregant described as an out-of-body experience.Jeremiah White, who is black, was so excited about Gateway when a friend brought him there years earlier that he insisted his parents come. Now a teenager, with his parents volunteering at the church for 12-hour days on weekends, Jeremiah had also begun to notice \u201cthe little details\u201d: an associate pastor, trying to get the attention of a black man, jokingly referring to him as the one God left in the oven a little long; a youth leader suggesting Jeremiah must be new because he was black.In the summer of 2016, Jeremiah made a cartoon and sent it to church leaders, depicting an elephant sitting on a man, squeezing out his insides. The elephant was labeled \u201cRacism\u201d; the man\u2019s insides were labeled \u201cGateway Church.\u201dPastor Morris had become aware of the disquiet himself, mainly from listening to black pastors at other churches. Still, while they would meet and talk and pray, not a lot would happen.\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it much before because we didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said of whites generally, in a recent interview at one of Gateway\u2019s satellite campuses. \u201cWe just thought, \u2018O.K. there was a tremendous racial problem in America. The civil rights movement came, laws have been passed now and we\u2019re over that now. We passed it.\u2019 What has happened in the last few years is many white pastors are beginning to realize we never dealt with this scripturally. We never truly repented.\u201dIn July 2016, days after a black man enraged about police brutality shot and killed five Dallas police officers, Jeremiah\u2019s father had breakfast with one of the church\u2019s senior pastors. He spoke to him frankly about race and his frustration with the church\u2019s silence.After that breakfast, church staff began discussing how to face matters directly. In meetings over the coming weeks, black staff members would talk of their own past struggles with racism and the grim parts of American history that still went unacknowledged. A pastor at Ms. Pruitt\u2019s church campus pledged from the pulpit to tear down racism, one conversation at a time.Then, the next month, Pastor Morris preached a message entitled \u201cStill.\u201d It began with a series of qualifications. God is still in control. There is no perfect political candidate. Voting is choosing the lesser of evils. Yes, there is gender inequality. And yes, there is a race problem in the country, though racism, implying hate, is not the right word. Pastor Morris said it was a subtler problem of prejudice.Then he focused attention on the upcoming presidential race.\u201cThe election,\u201d he said, \u201cis extremely important.\u201dThe country is in trouble financially; a critical Supreme Court appointment awaits; one of the major parties advocates using \u201ctaxpayer dollars, your dollars,\u201d for abortion. Evangelical Christians sit at home on Election Days, while \u201cthose who are trying to change our Constitution\u201d go to the polls, and look at what happens: Prayer is taken out of the schools.\u201cWe are going the wrong way,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe need to get involved, we need to pray and we need to vote.\u201dHe never said to vote for Mr. Trump. But the implication in the sermon, and in the leaflets that were handed out at church, was lost on no one: that one must vote to uphold Christian values, and that the Republican Party platform reflected those values. And Mr. Trump was the Republican candidate.Ms. Pruitt sent messages to several white couples she had befriended at the church, telling them she was going to take some time off. She had become uneasy at a church, she told them, that speaks of overcoming racism on one Sunday \u201cand then turns around later and asks me to support\u201d Trump, who she believed was \u201ca racist candidate.\u201dOne of the couples invited her to come to their house. Sitting in the living room over a plate of brownies, Ms. Pruitt explained to the wife how disturbed she had been by the clear inference from the pulpit that she should support a candidate whose behavior and rhetoric were so offensive that she could not bring herself even to say his name.The woman explained that a Trump victory had been prophesied and handed Ms. Pruitt a two-page printout, which began: \u201cThe Spirit of God says, \u2018I have chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this.\u2019\u201d Barack Obama, the woman continued, should never have been president, since he was not born a United States citizen. The visit ended with the woman suggesting that Ms. Pruitt\u2019s discomfort at the church was God telling her it was time to move on.Ms. Pruitt never went back.Jeremiah\u2019s family also left for good that summer, though he has heard that pictures of them still show up in church videos. They have not found a church since.One young black woman who had been going to Gateway for some years said she has begun exploring Ethiopian Christian traditions. Another woman, a former church staff member who still goes to Gateway, cut back her attendance from five days a week to once a month, if that, and is now praying for guidance on whether to leave altogether.Carla McKissic Smith stayed until one Sunday in March 2017, when a guest speaker, a messianic rabbi from New Jersey, spoke of the 2016 election from the pulpit, saying that it \u201cthreatened to seal the acceleration of America\u2019s apostasy,\u201d but that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was the fulfillment of God\u2019s covenant with Israel. \u201cIt was not the Russian intervention that determined it,\u201d he said to a congregation that frequently broke into applause and cheers. \u201cThe intervention was a bit higher.\u201dThree months later, Ms. Smith\u2019s father, the Rev. Dwight McKissic of Cornerstone Baptist Church in Dallas, would introduce a resolution condemning the alt-right at the annual Southern Baptist Convention in Phoenix. Unlike the resolutions condemning gambling and Planned Parenthood, his alt-right resolution didn\u2019t make it out of committee.\u201cAt that point,\u201d Ms. Smith said, \u201cI was no longer surprised.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s win, which one elder at Gateway described as a \u201csupernatural answer to prayer,\u201d generated a frisson of excitement at the church. Pastor Morris told the congregation that he was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s faith advisers. The church was a sponsor of an inaugural ball in January 2017.Jelani Lewis, one of the two black campus pastors, knew this was creating unease among many black members of Gateway. A black deacon approached him at one point and asked how he should reconcile his trust in Pastor Morris with \u201csome of the things that I\u2019m seeing from the current president.\u201d We trust in God, Pastor Lewis assured him, and we can trust in the heart of our pastor.As a tumultuous 2017 unfolded, Pastor Morris understood that some wanted him to address race directly.\u201cAs I prayed about it as I talked with black pastor friends of mine, I realized I don\u2019t really understand the depth of the pain they feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is personal to them \u2014 it was history to me. I would talk to my friend and it was personal to him because it was his great-grandfather.\u201dIn October 2017, he preached a message entitled \u201cA Lack of Understanding.\u201d Addressing \u201call the ignorant white people,\u201d and acknowledging his own past grappling with prejudice, the pastor listed reasons that racism was evil \u2014 among them that it was an affront to God\u2019s creation, given that Adam and Eve were probably brown-skinned. A video played of a black pastor talking of the racism he experienced as a child in East St. Louis in the 1960s. Pastor Morris concluded by urging people of color in the congregation to spread out and pray with whites in small groups.The response, Pastor Morris said, was \u201coverwhelmingly positive,\u201d and indeed the reaction on Facebook suggests as much. Pastor Lewis remembers a black woman weeping in her seat, and was thankful that he finally had an answer for black worshipers questioning how their church truly felt about racism.On Facebook some white congregants were angered at the sermon, especially at the focus on white people as the root of the problem.\u201cI believe Robert spoke from his flesh in this message,\u201d one of them, Steve Groebe, later recalled in a Facebook message. \u201cI gave him another week to correct the message and make it biblical. I didn\u2019t feel he did that so I left the church.\u201dThe message was not better received among the black worshipers who had already left the church. It did not, several said, address the enduring structural legacy of racism, instead adhering to the usual evangelical focus on individual prejudice. Most significantly, they said, it gave no sense that Pastor Morris had ever wrestled with his support of Donald Trump.\u201cI wasn\u2019t wrestling,\u201d Pastor Morris said of his feelings in 2016, going on to explain that he was not wrestling now, either. \u201cWe were electing what we felt was the person who held the values that the church loves dearly the most. That doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s perfect. But I do believe after spending time with him that he really wants to learn, that he really wants to do a good job for all Americans. I really do.\u201dThere are larger racial injustices in the country, he said, and those injustices need to be fixed \u2014 though not in ways that would enable dependence, he clarified, but rather to \u201cgive people a hand up, not a handout.\u201d He noted the low black unemployment rate under Mr. Trump. The answer to racism lies primarily in the church, not the government, he said, and now that white pastors are waking up to the pain that black people have felt, it is in many ways a hopeful time.\u201cI think that there\u2019s an anger and a hurt right now, and a fear,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think that people are going to get past that.\u201dThere is now a team at the church focused exclusively on making the church more diverse. On the weekend before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a 49-second video of excerpts from King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech was played at worship services \u2014 \u201ca monumental moment in Gateway church history,\u201d one pastor said, the first time that the day had been acknowledged.When Ms. Pruitt arrived at Mount Olive, the service had already begun, with a 26-person choir singing a gospel hymn, accompanied by a drummer and a man on a Hammond organ. This was one of the first churches she had attended for worship in a year and a half. She had kept giving tithe money to Gateway for some months after she stopped going, but after learning about the inaugural ball, started donating to another church. On most Sundays she had stayed at home, watching services online.The sanctuary at Mount Olive was brightly lit, and the one video screen advertised an essay contest for Black History Month. The congregation was older and more formally dressed than those of many megachurches. But for two young white men, all the worshipers were African-American.The Rev. William Timothy Glynn, wearing a sharply knotted necktie and a silk pocket square, began his message, on Elisha\u2019s taking up the mantle of the prophet Elijah. It was less a sermon, he acknowledged, and more a collection of observations; among them was that we inherit things from the past for a reason, and thus should not quickly discard them.\u201cWe live in this day where they want to throw what grandma had out the window; that\u2019s old and that\u2019s fogy and we don\u2019t have church like that no more, and we don\u2019t like that no more, amen?\u201d Pastor Glynn half sang. \u201cHave you ever thought about what their religion got them through? It got them through slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, from the back of the bus to the front of the bus. It brought them through everything anybody could throw and that\u2019s all they had. It built churches and schools and hospitals. Millions? They didn\u2019t have thousands! They had nickels and dimes!\u201dService ended in just under two hours. Ms. Pruitt needed to go pick up her mother, who was finishing her shift as a police dispatcher. On the way she drove out of Fort Worth, past a little community founded by a group of emancipated slaves, near the headquarters of an international ministry run by a Gateway elder. Then, with her mother, she went back to the house they share in a quiet neighborhood named after a Confederate major.The next week Ms. Pruitt considered the other 11 churches on the list, and on Sunday, she tried someplace new.Advertisement"}

The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users\u2019 identities, friend networks and \u201clikes.\u201d The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.The technique had been developed at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.Facebook said no passwords or \u201csensitive pieces of information\u201d had been taken, though information about a user\u2019s location was available to Cambridge.But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred \u201cto any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.\u201d It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan\u2019s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan\u2019s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.Facebook also said: \u201cSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\u201dFacebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.\u25a0 In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook\u2019s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.\u25a0 A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook\u2019s ties to Cambridge Analytica.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks Amazon, Saying It Does Not Pay Enough Taxes", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump escalated his attack on Amazon on Thursday, saying in an early-morning tweet that the online retail behemoth does not pay enough taxes \u2014 and strongly suggesting that he may use the power of his office to rein in the nation\u2019s largest e-commerce business.Mr. Trump accused Amazon, one of the country\u2019s most recognizable and successful brands, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and said the company was using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201dThe president has lashed out publicly against the giant company and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, on Twitter more than a dozen times since 2015. And privately, people close to him said, Mr. Trump repeatedly brings up his disdain for the company, often set off by his anger at negative stories in The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos.By focusing on the threat to small businesses, Mr. Trump has touched on the unease of Amazon\u2019s disruptive force. The company has changed industries as varied as publishing, groceries and health care. That has helped the company grow to be worth more than $700 billion, but it has also made it a convenient target.The president has little clear authority to take action against the company. Some Amazon critics have suggested antitrust actions against the company, but the moves would need to come from the independent Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department, where officials have promised to keep politics out of its corporate competition cases.Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.\u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201dAnd far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201dThe Post declined to comment.One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.Michael D. Shear and Cecilia Kang reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from Seattle. Katie Rogers and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

However, a key point is not being mentioned: The formulas developed by Cambridge Analytica to explain and predict people\u2019s personality traits and behaviors are most likely hogwash.For over 40 years I have worked for academic and public and private sector organizations as a specialist in personality assessment for the purpose of explaining and predicting behaviors.In all of my endeavors I have never achieved anything close to the level of explanatory and predictive robustness claimed by Cambridge Analytica, despite using an arsenal of data collected, with permission, from all job applicants.Therefore, in my opinion, Cambridge Analytica most likely \u201csold a bill of goods\u201d to the Trump campaign, using mountains of correlation data.

Tillerson has a set of diplomatic tools that he and aides use at nearly every stop.There\u2019s the shrug or dismissive laugh when he is trolled or overshadowed by Russia or China, rivals the Trump administration has yet to develop a coherent strategy to contain or surmount.And there\u2019s the signature pause that follows when his aides are asked why he has yet again failed to schedule a meeting during his trip with opposition or rival political leaders \u2014 the kind of encounters past secretaries of state routinely undertook to emphasize the importance of pluralism, and to hedge against sudden changes in government.\u201cThe United States commitment to Africa is quite clear in terms of the importance we place on the relationship,\u201d he said.For his part, Mr. Faki said, \u201cI believe this incident is of the past, and with the visit of Secretary of State Tillerson, and the evidence of the relations between Africa and the United States is personified through his visit.\u201dYet again Mr. Tillerson warned Thursday against Chinese investment. But with the Trump administration slashing assistance programs in Africa just as the Chinese are ramping up investments, he got as prickly a response in Ethiopia to his China-bashing as he had in South America.China has invested $15 billion in Ethiopia in recent years compared to about $550 million by the United States. Besides the African Union\u2019s headquarters, China has built a light-rail system, a vast ring road and a host of other structures in Addis Ababa.\u201cI think Africans are mature enough to engage in partnerships of their own volition,\u201d Mr. Faki said.Mr. Tillerson also got trolled by Russian officials.Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, was in Ethiopia at the same time as Mr. Tillerson and even stayed at the same hotel. The Russians insisted on social media that they had asked for a meeting between the two but had been rebuffed.In a news conference, Mr. Tillerson dismissed the Russian taunts as \u201csilly,\u201d saying he had met with Mr. Lavrov more times than he could remember and that the two knew each other\u2019s phone numbers.Mr. Tillerson could hardly complain about her exclusion \u2014 since he has often refused to include ambassadors in his own meetings with top foreign officials. But Mr. Kushner\u2019s continued efforts to serve as the administration\u2019s intermediary in crucial foreign relations have undercut Mr. Tillerson\u2019s authority.Mr. Tillerson is out of Washington just as South Korean officials fly in to brief their American counterparts about their talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The administration\u2019s pressure campaign against North Korea is one of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s signature efforts, something he mentions all the time.But fence-mending was needed in Africa, where Mr. Tillerson is making a five-nation tour. He arrived in Ethiopia just as this country has plunged into political turmoil. A police state with a democratic veneer, Ethiopia is buffeted by violent clashes in diverse ethnic enclaves where activists are demanding political and economic reform. The government recently declared a state of emergency.After his meetings at the African Union, Mr. Tillerson rode by motorcade across town to meet Hailemariam Desalegn, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, and Workneh Gebeyehu, the foreign minister.In a news conference with Mr. Gebeyehu, Mr. Tillerson said that while North Korea had sent \u201cpotentially positive signals\u201d in talks with Seoul, Washington and Pyongyang remained \u201ca long ways from negotiations.\u201d\u201cThe first step is to have some kind of talks about talks,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streaming Soon: A Fight Over AT&T, Time Warner, and the Future of TV", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 How you watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN is about to have its day in court.The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&T\u2019s nationwide mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner\u2019s huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT. The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers \u2014 in the media industry and beyond \u2014 will be permitted in the years to come.\u201cThis court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,\u201d said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. \u201cThis case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.\u201dUnless the two sides settle \u2014 and there have been no signs of that happening \u2014 the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country\u2019s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks \u2014 and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.The Justice Department argues that the merged company\u2019s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls \u201cmust-watch\u201d programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.The government\u2019s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming \u2014 the same combination that AT&T is seeking \u2014 would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast\u2019s holdings.\u201cEither important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,\u201d the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. \u201cOr it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.\u201dAT&T scoffs at the government\u2019s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government\u2019s theory that it would withhold content, AT&T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.AT&T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.\u201cThe new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,\u201d AT&T said in its pretrial brief.The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&T\u2019s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don\u2019t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.Streaming competition is the \u201cbest hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,\u201d said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government\u2019s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.\u201cThe government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,\u201d said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.AT&T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference \u2014 which it described as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 from the case.But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.The decision to block a merger between companies that don\u2019t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals \u2014 getting companies to promise they\u2019ll be on their best behavior \u2014 is not effective.That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS\u2019s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna \u2014 as well as proposed media deals like Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.\u201cThis could direct the future path of the industry,\u201d said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. \u201cIf it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The result is what some people consider Beijing\u2019s best Peking duck. This is a magical combination of words. \u201cBeijing\u2019s best Peking duck\u201d suggests a mandatory eating experience in a way that, say, \u201cRussia\u2019s best Russian dressing\u201d does not.It took me and my first corps of volunteers some time to find one another because the restaurant\u2019s address, 3 Bryant Park, implied that the entrance would be somewhere around Bryant Park. DaDong is inside a stack of glass-and-steel blocks that has somehow been plunked down west of the park between 42nd and 41st Streets, beside a pocket plaza that was new to me, although the skateboarders seemed to know all about it.In this room, it is not exactly shocking to learn that the usual Peking duck garnishes may be supplemented with 10 grams of caviar for $42. In lieu of toast points, servers recommend a shard of skin. If you skip the fish eggs, they will tell you there are three ways to eat the duck: wrapped in one of the very thin and tender pancakes with scallions and a smear of sweet soy-black bean sauce (great stuff); poked into a round sesame puff with julienned cucumber and melon, raw garlic paste and the black bean sauce; and finally, dipped in a small pile of sugar, recommended for the skin alone.This kept everybody busy for some time. The bird was precisely carved, as if by a laser. None of us had seen crisper skin \u2014 you could bounce a quarter off it. The dip didn\u2019t improve it, but it is always nice to find a new use for sugar.The meat didn\u2019t make as firm an impression. It made very little impression at all, apart from my strong sense that there ought to have been more of it. Tasted on its own, it reminded me a bit of the lean, whitish, noncommittal supermarket pork chops I grew up on. Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor.It was dry, too.New York City being a lush jungle of regulations, DaDong was forced to convert its wood-burning ovens to gas. Smoke might have added some flavor, but something seems to be lacking in the birds themselves, members of the Pekin breed raised on a farm in Indiana with special instructions to keep them lean, the way Mr. Dong prefers them.Unfortunately, DaDong\u2019s problems don\u2019t end with the duck. The menu in New York has been trimmed down considerably from the 280-page book presented to diners in Beijing, but it is still rife with dishes that are dead on arrival.Kung pao shrimp with beet coins and raw mushrooms tasted like ketchup. Sweet-and-sour pork ribs with preserved plums were as sweet as if they\u2019d been stewed in Dr Pepper, and a dusting of powdered sugar at the table didn\u2019t help.Little teepees of Ib\u00e9rico ham came wrapped around cold, dry wads of sticky rice. Champagne-glazed tomatoes were sweet enough to serve for dessert, and the \u201ccrispy mushroom salad\u201d they were stuffed with wasn\u2019t crisp and didn\u2019t particularly taste like mushrooms.A perfectly clear globe of ice, to be cracked with a spoon, kept soy-marinated ribbons of geoduck deliciously cold. Braised sea cucumber in a glossy soy-based sauce hit all the right sticky and soft marks.My favorite dish may be the seafood variation on the Sichuan classic Chongqing chicken called Hot and Spicy Lobster: a cut-up lobster stir-fried with nearly enough dried chiles to fill a pillowcase. A close second is the baby cabbage, sliced into threads and braised with chestnuts in saffron sauce.Whatever is causing the kitchen\u2019s reach-grasp ratio to break down doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the desserts. There is a fine plate of Beijing snacks, dense little half-sweet cakes made of lotus root, red beans, yellow split peas and so on. I enjoyed popping tiny seashells of white chocolate into my mouth to find out what each was filled with: Nutmeg? Tangerine? Wasabi? The simplest, though, the ice cream with an alluringly bitter edge of dried tangerine peel, was also the most rewarding.Servers sometimes seemed to be reading dish descriptions from a teleprompter, but they made up for that with a care and attentiveness that felt unforced. The sommeliers were particularly good at interpreting the wine list, which is well-rounded and can be quite reasonable. This list would get your attention almost anywhere, but in a Chinese restaurant in New York, it\u2019s a treasure.But even the most gently priced bottle can go only so far to smooth over the potholes on the menu, and the suspicion that the best Peking duck in Beijing has turned into something that would struggle to stand out in Parsippany.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

He shows no desire to leave the stage and every intention of breaking David Ben-Gurion\u2019s longevity mark by serving out his term.Yet there also hovered over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s trip the vaguely valedictory sense that this outwardly triumphal visit to the United States\u2019 political and media capitals, places where he has grown accustomed to a conquering hero\u2019s reception, could turn out to be his last as prime minister.The Israeli police have recommended bribery charges against him. Former confidants are lining up to testify against him and his wife. A criminal prosecution seems only a matter of when, not if.

But it also was a reminder that Mr. Netanyahu, once an architecture major at M.I.T. but never a lawyer, has little experience building criminal cases.Perhaps the clearest indicator of the dual audiences and agendas of this trip were the differences between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s remarks in English and Hebrew.Addressing American audiences in English, Mr. Netanyahu beat the drum, steadily and loudly, for confrontation with Iran, over its ambitions in the Middle East and over a nuclear deal that he implored Mr. Trump to \u201cfully fix or fully nix,\u201d lest Tehran acquire weapons with which it could threaten the entire world.In English, he whittled his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict down to a blunt end: \u201cThe Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, except the powers that threaten us,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cDoes that constitute a state or doesn\u2019t it constitute a state? Whatever.\u201dAnd in English, Mr. Netanyahu trumpeted Israel\u2019s and, by implication, his achievements: Establishing diplomatic relations and reaching trade deals across the globe, saving the lives of other nations\u2019 innocents through peerless intelligence collection, and using drones and computers to fine-tune agricultural irrigation down to the individual plant.Speaking to the Israeli news media in Hebrew, by contrast, Mr. Netanyahu played the victim and continued his monthslong assault on the credibility and motives of Israeli law enforcement.\u201cThey take them into detention, terrify them and tell them: \u2018Your life is over, your family\u2019s life is over,\u2019\u201d the prime minister complained in the video. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll take everything from you, including your freedom. You want to get out of this? There\u2019s one way \u2014 smear Netanyahu. It doesn\u2019t matter if you tell the truth \u2014 the main thing is you smear Netanyahu.\u2019\u201dOn Thursday, at the United Nations for a meeting with Ambassador Nikki Haley, Mr. Netanyahu was asked if he wanted to retract that attack. \u201cI can say one thing: We\u2019re being attacked all the time,\u201d he said in Hebrew. \u201cEvery hour, every minute. The prime minister is also allowed to insist on justice.\u201dAnd he nodded to the polls. \u201cThe citizens of Israel, in large numbers \u2014 not everyone, but in large numbers \u2014 have given their support to me and my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want justice.\u201dIndeed, a brewing political dispute back home threatened to provide an excuse for him to call early elections, a turn that could well result in a public vote of confidence and perhaps enough popular wind at his back to withstand calls for him to resign if he is ultimately indicted.By the time he wrapped up his visit and headed home, the coalition crisis seemed to be resolving itself, with members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government saying the only way elections would be sped up was if the prime minister insisted on it.At the same time, the opposition leader, Isaac Herzog of the left-leaning Zionist Union, was floating the idea of a unity government without Mr. Netanyahu as prime minister.That proposal seemed far-fetched, or at least premature, but there was poignancy to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s reception in the United States \u2014 particularly as he prepared to return home to unkind headlines and a drumbeat not his own.Asked how he thought Israelis were viewing his trip, Mr. Netanyahu expressed optimism that his statesmanship was getting across.\u201cI think they see the things that I say, they hear the things that I say, they see the reception that I receive,\u201d he said aboard his El Al jet, before leaving Washington on Wednesday. \u201cI think people have a very strong and clear impression of Israel\u2019s position in the world, in the United States \u2014 and my position in the United States, and in the world.\u201dHe said it in English.Advertisement"}

You could have one up to maybe two inches falling an hour,\u201d she said.Traveling during the evening commute will be very difficult to impossible, according to the National Weather Service.This is the fourth nor\u2019easter in the last three weeks, and it has the potential to drop the most snow this month in the area. However, New York City may see less on the streets.\u201cThere\u2019s so much activity in the city, it will have trouble sticking,\u201d Ms. Buccola said, \u201cIt will make the roads wet, but people in the city might not see that much snow accumulating.\u201dStill, you might want to pull out your snow boots.Here\u2019s what else is happening:In anticipation of the ritual cleaning that comes with the season, we wanted to meet the two New Yorkers doing more than most to keep our city pest-free.Nemo and his partner, Mickey, both pint-size beagles, are the only two canine members of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s code enforcement team. Their job: track down bedbugs with their highly trained noses.We met Nemo yesterday after he was picked up from Biscuits and Bath on the Upper East Side, where he lives, and before he and his handler of six years, David Trevino, headed out for their first inspection of the week.The canine unit is dispatched to city apartments after a resident complains to 311 about a possible infestation.Once Nemo arrives, and after a few belly rubs from adoring children, he gets to work with the command: \u201cFind the bugs!\u201dHe\u2019s trained to pick up the scent of bedbugs, and only bedbugs, and he scours headboards, couches and corners for the little bloodsucking critters.

A Bil-Jac chicken liver treat.But Mr. Trevino defended his co-worker. Instead of exploring an entire apartment, he said, the dogs help him narrow his search.And they are fast. An inspection takes about 20 minutes, or a matter of seconds if it\u2019s a full-blown infestation.\u201cThat\u2019s when the dog walks in and is like, \u2018Whoa,\u2019\u201d he said, mimicking Nemo by throwing his head back and crinkling his nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll look at me like, \u2018What do you need me for?\u2019\u201dThe number of bedbug complaints dropped last year to 8,113, from 9,618 in 2016, but the dogs are still used for about 10 inspections a day.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Surveillance Machine", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon\u2019s \u201cMechanical Turk\u201d platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife.About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app \u201cscraped\u201d information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends\u2019 profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica.A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn\u2019t installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook\u2019s true customers, whom it works hard to please.Facebook doesn\u2019t just record every click and \u201clike\u201d on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases \u201cexternal\u201d data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge \u201coffline\u201d data \u2014 things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store \u2014 with its vast online databases.Facebook even creates \u201cshadow profiles\u201d of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States.Despite Facebook\u2019s claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her \u201cconsent\u201d \u2014 at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off.Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person\u2019s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook \u201clikes\u201d \u2014 and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual \u2014 especially since it is practically irrevocable.What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company\u2019s operations in the 2016 presidential election.If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn\u2019t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn\u2019t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone\u2019s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.Advertisement"}

On it, apart from my biographical details and a photograph, there is a drawing of the Khyber Pass and the abbreviation N.W.A., for North Waziristan Agency. It marks me and other residents of the region as separate from the full citizens of Pakistan.In the aftermath of Mr. Mehsud\u2019s death, as accusations mounted that the gunfight in which he was said to have died had actually been staged by the police, thousands of young Pashtuns began marching in protest to Islamabad, the capital.Most people in the area were subsistence farmers, cultivating wheat in winters and corn in summers. Some ran small stores in Mir Ali, a nearby town of about 20,000. The economic precariousness forced a substantial number of men to leave for distant lands as migrant workers. I was 5 when my father left for Dubai to work as a laborer.I lived with my mother, a sister and a brother in a mud-brick house. Our days began with the morning call to prayer. After the prayers we returned home and drank tea with milk. Pakistan might have had a nuclear bomb, but my people couldn\u2019t afford breakfast.In the summer of 2001, my father returned home from Dubai after seven years. He set up a shop in the Mir Ali bazaar, buying and selling automobile tires. He spoke wistfully of the doctors and engineers he had met in Dubai. He hoped I would study to be a doctor.My father worried that I would get caught up in the war. In the spring of 2004, I left my village with him to attend high school in Peshawar, the largest city in northwestern Pakistan. Every day I wondered whether my family and friends back home were alive, whether they were safe. Newspapers ran cryptic reports about the violence and the deaths in Waziristan. Phones remained cut off for weeks.I witnessed my first drone strike when I was home for summer holidays in 2009. One night I was sleeping on a cot under the starlit sky, when a fierce explosion woke me up. I tried to collect myself. My uncle shouted: \u201cDrone! A drone attack!\u201d Two more explosions followed. My uncle led me to the village square where people had gathered.Villagers had seen a ball of light and fire rise from the house hit by the missile fired from the drone. Normally, we would rush there to help. Yet fear of another drone strike kept us from making the short journey, from picking up the remains of the dead and transporting the injured to a hospital. I saw the corpses of three militants in the morning when the funeral was held. The missile had shredded their bodies. I couldn\u2019t sleep for days.The war continued. After graduating from high school in Peshawar, I moved to a public college in Lahore in 2010 to study literature. The seductive, sprawling metropolis of Lahore was strikingly different from the war-ravaged Peshawar and Waziristan.One night several policemen barged into my dorm room, which I shared with three other students, ethnic Punjabis. After the policemen looked at our identity cards, they took me aside and rifled through my books and my belongings for incriminating evidence.Yet I made new friends, found inspiring teachers and went to diverse social and academic gatherings in Lahore. A new world seemed possible.A week later I visited Bannu, the town closest to the tribal areas. Families displaced from villages in Waziristan filled the road leading into town. Carcasses of cows, goats and sheep, which had died of thirst in the punishing heat, were rotting by the highway. Malaria and other diseases spread in the camps for the displaced outside the town because of open sewers and mosquitoes. Most of the displaced lived in those difficult conditions for two to three years.We boarded a military pickup truck going to Mir Ali. Along the way were the remains of the years of fighting: burned-out mud huts, houses disfigured by bullets and artillery fire.About half an hour later, we entered a vast flattened area strewn with debris. It was the town of Mir Ali. The grocery stores, vegetable and tea stalls and bookshops I had grown up with were dust. I spotted the plot where my father\u2019s shop once stood. Workers were carrying away the rubble. Bricks, iron rods, broken furniture and my memories were being carried off in a truck, to be resold in a nearby town. Every signpost of my personal geography had been destroyed.It was already dusk when I reached my home in Khushaly, about five miles from the town. A family whose house had been destroyed in aerial bombing was camping out there. After his shop was destroyed, my father had decided not to return. I stayed with relatives and heard tales of horror and suffering. The absence of hope marked our conversations.The protesters chanted the refrain of a song about our status as unequal citizens in the independent Islamic Republic of Pakistan: \u201cWhat sort of independence is this? What sort of independence is this?\u201dRaza Wazir is a writer from Waziristan.Advertisement"}

Her friends and family never heard from her again, prompting the police to start what became an expansive investigation that spread out from Los Angeles to the foothills of the Sierra Mountains to Colorado.The search ended on Tuesday. Along a creek in the Spenceville Wildlife Area, detectives recovered a person\u2019s remains in a shallow grave in a vast nature reserve in Nevada County, about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. While the coroner\u2019s office has yet to identify the body, the police believe the remains belong to Ms. Shabani, Capt. William P. Hayes of the Los Angeles Police Department said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.Shortly after her friends officially reported her missing on Feb. 25, the police focused on her boyfriend, Christopher Spotz, who was seen leaving the apartment with her. According to the police, Mr. Spotz, 33, who was engaged to another woman, told detectives that on Feb. 23, they stopped for coffee in Hollywood and then headed north for his father\u2019s home in a town outside Sacramento.But their road trip was cut short just miles outside Los Angeles, the police said he told them. The couple got into an argument, he said, and he let Ms. Shabani out of the car in Santa Clarita, a city about 25 miles from her apartment. However, detectives found no signs of Ms. Shabani in Santa Clarita or in Yuba County, where his father lives, Captain Hayes said on Tuesday.Around that same time in March, Mr. Spotz left California with his fianc\u00e9e for Fort Morgan, Colo. The Los Angeles Police Department alerted other police agencies that they were searching for Mr. Spotz and his Toyota Tacoma pickup truck.Last Thursday, San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s deputies spotted his pickup truck near Interstate 10 east of Los Angeles. They tried to stop him, but Mr. Spotz took off, leading them on a roughly 60-mile chase that ended when he fatally shot himself inside the truck, the police said.Captain Hayes said that despite the department\u2019s frantic search for Ms. Shabani in late February, she was most likely dead the same day she left her apartment or the next morning. \u201cSomething happened, and I believe it to be somewhat untoward \u2014 that there was foul play involved,\u201d he said at the news conference.Captain Hayes did not say how she died, though he noted that detectives believe Mr. Spotz played some role in her death, which was being investigated as a homicide. \u201cI do believe he was involved in it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He wants to make waves, which I think is important. He wants to cause a conversation, not in an angry way but in a helpful way.\u201dAt the Odeon, Mr. Picardi wore an outfit he referred to as his \u201cpajamas\u201d \u2014 midnight blue velvet pants and a matching shirt from the Sies Marjan label. Despite his swift rise at a company known for its Versailles-style office politics, Mr. Picardi said he was not the calculating sort. \u201cI\u2019m never making an effort to behave any differently or modify my behavior,\u201d he said over poached eggs and avocado.It is not difficult to see why Mr. Picardi \u2014 who goes by Phill, with two L\u2019s, thank you very much \u2014 has impressed his boss, particularly at a time when Cond\u00e9 Nast is looking for its next generation of (younger, cheaper) leaders. Even at his age, he is polished, with a repertoire of life-affirming stories. One of his go-tos: \u201cI got in trouble for bringing Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera CDs to second-grade class because I was in Catholic school and they freaked out and said it was too sexual and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s the point.\u2019\u201dDuring our interview, Mr. Picardi noted that Teen Vogue\u2019s monthly traffic under his team had gone from two million unique visitors to 12 million. \u201cNot to toot my own horn, that is very hard,\u201d he said. Traffic has since fallen, but his success has resonated inside One World Trade.\u201cPeople in the building are always referring to things that were instituted at Teen Vogue and now at Them,\u201d said Amy Astley, the editor of Architectural Digest and a former editor of Teen Vogue, who hired Mr. Picardi as an intern. \u201cI honestly think that people in the company wish him well and are not jealous of him and are learning from him.\u201dMr. Picardi grew up in North Andover, Mass. His father, a devout Catholic, owned a technology company. His mother was a homemaker and an executive assistant. He had four siblings, including a sister who used to paint his nails pink and a brother named John Paul, after the pope. Family dinners sometimes included Mr. Picardi\u2019s grandmother, who moved to America from a mountain village in Italy.\u201cMy dad used to pick the sausages out of the sauce and eat them with his fingers, and my mom would cry,\u201d Mr. Picardi said.It made for a sometimes challenging environment for the young Mr. Picardi. \u201cI was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cG.A.Y., with an exclamation mark and a little asterisk.\u201dHe came out to his parents in the summer before ninth grade. It was 2 in the morning, and Mr. Picardi, who had just finished watching \u201cQueer as Folk,\u201d burst into their bedroom and said: \u201cMom, Dad, I have something to tell you.\u201d His mother sobbed as he said everything he had to say. Ten minutes later, his father rolled over and asked what was going on. He had slept through it.His parents sent him to a Catholic therapist and instructed him not to tell his neighbors, his friends or his younger brother. But with his identity solidified, he began shaping his future. Before coming out, he had wanted to be a lawyer. Now, he decided, he should work in fashion.\u201cI watched \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 and that\u2019s what it felt like they were doing, more or less,\u201d he said.At a bookstore, he picked up copies of Out and Details. Then he saw it: Vogue.\u201cI picked up a copy of Vogue just because I was, like, I need to know about women\u2019s fashion now, because I\u2019m gay,\u201d he said. \u201cJack and Will make fun of everything Grace wears on \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 so I need to be like that.\u201d\u201cHe had the ability to make people do what he wanted them to do,\u201d said Carmen Lonero, a teacher who served as his adviser on the project. \u201cI always knew he was going to do something that was special.\u201dWhat set Mr. Picardi on a path toward working in magazines was a Vanity Fair cover story he read on Jennifer Aniston and the celebrity love triangle that involved Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.His duties have been expanded as Cond\u00e9 Nast is facing the financial challenges brought about by dwindling print circulations and listless ad sales. No longer a workplace of editors with plenty of leisure time and endless expense accounts, the company is surrendering to the economic realities and staccato rhythms of digital journalism.In this more parsimonious age, Mr. Picardi has emerged as the face of what Cond\u00e9 Nast calls its Next Gen network, which includes online titles like The Hive and Healthyish.Until recently, another rising star at the company was Ms. Welteroth, who was named the editor in chief of Teen Vogue in April. Not long after the announcement, Ms. Wintour asked Mr. Picardi to lunch. Over salmon, in a conference room in the building, she asked him what he wanted to do long term.\u201cI had a very pretty clear idea in my mind how he was going to answer, but I wanted it, obviously, to come from him,\u201d Ms. Wintour said.Mr. Picardi was not surprised by the question. \u201cI was ready for something new,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think she just sensed it.\u201dHe pitched her the idea for what would become Them.Ms. Wintour was interested. As the magazine business contracts, Cond\u00e9 Nast has been betting on less expensive, digital projects, and Them could serve as a template.\u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d Ms. Wintour said. \u201cIt just seemed like, yeah, this is right. This is what Cond\u00e9 Nast should be doing.\u201dFor anyone at the company or in the fashion world who had missed it, the bond between the Cond\u00e9 Nast artistic director and her new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 became all too clear in June at the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards dinner. Seated at Ms. Wintour\u2019s table in the Hammerstein Ballroom, along with Nicole Kidman, Tory Burch and Huma Abedin, and wearing a Bally summerweight suit the color of ros\u00e9, was Mr. Picardi.In November, Ms. Wintour stood at Mr. Picardi\u2019s side at a Cond\u00e9 Nast party held in honor of Them at Mission Chinese Food, a hip restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side. Among the guests were Chelsea Manning and Rose McGowan.The L.G.B.T.-centric platform is so new that it is hard to tell how it will fare. In its first three months, it attracted fewer than 1.5 million total unique visitors, according to internal data. Teen Vogue, though still enjoying its run as an online voice for progressive politics, has been unable to sustain its momentum. In the last three months of 2017, it drew on average fewer than six million monthly unique visitors.Mr. Picardi said he was unfazed. \u201cI think uniques are less and less a standard-bearer of success,\u201d he said. His plans for Teen Vogue include a restructuring that would have one team devoted to the latest news and another focused on features. He also said he would like to turn last year\u2019s outrage into action.\u201cBy quietly installing a white man at its helm, Teen Vogue, a platform seeking to empower young intersectional feminists, has arguably taken a step backwards,\u201d the author argued. (\u201cI think whoever wrote that is not looking at the person,\u201d Ms. Wintour said.)Mr. Picardi\u2019s flair for riding a cultural wave continues to win him key fans in the building. \u201cI think there\u2019s no end to his potential,\u201d Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cHe\u2019s innovative, he knows the marketplace, he knows young people, he knows all ages, he\u2019s not afraid, he\u2019s courageous, he\u2019s a brand-builder, he\u2019s a culture-driver. And it\u2019s just in his bones \u2014 it\u2019s not like you trained him. It\u2019s just there.\u201dWhen I asked Ms. Wintour if she thought Mr. Picardi could one day run Cond\u00e9 Nast, she did not swat away the question. \u201cFor Phill, anything is possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his road to take.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Humans of Quebec: Portraits of Those I Met on My Road Trip", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuebec Road TripSo, every day, Cory goes on the air at CKWE radio and utters one Algonquin word. Just one. On the day I visited, the word of the day was \u201cmigwan,\u201d which means feather in Algonquin.\u201cI invited some elders to the studio and they were afraid to speak Algonquin publicly,\u201d Cory said. \u201cWe need to change that.\u201dTo unearth the secrets of Quebec City, I turned to Richard Linteau, the avuncular doorman at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac who has worked at the grand hotel for 29 years.Overlooking the frozen Saint Lawrence River, the hotel has been a fixture of the city stretching back to 1893. It has been the setting of a Hitchcock film (\u201cI Confess\u201d), was host to Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II and, three weeks ago, was hostto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Richard, whose father-in-law also worked at the hotel, was a talented hockey player before he traded in his hockey stick for a doorman\u2019s cap. \u201cI hear and see everything but hear and see nothing,\u201d he said with a mischievous smile.Richard said the strangest request he had ever received was from a New Yorker, who asked him to rent a tow truck to take his car around town during a snowstorm. He didn\u2019t want its tires to touch snow. \u201cThen he drove back to New York.\u201dQuebecers, he added, are a hospitable bunch. \u201cI am not sure about Paris or New York, but if you fall on the floor here, a Quebecer will come pick you up.\u201dIn Quebec City, the windows of the main mosque are still pocked with bullet holes. This week I met there with Mohamed Labidi, the director of the mosque where six people were killed by a Quebecois shooter more than a year ago.Speaking after prayers at the mosque, where dozens of worshipers from North Africa, Africa and the Middle East knelt on the floor, Mohamed said many Muslims were still reeling from the attack. He said it had deeply shocked him and underlined some growing fissures in Quebec society.Last year Mohamed\u2019s car was lit on fire in front of his home after he sought to build a cemetery for the Muslim community. But he says he is undeterred.\u201cThe situation for us has gotten worse over the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has taken blood to flow for us to build bridges again.\u201dDozens of readers urged me to meet Louise Penny, the best-selling detective novelist and an Anglophone who conjures up French-speaking Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois characters. Her police detective, Armand Gamache, has become to Quebec what Hercule Poirot is to Belgium.So it was that I found myself having a lively coffee-fueled chat with Louise in the snow-covered town of Knowlton, in the Eastern Townships. Sleepy, bucolic Knowlton inspired the fictional Three Pines of her novels, where her likeable and inquisitive Chief Inspector Armand Gamache excavates the town\u2019s dark secrets. After 13 books in the series, Louise noted wryly that Three Pines had struggled to \u201csustain the murder count.\u201dLouise\u2019s novels were translated into 23 languages before they were finally translated into Quebec French in 2010, partly reflecting the cultural divide in the province.\u201cMy books are love letters to Quebec \u2014 the language of my characters is French and I wanted my characters to live in that language,\u201d Louise said. \u201cThe translation meant so much to me because I wanted my friends and neighbors to be able to read them.\u201dCezin Nottaway learned how to kill and skin a beaver at age 5. She is as at home in the forest as she is running her catering company. She is part of a rising generation of Indigenous cooks and scholars trying to preserve and spread the food culture of their ancestors.\u201cI had thought we were making progress, but the verdict made me sad and angry,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve warned my son never to trespass anywhere, I\u2019ve told my daughter never to be vulnerable. There is no justice for Indigenous people in Canada.\u201dIn a community plagued by drugs and alcohol, Cezin and her husband, Wesley, are notable success stories. Wesley was a drug dealer who will soon prescribe medicine as a doctor when he finishes McGill Medical School.How did he transform his life? Cezin explains. \u201cI told him: \u2018Enough is enough! What do you choose, drugs or your family?\u2019\u201dMany young people I spoke to here credited strong women \u2014 mothers, wives, grandmothers \u2014 for changing their lives.Wesley jokes that not listening to Cezin wasn\u2019t really an option.By Day 5 of my road trip, it was time for a beer break. And so I made my way to Shawinigan, in central Quebec, at the red-neon-lit brewery of Le Trou du Diable (The Devil\u2019s Hole), with Isaac Tremblay, the laid-back founder of one of Quebec\u2019s most successful microbreweries.Isaac, a former film technician on movie sets, first conceived of the idea for the brewery at age 25 with a group of friends from Shawinigan. He named it after a mythical bottomless caldron at the base of Shawinigan waterfall that leads straight to hell (he wrote his business plan on set during breaks). Isaac likes to draw, and his beer labels feature intricate narratives and psychedelic colors.Many readers urged me to visit a microbrewery because beer is such a part of Quebec\u2019s social fabric. Quebec\u2019s first brewery, the Brasserie du Roi, was established in 1668 by Jean Talon, the chief administrator after the French colonized Quebec. Today, there are roughly 150 microbreweries in the province, reflecting an appetite for local producers, and artisanal beer.Over a dinner of beef tartare and a citrus and coriander-infused pint of Blanche de Shawi beer, Isaac noted that, in this former pulp and paper industrial region, the \u201ctaverne\u201d has long been a place that marked the end of a factory shift, a place for beer-fueled political banter and letting loose. \u201cQuebec is a melting pot of France, Britain and Irish immigration, and drinking beer is part of its bon vivant spirit,\u201d he said.Shady Hafez is the son of an Algonquin mother and a Syrian Muslim immigrant father. He grew up between Ottawa and Kitigan Zibi.After completing an undergraduate degree in law and Canadian studies, he is completing a master\u2019s in Indigenous governance so that he can serve his community. His demand? That Canada give Indigenous people back their stolen land so they can finance their own institutions.\u201cIf you move people off their land and oppress them,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be surprised when they develop drinking problems.\u201dTo unwind, he sings and dances and is learning how to hunt. Asked the secret of his success, he credited his strict Muslim paternal grandparents.Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 \u201cMaple Spring,\u201d the huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.\u201cQuebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,\u201d he told me over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province\u2019s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was \u201cnot at its peak,\u201d he stressed that about 30 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.In 1954, 27-year-old Phyllis Lambert wrote an eight-page, single-spaced letter to her father, Samuel Bronfman, head of the Seagram distillery empire. Her father planned to build a new headquarters in New York, and the banality of the proposed building filled her with dread.\u201cDearest Daddy,\u201d the letter began. \u201cNo, No, No, No, No,\u201d she wrote, outlining with a mixture of passion and analytical verve why her father had a civic responsibility to build a memorable building that would change the world. The result \u2014 the towering Seagram Building on New York\u2019s Park Avenue \u2014 transformed 20th-century architecture.Phyllis took charge of its construction, choosing the modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe as its architect. Among its innovations, Phyllis noted, the building had a 90-foot-deep marble and granite plaza, breaking up the city\u2019s plodding uniformity.\u201cIt changed New York,\u201d she told me over tea in her kitchen in a triplex in Old Montreal with a dramatic skylight, an interior elevator and playful modern Canadian art.Phyllis has brought that same determination to her native Montreal. She is the city\u2019s most important conservationist, even if that has meant opposing projects financed by her own family. Among her crowning achievements, she helped found Heritage Montreal and founded the Canadian Center for Architecture, a pioneering global center for architecture. Acutely intelligent with an easy sense of humor, she shows little signs of slowing down and recently curated an exhibition about Montreal\u2019s historic greystones.\u201cI never wanted to be bored,\u201d she said.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Irish Abortion Vote Nears, Fears of Foreign Influence Rise", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey arrive wearing body cameras and bearing placards with graphic images of aborted fetuses.But not all of them are Irish.Of the eight members of the anti-abortion Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform who protested outside the offices of The Irish Times on a recent weekday, only three \u2014 including the group\u2019s leader, Jean Engela \u2014 are Irish. The others include Americans and a Hungarian.\u201cWe try to be as multinational as the abortion industry, and they make no apologies for sending in their international affiliates to pontificate to the Irish people,\u201d said Dr. Engela.The protests \u2014 relatively small but highly visible here in the Irish capital \u2014 are an emblem of the strong emotions as the country prepares to vote in late May on whether to retain the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which bans abortion in nearly all circumstances and was itself enacted by a referendum, in 1983. (Abortion was illegal before 1983, but the amendment made it even harder to terminate a pregnancy, even to save to mother\u2019s life.)To the age-old debates around abortion \u2014 including questions of when life begins and of women\u2019s control over their reproductive rights \u2014 the referendum has added a new dimension of concern about potential outside interference in the vote.But so far it does not appear that any anti-abortion groups have been asked to return overseas donations, despite reports that money is being openly raised on their behalf, particularly in the United States.Youth Defence did not respond to a request for comment. The Pro-Life Action League\u2019s executive director, Eric J. Scheidler, said that the remarks concerned American support for the Irish anti-abortion movement over several decades, and said his group had not raised money for the current campaign.The Irish Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, which picketed The Irish Times, receives foreign funding but claims to be exempt from government oversight. \u201cWe are an educational body,\u201d Dr. Engela said.He denied that the protest had anything to do with the coming vote, and asserted that some of the volunteers were full-time activists with their own sources of funding.Some commentators argue that anti-abortion groups are not being held to the same stringent standard as abortion-rights groups.Theresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork, said that there was a long history of overseas interests taking sides in Irish referendums, particularly on issues like the European Union. Over the last decade, even as support for the abortion ban has waned, concerns about possible outside interference have risen, she said.The church could not prevent the legalization of contraception and was on the losing side in referendums that legalized divorce in 1995 and same-sex marriage in 2015.As a result, today\u2019s anti-abortion activists are less overtly religious in their arguments. Instead, they are turning to arguments that abortion harms women\u2019s health. They are also turning to social media tools.The Save the 8th Campaign, an anti-abortion group, has hired Kanto Systems, a London-based political consultancy, to help run its campaign.Kanto Systems\u2019s founder, Thomas Borwick, was chief technology officer for the Vote Leave campaign in Britain, and developed a canvassing app for Cambridge Analytica, the data-mining organization that exploited Facebook data on behalf of the 2016 Trump campaign.Mr. Borwick said that he himself had not worked for the Trump campaign, and referred a reporter to a statement from Save the 8th, which said that Kanto would be performing \u201csome data analytics for us\u201d but would not be engaged in \u201cany voter profiling or voter targeting.\u201dJohn McGuirk, a spokesman for Save the 8th, said that in the Irish electoral system, which does not have online voter rolls, individually targeted advertising of the sort practiced by Cambridge Analytica would not be possible. \u201cIn terms of targeting advertising at individual voters, we couldn\u2019t do that even if we wanted to, which we don\u2019t,\u201d he said.The Times of London reported that the Pro Life Campaign, Ireland\u2019s largest umbrella anti-abortion group, has retained uCampaign, a Washington firm that has developed apps for the Trump campaign, the National Rifle Association, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave. (Neither uCampaign nor the Pro Life Campaign responded to requests for comment.)The Transparent Referendum Initiative, a small group of Irish technology advocates, said it had already detected paid social media campaigns stealthily targeting Irish voters. This month, the group introduced a crowdsourced monitoring tool to detect and investigate anonymous or vaguely sourced paid advertising on Facebook. It has already identified 92 such ads relating to the Irish referendum, 55 with anti-abortion messages and 37 in support of abortion rights.Political advertising is banned on Irish television and radio, but the online world is a different matter.\u201cThere is no law against someone anywhere else in the world signing a commercial contract with a British company to use foreign money or unknown money, that is not going through any official regulated campaign, in order to influence an Irish vote,\u201d said Liz Carolan of the Transparent Referendum Initiative. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious vulnerability in our democratic system. And it\u2019s now being exploited by incredibly sophisticated campaign techniques, and Facebook doesn\u2019t have to tell us who\u2019s doing it.\u201dResponding to the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Irish government announced last week that it planned to give Irish regulators new powers to curb external influence on Irish voters.A spokeswoman for Facebook\u2019s Dublin office said that the company agreed with the need for more transparency in advertising, and that it was developing a new tool to help people identify paid ads in their timelines and to identify and label political content. However, she said, the tools will not be ready in time for the May referendum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Got Lots of Company Stock. Now What?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a decidedly first-class problem: what to do when you receive most, or even substantially all of your compensation in stock?As the concept of \u201cpay for performance\u201d has taken root in corporate America, more C-suite executives are gaining firsthand experience with the major upsides \u2014 and occasional pitfalls \u2014 that can accompany generous equity compensation plans.On the one hand, receiving payment in the form of stock can amount to a windfall: not only are you getting stock on top of cash compensation, but those shares can appreciate dramatically.However, stock can just as often wind up underwater, essentially worthless. And even when shares can be sold at a gain, executives have to contend with thorny issues concerning diversification and the reputational risks of selling. It can be a tricky intersection in the corporate world of trusting your company\u2019s future versus protecting your own interests.The first thing to remember when receiving substantial stock compensation, financial advisers say, is that no matter how stable your company, you are taking a gamble. Markets go up and down, and even the most stalwart stocks can take sudden turns.Shares of General Electric climbed more or less steadily for decades until the year 2000, then tumbled. They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.\u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201dMr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.\u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201dNot everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.\u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201dThat can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.\u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica Suspends C.E.O. Amid Facebook Data Scandal", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe suspension represented a new low point for the fortunes of Cambridge Analytica and for Mr. Nix, who spent much of the past year making bold claims about the role his outfit played in the election of Mr. Trump. The company, founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least $15 million into it, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.The reports quickly put Mr. Nix in the cross hairs of a parliamentary committee investigating fake news and Russian interference in Britain\u2019s referendum to exit the European Union. Earlier this month, he told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had never obtained or used Facebook data \u2014 a statement that the firm itself has contradicted in recent days.But it was Monday\u2019s broadcast by Channel 4 News in Britain that appeared to push the board of Cambridge Analytica to move against Mr. Nix. Channel 4 spent months investigating the company, and sent a reporter to pose as a prospective client from Sri Lanka, secretly filming the encounters with Mr. Nix.The most damning footage was captured in January when Mr. Nix, sitting in a hotel bar in London, suggested the firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.\u201cWe have a long history of working behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Nix said.Inside Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Nix, the scion of a wealthy family who attended Eton College, the exclusive secondary school, had a reputation for lashing out at staff members, and for aggressively pursuing deals.Christopher Wylie, a data expert who worked at the firm in 2013 and 2014 and helped develop its voter-profiling technology, said in a recent interview that he kept memberships at a number of exclusive strip clubs near Pall Mall in London at the insistence of Mr. Nix, who often entertained clients from African and Caribbean countries there.\u201cWhy would I have these memberships?\u201d said Mr. Wylie, who is gay. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them.\u201dChannel 4 followed up Tuesday with a second part of its investigation that focused mainly on Mr. Nix\u2019s claims that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the election of Mr. Trump \u2014 a claim that many inside the Trump campaign have disputed.Announcing its chief executive\u2019s suspension, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that \u201cin the view of the board, Mr. Nix\u2019s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\u201dThe company said it had asked Alexander Tayler, its chief data officer, to serve as its acting chief executive. Mr. Tayler trained as a chemical engineer and joined Cambridge Analytica in 2014 as its lead data scientist, according to his LinkedIn profile.At the same time, the company said it was initiating an \u201cindependent investigation\u201d of Mr. Nix\u2019s comments and the allegations facing the firm.It added: \u201cThe board will be monitoring the situation closely, working closely with Dr. Tayler, to ensure that Cambridge Analytica, in all of its operations, represents the firm\u2019s values and delivers the highest-quality service to its clients.\u201dIt was not immediately clear what impact Mr. Nix\u2019s resignation would have on the SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. The companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure, and their operations are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell \u2014 it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.Neither the Mercer family nor Mr. Bannon has publicly commented since the reports in the Times and The Observer.In addition, Eric T. Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, said the state was joining Massachusetts in an investigation into whether the company failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. Their attorneys general have demanded that Facebook hand over information about its interactions with Cambridge Analytica.\u201cConsumers have a right to know how their information is used \u2014 and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users\u2019 personal information,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.In Britain, Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons, which is running the inquiry into fake news, called on Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to give evidence to Parliament.\u201cIt is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\u201d the letter said, adding, \u201cI hope that this representative will be you.\u201dStephen Castle and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Conversation With Louise Penny: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi! This is Dan Bilefsky, giving Ian Austen a couple of weeks off from this newsletter as I go on my road trip aimed at rediscovering Quebec, my home province, after an absence of 28 years.My first stop was Montreal. Dozens of readers had urged me to meet Louise Penny, the best-selling detective novelist and an Anglophone who conjures up French-speaking Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois characters.So I found myself last Monday having a lively coffee-fueled chat with Ms. Penny in the snow-covered town of Knowlton, in the Eastern Townships, a sleepy bucolic place that inspired the fictional Three Pines setting of her novels.In Three Pines, her avuncular Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, the provincial police force, excavates the town\u2019s dark secrets. After 13 books in her series, Ms. Penny noted wryly that Three Pines had struggled to \u201csustain the murder count.\u201dGamache, whom she confided was named after a local tailor, has become to Quebec what Hercule Poirot is to Belgium, and made Ms. Penny, a former journalist for the CBC, a literary star.She is also a rare breed in Quebec, a native English speaker who writes about French Canada in a province where neuroses about language run deep.\u201cI am a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise writer, and a Canadian writer, but I never wanted to be ghettoized,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be defined as a Canadian writer, but, rather, a writer who happens to be Canadian.\u201dMs. Penny\u2019s novels were translated into 23 languages before they were finally translated into Quebec French in 2010, partly reflecting the cultural divide in the province.\u201cMy books are love letters to Quebec \u2014 the language of my characters is French and I wanted my characters to live in that language,\u201d Ms. Penny, 59, said. \u201cThe translation meant so much to me because I wanted my friends and neighbors to be able to read them.\u201dMs. Penny and I also chatted about Quebec\u2019s culture wars, which she experienced while living in Quebec City during the 1995 referendum on the province\u2019s independence.She pointed out that Quebec had an English minority surrounded by a French majority, who were themselves eclipsed by an English majority in the rest of the country. So in Quebec, she noted, everyone defines themselves as \u201cThe Other,\u201d creating a sense of alienation that both inspired and repelled.\u201cAs much as the English don\u2019t know the French, the French don\u2019t know the English,\u201d she said.In multilingual Knowlton, however, she stressed that a love of country living and nature overcame any linguistic differences. Even when she was living in Quebec City, and her French was rudimentary, she said, she was \u201cnever made to feel like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d even when she would accidentally order \u201cflaming mice\u201d in a restaurant.Ms. Penny, who oozes humor and easy conviviality, has overcome her fair share of adversity. She said she was on the brink of suicide in her late 30s, consumed with fear of failure and an alcohol problem. She had five years of writer\u2019s block, and her first manuscript was rejected by at least 50 publishers.But with the encouragement of her husband, Michael Whitehead, a doctor who died in 2016, she refused to give up, eventually coming in second in a British writing contest. Gamache, she noted, came to her fully formed. Now she writes one book a year \u2014 all infused by her many years in Quebec.\u201cI wanted to write books that I would read, that my 8year-old self would read,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to love them. I created a village where I would live, populated with characters I would befriend and a main character I would marry.\u201dOn the reserve, which has been buffeted by alcoholism and drug problems and the legacy of colonial rule, many residents said Mr. Trump\u2019s latest declaration had little effect on them.But Shady Hafez, a youth worker whose mother is Algonquin and whose father is Syrian, said that America\u2019s rightward shift under Mr. Trump had made Canadians feel smug about their liberalism, and that some believed that they had been given a license to support racism in Canada, while others thought that Mr. Trudeau now had an excuse to be complacent about minority rights.\u201cJustin Trudeau looks and sounds amazing compared to what comes out of Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Mr. Hafez said. \u201cBut he is all talk. What matters is what happens on the ground.\u201dMy next stop: H\u00e9rouxville, which a decade ago become synonymous with a xenophobic impulse in contemporary Quebec. I want to see how and if attitudes have shifted. If you have any suggestions about whom to meet there or what to see or what to ask, please send them my way.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Martin Shkreli Sentenced to 7 Years in Prison for Fraud", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProsecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.As she imposed the sentence, Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto of Federal District Court cited Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cegregious multitude of lies.\u201d She said he seemed \u201cgenuinely remorseful,\u201d but he \u201crepeatedly minimized\u201d his conduct, including in statements and emails after his conviction.\u201cI was never motivated by money,\u201d said Mr. Shkreli, wearing dark prison scrubs and sitting at the defense table as he read from notes before the sentence was handed down. He cried as he gave his statement, dabbing at his eyes with a tissue. \u201cI wanted to grow my stature and my reputation. I am here because of my gross, stupid and negligent mistakes I made.\u201dShortly after Mr. Shkreli\u2019s conviction, his lawyers suggested that he would not be sentenced to prison. They noted that he had ultimately paid back his investors, meaning there was no financial loss \u2014 a key variable in determining sentences for white-collar criminals.Judge Matsumoto rejected that argument, citing legal precedents establishing that fraud losses cover property whether or not it is returned. She had ruled on Monday that Mr. Shkreli would also have to forfeit $7.36 million to the government to cover his fraud.Judge Matsumoto also authorized the government to seize Mr. Shkreli\u2019s assets, including a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album and a Picasso, if he was otherwise unable to come up with the required restitution.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s supporters argued, in letters submitted to the judge before sentencing, that he was a bright, nerdy child who became consumed with internet fame.Raised in Brooklyn, Mr. Shkreli was physically abused by both of his Albanian immigrant parents and witnessed domestic abuse in his home, according to a submission from a consultant hired by his lawyers that was reviewed by The New York Times. He suffered panic attacks. He funneled his energy into numbers: By the time he was 6, one of his sisters wrote, he calculated square roots and knew the periodic table.At school, he was \u201cashamed of his own upbringing,\u201d a friend, Franky Guttman, wrote. After Mr. Shkreli landed an internship at a Wall Street firm in high school, Mr. Guttman recalled being struck by how his friend could watch millions of dollars being traded, yet often arrive at school without lunch money.Several years ago, as Mr. Shkreli gained notoriety, the two men stopped talking to each other. \u201cThe affable, funny guy I knew,\u201d Mr. Guttman wrote, \u201cslowly gave way to his public persona.\u201dDuring and after his trial, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s behavior online exacerbated his plight. As the proceedings wrapped up, for instance, he wrote on Facebook that if he were to be acquitted, he would be able to have sex with a female journalist he often posted about online. It was one of several posts that prosecutors cited in a pre-sentencing submission in which they argued that any remorse Mr. Shkreli claimed to feel was only for show.\u201cHe wants everyone to believe that he is a genius, a whiz kid,\u201d Jacquelyn Kasulis, a prosecutor said, as she argued for a 15-year sentence. \u201cHe can\u2019t just be an average person who fails, like the rest of us.\u201d\u201cThere are times when I want to hug him,\u201d Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told the judge on Friday, arguing for a short sentence. \u201cThere are times I want to punch him in the face because he\u2019s made my job more difficult by some of the things he\u2019s said.\u201dThe judge also imposed a fine of $75,000, separate from the $7.36 million in forfeiture that she ruled on Monday that he must pay, after noting that his net worth is $27.2 million.Before she adjourned court, Judge Matsumoto encouraged Mr. Shkreli to continue teaching inmates, as he has been doing in jail.\u201cThank you very much, Your Honor,\u201d Mr. Shkreli said.Advertisement"}

I am a lemon person.Of all the lemony desserts one could make, I\u2019ve always leaned hard on the classic, lemon curd tart. But there are times when it pays to branch out. This elegant tart, with tangerine, ginger and a little chocolate, is one of them.I got the idea at my friend Shawn\u2019s dinner party this past winter. Periodically throughout the meal of fried veal cutlets with capers and potato gratin, I\u2019d turn to gaze at the lemon tart on the counter, glistening daisy bright.Even before I\u2019d polished off my wedge, I was already adapting the recipe in my head. What would happen if I added tangerine to the lemon, since orange flavors work so well with chocolate?A few weeks later, I tried it, and while I adored the way the tangerine and the chocolate got along, the tart was missing something \u2014 that intense lemony smack. The tangerine juice had dulled its bite.Adding more lemon to the curd would have meant using less tangerine juice or compromising the texture. Any extra punch would have to come via the crust.I briefly considered black pepper before settling on crystallized ginger, which has a sharpness equal to lemon, and a pleasingly chewy texture. Better yet, it turned the crust into a giant shortbread cookie. As a final touch, I spooned some tangy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche onto the top and sprinkled that with crystallized ginger, too.The tart had brightness, depth and a hint of spice \u2014 a treat for lemon people and beyond.cookingAdvertisement"}

Cohn right.\u2022 Dropbox has priced its I.P.O.An unorthodox action by President Trump unsettles investors, but after a freakout, their optimism returns and the stock market moves higher.The stock market plunged Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the measures against China. Since mid-February, when the Trump administration laid out its case for steel and aluminum tariffs, the S.&P. 500 is down 3.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average is off nearly 5 percent.Just as the Trump administration has stepped back from quickly imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs, it may soften its stance if China suggests that its open to negotiations. The world could relax.Investors would then scramble to quantify the economic repercussions. They might not be terrible.Some American companies, like computer chip makers, get substantial revenue from China. But on average, companies in the S.&P. 500 index derive a small share of their sales from the country.And some investors may take a long view, believing that U.S. companies have long been treated unfairly in China. A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of those disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of those firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent.Still, much could go wrong. A true test of investor sentiment will come if China fights back. Markets could fall further, creating a financial chain reaction that dampens the wider economy. A lot would depend on how Mr. Trump responds to Chinese actions. Would he up the ante?\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to predict how this will turn out,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese trade at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, \u201cwhether one side will back down or whether it will spiral into a trade war.\u201d\u2014 Peter EavisHere are the details:The contextThe demand for Dropbox\u2019s shares suggests investors overcame any concern about daunting competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and Amazon, all of which provide cloud storage services. A successful debut could pave the way for other unicorns to soon go public.President Trump said he would impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports as the White House moved to punish China for what it says is a pattern of co-opting American technology and trade secrets and robbing companies of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.The tariffs will target 1,300 lines of Chinese goods \u2014 everything from shoes and clothing to electronics \u2014 the NYT reports administration officials said.Mr. Trump, the officials added, will also direct the Treasury Department to impose restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies, a practice that they said the Chinese government uses to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles.\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, told reporters.Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council and an architect of the measures, cast the tariffs as part of a seminal shift in how the U.S. views China. Rather than trying to draw it into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger \u2014 the U.S. now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\u2014 Mark Landler and Jim TankersleyOn Thursday, the Trump administration announced trade restrictions against China. The news appeared to weigh on markets. So, how have stocks done since important dates in the trade skirmish?The Dow Jones industrial average has done a lot worse, however. It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\u2014 Peter EavisMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.The Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.Boeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.Boeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.Boeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.Shares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.That is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.Shares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.As these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.Such investments have raised concerns in the United States. The Trump administration officials said the Chinese government uses these investments to develop its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like A.I. and autonomous vehicles. As part of the China tariffs, the Trump administration plans to place restrictions on Chinese investment in American technology companies.Two members of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee called for an immediate rate increase, but the majority of the committee did not see the need for a hike at this time. Most economists expect the Bank of England to raise rates in May, when it releases its latest quarterly projection for inflation.\u2014 Chad BrayWhat he promised: to investigate apps that had access to large amounts of Facebook data, to restrict developers\u2019 data access and to show users how to revoke app permissions.Highlights from his interviews:Peter Eavis\u2019s take: Missing from his response was a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the Cambridge Analytica misuse of data. The company found out in 2015. Why wasn\u2019t the abuse disclosed then?\u2022 A pathway to funding for the New York Gateway project, something Mr. Trump has opposed\u2022 $1.6 billion, with strings attached, for a border wall with Mexico\u2022 Nothing to protect Dreamers or to shore up the Affordable Care ActRepublicans like the senators Rand Paul and John Kennedy are unhappy. So too is the president, who wanted far more for his wall. (He\u2019s on board for now.)Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results.

{"Headline": "Jane Brody\u2019s Personal Secrets to Lasting Weight Loss", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthWhen The New York Times hired me to write about science and health 52 years ago, I was 40 pounds overweight. I\u2019d spent the previous three years watching my weight rise as I hopped from one diet to the next in a futile attempt to shed the pounds most recently gained.No amount of exercise, and I did plenty of it, could compensate for how much I ate when I abandoned the latest weight loss scheme. I had become a living example of the adage: A diet is something one goes on to go off.Even daylong fasting failed me. When I finally ate supper, I couldn\u2019t stop eating until I fell asleep, and sometimes awoke the next morning with partly chewed food in my mouth. I had dieted myself into a binge-eating disorder, and that really scared me. Clearly, something had to change.I finally regained control when I stopped dieting. I decided that if I was going to be fat, at least I could be healthy. I made a plan to eat three nutritious, satisfying meals every day with one small snack, which helped me overcome the temptation to binge in response to deprivation.Much to my surprise, a month later I had lost 10 pounds \u2014 eating! Eating good food, that is, and plenty of it. I continued the regimen without difficulty because it was not a diet. It was a way to live and a healthy one at that. And I continued to lose, about two pounds a month.Two years later, all the excess weight was gone. I never gained it back and never again went on a diet. (Even with a twin pregnancy, I gained only 36 pounds and lost them all when my sons were born at 6 pounds 13 ounces each.)The greatest challenge to lasting weight loss, especially for someone like me with a food addiction, is the fact that no one can give up eating. Rather, one has to learn a better \u2014 and permanent \u2014 way to handle food.I eat everything I want, in moderation. My meals \u2014 mostly homemade \u2014 are heavily loaded with vegetables, and I choose calorie-controlled snacks like popcorn at 35 calories a cup, a graham cracker at 59 calories for two squares, and ice cream (really ice milk) at 100 to 150 calories a half cup. No seconds!Perhaps no one knows this better than Angelica Divinagracia, a fitness specialist in Los Angeles who at 53 still looks as good or better than she did as head cheerleader at U.C.L.A. (Full disclosure: Ms. Divinagracia is my daughter-in-law.) In a posting mid-January on Facebook, she wrote, \u201cThe diet and nutrition business is a billion dollar industry because it\u2019s designed for failure. When the diet ends, which ultimately it will, you go right back to where you were. Then you start another\u2026.\u201dMs. Divinagracia said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in diets or any particular products. I believe in learning how to create a healthy lifestyle, and the formula is simple.\u201d The most salient points of her well-practiced advice are these: 1) Stop eating crap, 2) Eat good food that is real, not processed, 3) Avoid drinking your calories, 4) Know what one serving is and do not eat more than that in a sitting, 5) Move your butt every day \u2014 even just walking is better than being a couch potato, and 6) Stop making excuses.Dr. Guth warns against numerous pitfalls, like being swayed by package claims of \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201clow carbohydrate\u201d instead of reading the facts on the nutrition label. \u201cThese foods do not necessarily have fewer total calories than the original version of the food,\u201d she wrote, because sugar is often used to compensate for flavor lost, for example, when fat is reduced. Fruit juice may be fat-free but it is not low in calories because it contains large amounts of sugar, she noted.She also urges closer attention to add-ons and condiments. \u201cA beef patty has definite food value but after adding a large bun, dressing and extra cheese, the total calories (535) will far exceed the caloric content of the meat, pickle and tomato (240),\u201d she wrote, adding that using butter, margarine or mayonnaise on a sandwich adds far more calories than mustard.Although most of the Jan. 16 issue of JAMA is devoted to studies of bariatric surgery, which offers the best route to permanent weight loss for some people, Dr. Guth pointed out that surgery is likely to fail too \u201cif a patient is unwilling to make appropriate changes in food choices.\u201dShe, like me, endorses Michael Pollan\u2019s diet mantra: \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\u201d And like me, she notes that slow, steady weight loss suggests that you\u2019ve made sustainable changes in your diet and exercise habits that can become second nature and last a lifetime.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peter Thiel\u2019s Money Talks, in Contentious Ways. But What Does He Say?", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Thiel is Silicon Valley\u2019s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.Even people paid to see the future didn\u2019t see that one coming.\u201cThe board\u2019s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWe were far from perfect in doing that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,\u201d Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.The investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201dThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201dIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201dThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201dMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.He denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s No Cold War, but Relations With Russia Turn Volatile", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor all the tension, proxy conflicts and risk of nuclear war that punctuated relations between Moscow and the West for decades, each side knew, particularly toward the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, roughly what to expect. Each had a modicum of trust that the other would act in a reasonably predictable way.The volatile state of Russia\u2019s relations with the outside world today, exacerbated by a nerve agent attack on a former spy living in Britain, however, makes the diplomatic climate of the Cold War look reassuring, said Ivan I. Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations, and recalls a period of paralyzing mistrust that followed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.\u201cIf you look for similarities with what is happening, it is not the Cold War that can explain events but Russia\u2019s first revolutionary regime,\u201d which regularly assassinated opponents abroad, said Mr. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg.He said that Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, had no interest in spreading a new ideology and fomenting world revolution, unlike the early Bolsheviks, but that Russia under Mr. Putin had \u201cbecome a revolutionary regime in terms of international relations.\u201dRussia, Mr. Kurilla said, does not like the rules of the American-dominated order that have prevailed since then, \u201cand wants to change them.\u201dOne rule that Russia has consistently embraced, however, is the principle of reciprocity, and the Kremlin made clear on Monday that it would, after assessing the scale of the damage to its diplomat corps overseas, respond with expulsions of Western diplomats from Russia.The Russian Parliament also weighed in, with the deputy head of its foreign affairs committee, Aleksei Chepa, telling the Interfax news agency that Russia would not bow to the West\u2019s diplomatic \u201cwar.\u201d Russia, he said, \u201cwill not allow itself to be beaten up, the harder they try to intimidate us, the tougher our response will be.\u201dThe attack on the Skripals was another first, at least according to Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who denounced the action as the \u201cfirst offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War.\u201dMr. Putin, she said, might not be predictable but usually follows what he considers fairly clear logic. \u201cPutin does not do disruption just for fun, but because he is Putin and he can,\u201d she said.In the case of the poisoning in Salisbury, Russia\u2019s denials became so baroque that even the state-run news media had a hard time keeping up.After officials denied any Russian role and insisted that neither Russia nor the Soviet Union had ever developed Novichok, the nerve agent identified by Britain as the substance used against the Skripals, a state-controlled news agency published an interview with a Russian scientist who said he had helped develop a system of chemical weapons called Novichok-5. The agency later amended the article, replacing the scientist\u2019s mention of Novichok with an assertion that the \u201cchemical weapons development program of the U.S.S.R. was not called \u2018Novichok.\u2019\u201dThe attempted murder of Mr. Skripal on British soil, however, \u201cwas the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian scholar at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw. \u201cWestern leaders finally decided that enough is enough\u201d because Moscow has played the denial game so many times and showed no real interest in establishing the truth, he said.Unlike Soviet leaders during the Cold War, he added, Mr. Putin follows no fixed ideology or rules but is ready to pursue any \u201cpredatory policies,\u201d no matter how taboo, that might help \u201cundermine the existing order in Europe,\u201d while insisting that Russia is the victim, not the aggressor.\u201cIf you keep putting forward crazy conspiracy theories, eventually people are going to ask whether what you are saying is just another crazy Russian denial,\u201d he said.Mr. Bond said diplomacy during the Cold War, even when it involved hostile actions, tended to follow a relatively a calm and orderly routine. No longer is that the case, he added, noting that the Russian Embassy in London and the Foreign Ministry in Moscow have issued statements and tweets mocking Britain as an impotent has-been power and scoffing at the Salisbury poisoning as the \u201cso-called Sergei Skripal case.\u201dPresident Putin, Mr. Bond added, \u201cis not trying to foment international revolution, but he is the great disrupter\u201d and revels in wrong-footing foreign governments by flouting established norms.While Russia may have been surprised by the magnitude of the coordinated expulsions by Britain\u2019s allies on Monday, it was clearly anticipating something. Hours before they were announced, it went on the offensive.Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, posted a message on Facebook sneering at the European Union for showing solidarity with Britain at a time when London is negotiating its exit from the bloc. Britain, she wrote, is \u201cexploiting the solidarity factor to impose on those that are remaining a deterioration in relations with Russia.\u201dWhile President Trump has expressed a curious affinity with Mr. Putin and raised expectations of improved relations, the Russian leader has always been more measured. The underlying mistrust seemed to be reinforced on Monday by Russia\u2019s ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, who told the Interfax news agency that \u201cwhat the United States of America is doing today is destroying whatever little is left in Russian-U.S. relations.\u201dDespite the unpredictability under Mr. Putin, the possibility of nuclear conflict between the Russians and the West, the most frightening aspect of the Cold War, does not appear to have increased. Arms control agreements reached since the 1970s are still honored \u2014 with the exception of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile accord, known as the ABM Treaty, which Mr. Bush abandoned 30 years later.Mr. Bush\u2019s decision, questioned by even some American allies, opened the way, in Moscow\u2019s view, to a free-for-all in international relations that has left the United States and Russia struggling to recover the trust developed by President Ronald Reagan and the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in the 1980s.In a state of the nation address in February, President Putin unveiled what he described as a new generation of \u201cinvincible\u201d long-range nuclear missiles but, speaking later in an interview with NBC, he blamed Washington for pushing Moscow into a new arms race by disregarding a Cold War status quo.\u201cIf you speak about the arms race, it started when the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty,\u201d he said.Confronted with Moscow\u2019s disruptive actions in the 1920s, Britain and other European countries \u201cdid not know how to respond and took 10 years or more to figure out how to deal with Moscow,\u201d said Mr. Kurilla, the St. Petersburg historian.In the case of Britain, the leading power of the day and the first Western country to recognize the Soviet Union, the process had echoes of the present. It recognized the new Bolshevik government in 1924 but then expelled Soviet diplomats and shuttered their embassy three years later after the police uncovered what they said was a Soviet espionage ring bent on spreading mayhem.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the American withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. President George W. Bush announced that the United States was withdrawing from the treaty in 2001. The withdrawal was completed in 2002.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dropbox Shares Leap in I.P.O., and Silicon Valley Smiles", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups.Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox\u2019s market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets.Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year.But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies.\u201cI think the success of Dropbox\u2019s I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox\u2019s early investors.Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors.And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren\u2019t easily liquidated.Given the huge values attached to those companies \u2014 Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion \u2014 access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out.Since 2014, the \u201cexits\u201d by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed.As a result, the offering for Dropbox \u2014 along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies \u2014 is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies.Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually.\u201cToday is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off,\u201d Mr. Houston said. \u201cWe were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it.\u201dDropbox\u2019s solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic.Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading.Such first-day pops aren\u2019t uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company\u2019s prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn\u2019t guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering.Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Calls for Privacy May Upend Business for Facebook and Google", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The contemporary internet was built on a bargain: Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share.People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising. The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.Now, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google\u2019s free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it\u2019s unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.\u201cThey are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,\u201d Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\u201cPeople are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIf your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone\u2019s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\u201dIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201dM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201dBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\u201cTo know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\u201d said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.There\u2019s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world\u2019s remedy for any problem is always more technology.\u201cIf Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\u201d said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \u201cBut well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It\u2019s like a child running a bulldozer. They don\u2019t have any sense of the damage they can do.\u201dDavid Streitfeld reported from San Francisco, Natasha Singer from New York and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

Mr. Miller plays a character named Alvy Singer. Ms. Chernick, who grew up in the Bronx, is Annie Hall, from Chippewa Falls. The movie, which includes the dialogue above, is \u201cMy Annie Hall.\u201dA year ago, two young artists, Matt Starr, 29, and Ellie Sachs, 25, approached the senior center with a proposal to remake a classic movie with members of the center. They had been turned down by other centers, who said that their members would not stick with such a project. But at Lenox Hill, Jessica Balboni, the director of the senior center, jumped at the idea.\u201cWe said, \u2018You betcha,\u2019\u201d Ms. Balboni said. \u201cThe arts have been such a powerful tool to build resiliency and vitality in older adults. It was an immediate yes.\u201d\u201cI was completely moved by what they were doing and sent money to them,\u201d said Jeff Garlin, a star of HBO\u2019s \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Goldbergs,\u201d who saw Mr. Miller in a friend\u2019s talent contest and was captivated. \u201cIt has a humanity to it and a sweetness to it that I don\u2019t see in any other work.\u201dOn a January morning in his apartment, Mr. Miller, who had never been in a film before, reflected.\u201cUnfortunately, the lobsters weren\u2019t very good actors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hardly moved.\u201dThen he said that making the movie was the best experience of his life.\u201cYou two are part of my life,\u201d he said, addressing Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs, who play a couple in the movie, and are one in real life. \u201cYou\u2019re the only people who ever call me. I don\u2019t get calls from anyone else, because they\u2019re all dead. Now I have two grandchildren.\u201dMr. Miller\u2019s favorite Woody Allen movie is \u201cInteriors.\u201d Ms. Chernick\u2019s is \u201cBananas,\u201d from 1971.

One day Mr. Starr played the movie \u201cCasablanca\u201d for her, and she seemed a different person. They acted out scenes from the movie, and she remembered the dialogue verbatim.\u201cWe would do a scene here and a scene there, and in between those scenes if I asked her questions or she asked me things, it wasn\u2019t just a circular conversation,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cWhereas literally hours before that, she would ask, \u2018Where are you living?\u2019 She\u2019d turn, take a bite of her bagel, and say, \u2018So, where you living?\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t happening when we were watching the film. So the film was doing something to her.\u201dWithout knowing it, Mr. Starr was practicing what doctors who treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease call \u201creminiscence therapy,\u201d which can reduce stress and stimulate memories in people with cognitive loss, said Molly Fogel, the director of educational and social services at the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America. \u201cIf I can bring you back to a point of pleasure, and to places where you have context or connections, then it provides a better opportunity to engage and communicate.At Lennox Hill, Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs offered to lead a weekly class they were calling Interpretive Cinema. The first week, about 15 people showed up, including Ms. Chernick. The next week, she prodded Mr. Miller to attend.\u201cWe go there for the company,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Mr. Sachs and Mr. Starr showed about 10 trailers, and asked the group to vote on one. \u201cIt was a tie between \u2018Singing in the Rain\u2019 and \u2018Annie Hall,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sachs said. \u201cWe encouraged the class to do \u2018Annie Hall\u2019 just because Lenox Hill Neighborhood House is so close by to a lot of the original locations. And it\u2019s a memory movie. It\u2019s about looking back and thinking about what you choose to remember, why you choose to remember certain things, what are the most salient and important memories. And also, it\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s accessible and seemed very ageless.\u201dAuditions lasted three weeks. Mr. Miller, who wanted a secondary part, got the lead instead. \u201cI was the only short one at the center,\u201d he said. To this day he has not seen \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d and refuses to do so.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to try to imitate,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to follow the script.\u201dMr. Miller was a find. He had won two Emmy Awards as a scenic designer for soap operas, and when he retired at age 75, he began taking acting classes at Hunter College. \u201cWhenever there was an old man part, I got cast in it,\u201d he said.Mr. Garlin cited another item on Mr. Miller\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cHe worked on \u2018Captain Kangaroo,\u2019\u201d the comedian gushed.Ms. Chernick had been singing since fifth grade in Hebrew school, but she had only acted once, in a production of \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d when she was in college.\u201cYou have natural acting chops,\u201d Mr. Starr said.It helped that they were good friends. \u201cShula and I have been going out together for eight or nine years, but not romantic,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAt my age there\u2019s no romance. But she\u2019s another generation younger than me.\u201dThe initial budget was leftover \u201cbar and bat mitzvah money,\u201d and the crew was the two filmmakers, Mr. Starr said. \u201cThen we put a call out on Facebook, and we had an overflow of people wanting to help. People who made a living doing this, and asked for nothing in return.\u201dThey raised $11,000, including a contribution from Mr. Garlin, and Mr. Starr went on unemployment to work on the movie. They cut the script to about 30 minutes, including Alvy Singer\u2019s opening and closing monologues. They chose scenes in which the cast\u2019s age would not \u201cturn into a joke,\u201d Mr. Starr said.Marshall McLuhan, who appears as himself in the original, did not make the cut.There were some unique challenges.\u201cHarry has a cellphone, but it\u2019s only on 30 minutes a day,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cAnd Shula has one that she hasn\u2019t turned on in five years. Getting in touch with them, it\u2019s difficult. We take for granted that we can send out one email and a follow-up text to every single crew member. But we really had to stay on top of making sure the stars of our film were there. There had to be that much more trust with our seniors, which is something we take for granted a lot with our friends.\u201dThey premiered the film at the center in Lenox Hill last December. Then in January, Mr. Allen\u2019s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow renewed charges that he molested her when she was 7 years old, inspiring many actors from past projects to dissociate themselves from him. Mr. Allen has consistently denied the charges.Neither the stars nor the filmmakers felt the charges colored their movie. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you can tie an artist with his work,\u201d Ms. Chernick said. \u201cThey kind of stand separately, and ours stands even further away. His thing is like a takeoff point for us. Ours is so different. Nobody tried to imitate him. Like Harry hadn\u2019t seen the film. I\u2019m a Jewish shiksa.\u201dThrough his publicist, Mr. Allen said last week that he had heard about the project and endorsed it. \u201cThought it was funny,\u201d the email message read. \u201cSaw no reason to interfere with those seniors\u2019 enjoyment of life. Never saw it, had no objections, good luck to them.\u201dMr. Starr and Ms. Sachs have shown the movie twice at Lenox Hill but nowhere else, and it is not available online. Their hope, Mr. Starr said, is that other young artists will do similar projects with their local elder communities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a big production,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be just a couple scenes shot on an iPhone. Maybe this can become an award category, Sweded Senior Films, and all of these legal hurdles won\u2019t be obstacles.\u201dIn the meantime, the movie\u2019s principals, young and old, have new friendships.\u201cI never had children,\u201d Ms. Chernick said.The directors begged to differ. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d Ms. Sachs said.\u201cI call you Mom or Grandmom,\u201d Mr. Starr said.\u201cExcept that they were our bosses during the movie,\u201d Ms. Chernick said. \u201cWe had to take orders from them.\u201dOn a recent morning, Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs took bagels and coffee to Mr. Miller\u2019s apartment on the Upper East Side. Before long, a Woody Allen movie broke out.Mr. Miller related the post-filming fate of two lobsters whose role in the movie is to get loose on the kitchen floor, bedeviling the two main characters. One, he said, was so large that ordinary tools were no match for its shell.\u201cWe were filming and I said, \u2018I have this six-pound lobster,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to all come over and eat it? So about six of us came over, and Matt volunteered to take on the lobster. He took off his shirt, he was naked to the waist.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019m a vegan, so this is a first for me,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cI took the hammer, undressed and started whacking it, and it\u2019s spraying everywhere. It was really intense.\u201dMr. Miller said he recently met a woman who said she liked everything in the movie except the lobster scene. \u201cI said, Why didn\u2019t you like that? It\u2019s a funny scene. She said, Because I\u2019m a vegan and I don\u2019t like to see animals treated like that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t blame her,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cHas your life at the center changed at all since?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cfor a week or two they kept calling me the star, but it calmed down after a while.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to write another film soon,\u201d Mr. Starr said.Ms. Balboni, the senior center\u2019s director, said the project had changed the attitudes of some members. \u201cWhat we got out of it was something far beyond our imagination,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is putting a spotlight on what often older adults experience, which is invisibility \u2014 \u2018I don\u2019t see you anymore, you\u2019re not important, you can\u2019t do.\u2019 This film blows that up and says, Let me show you an iconic story through the lens of older adults in all their audacity. So it gave them empowerment, and more chutzpah.\u201dThe elders, in turn, helped the filmmakers see their own lives differently. Most of Mr. Starr\u2019s and Ms. Sachs\u2019s friends were struggling artists trying to get by, doubling up in tiny apartments with exorbitant rents. The seniors, by contrast, were dating, had leisure time and often had big apartments with low rents.\u201cWhen we get together we talk about friend things,\u201d Mr. Starr said, referring to Mr. Miller and Ms. Chernick. \u201cWe talk about sex.\u201d\u201cThey consistently give better advice than most of my friends,\u201d Ms. Sachs said.She added: \u201cA lot of our friends have tunnel vision. They want one thing really badly, and they\u2019re so focused on it that it\u2019s hard to zoom out and get perspective. Spending time with Harry and Shula and the other people, the greatest gift was perspective, seeing the world a little differently.\u201dMr. Miller said that since his birthday in January, his age was finally catching up with him. Ms. Chernick disagreed. Since the movie, she said, the opposite is true. \u201cHe seems younger to me. We\u2019ve been friends for 10 years. I didn\u2019t realize he can talk so much. You were always quiet before.\u201dAs for herself, she said, \u201cI feel like I have glow inside.\u201dMr. Miller considered this.\u201cShula is more vivacious now,\u201d he said. She smiled.\u201cBut I have to tell you, the day I turned 94, I felt old and I could hardly move,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to love walking, and I can\u2019t stand walking anymore.\u201dHe had just spent the morning walking around the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u201cWait a second, you walked all the way down to meet me,\u201d Ms. Chernick said.\u201cYeah, but I wasn\u2019t carrying my shoulder bag.\u201d\u201cWell, who tells you to carry the shoulder bag?\u201d she said. \u201cI always tell you not to.\u201dSo it went.Mr. Starr and Ms. Sachs are now writing a screenplay for Mr. Miller, based on his life, from his boyhood in Jersey City to his television career and beyond. His is a world apart from theirs, featuring grand movie palaces where he used to tap dance before films, and an apartment in the luxurious Parc Vend\u00f4me near Columbus Circle, for which he paid $58 a month.Mr. Miller allowed that he can no longer do the Russian leg-kick dance, which used to be his big applause number. But he was not without ambition. Mr. Garlin, who was first won over by seeing Mr. Miller tap dance, said he might cast him in an Off Broadway play.Mr. Miller\u2019s acting teachers saw a screening, he said, and they were impressed. \u201cOne said she was going to get me an agent,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cso I could get work as the male Betty White.\u201dBeyond that, he said, little things have changed since the movie. \u201cMore people say hello to me, because normally I\u2019m not that outgoing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t go around talking to people I\u2019ve never met. And even when I do, I don\u2019t remember their names.\u201dAnd so a star is born.Advertisement"}

But the problem isn\u2019t just filter bubbles, echo chambers or alternative facts. It\u2019s tone: When the loudest voices on the left talk about people on the right as either beyond the pale or dupes of their betters, it is with an air of barely concealed smugness. Right-wingers, for their part, increasingly respond with a churlish \u201cOh, yeah?

The result: an odoriferous stew of political rhetoric that is nearly irresistible to those on the inside and confusingly abhorrent to those on the outside.Around the same time, a New York University psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, was formulating a theory about why liberals and conservatives have such a hard time productively conversing.After mucking around in a lot of survey data, he came up with this basic idea: Liberals and people of the left underpin their politics with moral concerns about harm and fairness; they are driven by the imperative to help the vulnerable and see justice done. Conservatives and people of the right value these things as well but have several additional moral touchstones \u2014 loyalty, respect and sanctity. They value in-group solidarity, deference to authority, and the protection of purity in mind and body. To liberals, those sincerely held values can look a lot like, in Dr. Haidt\u2019s words, \u201cxenophobia, authoritarianism and Puritanism.\u201d This asymmetry is the fountainhead of mutual incomprehension and disdain.Much of Dr. Haidt\u2019s subsequent work has been trying to find ways to bridge this political empathy gap, to foster ways of thinking about each other that will minimize polarization. But he is swimming against the political current.For many on the right, the real lesson of the Stewart-Carlson exchange was \u201cDo as I say, not as I do.\u201d Mr. Stewart urged sincerity and good-faith efforts at dialogue when lecturing Mr. Carlson but practiced the opposite when it suited him. Mr. Stewart\u2019s smugness was itself a form of trolling. And conservatives, no matter what liberals might think of them, are not stupid. The clear lesson was if you want to win, stop being the debate team kid in the bow tie and start being the class clown who gives that guy a wedgie.Mr. Stewart has since retired from the ring, having replicated himself a dozen times over on every channel, each copy smugger than the last. But Mr. Carlson, too, has triumphed. He now hosts one of the top-rated shows on Fox News, where he has become a shouty populist version of his former mini William F. Buckley Jr. persona \u2014 much closer to the trollish partisan Mr. Stewart accused him of being than he ever was in his \u201cCrossfire\u201d days.And the rest of the movement has evolved \u2014 or devolved \u2014 alongside him, from the organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference who invited Marion Le Pen and Sheriff David Clarke, to the campus conservatives who\u2019ve doubled down on their strategy of inviting Ann Coulter and her spiritual descendants to speak to the very audiences likely to be most outraged by them. For many campus conservatives, the invitations are driven by a sincere desire to give their values an airing and set off debate. It is, of course, also fun to annoy people who disagree with you.Ironically, or perhaps predictably, tonal tensions are escalating at a time when actual policymaking has ground nearly to a halt, with budgets and major legislative packages hopelessly stalled in Congress after Congress. The attempt to find common ground over the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 the group of undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children \u2014 for instance, ultimately involved a brief shutdown of the federal government and a near miss of one. The left labeled the right racist; the right accused the left of hating America. No substantive policy change resulted.So maybe it makes sense that political squabbling across much of America has become increasingly aesthetics-focused and content devoid: It\u2019s no coincidence that at the moment the alt-right leader Richard Spencer was sucker-punched on camera, he was explaining the elaborate in-joke signaled by his Pepe the Frog lapel pin. Nor that when Russians allegedly tried to meddle in the last presidential election, they chose to do it in meme form, with Facebook ads featuring Jesus and the Devil arm wrestling over the prospect of a Hillary Clinton victory, or promoting \u201cBuff Bernie\u201d pro-L.G.B.T. coloring books. Differences remain as fundamental as ever, but the way we talk about them is so superficial as to have become incoherent.But that has done little to restrain the all-consuming ferocity of the fighting. Nor have the consequences been restricted to the internet. The tonal differences go all the way to the top: If Barack Obama\u2019s \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d statement was a perfect distillation of the smug style in liberal politics, Donald Trump is impeccably suited to an increasingly post-ideological Republican landscape where the point-scoring is the prize.It is from the reluctant partisans and the remaining 10 percent of stalwart independents that hope must spring. The notion that there are sensible political coalitions to be had outside of partisan paradigms is a cherished American idea. Some of the people abandoning standard labels are liable to make things worse by racing to the bottom \u2014 think \u201cthe dirtbag left\u201d of the \u201cChapo Trap House\u201d podcast or even the alt-right. But there are other longstanding principled transpartisan coalitions that might be due for reconsideration: Think cosmopolitan libertarianism or Blue Dog Democrats. These coalitions can form, however, only if they can find a space outside of mainstream politics\u2019 compulsive, addictive, downward rhetorical spiral.In the meantime, \u201cDon\u2019t feed the trolls\u201d is a sound piece of advice \u2014 and one that is nearly impossible to follow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Reckoning: \u2018This Is a Major Trust Issue\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBelow is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity.The second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t going to be other different kind of things we\u2019ll also have to fix. But when there\u2019s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem.So the actions here that we\u2019re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can\u2019t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we\u2019re going ahead and doing that.Even if you solve the problem going forward, there\u2019s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people\u2019s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That\u2019s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we\u2019re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren\u2019t doing what Kogan did here.The third thing is, it\u2019s really important that people know what apps they\u2019ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we\u2019re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven\u2019t used them for three months.But it\u2019s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you\u2019ve connected to and authorized, here\u2019s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity.Now, there\u2019s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we\u2019re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don\u2019t know for certain that they were. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this.The point of what we\u2019re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn\u2019t mean that \u2014 if you\u2019re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people.We took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan\u2019s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn\u2019t have the data, and weren\u2019t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision.Again, we haven\u2019t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can\u2019t say definitively that they actually have data. I\u2019ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here.That\u2019s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data.Now, the good news here is that these problems aren\u2019t necessarily rocket science. They\u2019re hard, but they\u2019re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they\u2019re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere.One of the things that gives me confidence is that we\u2019ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France.In last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven\u2019t talked about publicly before, so you\u2019re the first people I\u2019m telling about that.I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we\u2019re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It\u2019s not all A.I., right? There\u2019s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we\u2019re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We\u2019ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it\u2019s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.The last thing I\u2019d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It\u2019s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the \u201990s, now they\u2019re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we\u2019ve made, like O.K., if you\u2019re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can\u2019t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I\u2019d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other\u2019s elections, there\u2019s no way I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible to know every issue that you\u2019re going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community.It\u2019s certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I\u2019ve made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that\u2019s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We\u2019ve launched product after product that didn\u2019t work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that\u2019s what people in our community would want.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian News Outlets Boycott Parliament After Harassment Decision", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Numerous Russian news media outlets vowed on Thursday to curtail their coverage of the State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament, a day after its ethics commission exonerated a lawmaker accused of sexual harassment by several female journalists.Some two dozen publications have declared a boycott of the 14-member commission and of the lawmaker, Leonid E. Slutsky, a member from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, a right-wing nationalist group, who is the chairman of the international affairs committee. Some organizations said they were stopping all professional interaction with Mr. Slutsky, while others like the popular Ekho Moskvy radio station announced a broader ban, withdrawing reporters from the Duma altogether.\u201cEkho Moskvy considers the State Duma an unsafe work location for journalists of both sexes,\u201d said Aleksei A. Venediktov, the station\u2019s editor in chief. The Parliament is widely viewed as a rubber stamp for the Kremlin, and its members rank among the least popular public officials in Russia.In 2016 there was a brief national public discussion when hundreds of women began posting firsthand accounts of sexual abuse and harassment on Facebook under the hashtag \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of saying.\u201d But that quickly died out.Mr. Slutsky denied all the accusations and turned to Facebook to mock his accusers. He and some of his fellow lawmakers, including the speaker of the Duma, Vyacheslav V. Volodin, suggested that the accusations were part of an anti-Russian campaign on the eve of the Russian presidential election.\u201cAttempts to make a Russian Harvey Weinstein of Slutsky look very much like a cheap, shoddy provocation,\u201d Mr. Slutsky wrote on Facebook, suggesting that the complaints would go nowhere.However, at least one member of Parliament, Oksana V. Pushkina, sided with the journalists. She pledged to submit an amendment to Russian law to provide a legal framework for prosecution of sexual harassment, which it currently lacks.On Wednesday, the Parliament\u2019s ethics commission took up the case, sifting through evidence that included the transcript of a conversation in which Mr. Slutsky suggested to a reporter from the Russian-language service of the BBC that she could become his mistress.The ethics panel ruled the same day as the hearing that it had not observed \u201cany breaches in the standards of conduct\u201d by Mr. Slutsky. The chairman of the commission, Otari I. Arshba, hinted that the journalists seemed to have plotted together, and that some waited too long after the incident \u2014 several years \u2014 before coming forward.Some reporters took to Twitter to mock the report, suggesting that the very problem was that the Duma did not consider Mr. Slutsky\u2019s actions to be out of the ordinary.On Thursday, after the various news organizations announced that they would not interact with Mr. Slutsky, some of their reporters were not allowed into the building at all.Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, declined to comment on the issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Virtual Currency Offerings May Hit a New Peak with Telegram Coin Sale", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It took Facebook seven years to raise $1 billion from investors. Uber did it in five.When programmers or entrepreneurs launch an I.C.O., what they are really doing is selling their own virtual currencies in order to raise money for software they say they are building. In return for real money, investors receive digital tokens, similar to Bitcoin.Telegram\u2019s supercharged fund-raising has become the most visible and perhaps most lucrative example of an I.C.O. The company has taken in $850 million over the past two months from some of the biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, and it is now aiming to raise another $850 million over the next month or so. A third $850 million round is in the works after that, according to documents associated with the offering.Telegram already runs a popular messaging service. It plans to use the new money to create both an online currency for ordinary people \u2014 outside the control of governments \u2014 and a new kind of global computing network, combining the attributes of existing virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Despite Mr. Durov\u2019s credentials, the tech world is divided on the wisdom of putting money into his fund-raising campaign.Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent venture firms have signed up to invest in the project, including Benchmark, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, according to two people briefed on the private deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly.But the venture capitalists who have invested the most in the virtual currency space, like Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock and Polychain Capital, have stayed away.\u201cIt\u2019s a pitch that sounds good to V.C.s that haven\u2019t participated but makes no sense to people that have been in the space,\u201d said Nick Tomaino, the founder of a virtual currency investment fund, 1confirmation, that didn\u2019t invest in Telegram.The most obvious reason to be skeptical of the project is that there is not even a prototype \u2014 just a 132-page paper promising what the system will look like one day. The Telegram team is promising to release the software late this year or next year.What\u2019s more, Telegram is promising to do more than any other virtual currency and to fix the intractable problems that have plagued virtual currencies like Bitcoin, such as overcoming the network\u2019s difficulty handling all the transactions that have poured onto the network as it has become more popular.An analyst at one virtual currency-focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital, wrote a scathing essay noting that the Telegram team has given no evidence that they will be able to solve the problems that have dogged everyone else.Telegram representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Believers in the Telegram project have said that the company has a team of developers that have already proved themselves by building two incredibly popular tech products, VKontakte and Telegram.Since then, Mr. Durov and his brother, who is said to be the technical genius behind the projects, have built Telegram into a messaging giant with nearly 200 million users. (When Facebook raised a billion dollars, it already had half a billion users.)The Telegram app has been popular in authoritarian countries because it promises that all messages are encrypted and protected from government snooping. Its pro-privacy stance has made it popular with many in the virtual currency community.The virtual currency network that Telegram is building, known as the Telegram Open Network, or TON, would allow users of the Telegram app to send each other payments when they are not in the same country. It would be a Bitcoin equivalent to the popular payment systems that messaging programs like WeChat have built.\u201cTON can become a VISA/Mastercard alternative for the new decentralized economy,\u201d said a TON primer that was sent to investors. \u201cWe believe that a whole new economy saturated with goods and services sold for cryptocurrency will be born.\u201dThe Telegram Open Network will use the idea of the blockchain, first introduced by Bitcoin, to maintain all the records of Telegram\u2019s currency, known as the Gram, on computers around the world, without any central authority. But Telegram is promising that its blockchains will do much more than Bitcoin: serve as the basis for a global super computer, somewhat like the popular Ethereum network.The Telegram documents say that 5 billion Grams will initially be released to users. The investors who put the first $850 million into the project paid 37 cents for each token, according to offering documents.The next round of investors, expected to come together over the next month, will pay about three and half times that for each Gram. If the current round raises another $850 million, Telegram said in documents that it may hold yet another round, to raise $850 million more.The price that Telegram is charging in the current fund-raising round \u2014 $1.33 a Gram \u2014 assumes the entire currency will grow to be worth at least $6.6 billion. There are already eight virtual currencies worth that much, and all the Bitcoin in the world were worth around $185 billion on Sunday. Given Telegram\u2019s experience, many investors think it won\u2019t be hard to achieve that long term value.Telegram\u2019s team has also been careful to stay on the right side of the law, only offering their token to accredited investors, and working with the established Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.Despite those precautions, many virtual currency investors said the Telegram offering was too risky.\u201cThis is an order of magnitude larger than any of the most hyped I.C.O.s we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Joe DiPasquale, the founder of BitBull Capital, a hedge fund. \u201cAs an investor who looks at a lot of projects in this space, that for me is a concern.\u201dFollow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopperAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Cooking in That Egg Spoon? A Bite-Size Culture War", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the great food culture wars of the 21st century, the egg-spoon skirmishes may one day be remembered as pivotal.Recent conflicts over this long-handled cooking tool have fostered a new social-media meme, a fresh front in the #MeToo movement and a handcrafted version that costs $250, not to mention new volleys lobbed by Alice Waters and Anthony Bourdain.But every war is steeped in history. The first egg-spoon dust-up occurred in 2009, after Ms. Waters, the spiritual mother of all that is organic and sustainable, cooked Lesley Stahl an egg in an iron spoon she held over a fire in her Berkeley, Calif., kitchen for a segment of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\u201cI liked that feeling of watching it and holding it,\u201d Ms. Waters said in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not like cooking it in a pan. You just feel like you\u2019re really in charge of it. It\u2019s so elemental. It\u2019s really primitive, in a way.\u201dIn the opposing camp were people happy to discover a slow, delicious way to make those farm eggs that they had worked so hard to find. Even if the egg spoon was merely aspirational, it set the bar for a simpler way of cooking and eating \u2014 one in which a fire-roasted egg slipped onto levain toast seemed the antidote to an unthinking, tech-dominated culture fueled by unhealthy, overly processed food.The egg spoon became a mark of insider status and a tool of seduction. Food writers like Daniel Duane, whom Ms. Waters hired to work at the Chez Panisse Foundation, fell prey.After drinking her daily \u201cMason jar half-full of black tea and half-full of organic lactose-free whole milk and maple syrup,\u201d Ms. Adler cooked an egg in a spoon over coals.Even she knew it had baggage. \u201cThough I cringe to admit it,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI not only own, but love, a hand-forged egg spoon.\u201dThe smoldering war was reignited. Over drinks and on social media, mocking ensued. The hand-forged egg spoon was recast as the new silver spoon.But social context is everything. This is the post-Harvey Weinstein era, when gender imbalance, assault and harassment in professional kitchens have been laid bare. The egg spoon has caught a ride on a new wave of kitchen feminism. Egg-spoon haters now find themselves under attack.Ms. Waters has never marketed frying pans or signed her name to stoves. But this time the stakes were high enough, Ms. Singer said: \u201cThis is attitudinal and atmospheric.\u201dStill, $250 for a spoon? Doesn\u2019t that just play into the hands of the haters?\u201cThe price of the spoon is beside the point,\u201d Ms. Singer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s ridiculous is that we treat men and women differently. I have never heard the word \u2018precious\u2019 used with a man who has promoted some little specialized gadget.\u201dFor her part, Ms. Waters is as much a supportive parent as she is the figurehead of the spoon wing of the #MeToo movement. \u201cIt is hilarious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut in another way, I want young boys to hold that spoon, too. I want them to feel the sense of the fire and the closeness to the simplicity of it. It helps you become sensitive. We are hoping men become sensitive and we find each other in that place.\u201dAnd what of Mr. Bourdain, the original egg-spoon skeptic? He concedes that there is a bit of sexism baked into the egg-spoon wars, but for him, the issue isn\u2019t gender equity. It\u2019s stupidity.\u201cI am quite sure male chefs have committed far, far worse crimes in the cause of pretentious and pomposity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is plenty of silliness out there to make fun of on both sides.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg\u2019s most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child\u2019s debate competition.Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value in the last couple of days.

In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook\u2019s users more secure, with more control of their data.Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company\u2019s business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.\u201cMy guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,\u201d she said.\u201cCalm down.

Some neo-Nazi groups use the number 18 to signify the letters of Hitler\u2019s first and last names in the alphabet.At least some letters \u2014 they also promote acid attacks and torture \u2014 appeared to have been mailed out of Sheffield, the group said.She said, \u201cI would urge our communities to be vigilant but not frightened,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u201cWe are stronger when we stand together as one and will not be divided. #WeStandTogether.\u201dThe letters lash out at Britain and countries elsewhere in Europe with migrant, minority and Muslim populations.\u201cAre you a sheep like the vast majority of the population? Sheep follow orders and are easily led,\u201d it says. \u201cThey are allowing the white-majority nations of Europe and North America to become overrun by those who would like nothing more than to do us harm and to turn our democracies into sharia-led police states.\u201dMr. Ahmed, the councilor, said in an interview that his letter arrived on Friday after being posted on Feb. 7 from Yorkshire. \u201cAll it had was the number of the property, the name of the road and the ZIP code.\u201dThe residents of the area where he lives in Bradford, a historic town in northern England, are of predominantly Pakistani and Muslim heritage, he said by phone, adding, \u201cMy guess is that the letter was meant to terrorize and cause discord within the various communities.\u201d\u201cBut we tend to rise above that in Bradford; we are very, very proud,\u201d he said. \u201cI came to this country when I was 12 years old from Pakistan. I\u2019ve seen far worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Hollywood, Cutting the Cord and Other Disruptions", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Brooks Barnes, who covers the entertainment industry from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.As our Hollywood reporter, what are some of your favorite tech tools for staying on top of your beat?Confession: When I saw this question, I had a minor panic attack and typed \u201ctech I should be using now\u201d into Google. I\u2019m one of those reporters who still take notes by hand. Appointments are written down in a planner that I haul everywhere. The TVs in my home office and on my desk in the bureau are those 700-pound box models with built-in VCRs, the kind that Goodwill won\u2019t accept anymore. (Sneer all you want. They work just fine.)But there are a few iPhone apps that I use frequently. One is Feedly, which collects articles from across the web in real time. I started relying on it when Google Reader went kaput in 2013, and I find Feedly easier to use than Twitter when keeping tabs on certain areas of my beat. I cover Disney, for example, and there are tons of obscure theme park blogs. I follow about 40 of them with Feedly, which makes it easy to swipe through dozens of items (headline plus the top of the story) in a few seconds.The other app I use a lot is IMDBpro, which is a subscription database with contact information for about 300,000 people in Hollywood. You can\u2019t look up Dwayne Johnson\u2019s mobile number, but you can quickly locate his agent, lawyer and publicist. I don\u2019t know how this is possible, but IMDBpro, which is owned by Amazon, became available as an app only in December.How have you seen tech change Hollywood in the years that you've covered entertainment?Immeasurably. I started covering the entertainment business 14 years ago. There was no YouTube. Netflix was still a tiny DVD-by-mail company. Buying a movie ticket online was not the norm. Video-on-demand was called pay-per-view and mostly existed for boxing matches and porn.One of the biggest and more interesting changes, at least to me, involves institutional arrogance \u2014 a deep-seated belief at studios, formed over decades of undisputed dominance, that nobody tells them what to do, including their customers. We will cast whom we want. We will tell the stories we want. And you will buy tickets, even if that means tricking you with marketing that makes something unwatchable look like a masterpiece.But that era is over. Social networks and sites like Rotten Tomatoes have empowered the masses. And Hollywood is still coming to grips with that. I ran into a studio executive a couple weeks ago who was fuming that she wasn\u2019t able to \u201ccheat\u201d an opening weekend \u2014 using marketing to cloak a bad movie \u2014 because angry ticket buyers immediately started spreading the word to their friends on Facebook and Snapchat.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?We love it. There is nothing about cable we miss. We have the latest iteration of Apple TV, which magically pulls together shows and movies from across the streaming services we use. Its integration of Siri is fantastic, allowing you to start watching almost anything with a voice command.And we love to go searching through free services like Pluto TV, which recreates the traditional cable experience with internet channels. Pluto has some well-known news networks like Cheddar and CNBC, but the thrill lies in flipping through one offbeat channel after another \u2014 one the other night had just a live stream view of a pond, and another seemed to consist of nothing but videos of buxom women posing next to dirt bikes.What don\u2019t you like about streaming services?I hate the Hulu interface. It feels counterintuitive to me. And every time we turn it on, \u201cAmerican Dad!\u201d \u2014 not something we would ever watch \u2014 seems to pop up as a suggested viewing option.With Netflix, I wish there was an easy way to zap straight back to MyList rather than having to scroll through the whole roster of suggestions every time. (\u201cBecause you watched \u2018London Spy,\u2019\u201d or whatever.) I have no real complaints about HBO Now except that the series offerings sometimes feel a bit sparse next to Netflix.The CBS app freezes up the most. Maybe it\u2019s the cosmos telling me that there are better ways to decompress than watching a soap opera? At any rate, I generally solve it by rebooting the Apple box.Advertisement"}

There are no rendition programs or extraditions here. (Shelby Prichard, Spyscape\u2019s chief of staff, who previously worked for the 9/11 Museum, said that the information gathered here was not shared externally or sold.)In a timely way, Spyscape shows us what we know, but choose to ignore: that espionage and spying are not only the stuff of extraordinary tales or specialists\u2019 tools.

{"Headline": "West Virginia Raises Teachers\u2019 Pay to End Statewide Strike", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The statewide teachers\u2019 strike that shuttered West Virginia schools for almost two weeks appeared all but over on Tuesday when Gov. James C. Justice signed a bill to give teachers and other state employees a 5 percent pay raise.A crowd of teachers wearing the red T-shirts that have come to symbolize their strike cheered as Mr. Justice, a Republican, signed the pay raise bill in a theater on the Capitol grounds. The bill had been passed unanimously earlier in the day by both houses of the Republican-controlled Legislature.\u201cWe\u2019re going to school tomorrow,\u201d said Heather Acord, an elementary schoolteacher from Wayne County, with relief obvious on her face. \u201cWe got everything we asked for.\u201dUnlike a previous proposed raise that was backed by Mr. Justice and the State House of Delegates, the deal reached on Tuesday had the support of Mitch Carmichael, the president of the State Senate. Mr. Carmichael said the deal would probably lead to painful cuts in other parts of the state budget; another Republican senator, Craig Blair, said in a conference committee that Medicaid would be among the areas cut.\u201cThese things come at a cost,\u201d Mr. Carmichael said.But as he signed the bill, Mr. Justice tried to dispel the suggestion that the pay raise would come at the expense of Medicaid recipients.\u201cThere\u2019s not a chance on this planet that\u2019s going to be the case,\u201d Mr. Justice said. \u201cWe have cash in the balances in Medicaid that will absolutely backstop any cuts whatsoever from Medicaid.\u201dThe strike ground the state\u2019s public schools to a halt for nine days, a remarkable show of defiance by the teachers in a state where the power of organized labor, once led by strong mining unions, has greatly diminished. Along the way, the teachers disregarded union leaders\u2019 advice to return to work when the governor first promised them the raise last week, deciding in meetings at malls and union halls and in Facebook groups that they would stay out until their raise was enacted in law.\u201cMaybe our voices are being heard, finally,\u201d said Danielle Harris, a third-grade teacher from Fayette County, whose eyes filled with tears after Mr. Justice announced the deal on Tuesday. \u201cThese strikes aren\u2019t for nothing.\u201dDale Lee, the president of the West Virginia Education Association, one of the teachers\u2019 unions, said the pay raise was probably sufficient to get teachers back to the classroom. School systems in some of the state\u2019s 55 counties, including Kanawha and Putnam, announced even before Mr. Justice signed the pay raise bill that they would reopen on Wednesday.\u201cIt appears the strike will end,\u201d Mr. Lee said after the deal was announced.The pay raise was the main point of contention in the final days of the strike, but the teachers have also demanded some relief from sharply rising health insurance costs. The governor has promised to address that issue through a state task force. Both union leaders and rank-and-file teachers have welcomed that move.\u201cI think it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d said Kerry Guerini, a teacher from Fayette County, who stood in the Capitol on Tuesday with a sign that said, \u201cWill teach for insurance.\u201d\u201cA 5 percent raise isn\u2019t going to feel like very much when we have so much coming out for insurance,\u201d Ms. Guerini said. Nevertheless, she added, \u201cI\u2019m ready to go back.\u201dMr. Carmichael, whose resistance to the raises had made him a key antagonist for the striking teachers, insisted on Tuesday that he did not want to pass anything \u201cjust to appease a special-interest group.\u201d The deal came about, he said, because lawmakers decided to offset the cost of the raises with budget cuts, rather than rely on optimistic revenue estimates the governor had offered.The raises for state workers were expected to cost the state treasury a total of about $110 million a year. Some of the money for the raises would be redirected from amounts the governor had requested for tourism promotion and the state Department of Commerce, but lawmakers in the Senate said additional spending cuts would probably be required. Mr. Blair, the Republican who heads the Senate\u2019s Finance Committee, said in a meeting that some of the money could be taken from Medicaid.Mr. Carmichael told reporters that the scale of Medicaid cuts was \u201cnot absolutely determined,\u201d because lawmakers were still \u201cscouring the budget\u201d for more places to cut.The prospect nevertheless alarmed some Democratic lawmakers.\u201cI want to make sure there\u2019s not a back-room deal here that\u2019s punishing people who are too poor to go to the doctor,\u201d Michael A. Woelfel, a Democrat, said on the Senate floor. \u201cDon\u2019t do this on the backs of the Medicaid recipients.\u201dThe teachers, who do not have a labor contract with the state, are among the lowest paid in the nation, on average, and had not had an across-the-board raise in four years. They walked off the job Feb. 22, saying they had been pushed to the brink by low pay and rising costs in their health insurance plan.\u201cTeachers across the state came together for one goal,\u201d said Renita Benson, 54, a remedial reading teacher from Calhoun County, who stood near the Capitol\u2019s soaring rotunda on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not the raise, as much as it is having the respect that we deserve from the government, and I think that was proven today.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the lower house of the West Virginia legislature. It is the House of Delegates, not the House of Representatives.Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from Pittsburgh, and Dana Goldstein from New York.Advertisement"}

And, instead of minced lamb or beef, the filling is made with duck. It was originally devised as a way to use leftover roast duck and gravy, the meat pulled from the carcass to make an irresistibly homey dish.I had no meaty duck leftovers, but it sounded so delicious that I went out and bought a few duck legs and braised them with wine and aromatic vegetables. Then I pulled the meat from the bones, chopped it and simmered it in a quick gravy for a rich and delicious filling. Topped with the earthy blend of fragrant mashed parsnip and potato, and baked until bubbly and browned, it may be the best shepherd\u2019s pie I have ever eaten. I highly recommend it.But to be true to the spirit of the recipe, you should feel free to replace the duck with other combinations of leftover braised meats, vegetables or mushrooms.

{"Headline": "Our Newest Culture Warriors: Activist C.E.O.s", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIn the wake of the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., companies like Delta, Hertz and Symantec distanced themselves from the National Rifle Association by eliminating benefits to their members.Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which owns 35 Field and Stream stores (which feature hunting gear and supplies), took it a step further: The company announced that it had unilaterally raised the age limit for firearms sales and stopped selling the AR-15, the weapon used in Parkland and other recent mass shootings. The chief executive, Edward Stack, said that the company was \u201cgoing to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and, hopefully, bring people along into the conversation.\u201d Less than 24 hours later, Walmart joined Dick\u2019s in raising the age limit on firearm sales (Walmart stopped selling AR-15s years ago).Some companies have benefited, through gains in popularity or even sales, by taking such stands. Patagonia reportedly saw a revenue surge after announcing its lawsuit against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash the size of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah. My research with Michael Toffel of Harvard Business School finds that consumers were more likely to buy Apple products after hearing Tim Cook\u2019s statement opposing Indiana\u2019s religious freedom bill.But other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench, as Target did when hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition in protest of its trans-inclusive bathroom policy. The chief executive of Papa John\u2019s, who blamed the National Football League\u2019s handling of the national anthem controversy for his company\u2019s declining sales, stepped down after he was criticized for his comments.What has not happened in any of these cases is a cooling of partisan tensions. Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements, which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the so-called bathroom bill, a culture war still festers.C.E.O. activism has typically not brought people together, working from the middle out. Instead, this type of activism, largely from the progressive side, has begun to galvanize conservatives. For example, in Georgia, lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the N.R.A.In the short term, Dick\u2019s will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so-called negative partisanship \u2014 an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party \u2014 are infecting our society. There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dick\u2019s stores to vote with their wallets. Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers.But the real story will be the long game. C.E.O. activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics. Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse, however, our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy. Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us, chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war, just like university presidents, celebrities, professional athletes and religious leaders before them.Brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue, strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel. Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns, with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones.Mainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians \u2014 that is, a rare, perhaps extinct, species in today\u2019s political environment. Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today, but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors.Most companies are not prepared for this new world of politics. Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns; there will be many more. As more companies take stands, those remaining will be named and shamed on social media, creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option.Like our politicians, corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their (customer) base will react. Like pollsters, they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with. The right answer will vary by a company\u2019s geographic location, who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation.There is no going back. Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side. The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession, forcing companies to take stands on just about everything.Much of this is a reflection of who we have become. Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want, and they do that by appealing to our identities. In 2018, for many Americans, our political identity seems to define us more than ever. It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook, whom we marry, what news we read and where we live.

{"Headline": "Facebook Made Him a Billionaire. Now He\u2019s a Critic.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Silicon Valley experiences a wave of criticism, even some former colleagues are becoming adversaries.Another prominent skeptic spoke out this week, as a creator of one of Facebook\u2019s top products waded into criticism of the internet giant.Mr. Acton\u2019s anti-Facebook message, retweeted more than 10,000 times, captured a moment in the tech industry when even some of its best-known people are publicly calling for change. The chorus has grown louder this week, as Facebook faces questions over how it allowed a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to obtain data on 50 million users.\u201cThe question is, \u2018What are you loyal to?\u2019\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former Google employee who has started The Center for Humane Technology, an organization for Silicon Valley workers who want to change corporate culture. He has been critical of social media companies for creating addictive products that inflame cultural tensions.\u201cAre you more loyal to your company,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cOr are you more loyal to protecting the fabric of our society?\u201dThe tech defections have accelerated in recent months, especially for Facebook.\u201cMore people are speaking up because they feel like they\u2019ve been told lies,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just repeat, \u2018We\u2019re making the world more open\u2019 over and over and over again while democracy is burning.\u201dSilicon Valley companies have long prized secrecy and loyalty among their workers, who often exercise, play sports and eat three meals a day together. Facebook especially is known for its tight-knit community. Each employee has an annual \u201cFaceversary\u201d on his or her hire date, a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons.\u201cUntil very recently, it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, the author of Troublemakers, a history of Silicon Valley.She said the defections she sees now are historically unique.\u201cThe Valley was founded on this notion of, \u2018We\u2019re very open,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Berlin said. \u201cBut the secrecy has always been there.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something new.\u201dEmployees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley\u2019s success, both technologically and financially. The technology platforms have become more powerful \u2014 and the fortunes much bigger \u2014 than the programmers ever expected. So while the industry\u2019s power disturbs them, the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution, Ms. Berlin said.\u201cIt\u2019s the shadow of the success,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand them together.\u201dCertainly, not everyone is critical. Mr. Acton\u2019s WhatsApp co-founder, Jan Koum, is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform, regularly posting pro-President Trump and anti-immigration news.And when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook, the company has often responded aggressively.\u201cThey do yell,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, referring to Facebook leadership\u2019s approach.But the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore, he said.\"Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on,\u201d Mr. McNamee said. \u201cThe facts are not only indisputable, they\u2019re not even complete. It\u2019s going to get worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Adding a grated garlic clove to the dressing is the height of my after-work ambitions.\u201cI\u2019d see all this beautiful produce piled up, and I was never satisfied with two little bags,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d have to buy it by the case and figure out what to do with it.\u201dMuch experimentation later, there\u2019s nothing she\u2019s uncomfortable putting in a salad, as long as the combination makes sense \u2014 though, she adds, \u201cwhat makes sense to me might be more broadly defined than to most people.\u201dCase in point: Her salad of tofu skins, edamame, Chinese preserved cabbage and raw mustard greens. It sounds bizarre, tastes wonderful: silky, tangy, crunchy and very fresh.Other recipes are more intuitive, though they still have surprising twists. To a simple salad of zucchini ribbons and squash blossoms, she adds slivers of Gouda for creaminess, pumpkin seeds for crunch and dandelion greens for what she describes as \u201cthe fluffy factor.\u201dHer red potato salad is layered with chorizo and roasted grapes. She tosses red cabbage with chickpeas and tahini for a rich, multitextured slaw.But what really inspired me was her take on dips for crudit\u00e9s, which I\u2019m going to incorporate into my Passover Seder this year. After dipping the greens, herbs and vegetables into the requisite salt water (symbolizing the tears of the enslaved Israelites), I plan to leave the vegetables on the table during dinner, and bring out several of Ms. Rosen\u2019s recipes for continued dipping.There\u2019s her sweet lime salt, an intriguing combination of sugar, salt and grated lime zest for sprinkling on cucumbers, radishes and the like; a luscious avocado-mint cream; and a tangy cilantro cumin dip that also would make a good sauce for the gefilte fish.None of this may sound strictly like salad, but that\u2019s Ms. Rosen\u2019s point. And it\u2019s saladish enough for me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Please Don\u2019t Flush the Toilet. It\u2019s Raining.", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeed another excuse to put off washing dirty dishes or doing laundry?How about this: It\u2019s raining outside.New York City is calling on residents in parts of Brooklyn and Queens to cut back their water use during rainstorms by postponing showers and other chores \u2014 even waiting to flush toilets. The reason is that household sewage flows into the same underground sewer pipes that also collect rainwater runoff from rooftops and streets.When those pipes are overloaded with rainwater, the combined overflow is then discharged directly into nearby rivers, bays and creeks instead of going to wastewater treatment plants.Angela Licata, a deputy commissioner for the Department of Environmental Protection, said that in about 60 percent of the city\u2019s sewer system, the same pipe is used to collect rainwater and sewage from homes and businesses, mainly in areas with older infrastructure. It was not until the 1950s that the city began building separate lines to avoid overloading the sewer system. \u201cWe\u2019re grappling with this very difficult legacy problem,\u201d she said.In total, the city has 14 wastewater treatment plants that process an average of 1.3 billion gallons of sewage on rainless days. They can generally handle up to 3 billion gallons per day.The new campaign aims to reduce the combined sewer overflows into Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile-long waterway that forms part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens; and Bowery Bay, and Flushing Bay and Flushing Creek in northern Queens.To sign up volunteers, the city will run ads on Facebook, partner with local environmental groups, and mail fliers to about 30,000 homes in two dozen neighborhoods that lie in the drainage areas for those waterways, including Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Astoria, Steinway, Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, and Corona. The campaign will focus on those living in single-family homes because their water usage data will be easier to collect and analyze, according to city officials who hope to eventually expand it to apartment buildings too.One recruitment pitch compares the overflows to a familiar problem: \u201cIt\u2019s like rush hour on the freeway: there\u2019s only so much road and if everyone uses it at the same time, it can get jammed. And just like rush hour, the best thing to do is avoid it.\u201dCity officials will monitor real-time rainfall data at the Newtown Creek and Bowery Bay treatment plants to determine when combined sewer overflows are likely. Once gauges at the plants register a half-inch of rainfall, volunteers will be sent a text message asking them to wait to use water. After the storm ends, and plant operations return to normal, they will receive a second text thanking them.The new campaign has cost about $120,000 to develop and put into effect.It grew out of an earlier effort by the Newtown Creek Alliance, which enlisted several dozen residents to curtail water use during rainstorms in 2014. Two years later, officials expanded upon that idea for a six-month pilot project in neighborhoods around Newtown Creek, enlisting 379 volunteers from more than 200 buildings. Of those, only nine quit the program, mostly because they were moving away from the area.During the pilot project, volunteers were asked to wait a total of 13 times \u2014 with the average wait lasting a little over seven hours. By the end, there was a 5 percent drop in the average daily water consumption in the buildings where the volunteers lived.Sarah Lilley, 52, a freelance public radio producer in Williamsburg, did not find it hard to give up water at certain times. She postponed showers and kept toilet flushing to a minimum. \u201cYou\u2019re just talking about a rainstorm, you\u2019re not talking about a weeklong blizzard,\u201d she said.Ms. Lilley became so well trained that she continued to do those things on her own after the pilot project ended. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knows that I could have had the sink running for 45 minutes after that dinner party and I didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the amount of water I did not use \u2014 and I can envision it not flowing down the street, and not picking up trash as it goes.\u201dAnother volunteer, Sarah Balistreri, 38, a school curriculum specialist who lives in Greenpoint, said she sometimes had to shower before going to work, but she made it quick. And she washed laundry if it was her only block of time to get it done for the week. \u201cI felt bad,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a perfect participant.\u201dBut those were the exceptions. \u201cMy behavior over all has changed,\u201d said Ms. Balistreri, who kayaks on Newtown Creek and has enjoyed the benefits of cleaner water firsthand.To make sure she never missed a text, she even programmed the number into her cellphone along with an image of a poop emoji. It\u2019s still on her phone.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cof what this is all about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Do Birds Flock Together? Australians Are Mailing In Feathers to Help Find Out ", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "Kate Brandis, an Australian researcher, has enlisted the public to help her track elusive waterfowl as the country\u2019s wetlands disappear.Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 One day in April 2016, Kate Brandis opened a weathered envelope, mailed to her from suburban Sydney. Instead of a letter inside, she found the feathers of an Australian white ibis. A day or so later, another envelope arrived, stuffed with more feathers. In the days following, more began to come.Soon, Dr. Brandis, who is a research fellow at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Center for Ecosystem Science, was receiving three to four envelopes a day containing the feathers of birds from across Australia, including those of pelicans, wood ducks, cormorants, herons and spoonbills.\u201cWhen our floodplains flood, which is only every couple of years, these birds come together in the hundreds of thousands to breed,\u201d Dr. Brandis said. But when the water recedes, the birds disband. \u201cYou don\u2019t see them again for years,\u201d she said.The birds\u2019 mysterious movements have long baffled Dr. Brandis and others in her field: Where do the birds come from, and where do they go afterward? \u201cBecause we don\u2019t track our birds, we have no idea,\u201d she said.Bird feathers, like human hair and nails, are made of a protein called keratin. As the feathers grow, the keratin keeps a record of the bird\u2019s diet, much like the rings of a tree. By analyzing a section of a feather, Dr. Brandis and her team can get a snapshot of the bird\u2019s diet while the feather was developing.Feathers from chicks \u2014 which have spent their entire lives at one wetland \u2014 are particularly useful to researchers, providing what Dr. Brandis and her team call a \u201cfingerprint\u201d of each place. By comparing the diet record of adult feathers against this information, researchers hope to map which wetlands the birds have been using, and how healthy those wetlands are.The information could help prioritize wetlands for protection and management. Since 1971, 65 Australian wetlands have been designated as significant under the Ramsar Convention, an international conservation treaty. \u201cIt puts even more pressure on wetland managers to get it right,\u201d Dr. Brandis said, adding that she was hoping to have results by the end of the year.Previous studies have used similar techniques to track monarch butterflies in North America and birds in Europe, but Dr. Brandis is the first to do this kind of work in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s very ambitious and it\u2019s kind of neat,\u201d said Keith A. Hobson, a professor of biological and geological sciences at Western University in Canada, who led the study of monarchs in 2004. Dr. Hobson said he liked the idea of using birds to learn more about wetlands, rather than the other way around. \u201cIt\u2019s flipping it on its head,\u201d he said.At the nuclear agency, researchers are using similar techniques to identify the origins of fish and prawns that they suspect may be falsely labeled as locally farmed or caught. Working with the Taronga Zoo in suburban Sydney, Dr. Brandis has also tested the quills of captive and wild echidnas, in the hope of developing a similar tool that could identify animals that have been poached. (Echidnas are difficult to breed in captivity, yet dozens of purportedly captive-bred animals are exported every year.)Dr. Brandis said the possibilities were endless when studying animals\u2019 tissue for clues about their environments, their habits and their origins. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, for citizen scientists like Mrs. Kemp and her husband, the feather-mapping project has inspired a new passion. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really into birds,\u201d Mrs. Kemp said. \u201cBut now, we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They totaled $184 billion in the 12 months through the end of September 2017. That makes China the United States\u2019 fourth-largest export market after the European Union, Canada and Mexico. The United States, however, imports far more from China than it exports, which means the deficit with China is far larger than it is with Mexico and the European Union.- Peter EavisMany Theranos investors have lost the entire value of their investment. The losses for [Rupert] Murdoch, once the company\u2019s largest investor, total more than $100 million, people familiar with the matter said.

Here are a few of the ones they found:In 2005\u201cAll the bond bears have been dead wrong in predicting sky-high mortgage rates.

{"Headline": "Madison Square Garden Has Used Face-Scanning Technology on Customers", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMadison Square Garden has quietly used facial-recognition technology to bolster security and identify those entering the building, according to multiple people familiar with the arena\u2019s security procedures.The technology uses cameras to capture images of people, and then an algorithm compares the images to a database of photographs to help identify the person and, when used for security purposes, to determine if the person is considered a problem. The technology, which is sometimes used for marketing and promotions, has raised concerns over personal privacy and the security of any data that is stored by the system.\u201cMSG continues to test and explore the use of new technologies to ensure we\u2019re employing the most effective security procedures to provide a safe and wonderful experience for our guests,\u201d the Garden said in a statement.A spokeswoman for the Garden declined to answer questions about the use of face-scanning technology.It is unclear when the face-scanning system was installed. The people familiar with the Garden\u2019s use of the technology, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it, said they did not know how many events at the Garden in recent months have used it or how the data has been handled.\u201cIn a lot of places we will see facial recognition framed positively as just an extension of video surveillance,\u201d said Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center. \u201cBut the reality is it is a way to require, or in secret, have everyone in a crowd show their papers, essentially, to compare them to a big enough database.\u201dThe Garden \u2014 home to the N.B.A.\u2019s Knicks and the N.H.L.\u2019s Rangers, and host to events like boxing matches, concerts and the Grammy Awards \u2014 was already known for having tight security. There is always a heavy police presence in part because the arena is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and is built above Pennsylvania Station, the nation\u2019s busiest rail terminal. Fans attending events go through security screening that can include metal detectors, bag searches and explosive-sniffing dogs.The use of facial recognition technology puts the arena in the vanguard of professional sports facilities. At least two other arenas have experimented with the technology, but teams and leagues are generally unwilling to discuss security protocols, so it is difficult to know for sure how widespread it is.\u201cNothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the fans, players, team and arena staff at our games,\u201d said Mike Bass, a spokesman for the N.B.A. \u201cThe league and our teams are exploring the use of all state-of-the-art technology, including facial recognition, to ensure that we have industry-best security measures to protect all those in our arenas.\u201dThe N.H.L. declined to comment.Although security is the most obvious use of the technology, some independent experts say it is less effective as a security measure for private businesses because they do not have access to various watch lists held by law enforcement agencies. In fact, some vendors and team officials said the customer engagement and marketing capabilities of facial recognition are even more valuable than added security for sports facilities.The software can be used to determine who is allowed into a building, like vendors or workers at a specified employee entrance. Companies may eventually be able to use the technology to increase customer engagement. In the case of an arena, a sports fan might sign up for a loyalty program with a team and attach his image and a credit card to the account. He could then park without paying an attendant, walk in without having a ticket scanned and pay for merchandise and concessions without ever taking out his wallet.Even without fans signing up for anything, the cameras can give teams a much better sense of who is attending a game. Currently, teams might know who originally bought a ticket, but after the ticket enters the secondary market, teams do not necessarily know who is sitting in the seat.\u201cThe days of having 40,000 to 60,000 people in the stadium and not knowing who they are, I think those days are going to disappear,\u201d said Charles Carroll, a senior vice president at IDEMIA, which manages the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s PreCheck program. IDEMIA has partnered with three sports venues on security, including Barclays Center in Brooklyn, to offer expedited lines to enter.Allen Ganz, a director of critical infrastructure at NEC Corporation of America, an industry leader in facial recognition, said his company\u2019s system could \u201cestimate anonymously the age and gender of people coming into the stadium.\u201d An electronic advertising board connected to the system could even be changed depending upon the age and gender of who is standing in front of it.Ganz declined to disclose which sports arenas use NEC technology. Peter Trepp, the chief executive of FaceFirst, said \u201cvery, very few\u201d stadiums and arenas were using facial recognition technology.In addition to Madison Square Garden, at least two other arenas are known to be experimenting with the technology. According to a Sacramento Kings spokeswoman, facial recognition is used to allow players and staff to enter the practice facility connected to the Golden 1 Center, but its use has not expanded to event attendees.The Dallas Mavericks have contracted with Suspect Technologies to experiment with facial recognition outside the team\u2019s locker room and throughout the American Airlines Center.Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, however, said in an email the team needs to \u201cfind the right application that creates so much value people want to use it.\u201d He said that, for now, facial recognition doesn\u2019t improve his arena\u2019s ability to keep out unwanted patrons enough to justify its implementation.\u201cIn the private sector, facial recognition is really only as good as the database it is compared against,\u201d said Michael Downing, the former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief security adviser for the Oak View Group.\u201cWe are in a kind of legal Wild West when it comes to this stuff,\u201d said Jay Stanley, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. While most sports fans may not have a legal right to know their face is being tracked, Stanley said he believed there is an ethical right to know.\u201cI should know if I am being subject to facial recognition if I am going into any business, including a stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if you are just running my face against a list of people who have been banned from the premises and doing nothing else with it. I want to know. I have a right to know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network\u2019s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016.An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica\u2019s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm \u2014 and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics \u2014 under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair.\u201d\u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America,\u201d he added. \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201dBut the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed \u2014 and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm\u2019s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.\u201cThis was a scam \u2014 and a fraud,\u201d Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \u201cWe will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all \u2014 and take action against all offending parties,\u201d Mr. Grewal said.In the United States, Mr. Mercer\u2019s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users\u2019 identities, friend networks and \u201clikes.\u201d Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.\u201cProtecting people\u2019s information is at the heart of everything we do,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cNo systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cit\u2019s a serious abuse of our rules.\u201dThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\u201d he wrote.Mr. Wylie\u2019s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201dMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201dMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201dJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201dIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201dFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201dMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201dBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.Matthew Rosenberg, Nicholas Confessore and Carole Cadwalladr reported from London.

{"Headline": "Reckless Driving and the Limits of Vision Zero", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityThe picture that circulated of Dorothy Bruns after her speeding white Volvo passed through a red light, leaving two children dead in a busy intersection in Brooklyn on Monday, is what initially sparked the rage. Shown on a gurney, sitting upright, an open purse on her lap, her long hair tucked into her black parka, she is texting without any suggestion of misery or even agitation, as if she were simply letting a friend know that she was going to be late for tennis.Her Facebook page quickly swelled with comments from observers who articulated the view that she was a murderer, that she ought to expire in hell and prison, that bad things should happen to her own children. In a city where young black men have routinely landed on Rikers Island for stealing diapers or drinking beer on a sidewalk or jumping a turnstile, it seemed an enraging mystery that Ms. Bruns, a white woman in her 40s from Staten Island, had still not been charged with anything by midweek, despite the fact that she had killed a 4-year-old and a baby and injured the pregnant mother of the older child, an actress named Ruthie Ann Miles.On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who for many years had lived just a few blocks away from the site of the crash, expressed his own dismay. \u201cI wish she was under arrest right now,\u201d he said, a statement that ignores how loose the strictures governing the behavior of drivers actually are.In the vast majority of incidents, Mr. Lander told me, drivers do not get their licenses revoked until they are charged. To get Ms. Bruns\u2019s license taken away temporarily required petitioning a judge, even though city records indicated that during the past two years, the car she was driving had been caught on camera violating speed regulations around schools four times and running red lights on several other occasions.\u201cI said, \u2018Where\u2019s the guy?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wallack recounted recently. He was told that the driver had been released, that the state trooper in charge had done an on-site evaluation and determined that the driver could go. No drug or alcohol test was immediately performed, Mr. Wallack said. \u201cHe was never charged; he got his car back; he didn\u2019t even get a ticket.\u2019\u2019 He had, the police said, a blackout related to diabetes.Through an investigation conducted by the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s office, Mr. Wallack told me, and through his own research, he learned that the driver had been arrested twice for heroin possession during the 18 months preceding the crash. On one of those two occasions he was arrested in his car and sentenced to rehabilitation and clinical work. He was still permitted to keep his car, the car he was driving when Martha Atwater was killed. Mr. Wallack also discovered that the driver had his license suspended in the past.Mr. Wallack lays blame for his wife\u2019s death not on this man ultimately, but on a system that shifts too much of the burden of maintaining public safety onto individuals, on whom we depend to exercise a proper moral authority. Too often, they don\u2019t. \u201cThere were so many opportunities,\u201d Mr. Wallack said, \u201cto stop what happened, along the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Far From Home and Censors, Some Chinese Students Protest Xi\u2019s Power Move", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChinese students have become a significant part of American college life, but they generally have shied away from the political activism of many of their classmates.\u201cNever My President\u201d said the poster that Longxiao Li, 24, put up on Thursday in the library at New York University\u2019s MetroTech campus in Brooklyn. The words were superimposed over a face of Mr. Xi, and were a reference, Mr. Li said, to the lack of democratic elections in China.\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party is an authoritarian dictatorship,\u201d Mr. Li, 24, a graduate student in game design from Shenzhen, said in a telephone interview on Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s never been my president. No one ever elected him.\u201dMr. Li said he felt an obligation to take action, despite possible repercussions if he returned home, after learning of a similar protest at the University of California, San Diego, that has also spread to other campuses, and of an accompanying Twitter campaign.The Twitter handle \u2014 @stopxijinping \u2014 was started March 1 and had gained more than 1,350 followers by the end of the week as well as a retweet by Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s office, which called it a \u201cbold move.\u201d Efforts to reach the people behind that campaign were unsuccessful.The number of Chinese students in the United States has exploded over the last 15 years, as American colleges have tapped into China\u2019s ascendant upper class as a major source of revenue. They are by far the largest contingent of international students, with more than 300,000 studying in the United States every year.Students at the University of California, San Diego, said that they had spotted posters earlier this week at the Price Center, a student center and food court. An English-language version was still up on Friday, but a Chinese version had been removed, according to Charlie Vest, a graduate student in Chinese economic and political affairs. In the past, pro-Beijing students in the United States have mounted counterprotests against students or speakers, like the Dalai Lama, who openly criticize or are seen as threats to the government.How broadly the protests were spreading at each college was unclear. Shiwei Terry Zhou, a senior at U.C. San Diego from Wuhan, said that while some posters had been placed on the campus, he did not think the campaign was having much influence. \u201cMost students are not anti-Xi as far as I know (they really just don\u2019t care),\u201d he said via a Facebook message.Perry Link, a China scholar at the University of California, Riverside, said that such activism was more common immediately after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after which Congress passed a law letting any Chinese student who feared retribution upon return to China to apply immediately for United States residency.\u201cThis rule actually became an incentive for students to speak out, since many were hoping to get green cards in any case,\u201d Dr. Link said. \u201cBut in recent years the external incentives have been powerfully in the opposite direction,\u201d he said, making it unusual for Chinese students in the United States to protest.Mr. Li, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Ohio State University before enrolling at N.Y.U., said later that while he had heard many Chinese students in the United States expressing their objections to the removal of term limits, only a few were willing to speak out publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t think many Chinese students are aware of this movement,\u201d he said.Audrey Jiajia Li contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A \u2018Bright Light,\u2019 Dimmed in the Shadows of Homelessness", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey met on a rainy morning several years ago, at the base of the Helmsley Building in Midtown Manhattan. As others hurried to work, Pamela J. Dearden, an executive with JPMorgan Chase, noticed a woman, unperturbed by the rain or her surroundings, standing on a 36-square-foot sidewalk grate she had chosen as her home.Ms. Dearden, known to everyone as P.J., offered her umbrella to the woman, who took it and thanked her.A friendship blossomed. P.J. would often stop to talk with the woman, who sat amid shopping bags, books, food containers and a metal utility cart. P.J. admired her hardiness, but also her smile, her soft features and her humor. If the woman was sleeping or talking loudly to herself, P.J. held back, but other times she engaged her in short conversations, which could go into unexpected places.The woman\u2019s name was Nakesha Williams. She said she loved novels, and they discussed the authors she was reading, from Jane Austen to Jodi Picoult. She and P.J. chatted as time allowed, or until Nakesha veered into topics that hinted at paranoia: plots and lies against her. Yet, P.J. realized she knew little about Nakesha, and she wondered about her past.Nearly three decades earlier, another woman took notice of Nakesha, then an 18-year-old college freshman, and considered her seemingly boundless future.Sandra Burton, director of the dance program at Williams College in Massachusetts, was struck immediately by Nakesha\u2019s vibrancy and talent as a dancer. She became Nakesha\u2019s teacher and mentor, and she began to closely track her development. Nakesha, she recalled, stood out no matter the setting: the stage, the classroom, even across a kitchen table.But three years after graduation, Ms. Burton and other friends started getting strange phone calls and emails from Nakesha, with bizarre claims she was being followed by strangers. She abandoned people who were close to her and spurned their offers of help. In 2010, more than two decades after they met, Ms. Burton received what would be her last communication from Nakesha, an email in which her former student angrily lashed out at her.Sandra Burton and P.J. Dearden were bookends to a promising life derailed by mental illness and homelessness. But their paths never crossed. One woman held answers to Nakesha\u2019s past, the other to her present.What had happened in between?Over the course of more than a year, I delved into Nakesha\u2019s life, trying to understand the events and forces that put her and so many of the city\u2019s homeless on the street. I spoke with dozens of people and benefited from having access to hundreds of emails that Nakesha sent over the years to friends and others, and scores of meticulously typed letters that she copied at libraries and handed to passers-by. In these, she offered a winding, rudimentary diary of her existence on the street.My effort revealed a deeply complicated, at times contradictory, journey \u2014 a life of spectacular promise undone by demons. No simple answer to the puzzle of Nakesha emerged. But at the same time, another narrative revealed itself: a story of New Yorkers and others who went to extraordinary lengths to try to help her, only to be left frustrated.On her grate at East 46th Street and Park Avenue, Nakesha was surrounded by a collection of strangers who offered their company, care and generosity. Sidewalk vendors watched over her and her belongings. Restaurant owners let her use their restrooms. People like P.J. brought her food and warm clothing.And yet Nakesha continued to spiral downward. She rejected P.J.\u2019s suggestion that she enter a shelter or seek help. \u201cI was like, \u2018I have a friend that you can talk to,\u2019\u201d P.J. recalled telling her, referring to a social worker she knew. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, no, I\u2019m fine.\u2019\u201d P.J. tried again. \u201c\u2018Do you need any medication?\u2019\u201d The answer was no.So P.J. tried to address her other needs. She brought her sandwiches and toiletries. She went online and ordered her a raincoat, a duffel bag, two pairs of black pants, shirts, socks and underwear. She bought a pair of black leather boots that she helped Nakesha pull over her swollen feet. She gave her presents on her birthday and at Christmas.Then one day in August 2016, P.J. realized that she had not seen Nakesha for weeks. With a sense of foreboding, she began to search for her friend.As a student at Woodrow Wilson High School in Camden, N.J., Nakesha had excelled. She was class president and a member of the National Honor Society; she sang in two choirs and worked on the school newspaper.The yearbook described her as one of two students who \u201cdid the most\u201d for their class and school. She graduated in 1988 third in her class of more than 200 seniors, and her college tuition was covered by scholarships, some from local churches.To Nakesha, Williams College, a competitive private liberal arts school in pastoral Berkshire County, must have seemed a world away from home.Yet she adjusted easily. A former classmate, Valda Clark Christian, now a health care executive in Maryland, recalled how Nakesha had warmly introduced her to the relatives who accompanied her to campus. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who met her and didn\u2019t fall right into some comfort and familiarity,\u201d Ms. Clark Christian said.Part of a close-knit group of students of color, Nakesha joined the college\u2019s gospel choir and a traditional African dance troupe called Kusika, which Ms. Burton directed.Nakesha, Ms. Clark Christian and two other students were seen together so often that they became known on campus as the Four Musketeers.\u201cThey were like the women you looked up to, that you admired,\u201d said Tanya Nicholson Miller, another former classmate and now an educational consultant in New Jersey. \u201cIt was just like the way they carried themselves on campus, their sense of self-esteem.\u201dNakesha was also a source of support for other students \u2014 a \u201creally bright light to all of the faculty and her peers,\u201d Ms. Burton recalled.Becky Dickinson, who had felt self-conscious about performing, said she joined Kusika only after Nakesha encouraged her.\u201cI do remember her saying like, \u2018You can do this,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dickinson said. \u201cI admired her. She was inspiring.\u201dIn her dorm room, Nakesha kept a photograph of her mother, Geraldine Williams, and she had saved her mother\u2019s cards and letters, which often bore an imprint of a lipstick kiss.In the fall of 1990, several weeks into her junior year, Nakesha learned that her mother, who had breast cancer, had become gravely ill. Nakesha withdrew from school and returned to New Jersey, moving into the Willingboro home of her aunt, Jacqueline Fattore, who was caring for Geraldine.Nakesha slept in a recliner at the foot of her mother\u2019s bed in the den. \u201cI spent every moment I could at her side,\u201d Nakesha later wrote in an essay about her mother\u2019s final days.Geraldine was an unwed teenager when Nakesha was born in 1970. Although she soon married Nakesha\u2019s father, Marvin Rothmiller, they divorced several years later. Geraldine became involved with an abusive man who repeatedly molested Nakesha when she was just a child, as Nakesha eventually confided to Ms. Burton and others. (The man was later convicted in a drug case and has since died.)Nakesha was sent to live with her maternal grandmother, with whom she stayed until leaving for college. But she remained close to her mother, and was devastated by her death in February 1991, at the age of 37.\u201cI looked at her face,\u201d Nakesha wrote. \u201cFor the first time in my life, I saw a calm that wasn\u2019t clouded by bitterness, hurt or anger.\u201dNakesha enrolled for the spring semester at Rutgers University\u2019s Camden campus, and in the fall, returned to Williams College, with a renewed sense of dedication and seriousness, Ms. Burton recalled.Over the next two years, Nakesha focused on researching, writing, choreographing and directing an ambitious senior project \u2014 a panoramic performance of black dance, from its origins in Africa through contemporary hip-hop.Nakesha, lithe and petite, also performed in the two-hour show in March 1993 which involved some 20 dancers and musicians. It was called \u201cIf You Can Walk, You Can Dance, If You Can Talk, You Can Sing.\u201dNavin Girishankar, a drummer, remembered the hours they had spent rehearsing in a campus studio.\u201cEverything I would throw at her, with these little drumming moves, she\u2019d come up with something even more brilliant,\u201d he said.The show was a sensation.\u201cThe audience was immediately aware of the great care and love that went into the production,\u201d the college newspaper, The Williams Record, said in a review.Nakesha was awarded a prize established in memory of the college\u2019s first black graduate for the \u201cbest scholarly work submitted by a Williams undergraduate in the field of Africana studies.\u201dReginald Hildebrand, who taught Nakesha African-American history, said he had \u201cexpected her to be one of the leading individuals in whatever she was going to do in her generation.\u201dAfter graduation, Nakesha went to work at Sewickley Academy, a private school near Pittsburgh that at the time enrolled about 700 students. One former student, Lisa Bevevino, to whom Nakesha taught sixth-grade history, remembered Nakesha as beloved by students, often sitting on the floor with them, talking through their problems and assigning projects that provoked creativity.Once, she said, Nakesha had each student invent a holiday and write about how it would be celebrated, the values it promoted and what artifacts would be involved.\u201cShe was one of the foundational people,\u201d said Ms. Bevevino, now an assistant professor of French and Latin at the University of Minnesota, Morris, \u201cthat really cared about how we were doing and how we thought about the world.\u201dIn 1996, after three years, Nakesha abruptly left Sewickley. Neither Ms. Bevevino nor anyone else could recall her giving a clear reason for her departure.Nakesha drifted over the next decade, moving among family members and friends and holding odd jobs, working as a sales clerk at Victoria\u2019s Secret and as a bridge toll collector. She took computer software courses, and a writing class at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she wrote the essay about her mother\u2019s death. Hints of her mental illness began to surface.In 1997, Ms. Burton and her husband invited Nakesha to live with them in Hancock, Mass., a short distance from Williams College, where Nakesha found administrative work in the dance department. The couple had been concerned that Nakesha had quit her teaching job, and they sensed that something was not right. One day, Ms. Burton said, she arrived home to find all the curtains drawn. Nakesha said she believed someone had followed her home.After a few months, Nakesha decided to move to New York, against the advice of Ms. Burton and her husband. \u201cWhat could we do?\u201d Ms. Burton said. \u201cShe was an adult.\u201dBy the summer of 1998, Nakesha was living in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with Anim Steel, a former college classmate. Mr. Steel had been captivated by Nakesha when they first met at Williams, writing in his journal, \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like her.\u201dIn Brooklyn, they shopped together, played kickball and visited the Statue of Liberty for Nakesha\u2019s birthday. But Nakesha was having bouts of anxiety, Mr. Steel said, and he found a therapist who agreed to see her on a pro bono basis.The therapy did not last; Mr. Steel moved to Boston at the end of the summer, and Nakesha stopped seeing the doctor. She moved in with another friend, Greg Holland, a paralegal and friend from high school, who she once described as being \u201clike a brother.\u201dAfter about two years, Mr. Holland recalled, Nakesha began claiming that the C.I.A. was looking for her. She stopped working and paying her share of the rent. She moved back to New Jersey, first staying with her father and then with other relatives. Her erratic behavior continued, and she began to cut off family members.In the summer of 2001, a former college classmate, Joan Rocklin, invited Nakesha to dinner in Manhattan. As first-year students at Williams, they lived across the hall from each other, and had remained friends. Ms. Rocklin was planning to move to teach at the University of Oregon School of Law and wanted to see Nakesha before leaving.As they relaxed in Ms. Rocklin\u2019s apartment, Nakesha mentioned that she had found messages in books she was reading. Ms. Rocklin assumed Nakesha meant certain books had seemed meaningful to her; she was disturbed to learn that Nakesha meant actual written messages.Nakesha moved a few years later to Philadelphia, where she taught at an adult literacy center. Her supervisor recalled her as a talented teacher but said she began talking to herself and complaining that people were stealing from her, and she eventually left the job without collecting her last paycheck.It was in November 2006 that Ms. Rocklin received the first in a stream of emails from Nakesha.\u201cHey Joan, What\u2019s going on?\u201d Nakesha wrote. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in California right now.\u201dNakesha said she was \u201cstranded\u201d with no address and could be reached through the Los Angeles library system.Ms. Rocklin responded that she cared about Nakesha and was worried \u201cwhether you have shelter at night and whether you are getting enough food.\u201dNakesha, then 36, replied that she was \u201cnot exactly homeless,\u201d but was in \u201ca wandering, unstable state that is sad at best.\u201dMs. Rocklin continued to receive Nakesha\u2019s emails, which were sometimes copied to politicians and others. She complained that the Los Angeles police had been harassing her and that she needed clean clothes, and money for food. She described picking up pennies on the sidewalk. \u201cI think I now have a whole 35 cents at my disposal,\u201d she wrote.She said that her eating habits depended on whether she could find free samples somewhere, or a church that served food after services. She said that her feet were blistered, sore and bleeding, and that walking was painful.\u201cThe socks are disgusting, the tights have holes and runs, and I have no winter jacket and it\u2019s cold here at night now,\u201d she wrote.Ms. Rocklin consulted with a psychiatrist in Los Angeles, collecting the names and numbers of shelters, clinics and a hospital, which she forwarded to Nakesha.\u201cWhen we were in college together,\u201d Ms. Rocklin wrote, \u201cI was always impressed by how bright, creative and resourceful you were. There are resources in West Hollywood and people who can help you. Please reach out to them.\u201dNakesha thanked her, saying the information seemed \u201cmeant for the homeless.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not homeless,\u201d she said.Her emails indicated otherwise. Nakesha wrote of sleeping in a Los Angeles motel lobby where the clerks knew her and sometimes got her a room, and of sitting in a doughnut shop in Hollywood until she fell asleep.A week before Christmas, Nakesha wrote to say that she had collected enough money to buy a bus ticket to the East Coast. A week later, she emailed to say she had arrived in Asheville, N.C., where the police had taken her to a Salvation Army homeless shelter.Three days later, Nakesha emailed again, this time from Washington, where, she later noted, she was writing from the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. In messages that followed, she described sleeping in the lobby of one apartment building and the laundry room of another, and outdoors on the National Mall.\u201cI still have no money to make sure I\u2019m fed & barely eat, if I eat at all,\u201d she wrote on Jan. 14, 2007. A week later, she claimed that she had been \u201crudely asked\u201d to leave the Greyhound bus terminal and Union Station, and was \u201cdesperate as to what to do.\u201dMs. Rocklin tried to arrange for a Washington-based ministry to have a photograph of Nakesha distributed to homeless outreach teams and the city\u2019s mental health services department.That July, Ms. Rocklin was traveling to Washington and emailed Nakesha, suggesting they have lunch together.They met at the library, then dined at a nearby seafood restaurant, where Ms. Rocklin said the conversation was pleasant if awkward; she felt she could not raise Nakesha\u2019s homelessness, since Nakesha had always denied it. She also took Nakesha shopping, buying her CVS gift cards and a fare card for the subway.Nakesha\u2019s emails eventually stopped, Ms. Rocklin said. Nearly a year later, in September 2008, Ms. Rocklin was in Washington again, for a wedding, and visited the library. She searched for Nakesha on each floor, without finding her.By then, Nakesha had been in New York for nearly a year, arriving in December 2007, according to her letters. Around that time, Ms. Burton\u2019s husband, Don Quinn Kelley, a professor at the New School, came upon Nakesha at Grand Central Terminal. He called his wife, saying he was shocked at Nakesha\u2019s appearance: frail, underweight and apparently homeless.\u201cI said, \u2018Sweetie, go look for her,\u2019\u201d Ms. Burton recalled. \u201cHe was really clear that she needed our help \u2014 and she needed help beyond us.\u201dThe couple invited Nakesha to move into an apartment they kept in Washington Heights, clearing space for her in the living room. But after they broached the idea of her getting treatment, Nakesha moved out.It would not be the last time Nakesha rejected offers of help, often from former classmates who had chance meetings with her on Manhattan streets.During one encounter, Ms. Dobson gave Nakesha some cash.\u201cYour twenty-five dollar \u2018donation\u2019 got me a very necessary new pair of pants,\u201d Nakesha emailed later, \u201cand for once in a long time I was lucky enough to get a shower.\u201dMs. Dobson said that when she suggested delicately that Nakesha might benefit from seeking help, Nakesha rejected the idea. When they next saw each other, on the street, Nakesha snapped at her and accused her of spreading lies.Angelique Feaster, Nakesha\u2019s former college roommate and now a bank vice president, learned of Ms. Dobson\u2019s encounters with Nakesha and began a search for her. \u201cYou are never alone,\u201d she emailed Nakesha. \u201cI love you, my sister, for life.\u201d She never caught up with her.Wole Coaxum, a banker and former Williams classmate, said he was at Grand Central one night when he heard someone call his name. He was stunned to see Nakesha, bundled on a bench. They had not seen each other since college, where they had been friends. He greeted her, silently trying to process the scene. He asked himself: How did you get here? Why are you sitting here homeless?He gave Nakesha his card, and later emailed her. \u201cHow wonderful it was to see you the other day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cClearly, you\u2019ve been working through a lot.\u201d He offered to help \u201cin whatever way I can.\u201dMr. Coaxum told Nakesha that he was on the board of Phoenix House New York, a nonprofit with a network of resources that could \u201cstart the process of helping you.\u201d Nakesha ultimately rejected the offer, saying the agency was not for her, it was for substance abusers.After his offices moved to Midtown, Mr. Coaxum continued to see Nakesha, on the grate at 46th Street and Park Avenue, sometimes on cold days when the rising steam kept her warm. He understood that homelessness was a reality, he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t necessarily happen to people that you know.\u201dNakesha\u2019s college friends communicated with one another about her predicament. But her resistance strained their relationships with her, and one after another they fell out of touch with Nakesha.\u201cThere was just a deep sense of helplessness I think we all shared,\u201d said Robyn Carter, a former nonprofit executive in Boston and one of the Four Musketeers on the Williams campus.In January 2010, Ms. Burton received an email from a colleague in the school\u2019s alumni relations department.\u201cSandra, F.Y.I.,\u201d the email said. \u201cLooks like Nakesha had a baby.\u201dA New York City child protective specialist, Charles Castro, had emailed the college, saying he was seeking any of Nakesha\u2019s \u201cfamily or friends who can be considered as resources in a time of crisis for her.\u201dNakesha, now 39, had apparently hidden her pregnancy under clothing and blankets. She was discovered going into labor at Grand Central and was rushed to the hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Nakesha wrote in an email several months later, that the baby \u201cwas born at all.\u201dMr. Castro, who has left the children\u2019s services agency and now lives in Minnesota, said that he checked on the newborn, a boy, and interviewed Nakesha in the hospital. Their conversation deteriorated quickly. \u201cYou\u2019d go from thinking she was very intelligent to what world was she living in?\u201d he said.Ms. Burton recalled Mr. Castro saying that he was trying to persuade Nakesha to accept mental health treatment, to improve her chances of maintaining a relationship with her child while his fate was decided in family court. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d Ms. Burton recalled, \u201cthe child was going into foster care.\u201dNakesha was not receptive. When Ms. Burton emailed her in July 2010 to see how she was doing, she responded angrily, threatening to sue her, adding that if Ms. Burton intended to discuss social services or doctors, \u201cdon\u2019t bother.\u201dThe baby was placed in foster care, and although Nakesha took some parenting classes and visited him at the nonprofit social services agency that was supervising the case, her parental rights were ultimately terminated by the family court. The boy was adopted by his foster mother.In 2012, Nakesha gave birth to another son, who was allowed to remain with his biological father. The agency\u2019s social worker who oversaw the children\u2019s cases said in an interview that both boys were in loving households, and each was thriving and happy.The older boy, now about 8 years old, is autistic and gifted, his adoptive mother said in a separate interview. She said the two boys had exchanged photographs and messages, and she added, \u201cThey look identical.\u201dBy the time P.J. Dearden first encountered Nakesha on the sidewalk in 2014, she had been homeless in Manhattan for more than six years, with only occasional breaks, her writing suggests. She described living for several months in Long Branch, N.J., a short \u201chome stay\u201d in the Bronx and spending some nights in a Brooklyn motel. Some periods are not documented. For the most part, she stayed on sidewalks near Bryant Park, Herald Square, Grand Central, Penn Station, a heated grate on 32nd Street near Seventh Avenue, and the sidewalk at 46th and Park. On some cold nights, she rode the subway.P.J. and several others had saved copies of the letters that Nakesha had handed them on the sidewalk. Nakesha typically wrote the letters on laptops she borrowed at the Grand Central branch of the New York Public Library, a short distance from the grate, and then printed copies. The letters, like her emails, were a mixture of delusional statements, literary references, tart commentary and harsh attacks on other people. Some were addressed to public figures, like President Obama \u2014 \u201cDear Barack\u201d \u2014 and others to \u201cChildren All Over the World.\u201d\u201cI am still stuck in New York City without housing,\u201d she wrote on April 10, 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t care for \u2018bag lady\u2019 as a profession any more than \u2018homeless lady.\u2019\u201dShe later described spending a rainy Christmas under a makeshift tent. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to be welcome in places where I actually should be,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthough I keep hearing my appearance and cart & bags are deterrents.\u201dShe noted that her bags and property had been stolen \u201cby an F.B.I. team,\u201d and that her sons, too, had been \u201cstolen.\u201dShe listed the books she was reading, and described her favorite hangouts: a Cosi eatery on 45th Street where she would \u201cbuy my dinner or get a hot beverage and use the bathroom\u201d; a passageway under the Helmsley Building, where she would \u201cthaw and stay out of the cold\u201d; and an atrium where she went at night after a late-January snowstorm.In her letters, she described rejecting offers of temporary housing by a homeless services outreach worker named \u201cLuis.\u201d\u201cStill a \u2018no\u2019 and will remain that way,\u201d Nakesha wrote.For many in the neighborhood, Nakesha was a fixture on the grate at 46th and Park. Daniel Ferrigno, who managed the Grand Caf\u00e9, a lunch counter beneath the Helmsley Building, said Nakesha was a frequent customer. They talked, he said, though not about her past.\u201cShe never needed me to open that door, so why go there?\u201d Mr. Ferrigno said.Nakesha was also a regular at the Grand Central library branch, according to Genoveve Stowell, a former managing librarian.Ms. Stowell said that the branch welcomed the homeless as long as they respected library rules that applied to everyone \u2014 no napping, no loud noises, no oversized bags.Ronnie Hicks, another former employee, said that although she had seen Nakesha outside the library talking to herself, \u201cshe never did that\u201d inside the branch, and had \u201cperfect manners.\u201dOccasionally, patrons complained about Nakesha\u2019s body odor, and Ms. Stowell took the matter up privately with Nakesha. \u201cI had to address it,\u201d she said.Others who engaged with Nakesha were often left with more questions than answers.Carolee Hildenbrandt, who passed Nakesha on her way to work, had once been a nurse at Bellevue Hospital Center. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful there,\u201d she recalled telling Nakesha. \u201cThey can help you.\u201d Nakesha demurred.Myrna Cruz, a senior executive assistant at JPMorgan, who bought Nakesha a cart, said Nakesha had seemed appreciative, yet within a week, the cart was gone and Nakesha was using an older one.Nakesha\u2019s closest observers were two street vendors. One, Hamid Elhiri, a Moroccan immigrant who each morning parked his coffee cart a few feet from the grate, said he typically made Nakesha a breakfast of eggs and a roll, with iced tea or cranberry juice. When he would ask how she was doing, she would respond, \u201cAlive.\u201dSometimes, Nakesha stood in line and placed a few dollars at his window, he said. If she did not have money, she would approach the rear of his cart. \u201cShe has \u2014 how we say \u2014 pride?\u201d he recalled.Mr. Elhiri said one day a man began taunting her, and Mr. Elhiri shouted at him to stop. Another time, he blocked a homeless man from stealing Nakesha\u2019s purse while she slept. Mr. Elhiri said he joked with her, \u201cI\u2019m your bodyguard.\u201dBut he regretted that one day he failed to stop a security officer from confiscating Nakesha\u2019s belongings after she had asked Mr. Elhiri to watch them. \u201cThey throw everything away,\u201d he said; Nakesha was enraged.At lunchtime, Nakesha often crossed Park Avenue to sit beside another vendor, Magdy Eltantawy, an Egyptian immigrant, who operated a sandwich cart with his wife and brother. They had known Nakesha for several years, and enjoyed bantering with her and preparing her favorite lunch \u2014 chicken over rice, with raw onion.Mr. Eltantawy said he remembered Nakesha saying she had children, and once showing him a photograph of her holding a baby.Mr. Eltantawy said he saw all sides of Nakesha\u2019s personality. One day, he recalled, she began screaming uncontrollably, and he asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Ms. Williams?\u201d\u201c\u2018This is not me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018This is other people in me.\u2019\u201dMr. Eltantawy\u2019s suggestions that she seek help were rebuffed: \u201cI\u2019m functioning very well,\u201d she told him.For Nakesha, Christmas 2015 was a relatively happy time, at least by one measure. On Dec. 28, an outreach worker, Luis Alfredo Garcia, found her on her grate, surrounded by a pile of presents she had received from passers-by.\u201cLots of gifts, food,\u201d Mr. Garcia jotted down in his journal.Nakesha\u2019s holiday bounty did not last long, Mr. Garcia noted several days later. \u201cSanitation took gifts\u201d that she had left unattended, he wrote: \u201cfood, blanket, vase.\u201dMr. Garcia \u2014 the \u201cLuis\u201d cited by Nakesha in one of her letters \u2014 worked for Breaking Ground, a nonprofit contractor for the Department of Homeless Services, which sends two-member outreach teams on daily walks to check on street dwellers in Midtown and to try to patiently encourage them to accept housing, treatment and supportive services. Occasionally, psychiatrists accompany the teams.At first, Nakesha was dismissive of the workers, calling them the \u201chi and goodbye\u201d people, said Bill Hughes, a Breaking Ground supervisor. Mr. Garcia said he drew out Nakesha by discussing the books she was reading; a co-worker, Shanna Knotts, said she used the letters Nakesha handed out for hints about what she was feeling and thinking.Mr. Garcia\u2019s journal served as a running account of his interactions with the street people he checked on; one entry shows that he observed Nakesha as early as August 2013, at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.\u201cNakesha: Reading. Looked up smiled, waved,\u201d Mr. Garcia wrote.The next month, Nakesha was at 46th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, sitting, writing and surrounded by bags. \u201cSpoke but waved off,\u201d he noted.His journal entries offered vivid snapshots of Nakesha\u2019s daily activities:\u201cCounting $.\u201d\u201cReading War of the Worlds.\u201d\u201cReading Huck Finn.\u201d\u201cSeated w/ umbrella, rain coat. Reading Anna Karenina.\u201d\u201cStill reading Anna K; about 200 pages left.\u201d\u201cPlans to stay here to keep wind from blowing away her things.\u201d\u201cStanding. Arguing w/ herself.\u201dBreaking Ground\u2019s records show that from April 2014 on, its workers saw Nakesha at 46th Street and Park Avenue 319 times, Mr. Hughes said. Three-quarters of those times, they stopped to speak with her. On 10 occasions, they tried unsuccessfully to persuade her to take a room reserved for the homeless at the Harlem Y.M.C.A.\u201dI can arrange for a ride there so you can see the place before deciding,\u201d Mr. Garcia once told Nakesha in June 2015, his journal shows.\u201cNot today,\u201d Nakesha responded.Nakesha resisted meeting formally with psychiatrists, although several spoke with her briefly on different occasions on the street and read some of her letters, Mr. Garcia recalled. He said that one doctor had suspected that Nakesha might have schizophrenia.Mr. Garcia said he had hoped Nakesha would agree to treatment so she could return to the \u201clevel of functionality\u201d she had once enjoyed, allowing her to reconnect with her family, become employable and even write in a more coherent way.\u201cThat\u2019s really what I wanted for Nakesha,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cShe\u2019d have her life back.\u201dHe said that he had also wondered whether Nakesha\u2019s refusal to seek shelter on the coldest nights was itself sufficient evidence that she posed a danger to herself, and thus could be committed for evaluation.Mr. Garcia said he got a new perspective one day in January 2016 when he was surprised to see that Nakesha had been interviewed by a local news station.The governor\u2019s order spurred widespread debate, and the television station, WPIX, seeking reaction from the street, found Nakesha.\u201cNakesha Williams braces for the first really cold night of this winter, hunkering down on the corner of 46th and Third Avenue,\u201d a reporter narrated over an image of Nakesha seated on a bench.Asked what she thought of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s order, Nakesha responded that it \u201cmakes sense,\u201d but noted that there were risks associated with shelters.\u201cYour choice is between the cold and an unsafe situation,\u201d Nakesha explained. \u201cIs it sanitary enough and is it safe enough? Those are the issues.\u201dMr. Garcia was impressed, he said, that Nakesha, despite her delusions, had cogently analyzed the choices as she saw them: a potentially dangerous shelter, or the street, where she had proved self-sufficient.\u201cSo, which is saner?\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a moment of extreme clarity.\u201dOn the morning of July 22, 2016, Scott Erickson, an optician who worked on Fifth Avenue near 45th Street, smiled at Nakesha as he passed her on his way to buy a lottery ticket; she nodded back, he recalled. He had seen her frequently in recent weeks, introducing himself at one point, and had given her small gifts: hand lotion, fresh socks and a pair of unused sneakers from his closet.That day, Nakesha was seated on a bench outside the Barnes & Noble store, surrounded by shopping bags, sandwiches wrapped in cellophane and an empty bottle of Minute Maid lemonade, a green straw inside. A blue utility cart, stuffed with clothing, papers and a floral-patterned sack, stood a few feet away.When Mr. Erickson returned from his errand a few minutes later, he found Nakesha sitting motionless, her head tilted backward, her eyes open but empty.He shook her arm and called 911. He began CPR, until the police and paramedics arrived and took over.\u201cCome on!\u201d he called to Nakesha.\u201cYou know her?\u201d a paramedic asked.\u201cJust from seeing her out here,\u201d Mr. Erickson replied.Nakesha was rushed to Bellevue, where she was pronounced dead at a minute past noon. She was transported to the medical examiner\u2019s office, where an employee wrote, \u201cUnknown woman of unknown age found dead in a park.\u201dHer photograph was emailed to the Department of Homeless Services. Outreach workers identified her and reported that she was mentally ill and had spurned offers of shelter or safe haven.\u201cThe team is not aware of any next-of-kin information,\u201d the workers said.Nakesha had died of a pulmonary embolism, a complication of her obesity, an autopsy showed. She was 5 feet tall and weighed 255 pounds, the report said. There was no evidence of alcohol or drugs in her system. She was 46 years old.Her remains were placed in a white body bag and kept in a basement mortuary, where she lay unclaimed.P.J. Dearden had been searching for Nakesha on the streets near the grate, and in and around Grand Central. Finally, she approached Mr. Elhiri, the coffee vendor, who said a customer had told him that Nakesha had died.P.J. sought a confirmation. Her wife, Dawn Dearden, a federal employee in Manhattan whom I knew, called me. How could she find out if Nakesha was alive? I suggested she call the medical examiner\u2019s office.P.J. resolved to not let that happen. She claimed Nakesha\u2019s remains, had her cremated at a Greenwich Village funeral home and had her ashes placed in an urn made with mother-of-pearl with flecks of gold. She left her phone number with Mr. Elhiri, in case anyone asked about the woman on the grate.An office worker, Karen Davis, who had known Nakesha and learned of P.J.\u2019s efforts through Mr. Elhiri, emailed the secretaries in her office, collecting money to help defray the funeral expenses. Ms. Davis gave P.J. about $300 in an envelope that listed 21 donors.I, meanwhile, used copies of Nakesha\u2019s letters, which P.J. and others had provided to me, as a guide to track down her relatives and former classmates.Nakesha\u2019s aunt, Ms. Fattore, sobbed at the news of her death. But she also seemed to have found a sense of relief. She said the family had not heard from Nakesha in years.In the living room of her house in Willingboro, N.J., Ms. Fattore, along with Nakesha\u2019s uncle, Danel Williams, and the younger of her two brothers, Cherron Rothmiller, proudly recounted her academic achievements, strong friendships and devotion to family members. \u201cEverybody called her Kesha,\u201d Danel Williams said.Displayed on Ms. Fattore\u2019s wall was Nakesha\u2019s high school portrait: She is wearing a blue-and-white-striped dress and resting her chin on her arms. She looks radiant, relaxed and confident.The family also described Nakesha\u2019s difficult childhood, her molestation and how she had kept it a secret for years. They also talked about her mental deterioration.\u201cWe should just be happy that she\u2019s at peace,\u201d Ms. Fattore said, weeping. \u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t at peace as long as she walked around this earth.\u201dNakesha\u2019s former college classmates were brokenhearted to learn of her death. Scores of tributes were shared through private group messages on Facebook. One appreciation came from Krystal Williams, who had danced in Nakesha\u2019s senior project but had not seen her since college.\u201cI am trying to wrap my mind and heart around Nakesha\u2019s final years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn my mind, I still see her hair in a ponytail with her rocking dance tights, and a slightly oversized dance jersey that slides off one shoulder. That is how I will remember her \u2014 in light, dancing and leaping over the drum beat.\u201dMs. Burton, sitting in her campus office at Williams College, read through letters Nakesha had written in her final months, including some in which Nakesha had bitterly attacked her.\u201cIt\u2019s really powerful for me to know that I was in her mind until her death,\u201d Ms. Burton said. She said that as Nakesha had struggled with her illness, she must have asked herself, \u201cHow do I anchor myself, right now, in this storm?\u201d\u201cHer discipline was writing every day,\u201d Ms. Burton continued. \u201cThe names, the places, the jobs, the memories of relationships, the snatches of memories of relationships; the books, the discipline to read all the time and to talk about what she was reading and to have a book list, right? To me, that goes back to the joy that she had as a learner, as a scholar, as a creative person. And those skills remained with her throughout her life.\u201d\u201cSomehow, she was also holding on to all of us,\u201d Ms. Burton added, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t let us hold on to her.\u201dOn Oct. 15, 2016, Nakesha\u2019s father, Marvin Rothmiller, then 66, a retired postal worker, arrived at Penn Station with several relatives, including two of his sisters, Norlyn Garlic and Valerie Dillard, who had been close to Nakesha. I accompanied them on the walk to 46th Street, where P.J. and Dawn Dearden were waiting by Nakesha\u2019s grate, with a suitcase containing Nakesha\u2019s urn.P.J. spoke for a few minutes about Nakesha, and the people who had watched over her. She showed the family the passageway under the Helmsley Building where Nakesha had sought refuge from the cold and rain, and the Grand Central library branch, where she had spent so many hours. The family returned to New Jersey, taking the suitcase with them.P.J. still asks what else she could have done for Nakesha. \u201cEveryone let her down on some level,\u201d she said. \u201cShe died on a street corner.\u201dOn Nov. 1, 2016, 10 people gathered on Nakesha\u2019s grate to commemorate her life. Nicole Moore, a friend of Nakesha\u2019s from college, had organized the event. Each guest lit a candle and reminisced.Many were Nakesha\u2019s former college classmates, including Becky Dickinson, the once-insecure dance performer; Anim Steel, who opened his apartment to Nakesha in 1998; and Abby Dobson, the singer and songwriter. Many spoke of their regret at not being able to do more for Nakesha.P.J. and Dawn Dearden were also there, as was Karen Davis, the office worker who had taken up a collection, and who happened on the gathering as she was heading to the subway.Ms. Feaster, the former college roommate who had been unable to find Nakesha in New York, said she was devastated that she never saw her.\u201cBecause I would have grabbed her and just took care of her, crazy or not,\u201d Ms. Feaster said. \u201cI would be like, \u2018O.K., they\u2019re coming after you? Well, we\u2019ll run!\u2019\u201dMs. Dickinson, now a social worker, said that every day she walked by people \u201cwho are going through trauma and adversity.\u201d\u201cYou never know \u2014 you never know anybody\u2019s story,\u201d she said.P.J., who was meeting Nakesha\u2019s college friends for the first time, could barely hold back tears. She said that she hoped the group was comforted knowing that \u201cthere were people who really cared for her, and looked out for her.\u201dWhen it was Ms. Moore\u2019s turn, she spoke about how mental illness did not discriminate. \u201cIt could be us tomorrow,\u201d she said. She turned to P.J. \u201cWe are grateful for you, for giving her whatever time you had,\u201d she said.With candles burning and a few pedestrians looking on, Ms. Dobson began singing a modern-day spiritual that she had written years earlier with her cousin. Inspired by the Toni Morrison novel \u201cBeloved,\u201d it was called \u201cLonesome Child.\u201dSusan Beachy and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Two Months, I Got My News From Print Newspapers. Here\u2019s What I Learned.", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtI first got news of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., via an alert on my watch. Even though I had turned off news notifications months ago, the biggest news still somehow finds a way to slip through.But for much of the next 24 hours after that alert, I heard almost nothing about the shooting.Instead, the day after the shooting, a friendly person I\u2019ve never met dropped off three newspapers at my front door. That morning, I spent maybe 40 minutes poring over the horror of the shooting and a million other things the newspapers had to tell me.Not only had I spent less time with the story than if I had followed along as it unfolded online, I was better informed, too. Because I had avoided the innocent mistakes \u2014 and the more malicious misdirection \u2014 that had pervaded the first hours after the shooting, my first experience of the news was an accurate account of the actual events of the day.This has been my life for nearly two months. In January, after the breaking-newsiest year in recent memory, I decided to travel back in time. I turned off my digital news notifications, unplugged from Twitter and other social networks, and subscribed to home delivery of three print newspapers \u2014 The Times, The Wall Street Journal and my local paper, The San Francisco Chronicle \u2014 plus a weekly newsmagazine, The Economist.It has been life changing. Turning off the buzzing breaking-news machine I carry in my pocket was like unshackling myself from a monster who had me on speed dial, always ready to break into my day with half-baked bulletins.Now I am not just less anxious and less addicted to the news, I am more widely informed (though there are some blind spots). And I\u2019m embarrassed about how much free time I have \u2014 in two months, I managed to read half a dozen books, took up pottery and (I think) became a more attentive husband and father.Most of all, I realized my personal role as a consumer of news in our broken digital news environment.But don\u2019t you and I also have a part to play? Getting news only from print newspapers may be extreme and probably not for everyone. But the experiment taught me several lessons about the pitfalls of digital news and how to avoid them.I know what you\u2019re thinking: Listening to a Times writer extol the virtues of print is like taking breakfast suggestions from Count Chocula. You may also wonder if I am preaching to the choir; doesn\u2019t everyone reading this story already appreciate print?I\u2019m nearly 40, but I\u2019m no different. Though I have closely followed the news since I was a kid, I always liked my news on a screen, available at the touch of a button. Even with this experiment, I found much to hate about print. The pages are too big, the type too small, the ink too messy, and compared with a smartphone, a newspaper is more of a hassle to consult on the go.What do you get for all that dough? News. That sounds obvious until you try it \u2014 and you realize how much of what you get online isn\u2019t quite news, and more like a never-ending stream of commentary, one that does more to distort your understanding of the world than illuminate it.Many of the opinions in that analysis could be found on Twitter and Facebook. What was different was the emphasis. Online, commentary preceded facts. If you were following the shutdown on social networks, you most likely would have seen lots of politicians and pundits taking stock of the deal before seeing details of the actual news.This is common online. On social networks, every news story comes to you predigested. People don\u2019t just post stories \u2014 they post their takes on stories, often quoting key parts of a story to underscore how it proves them right, so readers are never required to delve into the story to come up with their own view.There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting lots of shades of opinion. And reading just the paper can be a lonely experience; there were many times I felt in the dark about what the online hordes thought about the news.Still, the prominence of commentary over news online and on cable news feels backward, and dangerously so. It is exactly our fealty to the crowd \u2014 to what other people are saying about the news, rather than the news itself \u2014 that makes us susceptible to misinformation.Real life is slow; it takes professionals time to figure out what happened, and how it fits into context. Technology is fast. Smartphones and social networks are giving us facts about the news much faster than we can make sense of them, letting speculation and misinformation fill the gap.It has only gotten worse. As news organizations evolved to a digital landscape dominated by apps and social platforms, they felt more pressure to push news out faster. Now, after something breaks, we\u2019re all buzzed with the alert, often before most of the facts are in. So you\u2019re driven online not just to find out what happened, but really to figure it out.This was the surprise blessing of the newspaper. I was getting news a day old, but in the delay between when the news happened and when it showed up on my front door, hundreds of experienced professionals had done the hard work for me.Now I was left with the simple, disconnected and ritualistic experience of reading the news, mostly free from the cognitive load of wondering whether the thing I was reading was possibly a blatant lie.And, more important, you can turn off news notifications. They distract and feed into a constant sense of fragmentary paranoia about the world. They are also unnecessary. If something really big happens, you will find out.This is the most important rule of all. After reading newspapers for a few weeks, I began to see it wasn\u2019t newspapers that were so great, but social media that was so bad.Just about every problem we battle in understanding the news today \u2014 and every one we will battle tomorrow \u2014 is exacerbated by plugging into the social-media herd. The built-in incentives on Twitter and Facebook reward speed over depth, hot takes over facts and seasoned propagandists over well-meaning analyzers of news.You don\u2019t have to read a print newspaper to get a better relationship with the news. But, for goodness\u2019 sake, please stop getting your news mainly from Twitter and Facebook. In the long run, you and everyone else will be better off.Farhad Manjoo will be taking a leave of absence from the column to write a book. He will return in June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Nancy Pelosi Deserve to Keep her Job?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIf you think Facebook is worth deleting over its issues, then call your elected official to regulate the company, as well as other companies, like Google, that profit from harvesting our personal details to sell ads tailored to us across the internet,\u201d Glaser writes. \u201cBecause it\u2019s becoming clearer that we can\u2019t trust these companies to regulate themselves.\u201dThe point was clear enough. Everyone else may refer to the huge expansion of health insurance as Obamacare. But the Democratic members of Congress who voted for it know that it would not have happened without Pelosi. When Obama administration officials wavered over whether to keep pushing for such an ambitious bill, Pelosi bucked them up. Then she delivered the votes to pass the bill.But Pelosi\u2019s unpopularity also feels different. She has remained the Republicans\u2019 favorite bogeywoman \u2014 appearing in ad after ad \u2014 long after the Democrats were last in the majority and she was speaker. Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate leader, never became the target that Pelosi did, nor has Chuck Schumer, Reid\u2019s successor.Whatever the cause of her unpopularity, Democrats still have a dilemma: Is she the best House leader for the party?If the Democrats fail to win back the House this year, Pelosi will probably step aside, and she should. If they win, she\u2019ll deserve to be the speaker again. Pelosi will also turn 78 next week, and she would do her party a favor by starting to think about a succession plan. If she were to step aside by the end of 2020, she would have had an 18-year run as her party\u2019s House leader \u2014 one of the most successful tenures in modern politics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Must I Visit My Dying and Dangerously Facebook-Active Uncle?", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySocial Q\u2019sI am a multiracial woman from a small family that is otherwise white. A close relative is in hospice care. My family made it clear that they expect me, my (immigrant) husband and our young son to visit him before he dies. But this relative has become active in alt-right causes, posting offensive material about minorities, immigrants and women on Facebook. Some family members have asked me to \u201cleave politics at the door\u201d and \u201cturn the other cheek.\u201d Others threatened to ostracize us if we don\u2019t visit. Should I?A.S.Ignore your relatives\u2019 claptrap. Leaving politics at the door is easy \u2014 so long as it\u2019s not your race, husband or gender being trampled inside its threshold. And have you noticed that requests to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d are most popular with folks asking us to turn ours, but rarely their own? Finally, the threat of ostracism (a.k.a. bullying) is ridiculous. Who needs relatives that turn off and on like spigots?No, the only reason to make a pilgrimage to see this problematic relative is if the man ever treated you with love and kindness \u2014 even as a child. If he did, you have at least one thing to weigh against the hate-mongering of his later days. It may not be enough for you, and I would respect that too, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind.The other consideration is the suffering of his immediate kin. If you have a tender impulse toward them, in what is surely a terrible time, I can envision a farewell visit that is made for their sake and not for the dying man\u2019s. There are a few moving pieces here, even putting aside your relatives\u2019 sillier claims. Think about it, and wherever you land is the right answer (for you).A close friend who was in my wedding party and his then-girlfriend came to my wedding without giving us a gift. Now, two years later, this couple is getting married. My wife and I cannot agree how to handle the situation. Should we address the situation directly with our friends or just give them a wedding gift?ANONYMOUSThe cost of being a groomsman can range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on clothing requirements, wedding locations and bachelor parties \u2014 or worse, bachelor-party weekends. In this context, it is probably not factually correct to say your friend gave you nothing. (And speaking for a tiny subset of the universe: I don\u2019t want to be in anyone\u2019s wedding \u2014 ever! Factor that in, too.)My advice: Peruse your pal\u2019s wedding registry, choose a lovely gadget from Williams Sonoma, and stop nursing wounds from two years ago. A \u201cclose friend\u201d is worth much more than a blender \u2014 especially if he shows up for you on your big days.Years ago, I lent my friend an expensive handbag. (It cost more than a car.) We agreed that I would ask for it back when I wanted it. Two years later, I asked for it back. She told me her sister borrowed it and lost it. I was extremely annoyed but let it go. Later, I ran into the sister. When I asked how she lost the bag, she said she had no idea what I was talking about. Since then, I saw my friend wearing the bag at an event. She lied to me! I asked for the bag immediately, and have reiterated the request several times since then, but she always puts me off. What should I do?S.L.Undoubtedly, it is hard to learn that a pal values your handbag more highly than you. (At least it\u2019s expensive!) Fortunately, I own a plate by the artist John Derian with an old handwritten note from the Algonquin Hotel decoupaged on it. It contains the perfect advice for your predicament: \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me make trouble for you in trying to get my things back. I shall not write you again myself and will give you the rest of this week to return them.\u201d After sending a version of this note, and waiting said week, turn over the matter of the automobile-priced purse to the local police.I have a 9-month-old daughter. Sometimes, when we are out, strangers ask to take her picture. I feel awkward about this and would prefer they didn\u2019t. But how can I express this without offending someone who just told me how cute my baby is?MEIThe same way I did, last week, when a woman approached my table in a restaurant and asked if she could photograph my fluke tartare to post on Instagram. I smiled and said: \u201cThank you for asking. But I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d She looked confused but left eventually. We have no duty to cater to strangers with cameras.Until your daughter is old enough to make her own modeling decisions, you must make them for her, governed by her best interests, not the (sort of understandable) desire to avoid momentary awkwardness with utter strangers and their creepy requests. It\u2019s the job, Mom!Advertisement"}

Orange juice frequently takes a supporting part. And grapefruit catches a cameo from time to time.Pineapple juice has played another circuit altogether. You\u2019d occasionally encounter it in quasi-classic cocktails like the Algonquin (rye, dry vermouth) and the Mary Pickford (gin, maraschino liqueur, grenadine). But mainly it found steady work at tiki bars, where it had a home in everything from the Blue Hawaii to the Painkiller.Recently, however, the juice has branched out. At cocktail bars of every variety, it\u2019s a rare menu that doesn\u2019t have at least one drink using pineapple juice, which the bartenders press themselves.\u201cI think pineapple has grown in popularity as a cocktail ingredient due to the naturally occurring balance of acidity and sweetness in the fruit,\u201d said Ben Rojo, bar manager at the George Washington.\u201cIt takes a lot of the seriousness away, in terms of how a drink\u2019s perceived,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a warmth to it, in terms of how people react to it. Pineapple is just fun.\u201cFor Sarah Morrissey, the bar manager at Frenchette in TriBeCa, that fun can be transporting. \u201cYou could be sitting in a dark bar in New York in the dead of winter and order a pineapple heavy cocktail, and it truly takes you somewhere else,\u201d said Ms. Morrissey, who loves the fruit so much that her nickname is Little Pi\u00f1a Girl.Pineapple juice wasn\u2019t completely ignored during the early years of the cocktail revival. The innovative bartenders Audrey Saunders and Marco Dionysos, for instance, used it in signature drinks like the Tantris Sidecar and the Chartreuse Swizzle.But two recent developments have helped push the ingredient into wider use: One is the resurrection of the tiki bar aesthetic, and its absorption into the wider cocktail culture. The other is the rising popularity of tequila and mezcal, agave spirits that get along swimmingly with pineapple.All the bars said their pineapple drinks were popular. But with whom, exactly? According to Mr. Kearns, everyone. \u201cVery few people seem to be pineapple-averse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real crowd-pleaser.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Lets Ads Bare a Man\u2019s Chest. A Woman\u2019s Back Is Another Matter. ", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisers, especially smaller ones, complain of inconsistency and gender bias in the process that determines whether images are rejected for being sexually suggestive. The ad showed an image of a woman photographed from behind with a portion of her upper back exposed. It didn\u2019t seem particularly racy, certainly no more than an ad for Olay body wash, showing a woman\u2019s bare back and legs, that Ms. Venero had recently seen.Facebook rejected her ad, however, and when she disputed the decision, a representative told her that it implied nudity and that the company did not allow ads \u201cwith a sexual undertone.\u201d Facebook now says it incorrectly rejected Ms. Venero\u2019s ad, but the back and forth is an example of the social network\u2019s struggles over images of the human body. More precisely, as Facebook processes millions of ads a week through a mix of automation and human review, what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t, and who is making those decisions? Ms. Venero now tends to make her ads \u201cextremely conservative, she said. \u201cThey usually just have a man and woman\u2019s face on them,\u201d she added. \u201cI do have one that has a man\u2019s chest, and I\u2019ve never had any problems with it. But a woman\u2019s shoulder \u2014 we have a problem.\u201d Joel Jones, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions operations, said that the company tended to be \u201cconservative\u201d when monitoring ads that people might find offensive but that its enforcement of adult content did not distinguish between men and women. Human reviewers are trained with examples that feature both men and women, Mr. Jones said, and he noted that more women appeared in ads \u2014 almost twice as often as men in a sampling during the previous 30 days.For advertisers, debating what constitutes \u201cadult content\u201d with those human reviewers can be frustrating. Goodbye Bread, an edgy online retailer for young women, said it had a heated debate with Facebook in December over the image of young woman modeling a leopard-print mesh shirt. Facebook said the picture was too suggestive. When Goodbye Bread challenged the decision, and a company representative replied that the issue was the policy against ads \u201cthat show a lot of skin.\u201d \u201cThe shirt is considerably transparent in the fact that the breast would be visible had it not been blurred,\u201d the representative said, adding that as a result, the nudity was \u201cimplied.\u201dGeorge Stamelos, a co-founder of Goodbye Bread, said fashion brands regularly dealt with mixed messages from Facebook on skin and suggestiveness in ads but could often successfully appeal to human moderators. He also said Facebook\u2019s policies were unfairly applied to women. Mr. Jones of Facebook said the company set higher standards for ads than for regular posts from users because ads were \u201cproactively pushed out to people.\u201d He said Facebook was \u201cfocused on improving our review protocols and automated systems.\u201dFacebook, which counts more than two billion users worldwide, has frequently been accused of taking a conservative, and at times haphazard, approach to what types of nudity it finds acceptable. Mr. Stamelos said he hoped Facebook would reconsider how it applied its policies to women and men, adding that he had seen the company take a harder line on its appeals recently. \u201cThis is extremely problematic, especially considering the magnitude of Facebook\u2019s reach,\u201d he said.\u201cI understand they have to prohibit content that really is disturbing,\u201d Ms. Venero said. \u201cBut whatever their algorithms are that do this, or the humans in their department that look at these ads \u2014 they just aren\u2019t consistent with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Soi 38 in Melbourne, Australia", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare12 PhotosMELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Perhaps it is the hunter-gatherer locked deep in our DNA that makes the discovery of hidden things so very gratifying. That instinct to search for buried treasure makes Melbourne an especially fun place to live and eat \u2014 the city\u2019s charming laneways are famous for hiding all manner of culinary riches.Nestled in the middle of the ground floor of the parking garage, right next to the elevators, Soi 38 is a colorful nook of a restaurant, serving bowls of Thai noodles for $10 a pop at lunchtime only, six days a week.If you ask anyone abut Thai food in Australia, the conversation will probably focus on Sydney, which has a larger Thai population and a thriving Thai restaurant scene. Melbourne has plenty of Thai restaurants, but they\u2019re less likely to be regionally specific and more likely to cater to Western palates. It was this lack of specificity in Melbourne that helped create Soi 38.The restaurant is owned by Andy Buchan and Vherachid Kijthavee, who is also its chef. Mr. Kijthavee grew up in Bangkok, and moved to Australia to attend university, where he studied information technology. While in school, he began working part time in Thai kitchens, and after graduation he turned to restaurant work full time. Mr. Buchan was a customer at one of those restaurants.The two struck up a friendship. They talked a lot about food, and Mr. Kijthavee lamented Australia\u2019s lack of boat noodles, the dish that was originally sold from boats (hence the name) in Bangkok. It is now a ubiquitous street food throughout Thailand. Eventually, Mr. Buchan suggested they start a business selling the boat noodles that Mr. Kijthavee missed so much.The men purchased a cart like the ones used to sell noodles on the street in Thailand. Soi 38 began as a pop-up in a cafe and bar in 2013, with Mr. Kijthavee selling soup from the cart. In 2015 they moved into the parking garage, adding brightly colored metal tables with stools, designed for the kind of quick lunch where you huddle over your bowl and inhale its contents. The cart now serves as the counter of the restaurant, where customers order and pay.At first, only two dishes were served: boat noodles with beef, and a bright, lemongrass-heavy tom yum soup with pork and delicate prawn won tons. Over time a few more items were added, including a braised duck soup with egg noodles, and a green laksa based on a version Mr. Kijthavee grew up eating. Occasionally there is a special, such as fresh crab served over egg noodles with slices of pork, with an umami-intense broth on the side. But the core of the menu remains unchanged: four soups and a variety of noodle choices.If those other options weren\u2019t so tempting, this review might be a musing on the simple beauty of the one-dish restaurant. That is how Mr. Kijthavee originally conceived of Soi 38 \u2014 a take on the Thai street food specialists who do one thing and do it very well. But customers requested variety, and vegetarian options, and so the restaurant\u2019s purview grew. I\u2019m glad it did.The laksa is profoundly comforting, its rich green curry broth aided by the crunch of fried garlic and fresh bean sprouts. The duck soup (the only dish on the menu that costs $15; everything else is $10) showcases the righteous union of chewy egg noodles with braised duck leg in all its fatty splendor.Yes, similar dishes exist elsewhere in Melbourne. But as of now, Soi 38 is the only place I\u2019ve found boat noodles, and boat noodles are necessary for a life fully lived. The dish is distinctive mainly for its complex dark brown broth, which is traditionally made with blood. Mr. Kijthavee says he has not been able to find the fresh blood needed, so he has made up his own recipe that replicates the sweetness and depth that blood usually provides. It is intensely aromatic, and kind of mesmerizing when paired with flat rice noodles, hunks of tender stewed beef and curls of shattery pork cracklings. You feel as though you might tumble into the bowl head first and never emerge.But emerge you do, 10 minutes later, a little sweaty and bewildered but deeply satiated. It makes for the kind of pleasure that is almost sweeter because of its everyday accessibility. Would that all parking garages contained such magic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Surrealist Photos of Ralph Gibson", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensNonetheless, it was the beginning of a long and successful career.\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cI went from an impoverished nobody to all of a sudden being on my feet. I was getting a lot of press, doing lectures and workshops, and selling the occasional print.\u201d Under the banner of his newly established imprint, Lustrum Press, Mr. Gibson released two more related books, \u201cDeja-Vu\u201d (1973), and \u201cDays at Sea\u201d (1974), which, with \u201cThe Somnambulist,\u201d came to be known as the photographer\u2019s \u201cBlack Trilogy.\u201d Last month, decades since they were last in print, the University of Texas Press and Editions Hazan published them in a single volume, \u201cThe Black Trilogy.\u201d \u201cI wanted to have enough recognition to be able to do my work,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve gotten all the recognition I deserve, no more, no less. Since I was 30 years old, nothing has stood between me and anything I wanted to do.\u201dMr. Gibson was born in Los Angeles, and left high school at 16 to join the Navy. On his first day at boot camp, he was randomly selected to attend the Naval School of Photography in Pensacola, Fla. \u201cI consider photography to have been my destiny,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose it; it chose me.\u201d He moved to California in 1960 and became an assistant to Dorothea Lange. After some initial success as a magazine photographer, he moved to New York City in 1966, where he worked briefly with the Magnum Agency and as an assistant to Robert Frank. But by 27, he knew he wasn\u2019t interested in a career in photojournalism. \u201cI wanted to make photographs you could look at for a long period of time, photographs that were not ephemera, photographs that were made to last and could support a great depth of content,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the opposite of working for the media.\u201d At the time, Mr. Gibson slept during the day, staying up nights and expanding his mind through books and films, which gave him \u201ca different relationship to reality.\u201d On a weekend trip with friends in Pennsylvania, that newfound perspective surfaced in his photos, though he didn\u2019t quite know how to interpret it. But when he went to Mexico with Mr. Frank and his family, he returned to New York with an understanding of the photos he\u2019d taken in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt occurred to me that my camera as an instrument had located a dream reality,\u201d he said. One such image appeared while Mr. Gibson was walking down Sixth Avenue, when he saw a beauty parlor engulfed in flames. That scene could have been plucked from his subconscious: His mother, who died in a fire, had owned and operated a beauty parlor. Many of the other images in the book are abstract, others are erotic, most are shadowy and mysterious. As in a dream, the characters, settings and objects depicted seem to connect through some phantasmagorical logic.\u201cI believe photographs are better than the photographer and the art is better than the artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the music; I\u2019m the radio through which the music plays. So I follow the work, I don\u2019t lead the work. I go where the work sends me.\u201d Readers won\u2019t find explicit explanations of Mr. Gibson\u2019s psyche in his books, however, which are almost entirely without text. Those who are \u201csufficiently interested\u201d in his work, he said, are \u201csmart enough not to ask\u201d for clarification and willing to form their own interpretations. The only guidance he offers is in the sequence of images and their layout.Gilles Mora, the photographer and editor, said Mr. Gibson\u2019s idiosyncratic presentation \u2014 pairing photos face to face in order to establish thematic parallels \u2014 constituted a new \u201csyntax\u201d and represented a significant departure from the typical approach of photography publishers. That innovative approach, he said, would later be reflected in the monographs Mr. Gibson published through Lustrum Press of photographers including Larry Clark, Mary Ellen Mark, Danny Seymour and Neal Slavin.\u201cBefore the \u2018Trilogy,\u2019 photographic books with a few exceptions were just illustrative books about some specific topics, reflecting the outside reality of the world,\u201d Mr. Mora, who wrote an introductory essay for \u201cThe Black Trilogy,\u201d said. \u201cThe \u2018Trilogy\u2019 is like a book written by a writer, giving place to his inner reality, his subjectivity, his personal point of view on the world.\u201d Mr. Gibson faced considerable artistic and financial hurdles to make that point. But the critical recognition it garnered, he said, was enough to set him on a path toward chasing his dreams \u2014 both literal and figurative \u2014 for decades to come. \u201cIt released a tremendous amount of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one time in my life when I insisted on taking all the credit and all the blame, when I stood for my personal autonomy, I was recognized.\u201d Advertisement"}

She likes most of his policies and would still support him over any Democrat. But she is open to another Republican.\u201cI would like for someone to challenge him,\u201d Ms. Rains said, as she sipped wine recently with two other evangelical Christian women at a suburban restaurant north of Dallas. \u201cBut it needs to be somebody that\u2019s strong enough to go against the Democrats.\u201d Her preferred alternative: Nikki R. Haley, the United Nations ambassador and former South Carolina governor.One of her friends, Linda Leonhart, agreed. \u201cI will definitely take a look to see who has the courage to take on a job like this and do what needs to be done,\u201d she said.According to data from the Pew Research Center, support among white evangelical women in recent surveys has dropped about 13 percentage points, to 60 percent, compared with about a year ago. That is even greater than the eight-point drop among all women.\u201cThat change is statistically significant,\u201d said Gregory A. Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201dIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.The women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.And the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.But it has not been easy.\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.Some evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.They feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.They said that Christian voters who backed Trump had been derided as unthinking, unsophisticated hypocrites, but for many of them that only affirmed their resolve. One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201dStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.Karen Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201dEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201dMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.In surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.Evangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.And even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.Advertisement"}

Your former girlfriend accepted your statement of remorse, but seems to have decided not to continue dating a man who cheated on her.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Love the Managed Risk, and Rewards, of Nippers", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 49______\u201cIt\u2019s this Aussie beach surf lifesaving thing,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the kids wear these colorful beanies and go down to the beach early on Sunday, and there\u2019s swimming and running and then there are these boards and \u2026\u201dMy description was interrupted by laughter and questions. I could tell from our video conference call that my American editors were a bit confused. And honestly, I could relate.I still recall having no idea what this whole Nippers thing was when we first arrived in Sydney a year ago. Even when I signed up our two children, I didn\u2019t really understand what we were getting ourselves into.But now, as the Nippers season comes to a close, I\u2019m overwhelmed with appreciation.It may take a few more Sundays to figure out exactly why, but there are a few things I greatly admire about Nippers \u2014 and perhaps by extension, Australia itself.First and foremost: the encouragement of managed risk, at least with nature. (Culture and business are subjects for another newsletter.) Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They\u2019re taught to be safe in it.There are now roughly 40,000 kids, 5 to 13 years old, giving it a go every summer.And at least in our group at Bronte Beach in Sydney, fear, courage and pragmatism were all in the mix.All the children simply nodded when they were told to keep an eye out for them when playing near the rocks at the edge of the beach.Again, they were not told to stay away from the rocks; they were told how to navigate the dangers found there. I was amazed at the matter-of-fact approach, a far cry from the overprotectiveness I\u2019d seen at the Brooklyn summer camp my kids attended before we moved to Sydney and where just being in a shallow pool was a cause for parental fright.And last weekend, I was reminded of that contrast yet again. The waves were big on Sunday \u2014 rolling tubes of aquatic force that only a few surfers decided to brave.But there were the 8- and 9-year-olds, as you can see in the photo above, my son among them, jumping into a more protected area surrounded by volunteer parents in bright orange.That community vibe also won me over. The risks every Sunday were managed by neighbors, by friends, by people who knew at least a few of the children and how to handle children that particular age.The moms and dads were strong. Masters teaching young apprentices, they didn\u2019t scoop the kids out of the water at the first sign of struggle, or when a surge of water pushed them toward panic.Rather, they encouraged our children to keep going.Sometimes a volunteer would swim alongside a boy or girl who was losing motivation. Sometimes a child would recover on a buoy, briefly, before being sent off again.Even when waves crashed our children into a mess of sand and sea, the adults simply smiled and waited for them to re-emerge.My wife and I absolutely loved it, tears and laughter included.Yes, we\u2019ve covered wars and our kids spent most of their lives in Mexico City facing a different set of dangers so I recognize we may be more comfortable with risk than most. And I know I\u2019m not the first outsider or Australian to wax philosophical about Nippers.But week after week, I\u2019ve marveled at the scene. It\u2019s been great for my children\u2019s confidence. It\u2019s been even better for their (and our) love of the ocean.Could that be what Nippers is all about for many of us, engaging with the coast to find joy?This is a stunning place, Australia, ringed with ribbons of sand and blue-green waves that much of the world\u2019s population will never see. The water may be threatening \u2014 but how many of us could give it up if we tried.Surf lifesaving is as much about experiencing the sublime as it is about safety.Americans we are, but Nippers we shall be.Now for the week in global news, plus a recommendation for your ears.____________Some aspired to his disconnection, others scolded him for disengaging. I just want to know why he decided to do it in Ohio rather than in Australia.______It\u2019s the kind of Times story, at the intersection of culture and commerce, that makes you look at your world anew, pulling back the curtain on what we see every day and don\u2019t think about.______BooksFeatures______It\u2019s a bit like Triple J\u2019s Hottest 100, except with context, built for your phone not the radio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No More \u2018Fatherland\u2019? Germans Debate Gender-Neutral Anthem", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKristin Rose-M\u00f6hring, the equal opportunities officer for Germany\u2019s Family Ministry, sends a newsletter to staff roughly every six weeks. She probably did not anticipate the reaction that her latest has received.In the newsletter, timed for International Women\u2019s Day on Thursday, Ms. Rose-M\u00f6hring proposed some changes to Germany\u2019s national anthem to make its lyrics gender-neutral. The ministry will not release a copy of the newsletter but has confirmed that it was sent last week.According to Die Zeit, which has seen the document, Ms. Rose-M\u00f6hring recommended changing the word \u201cfatherland\u201d to \u201chomeland,\u201d and altering a line about the German people striving \u201cbrotherly, with heart and hand\u201d so they would be striving \u201ccourageously\u201d instead.Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman felt the need to reassure the country. \u201cThe chancellor is very happy with our nice national anthem as it is,\u201d he said.The anthem has a difficult history, she added, and has to be put in context. It was originally written in 1841 to help unite Germany\u2019s states, but its opening verse, which included the line \u201cDeutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles\u201d (\u201cGermany, Germany, above all else\u201d), gained sinister connotations under the Nazis and stopped being sung after World War II.The anthem was again adopted for the united Germany after the Berlin Wall fell. \u201cOur national anthem is a piece of history itself,\u201d Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer said.Ms. Rose-M\u00f6hring\u2019s feelings about the controversy are unknown \u2014 the Family Ministry said she would not comment \u2014 but those who have succeeded in changing anthems before said it could take years, even decades, to achieve the change if she decides to push her suggestion.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by the big discussion it\u2019s caused, and I\u2019m not surprised the politicians said no \u2014 I only succeeded the second time,\u201d said Maria Rauch-Kallat, a former Austrian politician who led efforts to get her country\u2019s anthem changed, with the result that Austrians now sing about their \u201cgreat daughters\u201d as well as their \u201cgreat sons.\u201dNancy Ruth, a former Canadian senator who spearheaded the campaign to make \u201cO Canada\u201d gender-neutral, said she felt all anthems that excluded women should be changed.\u201cWhat\u2019s my reaction to this?\u201d she asked, before answering her own question using an expletive and expressing frustration about the debate. \u201cOh, grow up,\u201d she added, addressing those against change. The easiest way to realize the power of a word like \u201cfatherland\u201d was to ask men if they would be happy singing about their motherland instead, she said.Changing an anthem requires a long campaign, she added: \u201cIt takes until you have a leader, with a majority, who truly wants equality among the sexes.\u201d Canadian feminists started calling for \u201cO Canada\u201d to be made gender neutral in 1980 and it took Justin Trudeau\u2019s election in 2015 for them to succeed.Angela Merkel was not in a position to offer such leadership given her recent electoral struggles, the former lawmaker said. She recommended that Ms. Rose-M\u00f6hring start singing her own words and hope others follow.Lukas Niederberger, director of the Swiss Society for Public Good, the organization behind the contest, said the idea of changing Germany\u2019s anthem seemed sensible. \u201cI think for a modern society, the central text of the culture should be politically correct,\u201d he said.Change shouldn\u2019t be hard, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re saying change the whole text, just adapting a few words. It\u2019s really no big deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "West Virginia Walkouts a Lesson in the Power of a Crowd-Sourced Strike", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Heather DeLuca-Nestor, a county teachers\u2019 association leader, was driving back to Morgantown, W.Va., from the state capital on Feb. 28 hoping that she and other teachers were about to return to work. The governor had promised 5 percent pay raises to settle a statewide strike, and union leaders had agreed.But as she made the winding drive, she said, her phone exploded with angry calls: \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d \u2018\u2018We can\u2019t go back to school.\u201d \u201cOur union sold us out!\u201dThat evening, many of the 150 teachers who had gathered in a deserted shopping mall told her in impassioned terms that promises and handshakes in the Capitol were not good enough. No matter what union leaders said, they were staying out until they had what they wanted, and in writing.Ms. DeLuca-Nestor, the president of the Monongalia County Education Association, walked away in tears to phone the county superintendent. \u201cI had to ask him to turn around and call school off,\u201d she said.\u201cUnions have tended throughout most of their histories to be forces that seek stability, not unrest,\u201d said Joseph A. McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University. \u201cWhen they are weakened, we\u2019re more likely to see the re-emergence of instability and militancy, and the kind of model that we\u2019re seeing happen in West Virginia.\u201dThat model, driven by grass-roots anger, can flummox politicians. Mitch Carmichael, the Republican president of the West Virginia Senate, opposes collective bargaining for public employees, but he acknowledged that the decentralized aspects of the strike made it difficult to reach a settlement that would satisfy the teachers.\u201cYou\u2019re not negotiating with a particular, a unique set of participants,\u201d Mr. Carmichael said. \u201cThere\u2019s just this organic sort of \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call it. More like an uprising.\u201dNational union leaders said the situation in West Virginia revealed the pitfalls of government policies intended to hobble them.\u201cIf the right wing gets what it wants and tries to eliminate collective bargaining in the public sector, then politics \u2014 this kind of political activism at the ballot box, in the State House \u2014 will be the only avenue,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers\u2019 union.The lesson, experts said, is that undermining public sector unions, as the Janus case seeks to do, will not guarantee labor peace.\u201cWhat it does show is that this Janus decision will force workers to look at other strategies,\u201d said Ken Fones-Wolf, a professor of history at West Virginia University. \u201cWithout this institutional voice, it does make it harder to sort of organize this kind of thing. But when conditions do get bad enough, workers will take action without an organization.\u201dIndeed, some teachers who went to the meeting at the mall in Morgantown said their lack of collective bargaining rights left them no choice but to continue their strike.\u201cIt we can\u2019t negotiate with the people that we\u2019re supposed to negotiate with, then we\u2019re really just sticking out our necks and saying, this is what we\u2019re fighting for,\u201d said Lindsay Smalls, a sixth-grade science teacher. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to stick up for ourselves.\u201dWildcat strikes led by rank-and-file workers are rare these days, but they recall the big miners\u2019 strikes that racked West Virginia\u2019s coal country in the early part of the 20th century. That pattern of labor activism changed with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, sometimes called the Wagner Act, giving most workers a federally protected right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.The Wagner Act does not cover public employees, though, and some states, like West Virginia, do not give public employees the right to bargain collectively. For that reason, the state\u2019s two teachers\u2019 unions, the West Virginia Education Association and the state branch of the American Federation of Teachers, do not function as those in other states might, although they do lobby for teachers and help with grievances. Membership is voluntary and far from universal.\u201cIt started off with the membership following their state leaders,\u201d said Gary Price, the superintendent of schools in Marion County, who, like his colleagues around the state, kept schools closed during the walkout. \u201cBut when the state leaders made a decision that the employees didn\u2019t like, they took it in a different direction.\u201dAt that point, the course of the strike was in the hands of teachers in each of the state\u2019s 55 counties making their own separate decisions about what to do, though they monitored the mood elsewhere over social media. In Mr. Price\u2019s county, teachers gathered for a heated meeting at a high school, where people stood up and cried out every time they heard that another county\u2019s schools would be closed the next day.\u201cOnce they started to all fall, we were going to fall in line with the rest of our state,\u201d said Allyson Perry, president of the Marion County Education Association. \u201cThat\u2019s been the theme of this the whole time.\u201dEarlier in the day, teachers and bus drivers from Boone County had huddled informally at the Capitol to make their decision. \u201cNone of our union reps were over there,\u201d Robin Muncy, a bus driver, said afterward. \u201cWe just did it as a whole, because we felt we were being lied to.\u201dWill Lawrence, 53, a cook at an elementary school in Charleston who is not a member of any union, said, \u201cWe had to drag our leaders kicking and screaming \u2014 that\u2019s why it seems so disorganized.\u201dAnd in Morgantown, it was Anna Simmons, 26, who called the meeting at the mall, intending to talk over the idea of defying the union leadership and staying out with some of her colleagues at the elementary school where she works as a counselor. She was stunned when so many teachers from other schools showed up.\u201cI think our reps realized change needed to happen,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cThey ended up with a forest fire, and once it was lit, they didn\u2019t know how to contain it.\u201dWest Virginia\u2019s strike is over now, but the problems and the activism that drove it are not. In Oklahoma on Wednesday, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union announced it was accelerating its timeline for a statewide walkout, catching up with the fast-moving plans of activist teachers who had already been organizing a work stoppage in protest of low pay \u2014 on average, the lowest in the nation.\u201cWe have proven this was long overdue,\u201d said Larry Cagle, an English teacher in Tulsa who has been one of the main grass-roots organizers of a walkout. \u201cThe union, they don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201dJess Bidgood reported from Charleston, W.Va., and Campbell Robertson from Pittsburgh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Man With the Battery-Powered Heart", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionHis heart was failing. I imagine it was like this: His legs were swollen and heavy like weights. He was so tired. But when he lay down, he felt he was drowning, and so he started to sleep propped up on the couch. He had taken all the medicines his doctors prescribed him, and they each helped a little, but they did not help enough.Van Chauvin was not afraid of dying but he did not want to go on living this way, suffocating in the night.And then his doctors told him about something called a left ventricular assist device, LVAD for short, or just VAD. They told him that the machine would work by drawing blood from a chamber of his heart and propelling it into his aorta \u2014 the main vessel that carries blood throughout the body. A cable would run from the device and out by way of a hole the surgeons would create in his abdomen. He would have to take good care of this hole to make sure it didn\u2019t get infected.If the VAD did not incapacitate him with a stroke or a bleed, it might allow him to walk comfortably. Keeping the device safe and dry would require him to sacrifice the fishing trips he\u2019d loved, but at least he might be able to breathe well enough to sleep in his bed again.Though some people receive a VAD as a \u201cbridge,\u201d a way to stay alive while waiting for a heart transplant that might or might not come, Mr. Chauvin, then in his 50s, had been a smoker his entire life, so he wasn\u2019t a good candidate for a transplant. More likely, his VAD would be a \u201cdestination.\u201d That\u2019s how he would live until he died \u2014 battery-powered during the day and plugged into the wall at night.In some ways, a VAD is nothing more than another implantable device, much like an insulin pump for diabetics or a cochlear implant for the deaf. I know the heart is just a muscle, and I have held a cadaver\u2019s still heart in my hands and felt its inanimate weight. And I know, too, that as time passes, VADs will become smaller, as devices do, and one day they might be no clumsier than pacemakers.But there will always be another machine that goes one step further to bring us up against the limits of what it is to be mortal. And as a critical-care doctor who treats people at these margins, I wanted to understand what it was like to live a life dependent on this kind of technology \u2014 not just at the hospital, amid the buzz of acute care decision-making, but after, when the reality set in.That\u2019s how I came to meet Mr. Chauvin, first while I was observing a clinic for VAD patients, and then, later, during a weekend afternoon in his home outside Boston. He had invited me there to meet his family and to see firsthand the realities of life on battery. I took him up on his invitation, unsure of what to expect.When I stepped into his living room, I didn\u2019t even recognize him. Surrounded by his family, he looked happy and relaxed, so different from when I\u2019d seen him in the clinic. He was wearing a vest to hold his batteries, and I could see part of the device bulging under his white T-shirt, but only if I looked closely.I settled into the seat he offered me and introduced myself to his sisters while he ducked into the kitchen to pull a steaming plate of baked potatoes, chives and sour cream out of the oven. He had found the recipe on Facebook, he explained. He was eager for us to try it.As the plate cooled, he showed me around, down the narrow hallway to the bedroom, where he connected himself to a wall socket each night so his batteries could recharge. Limited to the electric cord\u2019s 20-foot radius, he was \u201clike a dog on a leash,\u201d until the morning. Luckily, his house was small enough that he could make it from the bedroom to the kitchen even when he was plugged in. The bathroom was even closer.One time, he woke up at 2 a.m. to a jarring noise. Thinking there might be something wrong with his VAD, he changed his connection from the wall unit to a set of batteries. The sound continued. Frustrated, he fiddled around with the machine, doing things he definitely wasn\u2019t supposed to do, and still it wouldn\u2019t stop. He dragged himself out of bed to call his VAD team.It was only when he saw the receiver hanging off the hook that Mr. Chauvin realized the source of the noise \u2014 it had been the phone all along. As he told the story, his assembled family members laughed appreciatively, though they\u2019d heard it before. I found myself laughing too, briefly forgetting that he was talking about life or death, about a sound that could have meant he was moments away from collapse.The laughter quieted and there was a break in our conversation. In the moment of stillness, I found that I was curious about Mr. Chauvin\u2019s pulse. I asked him if I could feel for it and, seemingly amused, he offered his hand. I placed my fingers on his wrist, where I am used to feeling the rhythmic pulsations of the radial artery. But because the device moved blood through his vessels at a continuous, stable rate of flow rather than the pumping of a normal heart, melding human and machine, I found that I couldn\u2019t feel a thing.By the time we met, it had been more than five years since Mr. Chauvin\u2019s heart had started to fail and over a year since he\u2019d been told he wouldn\u2019t get a transplant. So I asked him what it had been like to learn that he would spend the rest of his life with this machine, that the equipment would be with him until he died. That if he were to follow his doctors\u2019 instructions to the letter, he would never be able to shower the way he liked or take his boat out on the lake. I wondered if he regretted his decision, if he had been angry.But Mr. Chauvin surprised me. He had a hole in his stomach and a vest to carry his batteries and a cord that tethered him at night and the ever-present threat of a stroke or a bleed or a problem with the machine. But without the uncertainty of a transplant that might or might not come, he had found that he was now free to focus on enjoying his life for what it was. Sometimes that meant bending the rules.\u201cIf I\u2019m just going to sit and live in fear, I\u2019d rather be dead. I\u2019ll take my chances,\u201d he told me. Neither of us knew, then, that he would ultimately die at home, just over a year later.\u201cWhen the pump goes down, I go down,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you unplug me, I go down. But I don\u2019t have time to worry about all that.\u201dLater that afternoon, he was going to take a quick rest, and then, if the weather held up, he was going to Walmart. I smiled when he told me what he was planning to get there \u2014 rope, an anchor and another life jacket. Summer was coming, and he wanted to be ready to go fishing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talking Politics With the Self-Styled Bernie Sanders of Quebec", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuebec Road TripMONTREAL \u2014 Since arriving back in Montreal after nearly three decades abroad, one of the most striking changes I\u2019ve noticed has been the seeming retreat of the separatist movement here. The younger generation seems far more focused on becoming the Quebecois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution.Mr. Nadeau-Dubois is a proud left-winger, who compares his politics to that of Bernie Sanders, Jeremy Corbyn or Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. He was one of the leaders of the 2012 \u201cMaple Spring,\u201d huge student protests against an increase in university tuition fees that galvanized a generation of young Quebecois. He is also unrepentant about Quebec pursuing its national sovereignty.\u201cQuebec needs to change the rules of the game, and that is not possible when Canada is based on a system in which Queen Elizabeth is the head of state and the constitutional system is centuries old,\u201d he told me on Monday over a coffee in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood. It is part of the district he represents in the province\u2019s National Assembly as one of three members from his left-wing party, Quebec Solidaire.While he acknowledged that the separatist movement was \u201cnot at its peak,\u201d he stressed that about 30 percent to 40 percent of Quebecois supported an independent Quebec, according to recent polls.Moreover, he argued that Quebec\u2019s independence would help neutralize the province\u2019s simmering far right by expunging easy nationalism and xenophobia in favor of cultural affirmation and human rights. Having an independent country, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said, would mitigate against fear of the other.I\u2019d be interested to hear what younger Canadians think of the separatist movement today. Please share your thoughts with me here, as well other ideas you might have for people I should meet and places I should visit to gain a richer sense of Quebec\u2019s identity today.Mr. Nadeau-Dubois embodies a new strain in Quebecois politics, seeking to tap into the younger generation\u2019s appetite for radicalism and change even as voters worldwide look for alternatives to mainstream political parties. He is a Quebecois anti-Trump for the digital age, using social media to mobilize his legions of young supporters.\u201cWe support feminism, indigenous and LGBT rights; we are pro-choice; and we believe that the state must regain control over parts of the economy, including some natural resources,\u201d he said.The son of a unionist activist father and a labor lawyer mother, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois said he received his political education at a young age, at union protests with his parents. Political apathy was not an option.Today, to unwind, he makes couscous and plays floor hockey. He also wrote \u201cIn Defiance,\u201d a book about his experiences during the 2012 demonstrations.Asked about his feelings about another young and charismatic politician named Justin Trudeau, Mr. Nadeau-Dubois became visibly agitated, dismissing Mr. Trudeau as a talented retail politician who has little substance.\u201cHis progressivism is a facade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is nice words. It is bling bling.\u201dMr. Nadeau-Dubois said the most emotional moment of the 2012 protests came when a young Lebanese-Canadian woman in a head scarf approached him at a protest where 300,000 people had massed in the streets. He said the young woman told him that, while the strike had divided her family, her mother had come to appreciate its importance as a struggle for accessible education for everyone.\u201cShe told me that it was the strike that had made her mom a Quebecois,\u201d he recalled, his face bursting into a smile.Ms. Nottaway is a passionate advocate for Indigenous rights, and I plan to talk to her about the anguish after the killing of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Indigenous man shot dead by a Saskatchewan farmer, Gerald Stanley, who was found not guilty of murder.If you have questions for her, or ideas for places I should go to understand Quebec\u2019s Indigenous communities, I\u2019d love to hear from you.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dr. King\u2019s Complex Relationship With the Camera", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRACE STORIESThe most compelling photographs of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity.African-American newspapers and magazines routinely reported on the details of his life and activism through pictures, years before mainstream publications. And those mass media outlets \u2014 though at first circumspect and, in Dr. King\u2019s final years, increasingly critical as he turned his attention to poverty, war and racism outside the South \u2014 nevertheless produced a visual narrative that helped transform a regional movement into a national one. If the news media sometimes vilified Dr. King, it also contributed to the mythic view of him as the charismatic leader \u201cwho single-handedly directed the course of the civil rights movement through the force of his oratory,\u201d as the historian Clayborne Carson wrote of his distorted legacy. In that, photos became as powerful as words as Dr. King was transformed from a human being into a visual symbol of courage, fortitude, or benevolence: The stoic cleric posing for a mug shot after being arrested during the Montgomery bus boycott, or the consummate family man to whom white Americans could better relate.If he was for many white people the standard-bearer of a black America that was otherwise unknown to them, the news media\u2019s mythic imagery rendered Dr. King enigmatic. He had become, in contexts both positive and negative, the pre-eminent but two-dimensional icon of a political struggle that involved thousands of organizers, activists and sympathizers. By contrast, the most compelling photographs of him were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity.James Karales\u2019s candid picture of Dr. King at the kitchen table, talking with his young daughter Yolanda, for example, reminds us that the lives of black Americans, no matter how famous, were inevitably fraught. Disappointment registering on his face, he was explaining to the child, for the first time, the perils of segregation and why she could not visit a restricted amusement park. A photograph of the civil rights leader in intense conversation with President Lyndon B. Johnson affirmed that he was not simply an activist clergyman, but also a tough negotiator adept at politics.What is perhaps most extraordinary about Dr. King and photography is not how the medium defined him, but how skillfully he used it to define the story of civil rights. He was a visual tactician who, along with his advisers, understood the power of the camera to expose the brutality and injustice of segregation. The historic \u201cChildren\u2019s Crusade\u201d in Birmingham, Ala., in May 1963, for example, was largely organized for the camera. Dr. King and his strategists recognized the need for pictures that would demonstrate the depravity of Jim Crow segregation to a skeptical public. Anticipating a fierce response from Bull Connor, the city\u2019s segregationist commissioner of public safety, and aware of the media\u2019s hunger for provocative images, they planned a nonviolent demonstration of more than a thousand schoolchildren. \u201cI always saw Martin Luther King Jr. as this incredible spiritual leader, who spoke in a way that inspired people in emotional tones,\u201d said the photographer Steve Schapiro of his famous subject. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t realize is that people are human at the same time. You can be a leader and still have your own particular worries.\u201d Race Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "The Leeway in President Trump\u2019s Tariff Order: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 The leeway in President Trump\u2019s tariff order.\u2022 President Trump authorizes tariffs.\u2022 What happens when the bond market and the Fed disagree?\u2022 Cigna struck a big deal for Express Scripts.\u2022 The White House plans to unveil its tariffs today.\u2022 Protesters want Visa to stop processing sales of assault-style rifles.The Secretary has also recommended that I authorize him, in response to specific requests from affected domestic parties, to exclude from any adopted import restrictions those steel articles for which the Secretary determines there is a lack of sufficient U.S. production capacity of comparable products, or to exclude steel articles from such restrictions for specific national security-based considerations.Any country with which we have a security relationship is welcome to discuss with the United States alternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country. Should the United States and any such country arrive at a satisfactory alternative means to address the threat to the national security such that I determine that imports from that country no longer threaten to impair the national security, I may remove or modify the restriction on steel articles imports from that country and, if necessary, make any corresponding adjustments to the tariff as it applies to other countries as our national security interests require.\u2014 Peter EavisFrom the NYT:\u201cThe orders represented Mr. Trump\u2019s most expansive use of federal power to rewrite the rules of global trade since he took office and upended the prevailing consensus on free markets that has largely governed Washington under administrations of both parties for decades. A longtime critic of globalization, Mr. Trump argued that the United States has been ravaged by unfair trading partners, particularly in fading sectors like steel and aluminum.\u201dThe details\u2022 The orders will raise levies on foreign steel by 25 percent and on imported aluminum by 10 percent.\u2022 The order goes into effect in 15 days.Tariff flyaroundWhen the Federal Reserve and the bond market are at loggerheads, it\u2019s almost as if the economy\u2019s parents are fighting. The kids, stock investors and borrowers in this analogy, just don\u2019t know who to side with.This dynamic appears to explain what happened in early February when inflation fears sent bond prices lower and, in turn, set off panicked selling in the stock market.Now, as the Fed gets ready to raise interest rates several times, differences between the central bank and the bond market could start to matter more.There is no conclusive way to measure the degree of disagreement between the Fed and the bond markets. But that didn\u2019t stop us having a go.One approach is to compare the yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note with Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts for the central bank\u2019s target rate. Several times a year, the policymakers project where the federal funds target rate will be at different points in the future. In this exercise, we compared the 10-year\u2019s yield with the median forecast made in December for the target rate at the end of the next year.In December of 2014, 2015 and 2016, the 10-year\u2019s yield was around 1 percentage point higher than the forecast.But in December last year, the difference between the two numbers had shrunk markedly. The yield was only 0.26 of a percentage point above the forecast.One interpretation of this narrowing: The bond market was behind in reacting to economic strength. And when it did snap out of its possibly complacent state, it did so sharply. The 10-year yield is now 2.88 percent, up from 2.39 percent before the meeting in Dec. 2017.With that increase, there was a 0.77 percentage point difference between the policymakers forecast and the yield on the 10-year Treasury on Monday.But if the 10-year yield moved up to reestablish a 1-percentage point difference, it would sail past the psychologically important 3 percent mark.The problem, of course, with using Fed policymakers\u2019 forecasts is that the Fed has made them public only for a few years.To get a much longer perspective, we looked back at the actual interest rate that the Fed targets, which is set in the market for the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. We compared this effective federal funds rate with the 10-year\u2019s yield.On Monday, that spread was 1.46 percentage points. How does that compare? It\u2019s tighter than the median for the past eight years, 1.95 percentage points. The 10-year yield would have moved a lot higher to take the spread back there.But there is a less alarming viewpoint. The current 1.46 percentage point spread is only slightly higher than the median 1.24 percentage points for the 50-plus years we studied.And, perhaps most reassuringly, 1.46 percentage points is very close to the 1.67 percentage point median for June 2003 till the end of 2006, a period in which the Fed raised interest rates repeatedly.\u2014 Peter EavisThe bigger point: as always, health care companies want to get bigger and gain negotiating leverage, while branching out into different businesses.Courtesy of our friends at Thomson Reuters:\u2022 At $69 billion, Cigna-Express Scripts would be the biggest deal of the year.\u2022 It is the 33rd deal valued at more than $5 billion announced this year. That is a record number for any year through March 8.\u2022 The value of those 33 transactions is $419 billion, or 53 percent of all acquisitions announced in 2018.\u2022 With nearly $800 billion in acquisitions announced globally this year, deal making is off to its best start since 2000.\u201cVisa quite literally has the power to save lives and their customers are demanding it,\u201d said Nita Chaudhary of UltraViolet, one of the organizers of the protest.But the move has not sat well with some at the bank. Bloomberg reports:\u201cThe decision to create a new seat on the committee for an executive whose prior experience at Goldman Sachs centered on philanthropy and related initiatives has become a topic of debate inside its hyper-competitive headquarters in lower Manhattan. Before joining the White House last year, Powell\u2019s projects included helping small businesses and charities. Adding that background to a board stocked mostly with profit producers serving elite global clients is frustrating some top executives, people close to the situation said, asking not to be identified describing private conversations.\u201dThe deals flyaroundOn Facebook: the board was \u201cfar from perfect\u201d in thinking about the tech giant\u2019s longer-term problems. And the anger now focused on the company is about the industry\u2019s arrogance: \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201dOn Mr. Trump: He\u2019s not that close to the president anymore, and the White House has \u201cfallen short\u201d of expectations. But this administration is better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s or any other Republican\u2019s would have been.On Gawker: He doesn\u2019t want to buy the defunct site to erase its archives, he asserts. \u201cPreserve them, study them instead.\u201dThe tech flyaround An operator of the account, communicating through private messages on Instagram, said it had shared 17 names of alleged harassers and had collected an additional 158 that it had not yet vetted. The person said the group vetted allegations before making them public.Critics, including women who work with agencies, say it\u2019s trial by social media.From a statement he had prepared for his signing of the Giving Pledge:\u201cWe will only grasp the staggering potential of our time if we create onramps that empower ALL people to participate, regardless of background, country of origin, religious practice, gender, or color of skin.\u201dThe top 5 billionaires in this year\u2019s list and their estimated net worth:\u2022 Jeff Bezos, $112 billion\u2022 Bill Gates, $90 billion\u2022 Warren Buffett, $84 billion\u2022 Bernard Arnault, $72 billion\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg, $71 billionAn earlier version of a chart with this briefing had an incorrect value for the long-term median difference.

{"Headline": "AT&T Would Use Time Warner as a \u2018Weapon,\u2019 Justice Dept. Says", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The much-watched antitrust trial between the Justice Department and AT&T began on Thursday, with opening statements that presented starkly different visions for how the company\u2019s blockbuster merger with Time Warner would fit into a media industry upturned by the internet.Before a packed courtroom with some of the industry\u2019s leading figures, the two sides zeroed in on the case\u2019s central question: Whether the deal would force consumers to pay more to watch their favorite shows on Time Warner cable channels like CNN and TNT.The Justice Department, which is suing to block the $85 billion deal, argued that AT&T, with its nationwide wireless and satellite TV business, could use Time Warner\u2019s content as a \u201cweapon\u201d by raising the licensing fees those channels command. The government said that the merged company could charge rival cable and streaming companies more for popular channels. Those increases, the agency argued, would be passed on to consumers.\u201cIf the merger goes forward, consumers all across America will be worse off as a result,\u201d said Craig Conrath, the Justice Department\u2019s lead lawyer.AT&T and Time Warner said they would disprove the notion that the deal would raise prices. And they said that the combined company could compete with the giants of Silicon Valley: Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Google. Those companies now produce their own shows and distribute them on their popular websites. They also dominate the market for the advertisements that run with videos streamed over the internet.\u201cThe government\u2019s theory is fundamentally stuck in the past,\u201d said Daniel Petrocelli, the lead lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner. He said the merger would do the opposite of what the government asserts: The company would have no incentive to withhold Turner channels, which are owned by Time Warner.\u201cIt would be financially ruinous if Turner were not as widely distributed as possible,\u201d Mr. Petrocelli said.The opening statements previewed the fierce legal battle that will play out before Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. His decision in the case will help set the direction for antitrust law for years to come. It will also frame the shape of the media industry, which is facing major shifts as more people move from cable television to viewing streaming entertainment over the internet.Hundreds of company officials, reporters, hedge fund investors, antitrust scholars and industry analysts stood in line for hours to get a seat at the trial. Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, sat together during the 90 minutes of opening remarks. Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust official, watched from the front row on the other side of the room. The chief executives and Mr. Delrahim did not interact.The case has drawn unusual public attention partly because of questions about whether it had a tinge of political interference. The Justice Department\u2019s opposition came as a surprise when it was announced in November, and AT&T suggested it had been instigated by President Trump, who has said that he opposed the deal. The government said that Mr. Trump did not communicate with antitrust officials on the deal and that their decision to oppose the merger had not been ordered by the White House.Judge Leon has rejected many of AT&T\u2019s efforts to introduce evidence about political interference into the case. Instead, the trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, will largely focus on fundamental principles of antitrust law: whether the merger would cause prices to increase and competition to decrease.The court\u2019s decision will determine what sort of media mergers will be permitted between the creators and the distributors of content. Such deals, called \u201cvertical mergers,\u201d generally pass regulatory scrutiny because they don\u2019t make a company dominant in one specific market area. Judge Leon has noted the unusual case is like a \u201crare horse\u201d but not a \u201cunicorn.\u201dBlair Levin, an analyst for New Street Research, a firm focused on the telecommunications industry, wrote in a research note that a Justice Department victory would \u201cset a standard for what constitutes substantial harm that would call into question a number of other potential and pending mergers.\u201dAbout 60 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of the trial, including Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Mr. Bewkes of Time Warner, and executives from digital services like SlingTV and YouTube.The Justice Department said it would present internal documents from Time Warner and AT&T to show that the merged company would have the incentive to raise prices on rivals and consumers. In one email Mr. Conrath mentioned on Thursday, a Turner executive explained how Dish TV, AT&T\u2019s top rival in satellite TV service, would be weakened without his company\u2019s channels.\u201cTime Warner,\u201d Mr. Conrath said, \u201cwould be a weapon for AT&T because AT&T\u2019s competitors need Time Warner programming.\u201d The government said consumers would have to pay an extra $436 million a year because of the deal.Mr. Petrocelli foreshadowed a plan to attack that economic analysis. He said the Justice Department\u2019s calculations, made by the antitrust economist Carl Shapiro, had omitted key information and were therefore flawed.Mr. Petrocelli promised to show Judge Leon that cable consumers could end up paying about 50 cents less a month if the deal goes through.\u201cThis is what I call the government\u2019s shrinking case,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolton Was Early Beneficiary of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Facebook Data", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles, according to former Cambridge employees and company documents.In the two years that followed, Mr. Bolton\u2019s super PAC spent nearly $1.2 million primarily for \u201csurvey research,\u201d which is a term that campaigns use for polling, according to campaign finance records.But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, offers more detail on just what Mr. Bolton was buying. The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as \u201cbehavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.\u201dTo do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.\u201cThe data and modeling Bolton\u2019s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,\u201d said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica. \u201cWe definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.\u201d\u201cThe Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,\u201d Mr. Wylie said.\u201cThat really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what they said they wanted, anyway.\u201dUsing the psychographic models, Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, according to Mr. Wylie and another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge.One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness, and were thought to respect hard work and experience. It emphasized Mr. Bolton\u2019s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr. Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president.Beyond their conservative politics, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron \u2014 the Mercer family of Long Island, whose patriarch, Robert L. Mercer, made a fortune at the helm of a top-yielding hedge fund.Cambridge Analytica, which grew out of the London-based SCL Group, was founded in 2014 with a $15 million investment from Mr. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm\u2019s board of directors. Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.At the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump\u2019s.The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL\u2019s elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.The profiles would be used to \u201cidentify the personality traits of individuals\u201d in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. \u201cIndividuals can be targeted with the right message,\u201d it said.The agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton\u2019s campaign to direct people \u201ctoward the FB app.\u201d Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network\u2019s profiles. The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research, and users were not aware of its true purpose.Months later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about how much you spend. It\u2019s also about how smart you spend,\u201d the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.\u201cOne way we\u2019re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm\u201d \u2014 Cambridge Analytica \u2014 \u201cto provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile. So if you\u2019re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about, our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her.\u201dThe subject line of the email: \u201cDid Bannon come back to you on this?\u201dKen Vogel contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anti-Muslim Extremists Retweeted by Trump Are Convicted of Hate Crimes", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The leaders of an anti-Muslim extremist group in Britain have been found guilty of hate crimes and sentenced to prison, months after they drew international attention for helping President Trump get entangled in a diplomatic dispute with British leaders.A judge in Folkestone Magistrates\u2019 Court on Wednesday convicted Paul Golding, the leader of the group, Britain First, of one count of religiously aggravated harassment, and Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader, of three counts of the same offense. Mr. Golding was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, and Ms. Fransen to 36 weeks.Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had called off the trip because he objected to the decision to close the old embassy and build a new one in a less glamorous location south of the Thames, a move that he falsely attributed to former President Barack Obama.Britain First is a Christian nationalist group that opposes immigration and contends that Islam is destroying the country, and it has used inflammatory tactics like publicly confronting Muslims on the street about their religion, and going into mosques.Ms. Fransen, 32, and Mr. Golding, 36, have accused the government of criminalizing their opinions. On Wednesday, the group posted a picture of the two on its Facebook page under the words, \u201ctheir only crime is loyalty.\u201dDuring the trial in the rape case, Ms. Fransen and Mr. Golding made video recordings, which they posted on social media, of Ms. Fransen knocking on the doors of places where they believed the defendants were present \u2014 though in each case, prosecutors said, they were wrong \u2014 and insulting them and daring them to come out and face her.In one instance, prosecutors said, Ms. Fransen yelled into a defendant\u2019s home, when only his pregnant girlfriend and their two small children were inside. In another, she warned against \u201cdirty Muslim\u201d pedophiles \u201ctouching our kids.\u201d\u201cThese defendants were not merely exercising their right to free speech but were instead aiming religiously aggravated abuse at innocent members of the public,\u201d said the chief crown prosecutor, Jaswant K.

{"Headline": "An Ex-Bodega Takes a Star Turn at Cienega Las Tlayudas de Oaxaca", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City13 PhotosThe tortilla is monumental, stretched to its limits on the tin platter. It was made in Oaxaca, Mexico, of masa (a dough of dried corn steeped in slaked lime) pressed flat until kerchief-thin, then baked on the comal to an even crackle, as crisp at the circumference as at the center.The corn is different there, starchier and stronger, able to sustain such breadth. It\u2019s tricky to make these giant tortillas out of sweeter, softer American corn, which is why the stiff, pre-baked rounds, stacked like vintage records, are shipped from Mexico. Somehow they haven\u2019t shattered on their long journey to Cienega Las Tlayudas de Oaxaca, a grocery turned restaurant in Corona, Queens.Over the tortilla, Eva Mendez \u2014 currently chef while her mother, Margarita Perez, is visiting Mexico \u2014 paints a coat of asiento, pork lard the color of brown sugar, rendered while cooking carnitas and scraped from the lowlands of the pot. Often tiny crumbs of pork, caramelized to a near burn, are trapped in the lard like fossils in amber.The second coat is black beans, boiled, pulverized and then simmered with a crumble of toasted avocado leaves, which lend an almost menthol buzz. On top goes a lacework of thick, chewy quesillo, pulling like mozzarella, and shreds of cabbage, tomato and wedges of avocado.This is a tlayuda at its most basic; some might argue that it needs nothing further to achieve glory. At Cienega, it\u2019s gilded with toppings like house-made chorizo, ticking with spices; cecina, cured and sun-dried beef restored to juiciness in the pan; and pork al pastor stained flame-red, a commingling of pineapple drippings and salt.As with a pizza, you\u2019re allowed to split toppings half and half, although the division isn\u2019t strictly observed and, more likely than not, you\u2019ll just get more of everything: a bounty.Once Cienega was just another bodega on a strip of Corona littered with them. \u201cNo money in that,\u201d said Maximo Ojeda, Ms. Mendez\u2019s husband, who transformed the store into a restaurant in 2014, when his mother-in-law arrived, bringing her recipes and cooking wisdom to New York. (The \u201cGrocery and Deli\u201d sign stayed up until last year.)Ms. Perez and Ms. Mendez come from the small town of San Agust\u00edn de las Juntas, in Oaxaca. Mr. Ojeda, who worked his way up from dishwasher to bus boy to waiter at other restaurants, grew up in an even smaller town, Ci\u00e9nega de Zimatl\u00e1n, which he remembers from his childhood in the \u201970s as a place where houses had no electricity or running water \u2014 \u201clike Amish country,\u201d he said \u2014 and neighbors had to share a single phone. (\u201cNow everybody has a cellphone,\u201d he said.)A friend from church turned the bodega\u2019s walls into bright murals, with dancers in voluminous skirts ready to take flight and flowers in riot: dahlias, poinsettias and calla lilies as if conjured by Diego Rivera. The rest of the room still has the feel of a just-vacated shop, but Mr. Ojeda makes up for it in gruff warmth.Beyond tlayudas, much of the menu is familiar from other Mexican restaurants in the borough: tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas. Of note are empanadas de amarillo, not little sealed pockets of dough but plate-wide tortillas folded around a yellow mole that shuns sweetness, rich with chicken broth and yerba santa, like a rinse of root beer.Enmoladas are loose rolls of tortillas, akin to enchiladas, enveloped in a mole that melds plantains and raisins with almonds and austerely dark chocolate, underscored by notes of smoke and fruit from pasilla, guajillo and ancho chiles. This is particularly fine accompanied by paper-thin cuts of bistec, fried hard and pleasingly close to jerky.There are no desserts, but who needs them when you have horchata, a lush blend of ground rice, walnuts and evaporated and condensed milk, steeped with cinnamon sticks and finished with a flurry of crushed pecans? Elsewhere in town, the drink can be so sweet that one sip is enough; here, served without ceremony in a plastic tub, it\u2019s cooling and warming at once.Come summer, Mr. Ojeda said, the horchata will shade into pink, from the addition of cantaloupe seeds and flesh, another Oaxacan tradition. He sighed at the thought. \u201cI am \u2014 how do you say? Sick for home.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For the U.S. and China, a Technology Cold War That\u2019s Freezing Over", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA cold war is being waged across the world\u2019s most advanced industries. And it just got a lot chillier.Recent tit-for-tat trade actions could deepen what has become a global contest for technological dominance between the United States and China, home to the planet\u2019s largest population of internet users and a flourishing community of start-ups and innovative companies.The fight between the two countries is cleaving the high-tech realm. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have each become increasingly protective of their own leading-edge industries, and mistrustful of the other\u2019s. Reconciliation looks difficult. And the rising tensions could further undercut American influence in a huge and fast-changing market.Both sides have been putting up defensive walls for years.The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.\u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201dChina could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201dChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.Despite the boost from America\u2019s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China\u2019s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.\u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201dIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.\u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Ben Carson, HUD Scales Back Fair Housing Enforcement", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is attempting to scale back federal efforts to enforce fair housing laws, freezing enforcement actions against local governments and businesses, including Facebook, while sidelining officials who have aggressively pursued civil rights cases.But Mr. Carson dismissed the idea he was abandoning the agency\u2019s fair housing mission as \u201cnonsense\u201d in a memo to the department\u2019s staff earlier this year, and reiterated that point during recent congressional hearings. A spokesman for the agency, Jereon Brown, said any programmatic changes are part of the routine recalibration undertaken from administration to administration, rather than a philosophical shift.Advocates for the poor and career HUD officials say that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, and his political appointees have begun weakening the department\u2019s fair housing division at a critical moment. The agency now has its greatest leverage to right past wrongs thanks to the $28 billion in disaster recovery Community Development Block Grants that Congress has appropriated to rebuild the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.The investigations, known as \u201csecretary-initiated cases\u201d to indicate their importance, had been used in the past to set precedent and to put other localities and developers on notice.One of the delayed investigations looked at an ordinance in Hesperia, Calif., that prevented the siting of neighborhood group homes for parolees and former offenders throughout the city\u2019s neighborhoods. HUD investigators saw the case as an important test of the federal resolve to rehabilitate low-level offenders, who often face housing and job discrimination when they are released, leaving them in need of government assistance.Other cases that were held up involved questions about the accessibility to the disabled of new dwellings built by a pair of large residential construction companies, Toll Brothers and Epcon Communities, in New York City and Ohio, according to a department official.One high-profile case never made it to that stage.But even before Ms. Far\u00edas was appointed, Mr. Carson\u2019s aides ordered fair housing division officials to cancel a planned negotiating session with Facebook executives, leaving HUD to take Facebook at its word that the company\u2019s \u201cpolicies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate.\u201dThen, after taking office, Ms. Far\u00edas sent a one-page letter to Facebook ordering, without explanation, the termination of a preliminary investigation into the company\u2019s advertising practices.Ms. Far\u00edas, an official at HUD in the George W. Bush administration, has not initiated any high-priority cases of her own, according to agency officials. And she has made it clear that she does not intend to aggressively pursue cases that are not instituted \u201cby my secretary,\u201d meaning Mr. Carson, according to an official who spoke with her last year.\u201cFor all intents and purposes, this administration is stopping the enforcement of civil rights and fair housing laws at the worst possible time,\u201d said Gustavo Velasquez, who served as assistant secretary for fair housing during the last three years of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the lack of an agenda, which is what I thought we were dealing with for the first year or so, but an attempt to reverse all the advances we made through regulations and enforcement actions,\u201d said Mr. Velasquez, who now works for the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan progressive think tank in Washington.This is not the first time critics have accused Mr. Carson, the only African-American man in President Trump\u2019s cabinet, of trying to stymie civil rights enforcement. Shortly after he was confirmed last year, Mr. Carson tried to reverse an Obama-era program that would make it easier for recipients of housing vouchers to use them in affluent neighborhoods.Last week, Mr. Carson told members of the Senate Banking Committee that he planned to delay another Obama-era rule that would have required local governments to create detailed plans to integrate racially divided neighborhoods.Despite these moves, Mr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the department was merely \u201clooking to streamline\u201d its enforcement efforts and to focus on new, neglected areas of discrimination.\u201cThere is no mission shift. We are, in fact, putting more emphasis in sexual harassment\u201d complaints, Mr. Brown wrote in an email. \u201cIn addition, 60 percent of the fair housing complaints we receive are disability related, and the majority of those have to do with service animals.\u201dIn a scathing letter, HUD officials accused Mr. Turner, who is African-American, of succumbing to \u201cracially motivated local opposition,\u201d claiming that he caved to protests by white business owners and residents.Mr. Turner has denied the accusation, arguing that he opposed the development because only 23 apartments were set aside for low-income families. He also objected to the idea of forced integration, putting him in agreement with Mr. Carson.\u201cI have chosen to stay in the neighborhood where I grew up, and I will not tell children in similar communities they must live somewhere else,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who grew up in an all-black development.But he might have had other reasons for opposing the project. In one meeting, Mr. Turner privately admitted that he hoped his position on the project would coax white Republican state legislators to support a bill needed to restructure Houston\u2019s ailing pension system, according to a former federal official who attended the meeting.The mayor denied that account.\u201cHe never told anyone he opposed the Fountain View Project to win votes for his pension overhaul,\u201d said Mary Benton, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turner.Still, few Democrats have done quite so well in negotiating with the Trump administration as Mr. Turner, who began pressing Mr. Carson to release the city from the order shortly after Mr. Carson was confirmed.Ms. Far\u00edas, with Mr. Carson\u2019s blessing, began negotiating directly with Mr. Turner and other city officials. She largely excluded the career lawyers who had already begun drafting a tougher order \u2014 one that required the city to pay the Houston Housing Authority, Fountain View\u2019s developer, as much as $14 million if it insisted on blocking the deal, according to an official in Houston.But Mr. Turner, who believes the case to be a distraction from his city\u2019s rebuilding effort, prevailed.But a coalition of local advocacy groups and national organizations are suing to block the disbursement of $5 billion in HUD recovery money unless the city abides by civil rights-era fair housing laws.\u201cFountain View was kind of the last stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent eight or nine years documenting systematic and pervasive racial discrimination in Houston \u2014 it is an open-and-shut case.\u201dMr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the agreement required the city to \u201cput in place new procedures for the building of affordable housing\u201d and a study on how to increase affordable housing in the city\u2019s Galleria district, where Fountain View was to be built.There are other signs of change within HUD that could make it far less likely that similar cases would ever be pursued.Ms. Far\u00edas, according to six current department officials, has told HUD managers that she intends to replace her top subordinate, Timothy Smyth, who played a central role in the Houston case. Bryan Greene, another senior manager, will be reassigned as part of the shake-up, the officials said.Mr. Brown, in an email, said no one had been reassigned yet \u2014 but he added that it was \u201cwell within the assistant secretary\u2019s authority after 120 days to reassign senior-level personnel.\u201dMorale at the division is sinking. At a meeting this month of HUD regional housing directors in Atlanta, Ms. Far\u00edas \u2014 a former vice chairwoman of the Bexar County, Tex., Republicans and a Trump campaign supporter \u2014 told one of the directors that she preferred older HUD employees because they were more likely to have had experience working for Republican administrations.Earlier, according to two aides who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, she had told her staff that it was her intention to root out people she viewed as \u201cObama plants.\u201dMs. Far\u00edas, through a spokesman, denied making those statements.An earlier version of this article misstated who was barred in a provision in the 2018 spending bill from requiring the production of plans to desegregate federally subsidized housing. It is HUD, not local governments.Advertisement"}

San Francisco and the peninsula to the south are still the global hub of tech finance and innovation.In 2005, Mr. Thiel explained, he was on a panel at Stanford. The question up for discussion was: Where will we find the next Google? \u201cIt was a search problem you couldn\u2019t solve by typing into the Google search engine,\u201d he says. \u201cThe answer I gave was there was 50 percent chance you would find it within a five-mile radius of the room we were in.\u201dIt turned out the next Google \u2014 at least in terms of the wealth it generated \u2014 was Facebook, in which Mr. Thiel was an investor. It was less than two miles away.\u201cIf I had to give that talk again, I\u2019d say there was far less than a 50 percent chance that it\u2019s in a 50-mile radius,\u201d he said. Perhaps the next great company would be in China, he suggested; perhaps elsewhere in the United States.The natural concentration of the tech industry was always an odd thing.\u201cThese technologies enabled globalization. They were about destroying the tyranny of place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a bit paradoxical that the overwhelming majority of them emerged in this very small place.\u201dThere are other reasons to leave. As the valley has gotten bigger and richer, it has, he feels, grown more close-minded.Sam Altman of Y Combinator, the start-up accelerator, is a friend of Mr. Thiel\u2019s.

The turkeys have regularly trapped people in their cars, swarmed them and pecked at their windows.

{"Headline": "Here Come the Fake Videos, Too", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArtificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person\u2019s face on another person\u2019s body with few traces of manipulation. I tried it on myself. What could go wrong? The scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you\u2019d see on a therapist\u2019s wall. In the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile.Then, the former first lady\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger began to strip.The video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what\u2019s known as a \u201cdeepfake\u201d \u2014 an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama\u2019s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny \u2014 if you didn\u2019t know better, you might have thought it was really her.Until recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology. But in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp \u2014 a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator.Before the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled \u201c3D face reconstruction for additional angles\u201d sat next to videos with titles like \u201c(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.\u201dSome users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world. Then, they kept making more. The deepfake creator community is now in the internet\u2019s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future. \u201cThis is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,\u201d wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B\u2019s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality? The user then signed off with a shrug: \u201cGodspeed rebels.\u201dAfter lurking for several weeks in Reddit\u2019s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face.I started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times\u2019s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes. What I learned is that making a deepfake isn\u2019t simple. But it\u2019s not rocket science, either.Once Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection.Picking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better. I\u2019m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from.To get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could.Mark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling.About eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling\u2019s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling\u2019s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me. We did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of \u201cJurassic World,\u201d whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set \u2014 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him \u2014 and let the model run overnight. In all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom.After the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers.\u201cI joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I\u2019d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.\u201dN. said he didn\u2019t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit\u2019s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product.\u201cI\u2019ve given it a lot of thought,\u201d he said, \u201cand ultimately I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to condemn the technology itself \u2014 which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.\u201dFakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it\u2019s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects.Deep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products.\u201cIt\u2019s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.\u201dOn the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, \u201cWhy We Need to Take Away White People\u2019s Guns Now More Than Ever,\u201d written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media.Online misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void.There\u2019s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they\u2019re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they\u2019re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them. \u201cThere\u2019s no choice,\u201d said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness.\u201cI see this as the next form of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.\u201dSo, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace.And there\u2019s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.Godspeed, rebels.

{"Headline": "Review: Momofuku Seiobo in Sydney, Australia", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "Australia FarePaul Carmichael, the chef, delivers a profoundly pleasurable experience at the Sydney location of David Chang\u2018s restaurant group.Supported byWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Mr. Carmichael\u2019s father had spent hard years working as a butler and bartender, and did not see it as a desirable path. He sought to break his son\u2019s romantic notions by getting him an unpaid job at a local restaurant. The plan backfired \u2014 Mr. Carmichael became hooked.When he made it to the Culinary Institute, his final thesis focused on Caribbean food. Then in his early 20s, he drew connections between slavery and colonialism and sustenance.He studied the ways in which food was often one of the only aspects of African culture that maintained an unbroken thread through generations, as language and religion and family were purposefully and systematically stripped from enslaved people. He dug into the history of certain dishes, tracing the heritage of flavors and the people who brought them to the Caribbean, and focused on how those flavors were melded and reshaped by new ingredients and new generations of cooks.Nearly 20 years later, in a multimillion-dollar kitchen in a casino here in Sydney, Mr. Carmichael is basically cooking that thesis, albeit through the lens of decades of experience in some of the best restaurants in America. (After graduation, he went on to work with Marcus Samuelsson, Wylie Dufresne and eventually David Chang.)11 PhotosThat was not always the case. In the restaurant\u2019s early days, the kitchen was headed by a British chef, Ben Greeno, who served Mr. Chang\u2019s famous pork buns alongside a globally influenced menu. What remains from those days is the format: a $185-per-person meal that on its surface looks very much like high-end tasting menus everywhere.At M\u00e1 P\u00eache, but also early in his tenure at Seiobo, Mr. Carmichael says he was trying to be two people. One was the cook he imagined Mr. Chang wanted him to be, making food that was more in line with the rest of the Momofuku empire. The other was truer to his own sensibilities.Mr. Carmichael says he didn\u2019t know exactly what he was going to cook when he accepted Mr. Chang\u2019s offer to move to Sydney, though he was given explicit instruction to do whatever he pleased.He wasn\u2019t quite prepared for the quality of tropical ingredients here \u2014 so much of what he had grown up eating and cooking in Barbados spilled forth from Sydney\u2019s market stalls. Slowly, and with the encouragement of the longtime front-of-house manager Kylie Javier Ashton, a new Seiobo emerged.The severe black-tiled room is often filled with the soft thrum of reggae music. Cooks deliver dishes and name-check origins: Antigua for sweet potato ducana with currants and a deep, sweet \u201cCaribbean XO\u201d sauce; Puerto Rico for a bowl of mofongo that arrives in a large mortar.Customers are given a pestle and asked to grind the mixture of plantains, garlic and chicharrones into a thick paste themselves \u2014 one of many interactive interludes in the meal.A shallow glass of intensely flavored pork broth accompanies the mofongo, made more extreme by a squiggle of smoked rendered pork fat. It delivers a level of pleasurable excess you might expect from a Chang restaurant, but set against the grounded moderation of the plantains, it provides elegant balance \u2014 porky treble to the dish\u2019s starchy bass.Cou cou, often considered the national dish of Barbados, is here reimagined with fresh corn in place of cornmeal, and Sterling caviar in place of the flying fish the dish usually accompanies. The result is a dream of creamy pur\u00e9ed corn with a swoosh of okra and the saline pop of mellow caviar.It makes for a glorious mouthful, modern and soulful and rooted in sense memory. Even if the memory is not your own, you taste its recollective pull.The apex of the meal comes when servers present a pot holding live marron. A few minutes later, the shellfish are back again, split open and smothered in a bright, delicately spicy sofrito.There is no way to approach the dish without making a glorious mess, while scooping the tender flesh awash in sticky sauce and just the right touch of stank from the roe and head of the spindly beasts.This is the kind of food that requires full abandon. (Wet towels are provided.)Mr. Carmichael is presenting a beautifully considered tribute to his birthplace, with all the thought and care and honor of fine dining, and all the fun of Momofuku. Many diners are likely to find the experience quite moving as well, particularly those with a personal connection to the history and culture upon which the chef\u2019s long-ago thesis was based.That audience is primarily elsewhere, and I can\u2019t help but think how much America might benefit from this profoundly pleasurable expression of African and Caribbean foodways.That this incarnation of Momofuku Seiobo exists in Australia makes us a lucky country indeed.An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Momofuku Seiobo opened. It was 2011, not 2012.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pet Instagram, Adult Dorms and Overlooked Obituaries: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted._________I am a 16 year old who feels strongly about politics, but I don\u2019t think the voting age should be lowered. At 16, teens are highly impressionable and easily succumb to peer pressure. Someone might vote for a candidate just because their friends or parents like them. Even though the article says that teens have the cognitive ability to make informed decisions, I still believe that the majority of 16 year old\u2019s would not make individual decisions. I consider myself a democrat, and I feel strongly about my views, but would I still feel the same way if my parents weren\u2019t democrats as well? I can\u2019t help wondering what I would be like if I was raised in a conservative household. Would I have the same views?I\u2019m 15 years old and I know several people that are 16/17 and are far more educated than some people over 18. If the question is if we are capableI believe we are, we are not stupid and especially with social media lots of us are involved with politics sharing our opinions but it hardly means anything when we can\u2019t even vote. We are giving political speeches at our walkouts, emailing congress, writing letters and marching for justice, we are more than capable to voteTeenagers today are much more exposed to politics thanks to the internet. They can follow it and form opinions on it easily because it\u2019s at their fingertips. If they\u2019re passionate about the issue being voted upon then they should be able to take part in the decision making. Teenagers aren\u2019t oblivious to what\u2019s going on in their country anymore and want to take some kind of action. Lowering the voting age would give the younger people of America opportunities to be apart of the community political-wise.I think that both sides have equally convincing evidence. On the one hand, 16 year olds are still young, and barely forming their own political opinions. Many don\u2019t know what to believe in, and many others like to live in ignorance of political issues. However, time and time again, we have seen teenagers age 16 or 17 achieve amazing feats. In regards to the Florida shooting, the \u201cchildren\u201d are the ones moving for change in a broken system, when adults refuse to do so. Teenagers this age are full of hope; they are passionate and strong-willed, and some apply these qualities to political issues as well. Even though both sides make sense, I believe that the voting age should be lowered to age 16. In these times, children are maturing much faster. There are many sixteen year olds with more rational and sophisticated opinions than adults. Also, I think that although sixteen year olds may just be forming informed political opinions, they should have a say in issues that drastically affect their lives, like gun violence. And overall, younger people are the future of the world. Change usually comes from the younger generation.As a 16 year old myself, I do not think that the voting age should be lowered to 16. While I do accept that 16 and 17 year olds are able to make rational decisions using \u201ccold\u201d cognition in a low-pressure situation such as voting, I do not think that their scientific capability to make choices should make them eligible to vote. The primary reason that I am opposed to 16 and 17 year olds being able to vote is that they are not yet legal adults. For the majority of teens, this means that they are under the care and control of their parents. While a huge population of young people is interested in current events and politics, and stays up to date on unbiased views of various topics, there are still large numbers of 16 to 17 year olds whose only knowledge of political controversy comes from their parents. Many young people have been fed their parents\u2019 ideas since birth, and when living at home have no source of outside knowledge. If teens who are not yet legal adults and therefore not yet independents are able to vote, I think that a large portion of this age group\u2019s voters would simply vote however their parents tell them to.Go to a high school and interview 3 random 16 year olds. Ask them current political questions. 2 out of the 3 will have no clue what you\u2019re talking about. Enough said.The status quo must be maintained due to the fact that elections aren\u2019t always \u201ccold cognition\u201d scenarios. Elections have been well known to be hectic with the emphasis of political and public pressure being based on the choice of the individual, therefore the brain relies on \u201chot cognition\u201d since the would-be voter is being pressured by peers and organizations. Studies have already shown that at 16 the part of the brain that processes \u201chot cognition\u201d is not fully developed and makes them more susceptible to emotional outbursts and the bias in decisions that follows, especially when a presidential candidate tries to poke at emotions to rally people together. This part of the brain is more developed in a 21 year old and is less likely (not never) to vote based on emotions.If the voting age were to be lowered to 16, I would vote. Many of the decisions that voters decide on now are what teenagers enter once they are considered \u201cadults\u201d. College students, just as high school students, have the same ability to be swayed by their peers and are quick to make impulsive decisions if they are unaware of the topic. If voters are voting on education, being a student, I wouldn\u2019t want a 60 year old high school drop out making decisions on what will occur with my education. Also, how come we can register to vote at 16, yet not be able to vote? In order to register, I believe that some sort of maturity and responsibility is needed simply to reach out and desire to vote in the future.I do not agree with the writer\u2019s stance that the voting age should be lowered from eighteen to sixteen. At this age I do believe that some 16-year olds are capable of making these political decisions on what to vote for, but that does not pertain to most. At this age there are many 16-year-olds who do not pay attention to current events and what is happening in politics. Also, that they truly do not have a grasp on the meaning of the events. If I was able to vote at 17, I do not believe that I would because I do not necessarily pay attention to government actions unless I am talking about it in one of my classes. Also, 16-year-olds are not a legal adult yet so they are still living at home listening to their parents opinions. This could sway them in one direction instead of making their own decision on what to vote for. I believe that the younger audience is easier to direct in one direction by feeding them false information about a certain topic. Many have not been exposed to the harsh world of politics and what occurs in order to win votes. High school students are still able to have a voice even if they are not allowed to vote. There are the high school students from the school shooting in Florida speaking out on their opinions of gun control and what should happen to control it. These students are making a difference even though they do not have the right to vote.I believe that the voting age should be lowered. Teenagers voices should be heard and people think that our opinions are unimportant and they look over them. Teenagers are close to being adults and expect to be safe during that period of time. When a gun is easier to get that a drivers license that is unacceptable. Gun laws should be raised to be stricter and more efficient than letting people get guns with disorders and mental disabilities. We expect to be safe and not have rampaging people with guns running around and killing people. Even if we are not adults our opinions should be heard!!!!!!!!!Should 16-year-olds be able to vote, let me take a moment to laugh. The issue with that is, we\u2019re kids. It might sting some to be called that, but that is because it\u2019s true. We aren\u2019t as focused or passionate on politics to make specific decisions that could affect the country as a whole. Sure, this can deal a lot with gun-control and drugs, but a few hundred thousand teens still aren\u2019t loud enough to reach the government. NRA, they control what happens with guns because they have the time, money, and power to toy with whatever they want. Drugs, I don\u2019t think we need to see a bunch of stoned kids walking around campus just because \u201cit\u2019s legal\u201d. Besides, most of us will just bandwagon off of somebody else\u2019s idea of society because we don\u2019t want to understand. Our job as student is to study so we can have a greater education that the generation before us, so we have a chance to make this country better for those who come after us.I agree with the writer\u2019s proposal to lower the voting age to 16. School shootings are happening more often then they should, so there needs to be an end to them. Having kids that are of the age of 16 and are in school would be a perfect time for them to start voting because when the kids are in school they would know what to vote on._________When I was in fifth grade, I made an Instagram account for my five pound Yorkie, Lulu. Now, five years ago, Instagram was not as it is today with the concept of \u201chigh quality = high amount of likes.\u201d I uploaded photos of Lulu going on walks to chase after squirrels and videos of her attacking the obnoxious pool cleaner. With a little help from hashtags, a couple hundred people started to follow this lovable ball of fur. And that was the height of Lulu\u2019s Instagram career. Years passed, the social media algorithm changed. You could take the most aww-dorable pictures like @chloekardoggian, or come up with the most clever captions like @itsdougthepug, or take the funniest pictures of your dog in clothes like @poochofnyc, but in reality it all comes down to luck when it comes to getting your picture seen, no matter how many hashtags. And that all has to do with the fact that the market is overcrowded. Even if you believe you have taken the cutest and creative photo of your pet, it\u2019s guaranteed that someone else has already done just that. Rewind a couple years, then yes, gaining likes and follows would merely be based on \u201cspecial talents and signature style.\u201d But in today\u2019s day in age, if you want your pooch to be a \u201cpet-influencer,\u201d \u2014 how do I put this nicely \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna happen.Social media accounts for animals are some of my favorite pages to scroll through because they are so adorable and always make me laugh. My dog is one that also always makes me laugh but I do not think she should have her own social media page. She is funny and exciting in person, but she is extremely difficult to catch on camera. That being said, to be star material, an animal must do comical things, or other notable actions, and allow cameras to capture their moments. The moments also must draw attention from more people than just the owners of the animal. The pages are usually funny or heartwarming, and I am very glad they are in existence.I feel like both of my dogs could be Instagram stars. I have two rescue dogs, both considered to be mutts. The youngest and littlest one being Sandy, a big eyed, silky coated, attention seeker. The other one being my oldest dog. His name is Piper. He\u2019s an older, strong, pincher mutt with a bad knee but with more energy than he knows what to do with at his age. Both of my dogs love being around my family and myself 24/7, often doing quirky and cute things in order to get their way. Sandy is just photogenic, often lying around and sleeping in adorable positions. While Piper, all he wants to do is run around and to go explore the neighborhood. I feel that with how well behaved both of them are, they would make excellent social media stars. I feel like because both Sandy and Piper are rescues and mutts, they would automatically be loved by anyone who came across their adorable faces, just like the article said. Step aside purebreds! The mutts are taking over the show!Instagram accounts featuring dogs have become increasingly popular in the past few years, and after reading the article I can tell you, without a doubt, that my dog is not Instagram worthy. Humans tend to favor dogs that look like them, which is why one of the most popular dog Instagram accounts is for a pug and the most popular dog breeds include Golden Retrievers, Bulldogs, Huskies, Beagles and more. My dog is the opposite. Bella wasn\u2019t a rescue, but the money we bought her with went into getting surgery for a sick dog who wasn\u2019t being adopted because of a knee injury. She\u2019s a Dachshund Border Collie mix (I know, weird.) and she\u2019s infuriatingly annoying. She has horrible attachment issues, won\u2019t do what she\u2019s told, and even though she\u2019s a small dog, can somehow get the food left on the counter. All this with being pretty smart. We keep her in a crate when we leave for school so she doesn\u2019t chew anything up and she has learned to automatically go in her cage in the mornings so we forget to lock it, and she has free roam of the entire house for 7 hours. She also gets in the trash. We turn the can around so she can\u2019t get inside but she still happens to make a mess. But I have to admit, she is adorable. So maybe she could become Instagram famous, if only we could get her to pose for a picture._________The Starcity arrangements detailed here sound like a dream \u2014 you can live comfortably with your friends, a lower rent, and in a thriving city! There seems to be no wrong, except that you have to share your living space with others. But that doesn\u2019t seem so bad compared to the upsides, and it actually might be a plus. I\u2019ve always particularly liked the idea of living in places that are strange but ideal \u2014 daydreams about living on furnished and futuristic ceilings, cozy 50 square feet apartments, and empty shopping malls to come home to fill my head often. There\u2019s something about deciding what your life can be like and how you can make it feel good that entices me, and choosing to live in a dorm like this is no exception. This echoes the kind of living I want to do, with traits that contrast the home I live in now. With this, housing with others sounds perfect. Even if it\u2019s not exactly like this, with Starcity perfection, the independence that emanates from such an experience is appealing. I think I really would like communal living when I grow up.I go to school surrounded by classmates and faculty, at work there are my coworkers and boss, and then out in the town are countless strangers. At the end of the day I come home to a house full of three other people. Where is my alone time? I feel the most pleasurable thing about being adult is enduring the busy day and then getting to retreat to a quiet house where you are free to be yourself and get work done without distractions. Sharing a small space with another person might save a grand amount of money and help with social advances, but it won\u2019t give me the personal time I crave at the end of each day.I think this is a brilliant idea to implement, especially in expensive urban areas similar to San Francisco. Many middle class workers don\u2019t make enough to pay for adequate housing in trustworthy facilities and eventually they might have to just give up and move to a cheaper place. I\u2019m not certain if I as a person would live in one of these communal housing buildings because though it might sound unpleasant at first, the positive community and being able to meet with new people really agree with me. In the end, my conclusion is this, if I ever found myself in a ridiculously expensive city with no stable income, I would most likely live in these dorms. Additionally, I would definitely have no problem adjusting as I would have probably already experienced communal living in college and am a generally social person. I don\u2019t like living alone so this setup may actually benefit me in the future. We\u2019ll just have to see.I personally would love the opportunity to live in a communal housing. I enjoy people. And I enjoy compromising and learning more about others. I have been raised in a fairly large family, so in my house, it basically feels as if I live in a communal housing unit with just a bit more privacy. I find it comforting knowing that if I need someone to talk to, or want to eat with someone, that there is always someone around. I believe that Starcity is creating something wonderful. It allows people who are normally alone to feel connected and as if they have a place.Initially, when I saw the words \u201ccommunal living\u201d I thought \u201cno way\u201d could I ever live like that! I\u2019m the kind of person who doesn\u2019t do well with living and sharing space with others (of course other than my family). This thought has been proven true over and over again when I come home from sleepovers that I regret. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy the company of others, I just have a certain way that I do things and anything that disrupts those certain things drives me nuts. However, after reading the article and seeing how much tenants such as Ms. Shiver and Ms. Ndrepepaj enjoy the space and being around other tenants, maybe I would learn to love Starcity. I love how everyone gets their own room but others areas are shared. My bedroom is the one place that I would need to be solely my own and private, so I appreciate the fact that it was made to be personal for everyone. Ms. Ndrepepaj alluded to the fact that having the shared space allows for everyone to get to know each other, resulting in friendships or rather a sense of family. Compared to my situation right now, I think it\u2019d be nice to actually know my neighbors name and have a genuine conversation lasting longer than \u201chow are you\u201d and an awkward shuffle for my door._________I think it\u2019s a great idea for incarcerated individuals in our society to have a chance to better themselves educationally. These prisoners have been cast out and sent to \u201ccorrectional facilities\u201d to essentially sit and wait for their sentence to be served. With education opportunities, they would be ready to return to society and participate in a positive way. Many could use these opportunities to really turn their lives around.Higher education is the most direct way to resolving our prison crisis. Although a 43% lower likelihood of recidivism and a 13% higher likelihood of getting a job after leaving prison does not mean all prisoners will improve, higher education causing less recidivism and a more peaceful environment can save prisons a vast amount of money. I also believe that a more college environment for prisoners would help, as it too would encourage good behavior and help with returning to society; although I fear that a difference in views on what places such as Germany (with lower recidivism and prison costs) see as learning how to fit in society, the United States sees as punishment for the wrong done in society and nothing more. One would think that decreasing private prisons, increasing psychological help, and increasing education opportunities would cost more, but by implementing these changes prisons would likely decrease in population over time \u2014 to an extent \u2014 and result in spending less on prisons. No matter what, there is a problem with prisons, and education looks like a promising part to the answer.There\u2019s no doubt that prisons are necessary atmospheres in society. A consequence for a greater punishment. But should that mean that inmates can\u2019t even obtain a proper education? Sure, they\u2019ve committed crimes and most of them are in there for the correct reason, but isn\u2019t the main goal for them to come out rehabilitated and able to integrate back into society? Integrating a college program into prisons would further this process and even be better for communities in the long run. When an individual goes to any type of school, they learn, and as the article states, this gives a better understanding of the world and allows them to become more empathetic. These are qualities many incarcerated peoples either lack or have learned to ignore. It is also a fact that many prisoners come from poor backgrounds with little to no education. Then they resort to crime and other means to make a living. In no way is this acceptable, but having college classes in prison would help them make up for their missed education. So once these prisoners got out of jail, they could give back to their community through the work force and use their newly-obtained education for the betterment of the world.Since the creation of jails in the year 1790, these closed in barriers were invented to punish criminals for their actions - some more extreme than others. I just can\u2019t get this idea of education in jails past my head, because it completely defeats the purpose of a jail, prison or however one may refer to it as. If jails are intended to punish, then why reward criminals with the power of literature and studies, something every criminal had access to before they decided that taking drugs or killing people took priority over studies? Yes, educating criminals may teach them life lessons that they can apply to their lives when they are released, but what about the people who deserve actual punishment for their actions and are instead treated with reading, writing and debating? That doesn\u2019t sound like much of a punishment to me, nevertheless taking place where punishment is the sole purpose. I am not all against the idea of educating prisoners with lesser crimes because, as the article states, \u201cinmates who took classes had a 43 percent lower likelihood of recidivism and a 13 percent higher likelihood of getting a job after leaving prison.\u201d I just believe that we as a nation are too afraid to give the punishment criminals deserve, and that educating them is only covering up their crimes and the hardship they have caused to the victims in the world.I disagree, yes most prisons are meant to punish the person that has committed the crime but they are also supposed to rehabilitate the inmates who have made mistake in the past. Education is a great way to do this. Many prisons offer different types of classes such as business and social-studies and some even offer the ability to get your high school diploma. Just because a person has done something wrong in their past that they regret does not mean they shouldn\u2019t be able to learn new things and explore new careers for when they eventually get out of prison. Also, being able to learn and take classes in jail does not take away from the fact that a person is in prison. The person still is only able to see their family a few times a week, they cannot use the internet freely, and they have awful living conditions, prison will always be prison, we will always take away a prisoner\u2019s right to go to the outside world, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should take away their right to learn.I would argue that if \u201ccovering up\u201d crimes with education works then why not use it? Punishment in prisons exists as negative reinforcement for avoiding crime, however as research shows it does not work well enough. Education in prisons serves the same purpose: encourage the avoidance of further crime.I do not disagree that our prison system is flawed but I don\u2019t think college level education for incarcerated people is the best choice. I am a high school student and I have an older brother in college. The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned about getting an education is that it\u2019s expensive and needs to be earned. I spend all of my time thinking about my resume and hearing my brother complain about the debt he is in. Now people are saying that incarcerated people have an easier gate to education. I cannot imagine a world where students get denied from college because a murderer has taken their spot or someone living in a pile of debt that they could have avoided if they had robbed a bank.So tell me Ms. Hilton, why should prisoners be rewarded with education for their crimes while students are punished after working hard all their lives?In our ever divided country very few issues are as divisive as our prison system. Many like to think that prison should be about \u201chard time\u201d that they are paying their dues to society for the crimes that they have committed. Maybe instead of this \u201chard time\u201d philosophy we should look more to rehabilitation something that will help out entire nation. If we can make the 2.2 million people that are incarcerated and reform even a quarter through education problems that could not only help make more good members of our community, but help cut down on the billions we spend each year on prisons and welfare programs once these prisoners are out of prison._________Researching my ancestry is one of my favorite things to do; I am completely fascinated by my heritage, genealogy, and genetics. Being able to know more about the ancestors that came before me and how I came to be is very important to me, and I\u2019m sure many people feel the same. As for my family tree, I have traced most of my ancestry back to Great Britain, Japan, and Ireland, though I know of some German, Belgian, and Spanish ancestry as well! Even though it\u2019s nice to know your history, I\u2019m certainly glad that modern technology and transportation have aided us in forming more diverse relationships outside of local gene pools, and I hope this genetic diversity can lead to a decrease in birth defects and genetic diseases.For as long as humans have walked the Earth, ancestry has been a major focal point in many cultures; ranging from the filial piety of the Chinese to the \u2018pure\u2019 blood-line of the Habsburgs of Austria. To me, heritage is much more than a couple names on a piece of paper. It is the recollection of hundreds of years of blood-lines \u2014 with geographic relocation, intermarriage, isolation and many other factors in the mix that ultimately determine \u201cwhy\u201d you are where you are today. As author Steph Yin says, learning about ancestries provides \u201copportunities\u201d, be that ranging from the probability of certain family members contracting diseases to finding cures for life-risking illnesses. Simply, there is much more good to find in trekking through the past than haphazardly ignoring the makeup of your ancestral motherhood. Personally, I love looking back at my family and peoples\u2019 history as it is an extremely diverse one. Bulgaria, the country which I have been born/raised in, has been conquered (and regrettably enslaved and killed) by the Byzantines, Greeks, Turks, and Romans. We are deemed to be a migratory Mongolic-Slavic peoples, sharing roots from Central Asia and Eastern Europe alike. It\u2019s amusing to try to figure out what I am, as I share Mongol ancestry through one part of my family and Slavic through the other. I enjoy how I can assimilate into both cultures and be proud of my origins, however historically disenfranchised or glorified they may be.Personally, my ancestry and heritage has always been a prominent factor in my life. In fact, one of my clearest memories from when I was younger revolves around my dad, gifting my brother and I a golden coin with our family name engraved on it, from a factory in Germany that our cousins own. With the coin, he also gifted us stories and information about our family, and origins. My mom chimed in as well \u2014 speaking of how her side of the family was Slovakian, and Irish. My mother is very, VERY into our ancestry. In fact, she\u2019s one of the people who pays for memberships on those genealogy websites, like mentioned in the article. Her and my grandmother have always been curious about it, spending hours researching it together at the computer or over the phone. (My grandmother even paid to have official DNA testing done.) I believe that my mom\u2019s interest about it has rubbed off on me a bit as well, as ever since I was younger, I\u2019d proudly share and brag about my heritage. Though, I do sometimes see an author with the same last name as me, or another classmate, or even a friend \u2014 and I can\u2019t help but wonder if somehow, we\u2019re distant relatives. Of course, I doubt that they\u2019d be anything like fourth cousins (like sampled in the article), but, curiosity still gets the better of me, and I can\u2019t help but research it or ask about it, many times.Just the other night I was talking to my grandparents about their ancestors and they told me that even they don\u2019t know everyone in their family tree. They followed up with, \u201cwell we\u2019ll know in 2-3 weeks,\u201d so I guess I won\u2019t have to wait long to see everyone who\u2019s related to me from my dad\u2019s side. That\u2019s besides the point, ancestry has always been cool to me but I\u2019ve never been invested in it and I probably won\u2019t be until my grandparents get the results back. Marrying relatives, maybe because it\u2019s almost extinct today but wouldn\u2019t you think it would be weird to marry even a fourth cousin? In my mind it is but back then it was natural as stated in the article. The closer you are to home the more likely you are to marry a cousin. I\u2019m glad that 1875 happened and people came to the conclusion that this is weird. If they didn\u2019t then it\u2019s very possible my mom and dad would be related, gross. All and all, I am very glad that people got some sense knocked into them and stopped marrying relatives.You reach to feel the crippled, geriatric book high up in your home\u2019s forgotten shelf. You grasp the solid and slide it carefully between surrounding notebooks and books. After long awaited seconds, you achieve to get the solid out of its own home, as you begin to feel the weigh of it. Observing the book, it does not seem out of place with the other books, it just looks more crippled; signaling its higher age. Yearning to get to know what\u2019s inside, you place your hands at both extremes of the book and separate them slowly, bringing the cover of the book with you. The first page, you recognize, has something typed down, kind of erased so you are unable to understand what its saying. Your sight goes down at the only readable words in the first page. You automatically realize the letters form a known word in your mind, so known you recite them everyday. It is a common name, followed by your last name! You wonder if the writer of this book is part of your family. You yearn to know more about your ancestry, your ancestor\u2019s ancestry; who you are, why you are here and not there. You have never done DNA testing, you wished you had, but money is an issue that is directed to needs. Suddenly though, this feels a need. You recognize a long awaited question: why am I here, not there, why am I here? Unanswered questions keep being unanswered, your history unknown._________Qiu Jin interested me most from the list of obituaries. Everything about her screams unusual for her time. As it said in the list, she had a passion for wine, swords, and bomb making. She is everything a writer would want a feminist character to be. The contrast between her love of bombs, and her beautiful poetry is intriguing and fascinating. What especially grabbed my attention was her ethnicity, Chinese. The stereotype of a Chinese woman is submissive, and to the patriarchy she is just a woman who is meant to be at home, not grabbing everything life has to offer. Her work in liberating Chinese woman from societal constraints shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.Although it is disappointing, I wasn\u2019t surprised that she and many others weren\u2019t given obituaries until now. The work she did for woman is wonderful, but it can be easily overlooked. I think that the criteria for determining who deserves an obituary should be simple. People who have left the world a better place than when they came should be the ones who are given the honor.One person who has inspired me to continue to pursue mathematics and science is Katherine Johnson. She was one of the many human computer at NASA in the 50\u2019s. She helped calculate the trajectory for Alan Shepard. Among this amazing accomplishment she was one of three black students to integrate into West Virginia\u2019s graduate schools. She is an amazing woman and her and her other human computer have finally gotten the appreciation they deserve. The movie Hidden Figures tells the story of Katherine. She is still alive today at 99. She has truly been overlooked by history and textbooks.It\u2019s so surprising to me that even something so universal and commonplace as an obituary can be affected by inequality. I think the most shocking omission was Sylvia Plath. Plath, who wrote numerous influential poems and The Bell Jar, is a very well known twentieth century figure, therefore it seems inevitable that she would receive one. This is especially true when even minuscule contributions, like naming the Slinky earned recognition in the Times. Though I knew who Plath was, along with Bronte and Lacks, I really had not heard of any of the other women before. For someone who prides herself on being knowledgeable of gender, this really speaks of how we recognize women in society. I hope that in the future, obituaries in the Times more universally acknowledge those who affected the world in a positive manner. I think the Overlooked project is a step in the right direction.These women all struggled for equality, went through hardships, and were never recognized at all. I was even disappointed in myself that I only knew about half of the women.I think that this is a good step in the right direction. I just wish it hadn\u2019t taken so long. All these women have been dead for years, and maybe, just maybe if they had been recognized sooner more people would know of their contributions and struggles. I also hate (and yes I know hate is a strong word) that this had to be purposely done. If we lived in a fair and equal society this article would not have existed, women would just automatically be given the same respect as men. It would be routine not an afterthought. Praise should not be given out to those who simply acknowledge women. I think moments like these shouldn\u2019t happen because of a new \u201ctrend\u201d but every day.I hope that someday a kid opens the NYT and finds a headline that says \u201cthe greatest contributions of women from the last 100 years.\u201d I hope they read it, and learn something about the awesome women who lived. I hope they aren\u2019t surprised there is an article dedicated to women. I hope that hundreds of other articles like this exist. I hope that it\u2019s a normal occurrence, not something that\u2019s forced._________This photo can definitely represent a multitude of things that take place in today\u2019s world, most of it being very negative and centered around technology. The massive ship in the background of the picture appears to be unharmed and moving peacefully across the water. Although, on the phone being held up, the ship is sinking and there is lots of text shown below it. I believe this is trying to show us that the news stretches and embellishes stories a lot, and that most of the population blindly follows them. Also that we enjoy hearing about negative occurrences in the news rather than positive ones. Most stories on something good happening don\u2019t exist, which is what I think this article is trying to portray and is the main reason why we receive and listen to all of these awful and negative stories in the news.In this image I see a picture portraying the growing issue of false information in today\u2019s society. A good word to describe this picture is \u201cclickbait\u201d. \u201cClickbait\u201d is when an image is distorted or dramatized in order to entice people into clicking on it. Clickbait is a huge issue in the social media world these days, people will come up with crazy titles or images to put on their videos and or pictures in order to earn \u201cviews\u201d or \u201clikes\u201d, but usually 99% of the time, those images and titles are false. This leads to many people being misinformed about a certain situation or thing, which is obviously never a good thing. When people are misinformed it can lead to unnecessary situations and problems that can harm not only the person who is misinformed but others around them.When Mr. McKinney said, \u201cmy experience is that once this stuff gets going, people just pass these stories on without even necessarily stopping to read them,\u201d it really made my concern grow. I\u2019m deeply concerned with the fact that lies can be spread that easily. False information and fake stories are a very dangerous thing that can spiral into a harmful situation such as falsely accusing someone, hurting someone\u2019s reputation or even ruining relationships.I think that before anyone spreads anything that they read online, they should always fact check. We need to start being more careful on social media when we read stories or view images because it\u2019s very likely that these things could be false.Information we get from the digital realm - Facebook, cable news, etc. - leads us to believe our world is falling apart at the seams. If we put down the phone and analyze our surroundings with our own eyes, we\u2019ll see that everything is business as usual for the most part. I feel there is a strong thread of truth to that message, though maybe the ship should be drawn slightly listing to starboard.This image seems to be portraying the common theme of how social media tends to change the original story or truth. It represents how nowadays, the truth always seems to be shifted somehow which results in many different points of views and stories. This image seems to also represent the negative connotation regarding technology. The photo of the ship on the phone in comparison to the ship, in reality, seems heated and in a bad situation, just like how social media often is now. It shows how exaggerated things seem to be when in reality they\u2019re not.Ah, this reminds me of a British propaganda poster in WW2 stating the following, \u201cLoose Lips Sink Ships\u201d. Misinformation as been a problem since the dawn of communication between humans.As kids, a fun game we are taught in kindergarten is telephone. Telephone is a simple game where a statement is whispered into the ear of the first person and they must relay it to the end without mistakes. If the statement is different by the time it gets to the end, someone altered the statement. This small children\u2019s game is an extremely accurate representation of media in this day and age.Winston Churchill once said that a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get his pants up. A good example in recent news is the Florida shooting. All these different news outlets had different interpretations of the event and sometimes you just don\u2019t know what to trust, what you heard or what you saw on the news. Then the next day, people will start debating on what THEY heard, and will try to justify it even though it may be different from what the person they are in debate with heard. This can harm social interactions and can influence things for the worst in today\u2019s society of believing everything we see whether it be in the news, on the internet, or from others we trust._________It was all about the precision of where I placed each of my fingers. How I used my hands to block the box-like build that my light shaded glasses had possessed. When I would take breaths, so that I would not be tempted to let out the faint hint of a giggle because I knew if I did not take care with these steps to be the perfect player at hid and go seek, I would have not only lost out on a quiet night but, a much less stress-filled one.I was asked by Mrs. Smith, the mother of a two year old son and a five year old daughter, who lived all the way at the end of the driveway, located exactly 0.75 of a mile away from my house, that could meet the standards of a royal family, to watch the younger child. The older, being treated to a night at the ballet. It was not my first time watching another living organism, my aunt\u2019s cat is the only available experience to add to my potential growing list.I was to leave my house at 5:15 on Saturday night, to be there at promptly 5:19, the time that would be most logical to come at, the Smith\u2019s idea, not mine. I was to come through the front door, take off my shoes directly a few feet from the house mat outside of the door, so no dirt would be tracked in on the freshly installed white, porcelain linoleum.As I proceeded to walk through the door, I saw it, the future to the most downcasted night of my entire career in the over watching of pre-educated, elite children. I should have known from the first word ever spoken to me.She doesn\u2019t want to look. She never does. Each time it happens, each time he says what he says, she feels every atom in her body recoil. Trust me, she tells you, I don\u2019t want to look.But something inside of me, she says, does. I do want to look. Because maybe the outcome will be different. You are supposed to give people the benefit of the doubt, right? She looks at you for affirmation, as if this isn\u2019t something she\u2019s supposed to say. You nod. You\u2019re supposed to, yes, you say, But sometimes that sort of thing has a limit.Every time I look, she continues, nothing changes. It\u2019s the same. He says the same thing, and does the same actions, and I\u2019m not even sure why I cover my eyes if it\u2019s the words that really get to me, shouldn\u2019t I be covering my ears?Maybe, you say, clearing your throat just so, Maybe it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to see him saying those things. Perhaps it\u2019s easier to pretend that he\u2019s not the one saying them.Maybe, she says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steve Bannon Is Done Wrecking the American Establishment. Now He Wants to Destroy Europe\u2019s.", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon leaned back in an armchair opposite a copy of a painting by an Italian old master and explained his modest efforts to build a vast network of European populists to demolish the Continent\u2019s political establishment.\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to be,\u201d he said, \u201cis the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\u201dJust that.But now Mr. Bannon, the architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist campaign message and the president\u2019s former chief strategist, has returned with an international mission.In Zurich, Mr. Bannon says, he had a \u201cfascinating\u201d meeting on Tuesday with leaders of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party.In a sprawling interview here, he declined to name whom he had met, other than to describe them as a broad array of politicians, operatives and investors.Aside from the occasional coffee at Campo de\u2019 Fiori or photo-op at Piazza Navona, Mr. Bannon has been holed up in hotel rooms, taking meeting after meeting.In both cities, he wore a blue and white striped button down over a polo shirt. In Rome the polo was orange. In Milan it was blue.He sipped sparkling water and described a grand vision for a global populist future.In the United States, Mr. Bannon said, he is working on a project to create a think tank to \u201cweaponize\u201d populist economic and social ideas.He sees that work spreading to Europe, where a proliferation of populist websites in the image of Breitbart News, either owned by him or others, will spread those ideas, under his guidance.As a final component, he wants to train an army of populist foot soldiers in the language and tools of social media.Mr. Bannon said that a common message he had received from populists throughout Europe was a desire to establish a media outlet for their views.\u201cThey see what Breitbart did and they want it in their own language,\u201d said Mr. Bannon, who slipped into the present tense when talking about the website from which he recently separated. \u201cThat\u2019s the key. Right now my sites are in English, they want one in their own language,\u201d he said, calling that \u201cphase two.\u201dBut Mr. Bannon, who said he was paying for the trip, said he was weighing whether to buy a name-brand outlet, like Newsweek or United Press International, or to start a new one, or to connect entrepreneurs with capital or invest himself.He imagined a scoop-driven and high-metabolism outlet \u201clike Axios,\u201d he said, referring to the buzzy Washington newsletter, but with a populist bent that would devour Europe\u2019s sleepy legacy papers.\u201cWhether I do it or a local entrepreneur does it,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are going to be these populist nationalist news sites that pop up in the next year on line. That will only take these things to the next level.\u201dWith Europe more aggressively tackling the migration issue, Mr. Bannon was aiming to move the future battle of populism to other terrains.He said that the reason it was so important to get populist nationalist governments in place was to prepare for a coming great-powers clash with an axis of ancient Turkish, Persian and Chinese civilizations. \u201cElites can\u2019t fight that fight,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause people have to buy into it.\u201dHe is also increasingly interested in motivating people to fight media conglomerates like Facebook that monetize their data. And he has become fascinated with crypto currencies and how they can help populist movements, the subject of a speech he gave in Zurich this week.In preparation for the speech, organized by Die Weltwoche, a conservative Swiss magazine, Mr. Bannon said he visited the town of Zug, known as Crypto Valley for its bustling cryptocurrency industry. He was impressed.\u201cIf Brussels and the European Central Bank is worried about Italy going to the lira, their concerns should be that all these communities and states are going to crypto,\u201d he said in Milan.In the meantime, he said, he admires Italy\u2019s populist parties for already being on the technological cutting edge.The Five Star Movement, a web-based party that preaches direct, online democracy, and the League, the hard-right, formerly northern-based secessionist party, both dominated social media during the campaign.Often, their critics say, they did it with spurious and inflammatory fake news about migrants and crime. Many of those messages seemed propelled by automated bots rather than real supporters.\u201cYou can\u2019t just have just all humans, I\u2019m sure they have some bots,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, unbothered. \u201cThe thing is that they are generating enthusiasm on shoestrings.\u201dHe said he hoped the two parties would eventually join forces \u2014 something not out of the question as the Italians try to form a government after an inconclusive election.But he spoke also almost sympathetically about Matteo Renzi, the now vanquished Italian leader who only years ago seemed to be the future of Italy and the European center-left.Mr. Renzi, he said, was \u201can object lesson to every rising politician in Europe,\u201d and not a good one.The former prime minister, he said, had tried to play by Brussels\u2019s rules when it came to the migration crisis, and instead the European Union allowed other countries to close their borders, leaving Italy to take the brunt of the burden.\u201cThey hung him out to dry,\u201d he said.Mr. Bannon said Italian voters on Sunday also spurned Pope Francis, who has urged tolerance for migrants.\u201cThis vote was a rejection of the pope,\u201d said Mr. Bannon, a Catholic who has nonetheless been a longtime critic of the pope\u2019s politics. \u201cThe pope likes to see himself as a radical and an anti-establishment revolutionary for the little guy; the little guy put the pope in his place on Sunday.\u201d\u201cThey said, \u2018Hey would you stay for the weekend?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201c \u2018All our people would love to hear you speak.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Spoke, We Listened. Our Quebec Road Trip Takes Shape: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs I wrote last week, Dan Bilefsky, who is based in Montreal, will set off on his road trip through Quebec on Monday. And he will take over the next two editions of the newsletter to report on his journey. He will also write a bonus edition on March 21.Here\u2019s Dan\u2019s update on his travel plans::A popular detective novelist who sets her whodunit mysteries in Quebec. A Montreal curling club founded in 1807. An artery-busting expedition to a sugar shack.I have been amazed and delighted by the enthusiastic response from Canada and beyond to my request for help in creating my itinerary. I received architectural and food tips as well as many suggestions for which Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois crooners I should feature on my playlist. Among those who came up frequently were the Dead Obies, a band whose members rap in Franglais (a mix of English and French), Coeur de Pirate and Arcade Fire.Alas, I am constrained by time and won\u2019t be able to venture 860 miles from Montreal to the picturesque \u00celes de la Madeleine, where I hope to sample the famed lobster at another time \u2014 hopefully soon.Mrs. Lambert famously persuaded her father, Samuel Bronfman, head of the Seagram distiller, to commission Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to build the towering Seagram headquarters in New York in the 1950s, which became an important symbol of modernism.One of the first things I noticed upon my return was that the old hang-ups of the past appeared to have been largely discarded by many among the younger generation. It seemed that 20-somethings across the city, while politically engaged, seemed more intent on becoming the next Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Steve Jobs than in fomenting revolution.Yet, there were still points of separation, including divisions over language and popular culture. Some people I\u2019ve talked to warned that the proliferation of English among the younger generation, fanned by social media, threatened the future of the French language in Quebec.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Next for Humanity: Automation, New Morality and a \u2018Global Useless Class\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 What will our future look like \u2014 not in a century but in a mere two decades?Terrifying, if you\u2019re to believe Yuval Noah Harari, the Israeli historian and author of \u201cSapiens\u201d and \u201cHomo Deus,\u201d a pair of audacious books that offer a sweeping history of humankind and a forecast of what lies ahead: an age of algorithms and technology that could see us transformed into \u201csuper-humans\u201d with godlike qualities.Just as the Industrial Revolution created the working class, automation could create a \u201cglobal useless class,\u201d Mr. Harari said, and the political and social history of the coming decades will revolve around the hopes and fears of this new class. Disruptive technologies, which have helped bring enormous progress, could be disastrous if they get out of hand.\u201cEvery technology has a good potential and a bad potential,\u201d he said. \u201cNuclear war is obviously terrible. Nobody wants it. The question is how to prevent it. With disruptive technology the danger is far greater, because it has some wonderful potential. There are a lot of forces pushing us faster and faster to develop these disruptive technologies and it\u2019s very difficult to know in advance what the consequences will be, in terms of community, in terms of relations with people, in terms of politics.\u201dThe combination of biotech and I.T. might reach a point where it creates systems and algorithms that understand us better than we understand ourselves.\u201cOnce you have an external outlier that understands you better than you understand yourself, liberal democracy as we have known it for the last century or so is doomed,\u201d Mr. Harari predicted.\u201cLiberal democracy trusts in the feelings of human beings, and that worked as long as nobody could understand your feelings better than yourself \u2014 or your mother,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there is an algorithm that understands you better than your mother and you don\u2019t even understand that this is happening, then liberal democracy will become an emotional puppet show,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat happens if your heart is a foreign agent, a double agent serving somebody else, who knows how to press your emotional buttons, who knows how to make you angry, how to make you bold, how to make you joyful? This is the kind of threat we\u2019re beginning to see emerging today, for example in elections and referendum.\u201dIn the 20th century, discrimination was used against entire groups based on various biases. It was fixable, however, because those biases were not true and victims could join together and take political action. But in the coming years and decades, Mr. Harari said, \u201cwe will face individual discrimination, and it might actually be based on a good assessment on who you are.\u201dIf algorithms employed by a company look up your Facebook profile or DNA, trawl through school and professional records, they could figure out pretty accurately who you are. \u201cYou will not be able to do anything about this discrimination first of all because it\u2019s just you,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cThey don\u2019t discriminate against your being because you\u2019re Jewish or gay, but because you\u2019re you. And the worst thing is that it will be true. It sounds funny, but it\u2019s terrible.\u201dIt took centuries, even thousands of years, for us to reap the rewards of decisions made by our forebears, for example, growing wheat that led to the agricultural revolution. Not anymore.\u201cTime is accelerating,\u201d Mr. Harari said. The long term may no longer be defined in centuries or millenniums \u2014 but in terms of 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in history when we\u2019ll have no idea how human society will be like in a couple of decades,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented situation in history in the sense that nobody knows what the basics about how the world will look like in 20 or 30 years. Not just the basics of geopolitics but what the job market would look like, what kind of skills people will need, what family structures will look like, what gender relations will look like. This means that for the first time in history we have no idea what to teach in schools.\u201dLeaders and political parties are still stuck in the 20th century, in the ideological battles pitting the right against the left, capitalism versus socialism. They don\u2019t even have realistic ideas of what the job market looks like in a mere two decades, Mr. Harari said, \u201cbecause they can\u2019t see.\u201d\u201cInstead of formulating meaningful visions for where humankind will be in 2050, they repackage nostalgic fantasies about the past,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a kind of competition: who can look back further. Trump wants to go back to the 1950s; Putin basically wants to go back to the Czarist Empire, and you have the Islamic State that wants to go back to seventh-century Arabia. Israel \u2014 they beat everybody. They want to go back 2,500 years to the age of the Bible, so we win. We have the longest-term vision backwards.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re now living with the collapse of the last story of inevitability,\u201d he said. The 1990s weres flush with ideas that history was over, that the great ideological battle of the 20th century was won by liberal democracy and free-market capitalism.This now seems extremely na\u00efve, he said. \u201cThe moment we are in now is a moment of extreme disillusionment and bewilderment because we have no idea where things will go from here. It\u2019s very important to be aware of the downside, of the dangerous scenarios of new technologies. The corporations, the engineers, the people in labs naturally focus on the enormous benefits that these technologies might bring us, and it falls to historians, to philosophers and social scientists who think about all of the ways that things could go wrong.\u201d\u201cTo act well, it\u2019s not enough to have good values,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cYou have to understand the chains of causes and effects.\u201dStealing, for example, has become so complicated in today\u2019s world. Back in biblical times, Mr. Harari said, if you were stealing, you were aware of your actions and their consequences on your victim. But theft today could entail investing \u2014 even unwittingly \u2014 in a very profitable but unethical corporation that damages the environment and employs an army of lawyers and lobbyists to protect itself from lawsuits and regulations.\u201cAm I guilty of stealing a river?\u201d asked Mr. Harari, continuing his example. \u201cEven if I\u2019m aware, I don\u2019t know how the corporation makes its money. It will take me months and even years to find out what my money is doing. And during that time I\u2019ll be guilty of so many crimes, which I would know nothing about.\u201dThe problem, he said, is understanding the \u201cextremely complicated chains of cause and effect\u201d in the world. \u201cMy fear is that homo sapiens are not just up to it. We have created such a complicated world that we\u2019re no longer able to make sense of what is happening.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Several Dead After Walkway Collapse in Miami", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe graceful pedestrian bridge was swung into place on Saturday. Heralded as a triumph of \u201caccelerated construction,\u201d the walkway would allow pedestrians to safely cross eight lanes of traffic separating the campus of Florida International University from the small city where many of the students lived.Cars were caught under the bridge when a stoplight turned red at a nearby intersection. Eight of them could be seen poking out from the rubble, in a scene that resembled the aftermath of an earthquake.\u201cI heard what sounded to me like a sonic boom from an aircraft which shook the ground below,\u201d said Kurt Baker, a student at the university who had just exited the Florida Turnpike.\u201cThere was a large plume of smoke,\u201d said Sgt. Adrian Mesa of the Sweetwater Police Department. \u201cAnd then you could see the south end of the bridge was tilted over.\u201dDrivers leapt from their cars to help pull people free, but quickly realized they could save only the people in cars that were partially crushed, said Lynell R. Collins, who had been about to turn onto the street in his pickup. The others were gone.\u201cSomeone that had been helped out of his car ran out shouting that he still had people in his car, that they couldn\u2019t get out of the car,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cOne of the ladies was screaming like crazy.\u201dAt least nine people were pulled from the rubble, Miami-Dade County fire chief Dave Downey said.Ten trauma patients were taken to Kendall Regional Medical Center, two of them in critical condition, hospital officials said at a news conference.Hours after the collapse, rescue workers were seen removing a body with a stretcher, and it seemed likely that there would be others.Rescue workers, joined by construction workers, desperately dug through the rubble looking and listening for signs of life, using listening devices, fiber optics and dogs. Officials said that they expected the search to continue through the night, and that they had to work carefully because part of the structure was still unsafe.Juan Perez, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, said the police homicide bureau would begin investigating as soon as rescue operations ended.The National Transportation Safety Board also rushed investigators to the scene on Thursday, for an inquiry that was likely to focus on the design and construction of the bridge, as well as the methods used to put it in place.The walkway spanned about 174 feet over Southwest Eighth Street, a major thoroughfare that crosses the county and separates the F.I.U. campus in western Miami-Dade County with the city of Sweetwater. The walkway was built adjacent to the street using a method called accelerated bridge construction. It was then driven into its perpendicular position across the road by a rig in about six hours on Saturday, while students from the university\u2019s engineering and architecture programs watched.At the time, Mark B. Rosenberg, president of the university, hailed it as a symbol of the bond between the university and the surrounding community.Bridges made with the accelerated techniques are not more at risk of collapse than others, but moving them into place causes different stresses than what the bridge would normally have to withstand, said Andy Herrmann, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers.Mr. Rosenberg said that testing of the walkway had been underway on Thursday.In a tweet late Thursday night, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, who had spoken with officials at the collapse site earlier, said that the cables that suspended the bridge had loosened and that the engineering firm ordered that they be tightened. \u201cThey were being tightened when it collapsed today,\u201d he wrote.Funding for the $14.2 million bridge, connecting plazas and walkways was part of a $19.4 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant from the Department of Transportation.The accident on Thursday was not the first time the company building the bridge, Munilla Construction Management, known as MCM, has faced trouble with a project.A lawsuit filed this month accused the company of shoddy construction work on a temporary bridge it built at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport. An agent with the Transportation Security Administration, Jose Perez, fell walking across the bridge and broke several bones, said his lawyer, Tesha Allison.The company has not responded to the suit.A lawyer for the family-owned business, Daniel Munilla, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Calls to the company were met with an announcement in which someone read the statement the company had posted on Facebook.\u201cMCM is a family business and we are all devastated and doing everything we can to assist,\u201d the statement said in part.MCM\u2019s partner, FIGG Bridge Engineers, put out a statement of condolence, adding, \u201cIn our 40-year history, nothing like this has ever happened before.\u201d Both said they would cooperate with any investigation.Passers-by were stunned by the collapse.Jonathan Mu\u00f1oz, 21, a junior premedical major, said he had just driven under the pedestrian bridge and entered a nearby parking garage when he heard a loud bang. He thought he had hit something as he looked for a parking spot, so he pulled over and checked his car.A few minutes later, he got a frantic call from his girlfriend, who had been with him in the car moments earlier. She was near tears.\u201cJonathan, the bridge collapsed,\u201d she said. He ran over and saw a construction worker with blood coming out of his neck.\u201cWhen we got there, cars were honking nonstop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a scene in a movie.\u201dHe said the cars must have been stopped at a red light, because so many cars were stuck: \u201cIt was one car after another.\u201dMr. Collins, the driver of the pickup, said he had stayed to help for about 10 or 15 minutes until the police came and ushered people out.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to see on the news like I always have, and to be actually in the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI began to itch and shake.\u201dSergeant Mesa, who arrived minutes after the collapse, said he had found construction workers injured, both above the crumpled bridge and at street level. \u201cMost of them were completely dazed,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone was nervous.\u201dA driver trapped in a car half-buried under the bridge was rescued by bystanders using a two-by-four, Sergeant Mesa said.President Trump, on Twitter, offered his prayers for those affected and said his administration was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse.\u201dShortly before 5 p.m., firefighters could be seen moving a stretcher on wheels into position near one of the crushed cars. They did not appear to be in a great hurry, indicating that the victim in question had died. The process was likely to be repeated as the evening wore on.Other firefighters were sawing large planks of wood, suggesting that they intended to prop up the collapsed bridge while they extricated victims.By late afternoon, a large crane was brought to the site on the west side of the broken bridge.Another crane that had been used in its construction was taken away on Thursday morning, Luis Bottari, a campus mail carrier, said as he watched the recovery efforts from the fourth-floor vantage point of a nearby parking structure.Nick Madigan and Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami, and Anemona Hartocollis from New York.

{"Headline": "China Presses Its Internet Censorship Efforts Across the Globe", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Within its digital borders, China has long censored what its people read and say online. Now, it is increasingly going beyond its own online realms to police what people and companies are saying about it all over the world.As part of that shift, Beijing has at times pressured foreign companies like Google and Facebook, which are both blocked in China, to take down certain content. At other times, it has bypassed foreign companies entirely and instead directly pushed users of global social media to encourage self-censorship.Zhang Guanghong recently discovered the changing landscape for technology firsthand. Mr. Zhang, a Chinese human rights activist, decided last fall to share an article with a group of friends in and outside China that criticized China\u2019s president. To do so, he used WhatsApp, an American app owned by Facebook that almost nobody uses in China.In September, Mr. Zhang was detained in China; he is expected to soon be charged with insulting China\u2019s government and the Communist Party. The evidence, according to his lawyer, included printouts of what Mr. Zhang shared and said in the WhatsApp group.That information was likely obtained by hacking his phone or through a spy in his group chat, said China tech experts, without involving WhatsApp. Mr. Zhang\u2019s case is one of the first-known examples of Chinese authorities using conversations from a non-Chinese chat app as evidence \u2014 and it sends a warning to those on the American platform, which is encrypted, that they could also be held accountable for what\u2019s said there.\u201cChina is increasingly throwing its weight around,\u201d said Joshua Rosenzweig, an analyst at Amnesty International.As Mr. Xi asserts himself and the primacy of Chinese geopolitical power, China has also become more comfortable projecting Mr. Xi\u2019s vision of a tightly controlled internet. Beijing had long been content to block foreign internet companies and police the homegrown alternatives that sprouted up to take their place, but it is now directly pressuring individuals or requesting that companies cooperate with its online censorship efforts.Often, these companies have little recourse when pressured for help by Beijing. Going to the American government could set off retaliation from China, so many have sought to navigate the situation on their own.\u201cI personally am not sure what the solution is for these companies,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig. \u201cI don\u2019t see a good answer because the Chinese government is really putting them between a rock and a hard place.\u201dChinese authorities have also successfully persuaded Google to pull down content that had been available around the globe.The Chinese government asked Google\u2019s services to take down 2,290 items in the first half of last year, according to the company\u2019s statistics. That was more than triple the number it requested in the second half of 2016, which itself had set a record.Content related to terrorism made up a substantial portion of the material China asked Google to take down, according to its data. The majority of China\u2019s recent takedown requests focused on videos on YouTube, the data showed. A Google spokesman said the company would not comment further on specific takedown requests.Chinese officials may have even bigger censorship ambitions.At a major Chinese internet conference last year, Mei Jianming, a Chinese antiterrorism expert, said Beijing should put more pressure on companies like Twitter. The goal would be to get them to change their terms of service so they could restrict posts by groups that Beijing considers subversive, like the World Uyghur Congress, which seeks self-determination for the people of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.Mr. Mei called for a crackdown on tweets that \u201cdefame the party, Chinese leaders, and related national strategies.\u201dSometimes, Chinese people also push foreign companies to censor themselves in the country, nurtured by sentiments on China\u2019s propaganda channels.Mercedes-Benz erased the post \u2014 even though few people in China could see it because Chinese authorities block Instagram. Still, criticism continued. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, branded Mercedes-Benz an \u201cenemy of the people.\u201dChina is Mercedes-Benz\u2019s biggest single car market, accounting for about one-quarter of sales.\u201cChina is getting stronger,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and a former Google employee. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more confident in putting pressure on these platforms.\u201dChina is also requiring individuals to police what they say on global social media. In a prominent conviction last year of a human-rights activist, Lee Ming-che, the Chinese police used writing that he had posted on Facebook from Taiwan as evidence against him.\u201cThe fact that China is punishing people for critical content published outside China to audiences not based in China is of course a concern,\u201d said Mr. Rosenzweig.The case of Mr. Zhang, the Chinese individual under scrutiny for what he posted on WhatsApp, could indicate a further extension of China\u2019s reach.The Chinese police have previously focused on activists for what they say on foreign social media, but Mr. Zhang\u2019s case seems to be one of the first in which someone has been charged for spreading articles on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp is encrypted and run by a foreign company, it is generally considered a safer platform than local messaging app WeChat, which has for years been closely monitored by Chinese authorities.Mr. Zhang\u2019s lawyer, Sui Muqing, said he was surprised when the police presented him with printouts of articles and comments from Mr. Zhang.\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the information from him, but they have it,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cThat was what we found so weird. None of us knew how they were capable of getting that data and whether WhatsApp has become unsafe.\u201dA spokeswoman for WhatsApp said Chinese authorities did not have backdoor access to its encrypted messages. China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cWhen I talk about technology and the internet, people normally pine for them and look forward to a future that will promote liberalization,\u201d Mr. Sui said. \u201cBut people neglect the fact that modern authoritarianism also rises with the development of technology, which makes wider and deeper control possible.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyday Wines: The Most Important Bottles You Will Drink", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourInstagram is lined with photos of the proverbial unicorn wines, bottles so rare that they are sighted with the frequency of mystical animals. Somehow, these shots often seem to be posted by sommeliers, proving that such bottles are scarce only for those without access to other people\u2019s money.As much attention as is paid to the rare and profound bottles that fire the imagination, far less is devoted to the sorts of wines that people might actually consume at any given weeknight meal.Yet the bottles we might open every day are actually the most important wines in our lives, just as the art we live with in our homes is ultimately more meaningful than what we might see on an occasional visit to a museum.The rare bottled masterpiece may stretch the mind, enlarging our notion of what wine can be and the emotions it can provoke. These special bottles, if we are lucky enough to drink one, occupy an exalted place because they set benchmarks and stretch context as they surprise and astound. But the simpler pleasures of everyday wines shape our attitudes and desires, pique the curiosity and fire the imagination. They forge our relationship with wine, and ultimately define its role in our lives.The joys of one cannot be understood without the pleasures of the other. Missing out on either side distorts the whole. But I would argue that for people who love wine or who want to understand it better, paying more attention to everyday wines rather than rare and expensive bottles can improve one\u2019s drinking life significantly.This especially holds true for wine authorities of all kinds. Rather than paying lip service every once in a while to \u201cgood values\u201d or \u201cTuesday night bottles,\u201d I would like to see regular, purposeful attention directed at everyday wines, good bottles that are moderately priced and easy to drink in relaxed, casual settings, yet are still interesting enough to inspire wonder and to be deeply pleasurable.The world is full of these sorts of wines, yet paradoxically they seem hard to come by. How can that be?Over the last 25 years, an explosion in diversity has blown apart the once-simple framework for getting to know and understand wine. Here in the United States, we now have access to more different sorts of wines than ever before, from more places, in more styles, made often from grapes that were largely unknown at the end of the 20th century.But rather than make the job of finding and selecting a good, interesting bottle easier, this new diversity seems to have made it more difficult. So many choices can be confusing. Rather than take a chance on the unknown, many people choose instead to settle for familiar grapes, enticing brand names and well-known places.I have great sympathy with this point of view. We have only so much time and energy to absorb new ideas, especially in a world in which the unexpected arrives at frightening speed. Good food and good wine are not everybody\u2019s priority.Even if you would like it to be a more important part of your life, wine still comes in too many varieties and from too many places to comfortably and quickly absorb. So I would like to offer some practical recommendations to make it easier to drink better every day.One more element will help to further the appreciation of everyday wines: Broaden the definition of greatness. Every worthy type of wine has a role to play. Pairing bottles to occasions is every bit as important as pairing wine with food.For too long, we have thought of great wines solely in terms of their potential to age, to evolve, to be profound and to be complex. These are all wonderful attributes, and they define wine at its highest level.But maybe we need to think of greatness in terms of how well wines can play their role. If certain bottles are accessible enough to be everyday wines, yet interesting enough to capture our attention while refreshing and delighting, isn\u2019t that great as well? I think so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banning Social Media Won\u2019t Stop Hate Speech", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAfter a weeklong blackout, the Sri Lankan government lifted its nationwide ban on social media on Thursday. Facebook and several other platforms had been shut down after days of violence targeting Muslims in the Kandy district, a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims. The violence began after a Sinhalese Buddhist truck driver was killed in a road-rage incident. Buddhist chauvinist groups flocked to the area, and their visits were followed by looting, arson, and attacks on mosques and on businesses operated by Muslims.Anti-Muslim propaganda is pervasive in all types of media in Sinhala, the language of Sri Lanka\u2019s majority Buddhist population. But some pieces of disinformation \u2014 like false accounts of Buddhist monks being attacked \u2014 spread on social media and were perceived as especially dangerous. So the Sri Lankan government imposed the ban on Facebook, WhatsApp and several other services as a temporary security measure.The government is claiming a victory, but blanket social media bans are not a solution to the problem of hate speech. They set a bad precedent for freedom of expression and undermine efforts to spread messages of reconciliation.In Sri Lanka, the time to act was months, if not years, earlier, engaging with all types of media. Facebook and internet penetration in the country is still around 30 percent. It\u2019s just as likely that this violence was organized not only through Facebook and WhatsApp but also through phone calls and words exchanged across a neighbor\u2019s fence. Facebook and WhatsApp are growing fast in Sri Lanka, but they are only a small part of an extremely polarized media world dominated by television and radio. Anti-minority hate speech, particularly against the Tamil minority, has been part of the Sri Lankan political landscape for decades. Now, it\u2019s Muslims, not just Tamils, who have become the target.We have been conducting surveys and qualitative research on how people use mobile phones and the internet around the region for more than a decade. We recently focused on Myanmar to understand better how hate speech spreads. Social media use has grown at a stunning rate in Myanmar since 2014, at the same time that anti-Muslim violence linked to Buddhist chauvinist groups has escalated.We noticed that people usually first encountered false stories in \u201caffinity circles\u201d \u2014 messages sent through Facebook or WhatsApp groups. Within those circles, the messages appear as a communication from a trusted friend or relative. Because many people belong to multiple affinity circles, the hate-speech messages would jump from one circle to another, in each case appearing as from a trusted person.When mob-related violence does occur, the government relies on tactics developed during the colonial era: preventing the formation of mobs, usually through curfews, which stop people from gathering in public spaces. The same principle gives Sri Lanka\u2019s telecommunications minister the power to prohibit the transmission or reception of entire categories of messages in emergencies or \u201cin the interest of public safety and tranquillity.\u201dThere is no doubt that social media companies need to do more. While Facebook has hired Sinhala-speaking moderators to detect and remove hate speech, its ability to respond to complaints quickly and consistently is limited. Facebook also should not rely on users to report abuse. It should proactively identify and remove hate speech before it spreads widely enough to generate complaints.But focusing too narrowly on one company or platform is a mistake. A foundation of mutual distrust and fear \u2014 not access to social media \u2014 is the necessary condition for the mobilization of violent mobs. Governments can\u2019t dismantle that foundation alone. Media companies of all kinds must accept responsibility and deploy artificial intelligence and plain old elbow grease to the task. And people of good will must play their part by calling out falsehoods and reporting those responsible.Banning social media after the mobs have started running is mere political theater.Rohan Samarajiva is the chairman of LIRNEasia, an information and communications technology and infrastructure think tank, based in Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}

Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201cAre there other Cambridge Analyticas out there?\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said later in an interview with The New York Times. He added, \u201cWere there apps which could have gotten access to more information and potentially sold it without us knowing or done something that violated people\u2019s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control.\u201dMr. Zuckerberg said the company would investigate apps like the third-party quiz app that had previously obtained access to \u201clarge amounts of information\u201d from the social network. He also said the company would restrict third-party developers\u2019 access.\u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\u201d he wrote in his Facebook statement.The Cambridge Analytica revelations added to the questions that have been raised about Facebook\u2019s handling of user data and security. Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet.The resulting backlash is Facebook\u2019s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr. Zuckerberg and others in 2004. The information, photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network, and to the company\u2019s profitability. Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company\u2019s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill.Last Friday, after The New York Times, The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained, the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data.\u201cThis was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday. \u201cBut it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.\u201dFacebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban. Mr. Zuckerberg told The Times he did not rule out allowing Cambridge Analytica back, saying Facebook must first conduct a \u201cfull forensic audit of the firm\u201d and \u201chave full confirmation that there\u2019s no wrongdoing here.\u201dLawmakers who have demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook\u2019s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement.Independent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company\u2019s operations.\u201cHe avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. \u201cThere is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company. This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one-off problem.\u201dIn his statement, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook\u2019s dealings with Cambridge Analytica. He traced the information-sharing issue to 2007, when Facebook decided to become an open platform \u2014 enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends.In 2013, Mr. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher, created a personality quiz app that about 300,000 people installed, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Because Facebook was an open platform, Mr. Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app.A year later, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third-party apps could access. \u201cThese actions would prevent any app like Kogan\u2019s from being able to access so much data today,\u201d he wrote.By 2015, Mr. Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica, which later used the material to single out American voters. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr. Kogan\u2019s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted. He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s an issue where someone\u2019s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to, that\u2019s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in the interview.For Mr. Zuckerberg, the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging. Inside Facebook, even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere. Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions, such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo-sharing platform Instagram, calling their work on Facebook\u2019s main product \u201cdemoralizing.\u201dHis silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days. Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry, but Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the event. He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday.In his interview with The Times, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company\u2019s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior \u2014 which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 were an important part of a larger transformation at the company, which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub.\u201cIf you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I\u2019d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other\u2019s elections, there\u2019s no way I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco and Kevin Roose from New York.

{"Headline": "Is This Dog Actually Happy?", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWhat is it like to be a dog?I\u2019ve been in search of the answer to that puzzling question by way of science. I\u2019m a researcher of dog behavior and cognition: I study how dogs perceive the world and interact with one another and with people. Even in those moments when I wrest myself away from my subjects, the question stirs in my head. For everywhere I look, I find myself faced with dogs.Dogs in movies, GIFs and memes \u2014 peppering Twitter feeds and Facebook posts. The Super Bowl has a puppy alternative; dogs in advertisements sell everything from toilet paper to tacos. Weirdly, the omnipresence of my favorite subject has begun making me grumpy, not elated. As dogs themselves produce a profound anti-grumpiness in me, I began to wonder why. Why can\u2019t I stand to look at one more photo of a \u201cfunny dog\u201d?Despite the ubiquity of dogs in our culture, there is much we don\u2019t know about them. My field is in its infancy. We know that among animals they are uniquely attentive to the human gaze, but their preternatural sensitivity to our emotions and behavior defies easy explanation. Even as we are discovering the history of their domestication, we still have little idea how dogs experience the world through smell, their primary sense.\u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d is a delightful movie, and the stop-action is mind-bogglingly good, but the dogs are the pits. Though beautifully rendered in fur-ruffling style, their characters are thoroughly human, with human voices and human concerns. They are quadrupeds with dog tags \u2014 they are not dogs.This is the crux of the matter: Rarely do dogs get to be dogs. In film, they are cast as cute, fuzzy human-replacements. This anthropomorphizing ranges from simply ascribing human emotions and desires to dogs (see \u201cLassie\u201d or \u201cBenji\u201d) to the inexplicable genre of dogs who excel at professional human sports (\u201cAir Bud\u201d and \u201cSoccer Dog\u201d).Online, the dog suffers worse misrepresentation. In a typical image the dog is posed in a distinctively person-like way, as if on the phone, seated at a table or wearing headphones, and dressed in human attire \u2014 glasses, a dog-size suit and tie, even pantyhose.Despite the discomfort this must entail, these images are taken to be hilarious.Other times a dog\u2019s expression is misrepresented as a human one, such as an image of a dog \u201csmiling\u201d (an expression that actually indicates that the creature is scared or worried) used to indicate delight.It wouldn\u2019t have dogs talking, in human speech, to be sure, or motivated by human desires. It would follow their heartbeats, their noses, and take a measure of the world viewed from two feet (or so) off the ground.Here I find reason for optimism in a certain branch of dog GIF or short video which, instead of presenting the dog as the furry human we want them to be, shows dog behavior as it naturally occurs.Dogs wriggling in the snow; jumping up and down in anticipation of a walk; sniffing or licking or wagging excitedly.The pleasure of these GIFs is in the exuberant expression of the dog \u2014 maybe reminiscent of the washes of emotion that we used to feel, as children, but no longer do. Rarely do we spiral in a frenzy of wiggling glee when we see a loved one. But we can find vicarious enjoyment in the dog\u2019s uninhibited dogness.When I see these dogs I also feel the foreignness of the world viewed through the dogs\u2019 eyes (or, more aptly, nose). They aren\u2019t talking quadrupeds who want to find a partner, get a good job and settle down. Their motivations are unclear; what they smell is uncertain. It seems, for that moment, incredibly surprising that we share a home (and in my home, a sofa).Wouldn\u2019t the most transporting stories or snapshots we shared be those that really try to consider the dog Other \u2014 imagining the point of view of someone or something fundamentally foreign to us \u2014 instead of simply transplanting our story onto them? If we are really so unwilling or unable to imagine the perspective of another being, we will only ever see ourselves. For that, we needn\u2019t even turn away from the mirror.Advertisement"}

But apparently, when you\u2019re trying to win a campaign, prostitutes, bribes and spies work pretty well too.After days of revelations, there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Cambridge Analytica. But we\u2019ve learned that an operation at the heart of Trump\u2019s campaign was ethically nihilistic and quite possibly criminal in ways that even its harshest critics hadn\u2019t suspected. That\u2019s useful information. In weighing the credibility of various accusations made against the president, it\u2019s good to know the depths to which the people around him are willing to sink.But whether or not Cambridge Analytica\u2019s methodology works, the fact that the Trump campaign had a crew of high-tech dirty tricksters on its payroll is significant. We already know that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange about finding and disseminating Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. We know that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has asked the company to turn over documents related to the Trump campaign. Channel Four News plans to air additional undercover footage about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in the Trump campaign on Tuesday.For those who knew something of Kushner\u2019s pre-election career, this portrait of him as some sort of analytics genius was befuddling. The small, gossipy New York newspaper he\u2019d owned, The New York Observer, didn\u2019t even have a particularly good website. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t tech-savvy at all,\u201d Elizabeth Spiers, the paper\u2019s former editor in chief, told me.Cambridge Analytica\u2019s corruption helps provide the missing piece in this story. If the Trump campaign had a social media advantage, one reason is that it hired a company that mined vast amounts of illicitly obtained data.There\u2019s a lesson here for our understanding of the Trump presidency. Trump and his lackeys have been waging their own sort of psychological warfare on the American majority that abhors them. On the one hand, they act like idiots. On the other, they won, which makes it seem as if they must possess some sort of occult genius. With each day, however, it\u2019s clearer that the secret of Trump\u2019s success is cheating. He, and those around him, don\u2019t have to be better than their opponents because they\u2019re willing to be so much worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Betty Ann Bowser, Versatile TV Newswoman, Is Dead at 73", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetty Ann Bowser, one of television\u2019s most prominent newswomen for years as a correspondent for CBS and then the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d died on March 16 at her home in Ajijic, Mexico. She was 73.Her son Patrick Kelley said he believed the cause was pneumonia. She had been in declining health for several years.In an era when journalism, both broadcast and print, was still dominated by male reporters, Ms. Bowser became one of the most recognizable women in the field.Elizabeth Ann Bowser was born on Aug. 19, 1944, in Norfolk, Va. Her father, John, was a salesman, and her mother, the former Elizabeth Martin, was a homemaker.Ms. Bowser graduated from Granby High School in Norfolk in 1962 and enrolled at Ohio Wesleyan University, where she joined the student newspaper and quickly displayed a trait that would mark her whole career: versatility.That spring fever article reported on an epic campus water fight.\u201cA parking ticket for the Dean of Women, four flat tires for the campus policeman and free 1:30s for coeds\u201d \u2014 the privilege of staying out until 1:30 a.m. \u2014 \u201cwere some of the side effects of the season\u2019s first all-campus water battle last Thursday night,\u201d Ms. Bowser wrote in her opening sentence.Pursuing a double major in English and journalism, Ms. Bowser graduated in 1966 and took a job at WAVY, a Norfolk-area TV station, and later moved to WTAR, a station in the same market, where she was a co-anchor of the news report. She joined CBS in 1974.The PBS article said she would sometimes tell the story of scoring a brief interview with Richard M. Nixon, shortly after he resigned the presidency in 1974, by dropping in at a golf course near his California home on a whim. The modest scoop impressed Walter Cronkite, the CBS anchor, enough that he made a congratulatory phone call to the recently hired Ms. Bowser, who credited the incident with elevating her profile at the network.She ranged far and wide as a CBS correspondent, covering national stories as well as international ones like the persistent famine in parts of Africa. In 1980 she became a host of \u201c30 Minutes,\u201d a newsmagazine program aimed at teenagers. The program won some Daytime Emmys but was canceled in 1982 because of low ratings.Ms. Bowser left CBS in the mid-1980s, amid cutbacks at the network. She almost left journalism as well. She intended to go into the real estate business, and did briefly. But then her husband, Chris Kelley, a former Pentagon correspondent at CBS, got a job in Texas, and the housing market went dormant.\u201cI was in Texas, I was unemployed and we needed money,\u201d she told The Virginian-Pilot in 1997, \u201cso I went to the local PBS station looking for some freelance work for \u2018NewsHour.\u2019 \u201dIt was a step she took reluctantly, she said. She had become disillusioned with television news and concerned about whether women in the TV news business would be allowed to \u201cage gracefully\u201d in their jobs.\u201cI went back kicking and screaming,\u201d she said. But \u201cNewsHour\u201d proved a good match; she became a general assignment correspondent, covering stories that included the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City in 1995.In the PBS tribute, colleagues recalled her ability to connect and sympathize with ordinary people, as was evident in her work on the Oklahoma City attack, which killed 168 people. She spent weeks reporting on the friends and family members of victims, and returned several times later.\u201cI followed people\u2019s lives,\u201d she told The Virginian-Pilot. \u201cThere are incredible stories about what people have done, all these individuals who\u2019ve risen to the occasion and done amazing things with their lives.\u201dMs. Bowser retired in 2013. Her marriage to Mr. Kelley ended in divorce in 1996. In addition to her son Patrick, she is survived by another son, Matthew.In the PBS tribute, Brian Gill, a cameraman, recalled working with Ms. Bowser covering Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\u201cPeople we talked to would open up to her,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they knew that she cared about them and their situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Brazilian artist Erika Verzutti is in her late 40s, but her work exudes the exploratory energy of youth, mellowed by older, wiser emotional warmth, especially in her unusual combination of materials. In \u201cEx Gurus,\u201d her first commercial gallery solo in New York, Ms. Verzutti uses raw bronze, gold in color, as canvas; combines papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with concrete; and in \u201cCemetery Inline,\u201d makes a bumpy Carl Andre floor piece resembling a ragtag row of tombstones from chunks of cobblestone, unbaked clay and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with color added. More subtly, Ms. Verzutti pits the translucence of oil paint against the implacable opacity of acrylic.This contrast is especially evident in \u201cFloral,\u201d where the shapes of a wilting flower and perhaps a beehive carved into the surface of raw bronze, are veiled in blue or yellow; dots of acrylic jump all around them like bees. Ms. Verzutti usually creates a specific physical place for color in her bronze surfaces (see the extremely satisfying \u201cAstrology\u201d). Except when she doesn\u2019t: In \u201cHomeopatia,\u201d arguably the show\u2019s star, lozenge-shaped indentations of brilliant color dot the raw bronze surface while other lozenges are painted flat on the surface, which creates strange spatial ambiguities. It resembles a painter\u2019s palette and an entomologist\u2019s beetle collection.Despite Ms. Verzutti\u2019s love of color, her mind seems alive with sculpture. Past works have referred to Robert Gober and Jeff Koons. \u201cDias da Semana\u201d evokes some of Brancusi\u2019s sexier sculptures while also \u2014 seen from a certain angle \u2014 recalling her penchant for casting fruits and vegetables. In two dark bronze reliefs named \u201cWitch\u201d and \u201cPilates\u201d she drags little stones or clumps of bronze down the surface, creating deep ruts and leaving the forming implements in place. They\u2019re mini-earthworks that pay tribute to the Italian artist Lucio Fontana. Combined with the show\u2019s title, the works\u2019 names suggest paths to health that Ms. Verzutti has tried and discarded. They also suggest an artist who leaves no stone unturned.ROBERTA SMITHThe occasional small overlap or gap in the thin lines that circumscribe the squares are almost the only uncontrolled expressiveness in pictures as studiously devoid of spontaneous gestures as an engineering diagram. Things like the lush foliage in \u201cAlameda Light\u201d or the wrinkled tarp thrown over a car in \u201cDogpatch Wrap\u201d might seem to offer the artist more occasion to let himself go, but in fact he records those less regular objects with the same straight-faced fidelity he applies to the shifting gray-tone planes of a sidewalk or wall.But well-placed details like those gaps, or like the little dots of white with which Mr. Bechtle heightens streetlights and shiny fenders, can have disproportionate effects. In this case they make the drawings feel as thrillingly precarious as a high-wire act. They also imbue empty cars and opaque windows, which might otherwise read simply as easy metaphors for loneliness and alienation, with a real, if mysterious, presence.In the show\u2019s strangest and most memorable drawing, \u201cCovered Car, San Francisco,\u201d the 85-year-old Mr. Bechtle confronts that ambiguous presence directly, picturing it as a sleek, almost unbroken black silhouette divided from its own shadow by only a thin white speck.WILL HEINRICHIn this post-truth moment, science fiction is particularly popular with artists. In her current exhibition, \u201cA Vaudeville on Mankind in Time and Space,\u201d Fia Backstr\u00f6m draws upon the work of the Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson, whose epic science fiction poem \u201cAniara: A Vaudeville on Mankind in Time and Space\u201d provides both a title and a springboard for thinking about time, history and the fate of humanity.A broadsheet available to visitors at the front of the gallery describes Mr. Martinson\u2019s 1956 poem, in which a spaceship populated with Earthlings escaping the wreckage of nuclear war and ecological disasters hits a meteorite labeled Hondo. The collision destroys the vessel\u2019s navigation system, then the spaceship flies through deep space, toward doom, entertained by a female artificial intelligence system named Mima.Accompanying the broadsheet (which also wanders into Scandinavian folklore, pagan rituals and quantum physics) are abstract photographs on the wall as well as fuzzy brown works made by sticking parchment paper in the oven. The photographs feature real subjects \u2014 mucous, cuticles, newspaper clippings \u2014 often captured at microscopic levels to create a fossilized, distorted effect.Together, the parts of Ms. Backstr\u00f6m\u2019s show serve as powerful analogues for our own era of refugees and migrants moving across a globe ravaged by despots, war and ecological disaster. Rather than addressing this directly, Ms. Backstr\u00f6m gains power through the subtlety of suggestion. Change a few details, and \u201cAniara\u201d sounds like reportage rather than fiction. Ms. Backstr\u00f6m\u2019s photographs could be scientific evidence of lost civilizations, gathered by future generations.MARTHA SCHWENDENERThe globe is ever more networked, and has reduced unfathomable distances to the breadth of a screen; the globe is ever more riven, and political and social identities have solidified into stereotypes and dogmas. These two statements are no contradiction for the young South African artist Bogosi Sekhukhuni, whose New York debut, following on promising appearances in a number of international biennials, plumbs the shortcomings of digital technologies, neoliberal economics and multiracial democracy through videos, drawings, sculpture and a single painting.Mr. Sekhukhuni, born in Johannesburg in 1991, has a particular interest in how spirituality fills the gaps in lives pitted by economic hardship or technological isolation. For some, that takes the form of evangelical Christianity \u2014 the video \u201cThus Saith the Lord (Overunity)\u201d (2015) introduces a real-life Zimbabwean entrepreneur who relies on divine guidance, rather than scientific know-how, to build helicopters and electric cars. Or it can take the form of post-apartheid New Age ancestor worship, which the artist delivers in the character of a deadpan talk show host.In purely visual terms, Mr. Sekhukhuni has ample room to mature; his videos rely too heavily on plug-and-play personal computing software, and need to stand further from a million Tumblr memes. But his art already displays a sensitivity to the confluence of personal circumstances and political systems that would be the envy of artists twice his tender age.JASON FARAGOAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yale Rape Verdict Shows How \u2018Yes Means Yes\u2019 Can Be Murkier in Court", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a jury in the trial of a Yale college student on rape charges returned a verdict of not guilty on Wednesday, after barely three hours of deliberations, the message seemed clear: Evidence that might warrant punishment from a campus panel was insufficient for a court of law.At the heart of the trial was the question of whether the complainant could have agreed to have sex with the defendant, Saifullah Khan, 25, on Halloween night in 2015, when the two found themselves in her dorm room after a night filled with alcohol, text messages and conflicting accounts of flirtatious behavior. The complainant was not named in the arrest warrant application.Had the case gone before Yale\u2019s own internal panel, the outcome might have been different. The panel, the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, uses a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in determining responsibility, and its members are trained in a notion of consent where only \u201cyes means yes.\u201dBut the jurors seemed to have come to the case with a different understanding of what it means to show consent, highlighting the divide between the standards of sexual behavior espoused in freshman orientation programs and campus brochures, and those that operate in courts of law.One, speaking anonymously after the verdict out of hesitancy to speak for other jurors, said the panel members asked themselves whether there was \u201cenough evidence to show that there could not have been consent. And we couldn\u2019t get there.\u201dJames Galullo, another juror, said he did not understand the outrage that the verdict had inspired on campus, among students who wrote angry opinion pieces for the campus newspaper or took to social media to denounce the outcome.\u201cI just think it\u2019s lack of experience in the world,\u201d Mr. Galullo, 61, said. \u201cThe jurors were all basically middle-aged. They were able to see their way through all the noise.\u201dAlexandra Brodsky, a lawyer at the National Women\u2019s Law Center who graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School, said, \u201cSchools have adopted consent as an educational tool, but that sometimes means we end up using words that mean different things in different contexts.\u201d\u201cThere are many forms of violence that would be condemned on campus, where a prosecutor would have trouble getting a jury to convict,\u201d she added.Defense lawyers did not necessarily paint a flattering picture of their client, who acknowledged having sex with the woman, despite the fact that she had been drinking to the point of vomiting several times. He also said that he had called his longtime girlfriend, with whom he had an open relationship, from the complainant\u2019s bedroom.But Mr. Khan\u2019s lawyers pressed the woman on the witness stand about messages she had sent inviting Mr. Khan to dinner, or writing \u201clol\u201d \u2014 short for \u201claugh out loud\u201d \u2014 the morning after the alleged assault, when she woke up with bruising on her legs. Norman Pattis, one of the defense lawyers, asked if the messages indicated her interest in Mr. Khan. She replied that she spoke to everyone in that manner.Mr. Pattis also asked about a screenshot that she had sent to Mr. Khan of a Shakespeare sonnet that seemed to imply a romantic interest. She replied that she had been joking; the screenshot was from a popular campus Facebook group, where jokes are often posted.Dan Erwin, who handled jury selection for the defense, said that they had favored \u201colder jurors, 30 to middle-age\u201d because \u201cthere was a seriousness about them insofar as none of them accepted, condoned or denied the existence of misconduct, harassment or assault, but they all seriously engaged with the need for due process.\u201dThe juror who spoke anonymously said that the panel had not focused on the banter or on Mr. Pattis\u2019s suggestion that the woman\u2019s Halloween costume had been too sexy. Instead, the jurors focused on evidence like security camera footage that showed the complainant and Mr. Khan walking back to her dorm room. The complainant had testified that the footage showed her so drunk that she was unable to support herself, her leg dragging behind her.\u201cWe looked at and we looked at and we looked at that video of them walking,\u201d the juror said. \u201cWe could not see her leg dragging. We could not see her eyes shut. We could not see what she said.\u201dMr. Galullo said the rigorous standard of proof required, coupled with the length of Mr. Khan\u2019s possible prison sentence, weighed heavily upon him.\u201cWe wanted to really be sure that he was guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kids went through a lot. It was really very, very sad. You had tears in your eyes \u2014 for both of them.\u201dMr. Khan may still face a hearing at Yale. He was suspended by the university shortly before he was arrested and charged, and his lawyers said that Yale\u2019s disciplinary hearing had been delayed pending the criminal trial. That panel would only have to determine that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he was in the wrong to find him responsible.Mr. Khan\u2019s lawyers are seeking to have him reinstated. A university spokesman declined to confirm or deny the existence of an internal complaint.Several experts agreed that the distance between campus and criminal understandings of permissible sexual conduct may continue to widen, especially as conversations about sex and power continue to evolve.Cheryl P. Weinstock, Kristin Hussey and Graham Ambrose contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Noor Salman Acquitted in Pulse Nightclub Shooting", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 The acquittal by a federal jury of Noor Salman, the widow of the man who gunned down dozens of people at the Pulse nightclub two years ago, handed federal prosecutors on Friday the rarest of defeats: a loss in a terrorism case.The outcome was even more striking because the not-guilty verdict came from jurors in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen\u2019s rampage left 49 people dead and 53 others injured, the worst terrorist attack on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Jurors unanimously rejected government charges that Ms. Salman had helped her husband plan his violent assault in the name of the Islamic State \u2014 a narrative countered by her family\u2019s claims that she was kept in the dark about her husband\u2019s secrets and was home sleeping when the attack occurred.To blame for the government\u2019s defeat, said defense lawyers and legal experts who closely followed the trial, was a flimsy circumstantial case that ultimately was unable to persuade jurors during the eight days of trial.Testimony from an F.B.I. agent revealed that prosecutors knew early on, but did not reveal, that one of their crucial initial pieces of evidence \u2014 that Ms. Salman had admitted driving by the nightclub with her husband in the days before the attack \u2014 most likely did not happen.Prosecutors also faltered when they argued that Ms. Salman had created an alibi for her husband the night of the shooting, telling Mr. Mateen\u2019s mother that he was out to dinner with a friend identified only as Nemo. But that line was Mr. Mateen\u2019s own lie to his wife, defense lawyers argued. They put Nemo on the stand, over prosecutors\u2019 objections, to testify that he knew Mr. Mateen had used him in the past as a cover story to cheat on his wife.\u201cThe more we learned, the better Noor Salman looked,\u201d Charles D. Swift, one of her lawyers, told reporters after the verdict was announced.The jury of seven women and five men deliberated a little more than 12 hours before acquitting Ms. Salman on charges of aiding and abetting the commission of a terrorist act and of obstructing justice. She had been accused of giving misleading statements to law enforcement officers who interviewed her after the massacre.\u201cOn the contrary, we were convinced she did know,\u201d the foreman told The Sentinel, asking to remain anonymous and saying he was speaking on his own behalf. \u201cShe may not have known what day, or what location, but she knew. However, we were not tasked with deciding if she was aware of a potential attack. The charges were aiding and abetting and obstruction of justice.\u201dAnd on those charges, he said, the jury was presented with \u201cno option\u201d but to acquit.\u201cProsecutors have got a duty not to be caught up in hysteria,\u201d said William N. Nettles, who was the United States attorney in South Carolina when a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston in 2015 and successfully prosecuted a man who had withheld information about that attack.He said prosecutors must guard against allowing public emotion to influence their decisions.\u201cThe federal government should never lose a case,\u201d Mr. Nettles said. \u201cProsecutors should never lose. They pick the fight, they pick the day the fight happens, they\u2019ve got the best investigative capabilities in the world. It should always be an embarrassment for the government to lose.\u201dAfter the verdict, two of Ms. Salman\u2019s defense lawyers, Charles D. Swift and Linda Moreno, said in an interview that prosecutors had offered their client a plea deal in the weeks leading up to the trial but she had refused to accept it, insisting on her innocence.The 31-year-old defendant wiped tears from her eyes after the verdict on the first charge was read. By the time the judge\u2019s clerk finished, Ms. Salman openly sobbed, hugging her lawyers and burying her face in their arms. They, too, wept. She later left the courthouse with Fritz Scheller, another one of her lawyers.A spokeswoman for the Salman family said Ms. Salman plans to return to California, where she had been living before her arrest in January 2017, to be with her 5-year-old son. She had faced a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted.\u201cI don\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to make up for two years,\u201d said Al Salman, one of her uncles, who sat two rows behind his niece during the trial. He said he intends to hire a therapist to help Ms. Salman rebuild her life.Families of the Pulse victims sat in stone-faced silence as the verdict was announced. They walked out of the federal courthouse in downtown Orlando as a group, some of them wearing dark sunglasses, without saying a word.After news of the verdict spread, a small group gathered outside Pulse, which has remained shuttered since the shooting, holding signs declaring, \u201cWe will not let hate win.\u201d\u201cThose of us directly affected by this tragedy must find peace in our hearts and remember that he was the one who pulled the trigger that night,\u201d Barbara Poma, the nightclub owner and founder of a foundation for the victims, said in a statement, referring to Mr. Mateen. \u201cThis verdict cannot and will not divide us.\u201dThe prosecutors, James D. Mandolfo and Sara C. Sweeney, declined to comment, other than to thank jurors for their work and say they respected their decision.From the start, Ms. Salman had insisted she had nothing to do with her husband\u2019s rampage. The prosecution built a convincing case that Mr. Mateen methodically made arrangements for the attack, apparently inspired by the Islamic State propaganda he obsessively consumed online \u2014 including a video he watched weeks before the shooting urging bloodshed against Americans during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The burden on prosecutors after that was high: They had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Salman knowingly and willfully helped or tried to help Mr. Mateen commit an act that would provide material support to the Islamic State. Merely being his wife or unwittingly assisting her husband was not enough, said Joshua L. Dratel, a New York lawyer experienced in defending terrorism cases.\u201cYou have to share the intent of the actor,\u201d Mr. Dratel said. \u201cYou have to do something to make the crime succeed \u2014 not do something that makes the crime succeed without knowing that the crime is going to occur. You have to have both of those elements.\u201dProsecutors did not have to prove a motive, though Ms. Sweeney, an assistant United States attorney, said in her closing argument on Wednesday that Ms. Salman could have aided Mr. Mateen out of love, money or spite. But while Mr. Mateen\u2019s internet browsing and social media records showed intense radicalization, there was no similar history for Ms. Salman. In fact, twice on Facebook she criticized Islamic terrorists, at one point calling them bad Muslims.\u201cIn today\u2019s world, to have a case like that where you have access to all the social media, you have access to the phones, you have access to the computers \u2014 all of that, and you don\u2019t have a specific piece of evidence pointing to her intent? You don\u2019t have a case,\u201d Mr. Dratel said.In her supposed confession, Ms. Salman told F.B.I. agents that she and Mr. Mateen had scouted Pulse as a target for the June 12, 2016, attack, yet investigators apparently knew just days later that there was no evidence to corroborate that. That false statement in her confession called into question the rest of what she told law enforcement over more than 11 hours of questioning without a lawyer present. The F.B.I. made no audio or video recordings of the interview. The jury foreman told The Sentinel that he wished a recording had been available.\u201cTwenty years ago, not everybody who you ran into had a digital recorder in their pocket, and we didn\u2019t have \u2018CSI\u2019 shows, and we didn\u2019t expect to have everything on tape for us to see,\u201d said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who is now a defense lawyer. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we expect now. If there isn\u2019t a picture, it didn\u2019t happen. So the fact that they didn\u2019t record the confession helped to raise this reasonable doubt as to what was being said.\u201dThe final coup for the defense came during the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, when Ms. Sweeney for the first time suggested that the reason Ms. Salman told F.B.I. agents that she and Mr. Mateen had driven by Pulse was because she incorrectly thought the nightclub was at the Disney Springs shopping and entertainment complex, formerly known as Downtown Disney, which the couple did visit.Offering an especially chilling detail, Ms. Sweeney suggested that Mr. Mateen bought a baby carriage and doll at a Walmart the night before the massacre so that he could conceal his AR-15 assault rifle and draw no suspicion as he walked toward Disney Springs, which prosecutors believe was his original intended target.Prosecutors had never before assigned any importance to the stroller, which Mr. Mateen bought alone, while Ms. Salman was miles away, shopping with his credit card. Mr. Swift said in an interview that it showed his client was not in the loop and her husband had intentionally kept his plot from her.\u201cDoesn\u2019t it make more sense to got to the Walmart with his wife for a baby carriage?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf she is aiding and abetting, then why isn\u2019t she with him? If she was there, she might have questioned him: Why do we need a baby carriage? Their kid did not need a stroller.\u201dThe defense asked for a mistrial this week after prosecutors disclosed that Mr. Mateen\u2019s father, Seddique Mateen, had been an F.B.I. informer at various times from January 2005 to the time of the attack. He is now under criminal investigation for financial transfers to Turkey and Afghanistan he made shortly before the shooting. Defense lawyers argued that the elder Mateen\u2019s relationship with the F.B.I. should have been disclosed early on in the case.\u201cMistakes were made by everybody, but nobody would admit to them,\u201d Mr. Swift said. \u201cMistakes were made by the interrogators, and by the original people who looked at Mateen, and the prosecution. At every level.\u201d\u201cSalman was a solution to all their mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the jury didn\u2019t buy it.\u201dFollow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Adam Goldman and Alan Blinder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discussion Questions for \u2018Exit West\u2019", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read ThisBelow are questions to help guide discussions as you read the book throughout the month. The questions are broken down by week, or divided into four parts to match your reading speed. (Spoiler alert on the questions that are further down if you read ahead!)Week One1. \u201cExit West\u201d begins with two people meeting in a city \u201cswollen by refugees but still mostly at peace, or at least not yet openly at war\u201d \u2014 setting the scene for what\u2019s to come. Throughout the book, as the city descends into war, Hamid never mentions the place\u2019s name. Why?2. As the book follows its two main characters, Nadia and Saeed, readers also meet a thief in Australia, a suited man targeting women in Tokyo and an old man whose house is being surrounded by military men in San Diego, among others. We never meet these characters again. What do you think is the purpose of these interludes?3. We learn early on that Nadia wears flowing black robes but is not religious. She says she does it so that men won\u2019t disturb her. When she goes to withdraw money from a bank, she is groped in a crowd with \u201cincredible force.\u201d What are we supposed to take away from the scenes about the ways women have to survive in a period of instability?4. Even as the city descends into war, and events become increasingly scary, Hamid rarely tells us that the characters feel fear. Instead, the reader is left to decipher how the people in the book must be feeling. Why do you think that is?Week Two5. Hamid describes windows in people\u2019s houses as a \u201cborder through which death was possibly most likely to come,\u201d and the many ways a house has to be rearranged during war to ensure it\u2019s safe. How is the feeling of home as a secure place challenged in this book?6. After discussing the windows, Hamid introduces the rumors about doors \u201cthat could take you elsewhere.\u201d What do we learn about the dangers and promises of these passageways?7. The militants who take over the city do not allow music, do no not approve of unmarried lovers like Nadia and Saeed, and come looking to kill people of a particular sect. Does this book feel representative of the unrest of our present time, of our past, or both?8. When Nadia and Saeed learn that the magical doors do exist, and can in fact take them away from the violence of their city, they are excited and immediately pursue an agent to help them leave. Saeed\u2019s father, on the other hand, only says of the doors: \u201cLet us see.\u201d Does this feel resonant to you of the experience of different generations of migrants?Week Three9. Chapter Five ends with Nadia making Saeed\u2019s father a promise to take care of his son, and the line: \u201cThat is the way of things, for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.\u201d Is Hamid referring to Saeed\u2019s father and the people we leave behind, or something more?10. As migrants move through the magical doors to other places, trying to escape war and chaos, the passage they take is described as: \u201cboth like dying and like being born.\u201d Does this description feel representative of the experience of people who migrate today?11. We never hear, though, about what actually happens as people migrate through these doors. Why do you think the migration itself is absent from the narrative?12. As Nadia and Saeed escape through the doors, we learn that not just their city, but much of the wider world, is in turmoil. Refugees are on the move to Mykonos in Greece and Marin County, near San Francisco. Riots are starting over migrants in Vienna and in London. What do you think Hamid wants us to understand about this global instability?13. As these cities become more unstable, they also come under greater surveillance, at the hands of unseen authorities. These authorities also control the electricity network and internet connectivity. How do these changes impact the people in the book? How does it feel relevant to today\u2019s world?Week Four14. In the cities to which migrants flee, Hamid writes that people began to reassemble with others of their own kind, \u201clike superficially with like.\u201d At one point, even Saeed wants him and Nadia to relocate to live with others like them, though Nadia resists. What do you think is behind this human impulse?15. As Nadia and Saeed continue to move locations, their relationship becomes increasingly unstable, and the way they speak to each other not as kind. By the end of the book, Hamid writes that they begin \u201cslipping away\u201d from each other, as people all over the world are \u201cslipping away from where they had been.\u201d What does Hamid want us to learn here?16. And yet at the same time in Amsterdam, two older men fall in love. What do you take away from his interlude?17. The book ends in the city of Nadia and Saeed\u2019s birth, which Hamid writes seems to them both familiar and unfamiliar. How did you feel about this book\u2019s ending?Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a wine understood not so much for its fruitiness as for its savory elements, which is true of some of the world\u2019s great whites.It\u2019s hard to find carricante from any other place in the world. The grape is grown elsewhere in Sicily, where it often plays a subordinate role to catarratto. But I\u2019ve never found it to be as interesting as it is when it comes from Etna.The three bottles I suggest are:As is so often the case, these are small-production wines. If you cannot find them, look for other bottlings from these producers, as well as Etna Biancos from Tenuta delle Terre Nere, Biondi, Russo, Murgo, Planeta, I Custodi (also associated with the producer Salvo Foti), Barone di Villagrande and Pietra Dolce.If you don\u2019t mind spending a little more, the Arcur\u00eca from Graci is superb, while the Benanti Pietra Marina is one of the best white wines from Italy.These wines are natural partners for all sorts of seafood, particularly shellfish and leaner cuts of fish. I would probably not serve them with meatier fish like tuna or salmon.Serve these wines cool, but not too cold; otherwise the nuances may be lost. If the bottle is fully refrigerated, plan to take it out about 20 to 30 minutes before serving.Advertisement"}

Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.Now, that confidence is evaporating.Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent, the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P.The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing, as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company\u2019s bonds after markets closed Tuesday.Across the technology industry, investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years.Those days are gone.Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent, its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent.The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February, a diverse crop of worries \u2014 such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy \u2014 have unnerved investors. After years of being placid, markets have been on a roller coaster, routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day.Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear, their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets.Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index, by contrast, has gained 290 percent.The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent.

{"Headline": "The Superfund Sites of Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSThe world\u2019s capital of tech innovation prefers to keep its superlatives, good and bad, under wraps. Along its Prius-choked roads, it looks like Anywhere, U.S.A.: single-family-home suburbs south of San Francisco, bordered by chain stores, auto dealerships and corporate parks \u2014 lots of beige, boxy corporate parks. Inside these plain vanilla buildings, where C.E.O.s in hoodies and jeans stockpile more money than the G.D.P. of developing countries, newly minted techies complain that \u201cS.V.,\u201d the world\u2019s largest wealth generator, is too expensive and that its exhausting work culture is toxic. So, too, is the land beneath their feet. The issue is no secret \u2014 Silicon Valley government officials are well-schooled on the sites and news organizations have written about them. Still, Silicon Valley\u2019s Superfund sites rarely make news. Like other problems simmering below the surface \u2014 Facebook\u2019s allowing millions of profiles to be used to aid political campaigns without users\u2019 knowledge, say \u2014 it takes viral headlines to bring the issue to the public\u2019s attention.Some of these sites, still under remediation, contain fully occupied office buildings, others are in or near parks and playgrounds. One, a former Hewlett-Packard property, is a soccer field within walking distance from where Ms. Armstrong lives.\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of Superfund sites,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand got intrigued by the notion of so many sites, 23, in Santa Clara County.\u201d When she began to research the sites, she was struck by how many looked like ordinary places, with people going to and fro. \u201cSo many, albeit still contaminated and in the process of being cleaned up, are used for a number of activities and commercial enterprises,\u201d she said.The companies that used TCE did so not knowing it would contaminate the soil and groundwater and take decades to clean up. Ms. Armstrong found out that the work done by the E.P.A. in Silicon Valley over the last 20 to 30 years to remediate contamination have set the standards for how Superfund sites are managed nationwide. In some cases, however, the underground contamination has moved beyond the boundaries of the Superfund sites. \u201cVapor intrusion, when chemicals evaporate inside buildings and people are exposed to them, is a problem that needs ongoing monitoring,\u201d Ms. Armstrong said.She became a Superfund expert by poring over pages on the E.P.A. website and visiting every single site in Santa Clara County. The slow process of making images with a medium-format camera allowed her to take her time documenting what, at first glance, look like ordinary buildings and grounds. Her project, \u201cIn Plain Site\u201d will eventually take her to all the Superfund sites in California \u2014 more than 100 of them.Until then, her goal is to expose the issue to as wide an audience as possible, at least throughout Silicon Valley. With the Trump administration threatening significant cuts to the E.P.A. budget, including a 25 percent decrease in Superfund site cleanup, the issue needs wider awareness, she said. \u201cMost sites are currently occupied by offices, some house some of the most prestigious companies of Silicon Valley,\u201d she said. But others, she added, are completely obscured by their new life as retail spaces and private residences.\u201cMost people I talked to in the community seemed unaware of their presence,\u201d she said. \u201cOften, even the notion of Superfund sites is foreign to many people. We are used to taking for granted the safety of the environment we inhabit. I feel the need to pay more attention to it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

During the Revolutionary War \u2014 even while British forces occupied our city, Professor Shapiro told us \u2014 there was Shakespeare being performed here.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give a sense of the superstar, international status of these people, who were the Madonnas or Jay-Zs, if you will, of the Shakespeare community,\u201d Professor Shapiro said.And although Shakespeare\u2019s writing bridges centuries, languages and communities around the world, three seminal moments in its influential history took place in New York City:\u201cNew Yorkers never tire of Shakespeare; he\u2019s really crucial here in ways that he has not been in England and, for that matter, everywhere else in the world,\u201d Professor Shapiro said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot for Shakespeare and shaped the way that Shakespeare is understood.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:We considered giving the forecast in iambic pentameter, but ultimately decided that we would spare you the literary pain.And clear skies are entering stage right for the weekend.If the ides have you feeling inspired to set off on a Shakespearean scavenger hunt, here are a few treasure troves around the city:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What College Students Really Think About Free Speech", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe survey, a collaboration among five groups, finds that college students feel increasingly stifled on campus and online, and while they equally value free speech and inclusivity, they wrestle with how best to balance the two.\u201cWhat you see is a generation that\u2019s struggling with really deep questions about how to be a pluralistic society and a pluralistic campus and how to be an open society and an open campus,\u201d said Sam Gill, vice president of communities and learning at the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which led the effort with Gallup, the polling company.Students differed widely on how to strike that balance. Here\u2019s a look at some of the findings of the survey, which was co-sponsored by the American Council on Education, the Charles Koch Foundation and the Stanton Foundation.College students believe about equally in free expression and pluralism, with nearly 90 percent saying that free speech protections are very or extremely important to American democracy and more than 80 percent saying the same of promoting an inclusive and diverse society.When forced to choose, a majority of students said that diversity and inclusivity were more important than free speech, though opinions differed widely by demographic.Those who belong to groups historically or currently in positions of power \u2014 white students, men or Republicans \u2014 tended to favor free speech, while nearly two in three students who were black, women or Democrats favored inclusivity. That gap was widest along partisan lines, with 66 percent of Democrats saying inclusivity was more important and 69 percent of Republicans saying the same of free speech.Still, a majority of students in every demographic drew a line for hate speech, saying that it does not deserve First Amendment protection.On campus policies, students showed broad agreement that restrictions should be placed on racial slurs and costumes that promote stereotypes. They also widely supported safe spaces for those who feel upset or threatened and free speech zones where protests or partisan proselytizing is explicitly allowed. Even 70 percent of Republicans surveyed supported safe spaces on campus, an idea often dismissed by conservatives.Students may struggle to balance free speech and inclusivity in the abstract, but they overwhelmingly and broadly prefer a learning environment that is open and permits offensive speech to one that is positive and limits it.Still, they increasingly believe that speech is being stifled. Last year, 61 percent said that their campus climate deterred speech, up from 54 percent in 2016. That sense was widely held among students at colleges big and small, private and public. Only Hispanic students and Republicans saw a decline in that feeling of stifled speech.Students broadly agree that liberals have it easier, with about 92 percent saying that liberals can freely express their views on campus, while only 69 percent said the same of conservatives. Democrats were just as likely as the overall student population to hold those views.The debate over speech on campus may be growing less relevant, however, with a majority of students saying that most political and social discussion now takes place online, even if they may not feel particularly good about that shift.The vast majority of students blame social media for an increase in hate speech, with about two in three saying that platforms like Facebook and Twitter should take responsibility to limit that speech.Students also said they found online discussion stifling and uncivil. About 60 percent said that free expression is limited online by the ability to block contrarian views and the fear of being attacked or shamed for expressing one\u2019s beliefs. Just 37 percent believe that the dialogue on social media is usually civil.Women, black students and Democrats were the groups least likely to feel confident in those rights. Less than half of the students in each demographic said that they believed the freedom of assembly was secure or very secure, for example.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Mark Zuckerberg Can Save Facebook \u2014 and Us", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is so much news these days that it\u2019s hard to distinguish one big story from another. But for me the most consequential story of late was that a self-driving car operated by Uber \u2014 with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel \u2014 struck and tragically killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz.We became our own filmmakers and reporters; we launched political and social revolutions from our living rooms; we connected with long-lost family and friends; we found the answers to old and new questions with one click; we searched for everything from spouses to news to directions to kindred spirits with our phones; we exposed dictators and branded ourselves. With one touch, we could suddenly call a taxi, direct a taxi, rate a taxi and pay a taxi \u2014 or rent an igloo, rate an igloo and pay for an igloo in Alaska.And then, just as suddenly, we found ourselves in the second inning. The cool self-driving car killed a pedestrian; the cool Facebook platform enabled Russian troll farms to divide us and inject fake news into our public life; the uncool totalitarian government learned how to use the same facial recognition tools that can ease your way through passport control to single you out in a crowd for arrest.And Mark Zuckerberg, who promised to connect us all \u2014 and that it would all be good \u2014 found himself on the cover of Wired magazine, with his face cut, bruised and bandaged, as if he\u2019d been hit by a fastball. He wasn\u2019t alone. In inning two, we started to feel beat up by the same platforms and technologies that had enriched, empowered and connected our lives.Silicon Valley, we have a problem.What to do? For problems like this, I like to consult my teacher and friend Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN, which helps companies and leaders build ethical cultures, and the author of the book, \u201cHow: Why How We Do Anything Means Everything.\u201dEqually important, Seidman added, these \u201cunprecedented and valuable tools of connection\u201d are being used with great accuracy and potency \u201cto assault the foundations of what makes our democracies vibrant, capitalism dynamic and our societies healthy \u2014 namely, truth and trust.\u201dValues are more vital now than ever, Seidman insisted. \u201cBecause sustainable values are what anchor us in a storm, and because values propel and guide us when our lives are profoundly disrupted. They help us make the hard decisions.\u201d Hard decisions abound, because everything is now connected. \u201cThe world is fused. So there no place anymore to stand to the side and claim neutrality \u2014 to say, \u2018I am just a businessperson\u2019 or \u2018I am just running a platform.\u2019 \u201dNo way. \u201cOnce you see that your technologies are having unintended consequences, you cannot maintain your neutrality \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve become so central to the lives of billions of people.\u201dTo be sure, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube should all be commended for trying to find engineering solutions to prevent them from being hacked and weaponized.\u201cBut this is not just an engineering problem, or just a business model problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSoftware solutions can increase our confidence that we can stay a step ahead of the bad guys. But, fundamentally, it will take more \u2018moralware\u2019 to regain our trust. Only one kind of leadership can respond to this kind of problem \u2014 moral leadership.\u201dWhat does moral leadership look like here?\u201cMoral leadership means truly putting people first and making whatever sacrifices that entails,\u201d said Seidman. \u201cThat means not always competing on shallow things and quantity \u2014 on how much time people spend on your platform \u2014 but on quality and depth. It means seeing and treating people not just as \u2018users\u2019 or \u2018clicks,\u2019 but as \u2018citizens,\u2019 who are worthy of being accurately informed to make their best choices. It means not just trying to shift people from one click to another, from one video to another, but instead trying to elevate them in ways that deepen our connections and enrich our conversations.\u201dIt means, Seidman continued, being \u201cfully transparent about how you operate, and make decisions that affect them \u2014 all the ways in which you\u2019re monetizing their data. It means having the courage to publish explicit standards of quality and expectations of conduct, and fighting to maintain them however inconvenient. It means having the humility to ask for help even from your critics. It means promoting civility and decency, making the opposite unwelcome.

Questions are among them. Visiting reporters rarely get too far without being asked about their plans, and within a day or so, word gets around.If you\u2019re deemed trustworthy, introductions are made, phone numbers are shared and people just appear to tell their stories.Pubs help.Here in Pyramid Hill, we arrived and dropped our bags in a couple of rooms at the Victoria Hotel around 3 p.m. on Monday. A few hours later, the local mayor stopped by for a chat and a beer on her way home from work.She appeared a few minutes later, not just at the pub, but at my table.No wonder writers love these kinds of towns.Tim Winton, even as he promotes a new novel called \u201cThe Shepherd\u2019s Hut,\u201d still deliberately avoids telling anyone where he can be found in Western Australia to preserve the peace and quiet of his coastal community.And then there\u2019s Gerald Murnane, the Australian literary savant who has landed in Goroke, a stretch of remote Victoria a few hours from where I am.The shed reminded me a bit of the Op Shop here. (For the non-Aussies, that\u2019s a vintage store, the \u201copportunity shop,\u201d which sells donated goods, in this case to benefit the local nursing home.)I stopped in Tuesday afternoon and bought three antique port glasses from a couple of older volunteers who were mending dresses for some Filipino girls at the local Catholic school.Each glass cost me \u2026 go on, guess.Try 20 cents.The woman who sold them to me wrapped them carefully in gray paper to ensure they made it back to Sydney, and as we chatted about how the town was changing with the influx of Filipinos (more on that in a future story), I started to wonder what else I might buy.There was a big \u201cfor sale\u201d sign out in front of the pub.My room was comfortable and clean. The place had good bones, solid wood floors, lots of space and decent water pressure.Would it be weird for The New York Times to buy into a piece of regional Australian life? Would it even be possible?Probably not. But in a place this friendly and quiet, it\u2019s a ribbon of thought that keeps twirling.Now for the week\u2019s reads \u2026 and a call for your recommendations about what to listen to, read or watch to better understand regional Australia.______Australians often ask me why Americans are so obsessed with guns, but what we\u2019re witnessing now is a historic push in the other direction.______Who is Stormy Daniels?______Lots of things are signs of status: cars, handbags, shoes, watches. And fish \u2014 the ones that get plastic surgery.______In-DepthNewsFor Fun____________This week, as I prepare to write about Pyramid Hill and other small towns, I\u2019m looking for suggestions: Share your favorite movies, songs, books, essays or photographs that go deep toward understanding rural, regional Australia.All suggestions, big or small, are welcome.

And it\u2019s not just because he\u2019s from Victoria, British Columbia.In his testimony, Mr. Wylie said that Aggregrate, a subsidiary of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent, drew on Cambridge\u2019s Facebook data to sway social media opinion in favor of the Leave side in the 2016 British referendum on the European Union vote, and he repeated claims that the Canadian company was used to avoid British campaign spending limits. (The company has denied the claims.)Attention inevitably turned to Mr. Wylie\u2019s activities in Canada. When he was 19, Mr. Wylie worked briefly in the office of Michael Ignatieff, then the Liberal leader. Then early in 2016, when Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was not being widely predicted, Mr. Wylie, through a company called Eunoia Technologies, was given a 100,000 Canadian dollar contract by the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. Like all of the political parties\u2019 research shops, the bureau is separate from the party\u2019s other operations and is funded by Parliament.Melissa Cotton, the bureau\u2019s managing director, said in a statement that Mr. Wylie did not have access to the party\u2019s data and that he worked on projects that appeared to have involved monitoring social media, identifying issues and analyzing how Liberal members communicate with voters.\u201cPreliminary work was done by Eunoia Technologies but after seeing what was offered, Liberal Caucus Research Bureau decided not to move forward.\u201d Ms. Cotton said, without explaining why it cut ties.Mr. Wylie\u2019s time in Ottawa, however, brought to light something that most people have overlooked. Unlike businesses and the federal government itself, federal political parties aren\u2019t subject to Canada\u2019s internet privacy and data protection laws.\u201cEvery other sector is covered by privacy laws but political parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are all using data so I don\u2019t think there is a good argument about why they should be under privacy rules.\u201dAs for concerns about encroaching on Parliament, Professor Pal isn\u2019t buying that either. He noted that parties were already \u201cheavily regulated\u201d through Elections Canada and election fund-raising laws.\u201cWhat, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network?Here\u2019s the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.\u201dOther injustices and misfortune followed the five through their lives. The decision by the City of North Bay to turn over the log house to a village without the obvious means to maintain or restore it looked like the latest one.But much has changed in the past year. After a public campaign, North Bay reversed its decision, and the house has been moved to downtown where it will become a museum.Carlo Tarini, a friend who acts as the family\u2019s spokesman, told me this week that Annette and C\u00e9cile, the two surviving sisters, are doing well, although C\u00e9cile was hospitalized for a time in January because of pneumonia.\u201cIn the pre-internet decades of the 30s and 40s, the worldwide fascination they sparked as children brings shade to the Kardashian kids popularity,\u201d Mr. Tarini wrote in an email.An earlier version of a web summary with this article misstated the name of the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower.

{"Headline": "Your Kid\u2019s Phone Is Not Like a Cigarette", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionBut an anti-tobacco campaign is not an ideal model for the effort to make technology safer for children. Because while there\u2019s plenty of concern about overuse of technology among young people, the actual evidence of addictiveness and harm is much more complex than it was in the case of cigarettes.Sure, there are treatment facilities for adolescents who are hooked on devices, and psychologists use terms like \u201cproblematic media use\u201d in describing a small percentage of people who seem to prefer screens to people. But experts are split over the question of whether internet addiction is a legitimate stand-alone disorder.A Common Sense spokeswoman, Corbie Kiernan, told me, \u201cWe use the term \u2018addiction\u2019 colloquially, not diagnostically,\u201d in response to parents\u2019 concerns. Of course, only a rank apologist would deny that there is cause for concern about the role mobile devices are playing in children\u2019s and young people\u2019s lives. Media habits are shifting fast: The amount of time children 8 years old and younger spend on phones or tablets has increased tenfold in just five years, according to a 2017 study by Common Sense. The organization also found that 42 percent of children under 8 already have their own mobile device. That number was less than 1 percent in 2011.While those of us who grew up before smartphones can agree that these changes are jarring, the extent of the harm done to kids by more screens than we could ever have imagined is not at all clear. The real \u201ctruth about tech\u201d is that there just isn\u2019t enough research on this yet. For example, when I asked Victor C. Strasburger of the American Academy of Pediatrics how the organization arrived at its \u201cno screens before age 2\u201d recommendation, he said that later studies supported the guidance but admitted that at the time it was put into effect, \u201cthere was no evidence. None. We made it up.\u201d (The group has since changed its stance, maintaining that it\u2019s best to keep the youngest children away from screens, but making an exception for live video chat.)The science here is nothing like the kind that fueled the Truth campaign against cigarettes. For that reason alone, those working to make tech safer for kids can\u2019t emulate that campaign.With this in mind, activists shouldn\u2019t simply vilify the tech industry \u2014 they should goad it toward accountability as Mr. Nader, Ms. Lightner and others did with the auto industry. They need to summon the art of moral suasion to create powerful cultural memes, like that of the \u201cdesignated driver,\u201d to push us to use tech more safely. (Especially, by the way, in cars. Designated texters, anyone?)Mr. Harris, of the Center for Humane Technology, who studied persuasive technology and then spent time as a digital ethicist at Google, now pushes for social networks to adopt less nefarious business models. He also suggests a simple method of making your phone less compelling: Set it to grayscale.The campaign, and the concerned Apple shareholders, should focus on these kinds of approaches and avoid imitating the fight against Big Tobacco by creating a moral panic about the specter of addiction. After all, the goal is to inspire a cultural shift around technology like the one we saw around car safety \u2014 not to snuff out kids\u2019 use of devices altogether.Anya Kamenetz is the author of \u201cThe Art of Screen Time: How Your Family Can Balance Digital Media and Real Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama in Talks to Provide Shows for Netflix", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama is in advanced negotiations with Netflix to produce a series of high-profile shows that will provide him a global platform after his departure from the White House, according to people familiar with the discussions.Under terms of a proposed deal, which is not yet final, Netflix would pay Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for exclusive content that would be available only on the streaming service, which has nearly 118 million subscribers around the world. The number of episodes and the formats for the shows have not been decided.Mr. Obama does not intend to use his Netflix shows to directly respond to President Trump or conservative critics, according to people familiar with discussions about the programming. They said the Obamas had talked about producing shows that highlight inspirational stories.But the Netflix deal, while not a direct answer to Fox News or Breitbart.com, would give Mr. Obama an unfiltered method of communication with the public similar to the audiences he already reaches through social media, with 101 million Twitter followers and 55 million people who have liked his Facebook page.\u201cPresident and Mrs. Obama have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president, said Thursday. \u201cThroughout their lives, they have lifted up stories of people whose efforts to make a difference are quietly changing the world for the better. As they consider their future personal plans, they continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.\u201dIn one possible show idea, Mr. Obama could moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency \u2014 health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy, climate change \u2014 and that have continued to divide a polarized American electorate during President Trump\u2019s time in office.Another program could feature Mrs. Obama on topics, like nutrition, that she championed in the White House. The former president and first lady could also lend their brand \u2014 and their endorsement \u2014 to documentaries or fictional programming on Netflix that align with their beliefs and values.It is unclear how much money the Obamas will be paid, given their lack of experience in the media business. Netflix recently signed a five-year, $300 million deal to lure Ryan Murphy away from 21st Century Fox, but Mr. Murphy is among the television industry\u2019s most sought-after producersSeveral people familiar with the Netflix discussions said that executives from Apple and Amazon, which have their own streaming services, have also expressed interest in talking with Mr. Obama about content deals.Mr. Obama has long expressed concerns about how the flow of information \u2014 and misinformation \u2014 has the power to shape public opinion. In the last several months, Mr. Obama has discussed with technology executives and wealthy investors the threats to American democracy from the manipulation of news.He has seethed privately and publicly, about what he says is the manipulation of news by conservative outlets and the fractured delivery of information in the internet age. In several recent public appearances during the last several months, the former president hinted at his frustration with the way conservative news outlets have shaped people\u2019s perceptions about the divisive 2016 campaign and the issues he cares about.It would also be another coup for a company that began by distributing DVDs and is now doing deals with some of the most powerful names in entertainment.Several of the technology and media worlds\u2019 top executives have been close advisers and donors to Mr. Obama over the years, including John Doerr and Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley venture capitalists, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, the entertainment executive.But Mr. Obama has particularly close ties to Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. Mr. Sarandos is married to Nicole A. Avant, an activist who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to the Bahamas. And Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, was close to Mr. Obama while he was president and an attendee at state dinners. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment about any discussions with the former president and his wife.Some of the biggest media companies on the internet, like BuzzFeed and Vice, have embraced politically-themed programming, even as they have recently seen their growth flatline with shifts in the digital advertising and distribution landscapes. Political news start-ups like the website Axios and the podcast \u201cPod Save America,\u201d hosted by former Obama officials, have connected with audiences that are eager for scoops, analysis and opinion.The deal between Netflix and Mr. Obama would be a modern media twist on an approach that former politicians have tried in the past.Al Gore, the former vice president, created a new cable network after losing the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Gore and Joel Hyatt, a businessman and Democratic activist, purchased a small cable company in 2004, eventually renaming it Current TV and positioning it as an \u201cindependent voice\u201d in the political debate.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach is less of a direct challenge to the existing news establishment. But he is embracing the streaming services that have become a direct threat to the cable and network television infrastructure, especially among younger viewers.Advertisement"}

We regulate to avoid taking in harsh critiques.Why do we react this way to feedback that is ostensibly supposed to help us?When you\u2019re delivering negative feedback, do so honestly and openly, and frame the conversation as a difficult-yet-necessary means to an end of improving the receiver\u2019s performance (and mean it!). Don\u2019t sugarcoat it, either. Those \u201cpraise sandwiches\u201d in which we surround a bad review with halfhearted, superficial compliments don\u2019t help either side.If you\u2019re receiving the feedback, frame it so it will ultimately lead to self-improvement.

Even if you\u2019re given a C for performance, you can still earn an A for improvement. And eventually, like one C.E.O. whom Adam interviews in his podcast, you can retrain your brain to actively seek out that feedback so you associate it not with anxiety, but with opportunity.Have a great week!Advertisement"}

Could it happen again?Here are some of the things the commission says Theranos, a private company, did to pull the wool over investors\u2019 eyes.It allegedly performed tests on non-Theranos equipment without telling representatives of a pharmacy company that was poised to invest money in the company.Based on Holmes\u2019 presentation, Pharmacy A executives understood that the blood from their demonstration samples would be tested on Theranos\u2019 miniLabs. Holmes never told the executives that Theranos was actually testing some of their blood on modified third party analyzers.Theranos allegedly distributed fake reports by pharmaceutical companies.Investors believed that pharmaceutical companies had written their own endorsements of Theranos\u2019 technology, when the pharmaceutical companies had not.Theranos allegedly made misleading statements about its work with the United States Department of Defense.While Theranos\u2019 technology was used in a D.O.D. burn study, it was never deployed by the D.O.D. in the battlefield, in Afghanistan, or on medevac helicopters. From 2011 to 2014, Holmes had discussions with multiple divisions of the D.O.D. However, Theranos generated only approximately $300,000 from three D.O.D. contracts.Ms. Holmes allegedly told an investor Theranos expected to expand quickly in the stores of a pharmacy chain, but the likelihood of such an expansion was small.Holmes was aware that Theranos\u2019 retail roll out with Pharmacy A was stalled due to, among other issues, some concerns Pharmacy A executives had with regard to Theranos\u2019 performance.The Food and Drug Administration communicated to Theranos that its approval would be needed, but Ms. Holmes allegedly told investors afterward that F.D.A. approval was merely voluntary.Holmes\u2019 statements that Theranos did not need F.D.A. approval or clearance were important to investors because approval or clearance would have been an obstacle in the company\u2019s path to realizing full commercialization.Ms. Holmes allegedly gave investors fake financial results.Holmes also provided historical financial information to one potential investor. In August 2015, Holmes met with a potential investor, during which she provided Theranos\u2019 financial results for fiscal year 2014.These financials showed 2014 net revenues of $108 million, and 2015 and 2016 net revenue projections of $240 million and $750 million, respectively. But Theranos\u2019 actual financial performance bore no resemblance to the financial information Holmes shared with investors.Theranos recorded little more than $100,000 in revenue in 2014 and was nowhere near generating $100 million in revenue by the end of 2014\u2014 Peter EavisWhat makes this case interesting is that Theranos was one of the original unicorns, a private company with a value of more than $1 billion. We usually see the S.E.C. pursue charges against public companies and their executives, while private firms operate largely free from scrutiny \u2013 at least until they prepare for an I.P.O.For Ms. Holmes, the settlement means that she will be cut off from raising money for any new venture for a long time. The complaint shows a systemic effort to deceive investors over a number of years, no doubt in a desperate hope that somehow the technology could be made to work. It is unlikely anyone in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street will trust her again.\u2014 Peter J. HenningReaction\u201cIt remains to be seen whether Kudlow can step into the role of a virtual moderating influence in this administration. Unlike others in this White House, he does have experience in government and the private sector. But unlike television where on-air conflict is sometimes mostly for show, the health of the national and global economy is at stake here.\u201dBut was buying Bear Stearns as bad a deal as Mr. Dimon suggests?While we don\u2019t have all the numbers necessary for a full accounting, there is much in the public domain that can help answer this question. And this information suggests that, while the Bear Stearns acquisition probably wasn\u2019t as profitable as expected in March 2008, JPMorgan may still have benefited from it \u2014 even after taking into account the legal expenses.That\u2019s a lot, but when JPMorgan did the deal, it agreed to terms that gave it a lot of financial protection against nasty surprises like this.-- Peter Eavis with reporting from Charles V. Bagli.CybertrailsAt approximately 10:00 a.m. on Monday, August 28, 2017, Ying used a search engine to find information on the internet concerning the September 2015 cybersecurity breach of Experian, another one of the three major credit bureaus, and the impact that breach had on Experian\u2019s stock price.

The White House has made no secret of its concerns about Beijing, and seems to have been motivated by the prospect of Qualcomm losing its lead in 5G.\u201cIf every country in the world conducted policy like that, it would make cross-border investment difficult to the detriment of American and foreign companies,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cForeign direct investment is an important part of the strength of the U.S. economy.\u201dPeter Eavis\u2019s take: National champions have to deliver.

It has also, they say, stymied a more robust #MeToo movement \u2014 akin to those that have rattled Washington and Hollywood \u2014 from taking hold.\u201cI know it prevented a number of other victims and witnesses\u2019 feeling safe to come forward,\u201d said Tessa Sullivan, a former Melbourne City Council member who accused Mr. Doyle of harassment. \u201cA number of politicians knew about my abuse and tried to deter me from speaking out.\u201dAustralia\u2019s universities are in the early phases of a reckoning.Over the past few years, students at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and on several other campuses have mobilized against \u201crape culture,\u201d drawing attention to a lack of punishment for sexual assault and harassment.How are public institutions in Australia responding to sexual assault and sexual harassment? To inform our coverage, we\u2019re asking readers to contribute their stories.Many Australian women a generation removed said it was at least as bad or worse during their student days. And, they said, the culture of student politics did not help.Each of Australia\u2019s main political parties has an active youth wing \u2014 the Young Liberals promote themselves to anyone ages 16 to 31; Young Labor focuses on anyone under 26 \u2014 and their efforts often overlap with on-campus campaigns.Many lawmakers started out in this milieu, with student bodies or union boards, before moving to staffing roles, party offices or legislatures. Three of Australia\u2019s five most recent prime ministers \u2014 Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott and John Howard \u2014 began their political careers as students at the University of Sydney.Regular gatherings of young people in politics \u2014 like the annual National Union of Students conference in December \u2014 are also notorious for alcohol-fueled inappropriate behavior.\u201cAt one of them, a Queensland Labor man threatened to rape me as I was walking back to my room,\u201d said Tammy Franks, a Greens member of the South Australian Legislative Council, who was active in student politics in the \u201990s. \u201cI was on the sexual harassment and grievance committee, and there was a lot of that type of behavior.\u201dPoliticians have carried their university-bred attitudes up the ranks for decades.Jacqui Munro, a former Liberal staff member in New South Wales who joined the party in 2011, says the \u201cmixture of older adults and young staffers\u201d in many political workplaces can produce situations where professional and personal boundaries are poorly defined.Mr. Joyce, the deputy prime minister, ended up having an extramarital affair with a younger member of his staff \u2014 that\u2019s the extreme. But there are other problems with combining power, proximity and desire.\u201cCloseness can sometimes be misread, especially if alcohol\u2019s involved,\u201d Ms. Munro said. \u201cPeople can be inappropriately handsy, and sometimes get away with things because it\u2019s considered a bit too difficult to manage in a long-term sense. You just sort of address it quietly.\u201dMs. Sullivan, the former Melbourne council member whose allegation helped topple the city\u2019s mayor (he denies the accusation), said women working in Australian politics frequently warn one another privately about male colleagues\u2019 conduct, but are often reluctant to accuse their harassers publicly.\u201cFemale politicians,\u201d she said, understand that they have \u201cto take steps to protect themselves from being violated.\u201dThe threats and abuse span parties and states.In South Australia, Ms. Franks said she, too, sees signs of a \u201ctoxic culture.\u201d\u201cPeople act like spoiled teenagers, and because they have a lot of power they think they can get away with it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 in reverse. \u2018Mean Blokes.\u2019\u201dAustralia\u2019s main political parties, in the wake of scandal after scandal, have said they are trying to improve their relations with women.But with the issue confronted only weakly for years, many women in and out of Australian politics say the country must do more to hold men accountable at every phase of life \u2014 and to ensure that women are not pushed aside by a culture of abuse.\u201cMy advice for women who wish to join politics is to find your voice before joining,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said. \u201cYou will need bravery.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cplease do give it a go, because we need more women to help shape the world we all live in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The new prime minister, Peter Pellegrini, 42, is a close ally of Mr. Fico, who will return to Parliament as the leader of the ruling SMER-SD party.Mr. Kiska, a vocal critic of Mr. Fico who had to approve the new government, predicted that merely reshuffling the cabinet would not restore the trust of the people.\u201cI believe that we all understand the changes in the government are not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main responsibility is changing the way of ruling.\u201dThe other significant change was the appointment of Tomas Drucker, the minister of health, as the new interior minister, overseeing the police. It will fall to Mr. Drucker to lead the investigation into the murders of the journalist Jan Kuciak, 27, and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Kusnirova, 27, which have rocked Slovakia\u2019s political culture.Among other things, Mr. Kuciak was looking into how a young woman went from being the business partner of an alleged \u2019Ndrangheta figure, to being a senior adviser to Prime Minister Fico.Her business partner, Antonino Vadala, was arrested in Slovakia last week on drug trafficking charges and could soon be extradited to Italy.Mr. Kiska said that the naming of a new cabinet resulted directly from the killings, and that public faith in government institutions would not be easily restored.\u201cYou cannot react to the distrust and outrage of the public with yelling, arrogance or ignorance of suspicions of organized crime reaching to the top places in Slovak politics,\u201d he said.The new cabinet \u2014 which also include new ministers of culture, justice and health \u2014 will seek the support of the Slovak Parliament on Friday, but the coalition has already said it would have enough votes to win approval.Protest organizers, while disappointed that calls for early elections were not heeded, said they were canceling a demonstration in Bratislava planned for Friday.\u201cAll of us together have been able to stand up for decent and fair Slovakia,\u201d they said in statement. \u201cThe change has started and it\u2019s unstoppable.\u201dDeclaring that \u201cdecent citizens respect the Constitution,\u201d the organizers said it was time for lawmakers in Parliament to take over. The group\u2019s Facebook page was quickly flooded with messages of disappointment and frustration.Students at several universities said they would carry out a silent march and light candles at a shrine set up in memory of Mr. Kuciak and Ms. Kusnirova in Bratislava\u2019s SNP Square. Some people throughout the country, including Ms. Kusnirova\u2019s mother, said they would continue the demonstrations.\u201cWhat happened in Slovakia in the past month was a political earthquake,\u201d said Marian Lesko, an analyst with the group Let\u2019s Stop the Corruption. \u201cBut after every earthquake, there are some aftershocks.\u201dIt was a shame that the nationwide movement for better politics should stop so abruptly, he said, but there was little more that protesters could achieve legally by taking to the streets.Still, Mr. Lesko said, \u201cSlovakia hasn\u2019t been this determined and decisive in a long time.\u201dMr. Pellegrini, the former minister of education and speaker of the Parliament, said a new cabinet was the best way to restore the stability.He said the murders of Mr. Kuciak and Ms. Kusnirova were an attack on democracy, and vowed that his government would do everything in its power to find those responsible.\u201cWe will do everything to make Slovakia a successful country,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make it a good place to live in and to make it a country we can be proud of.\u201dMiroslava Germanova reported from Bratislava, and Marc Santora from Warsaw.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gun Control Debate Sweeps Up an Outdoor Brand\u2019s Other Products", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe national debate over gun control is now sweeping up bike helmets and water bottles.REI and Mountain Equipment Co-op, two outdoor retail chains that are also customer cooperatives, said Thursday they were suspending orders for popular items like Bell bicycle helmets and CamelBak water bottles from the company that owns the brands, Vista Outdoor, because Vista also makes assault-style rifles.The move signals an escalation of the stances businesses have taken in the past week in the controversial gun debate since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month that killed 17 students and staff members.In the wake of this shooting we have reviewed our policy on firearm sales, and we will no longer be selling guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21. ^kwThe stance by REI and Mountain Equipment also signals a widening of the goods and products that are coming under scrutiny in the gun debate. In recent years, Vista Outdoor, like other leading gun manufacturers, has acquired brands that are unrelated to their core firearm or ammunition businesses.The acquisitions were done, in part, to diversify their revenue sources as gun sales, particularly in the past year under President Trump, have slumped, but also to rebrand, or emphasize, their connection to broader outdoor activities.On Friday, the stock of Vista Outdoor was down 7.3 percent at the close of the market. In February, the company reported that revenue for its guns and ammunition business in the most recent quarter had fallen more than 20 percent. But its outdoor products group, which makes up about half of its sales and includes brands like Camp Chef outdoor cooking products, Boll\u00e9 eyewear and Jimmy Stykes paddleboards, showed modest growth.After several days of active discussions, REI said it learned that Vista did not plan to make a public statement, outlining a clear plan of action. \u201cAs a result, we have decided to place a hold on future orders of products that Vista sells through REI while we assess how Vista proceeds,\u201d the company said. \u201cCompanies are showing they can contribute if they are willing to lead. We encourage Vista to do just that.\u201dCamelBak, founded in 1989, is popular with athletes for its packs that allow athletes to hydrate without using their hands as well as its brightly colored water bottles. It was acquired by Vista in 2015 for $412 million. \u201cOur brand falls within the Outdoor Products segment of our company, which operates separately from Vista Outdoor\u2019s Shooting Sports segment,\u201d the company said in a statement. That segment manufacturers a variety of guns, including AR-15-style rifles.On social media, some argued that boycotting brands like CamelBak and Giro would only hurt people making quality products. Others chided REI for what they saw as mixing business with politics.But retailers are being forced to respond to the growing call to arms that is racing across the internet. On Twitter and Facebook, lists and petitions are being widely circulated of myriad companies associated with the gun lobby or brands owned by gun manufacturers, urging customers to boycott and retailers to drop them.\u201cI only discovered a week ago that my children\u2019s CamelBak water bottles and the Bushnell binoculars that I bought for my 10-year-old who is into birding were associated not only with the gun lobby, but with companies that manufactured assault weapons,\u201d said Sarah Latha, a 39-year-old mother of three who works for the provincial government in Ontario. \u201cIt was incredibly disturbing.\u201dMountain Equipment was caught off guard. The cooperative had long sought out products for its five million members that were ethically sourced and environmentally sustainable. As myriad acquisitions occurred in the outdoor goods space in recent years, it had not paid attention to who currently owned the companies and brands.\u201cThe ownership links to these products caught us by surprise,\u201d David Labistour, the chief executive of Mountain Equipment, said in an interview Friday afternoon.After reading more than 70,000 comments made in two days through the petition and emails and on its Twitter and Facebook pages, Mountain Equipment reached out to Vista, alerting the company it was suspending further orders of the five Vista brands the retailer carried. Existing inventory would continue to be sold in the store.\u201cOur general purpose is to get all of the brands that we deal with to become advocates in the conversation for the sensible and safe ownership of guns,\u201d said Mr. Labistour, who grew up hunting on his farm in South Africa. \u201cThey\u2019re in a tough place, though. They have two very different stakeholder groups.\u201dMr. Labistour said when it came to consumer activism, he had been fairly cynical, noting there was often a gap or disconnect between what consumers said they would do in a tweet versus what they actually did. But he believes this movement is different.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the industry rally together, and I believe that we can have some influence in starting this conversation about the appropriate ownership and use of firearms,\u201d Mr. Labistour said. \u201cAnd when it comes to the sale of assault-style and military-grade firearms, that conversation needs to happen now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There\u2019s a blue-haired mom named Virandara in flowing pants; a dad in horn-rimmed glasses feeding his baby pumped milk; a skinny guy with a toothy smile and a T-shirt that says \u201cKindness Is Everything.\u201d I have forgotten how to make conversation with these people.Could this loneliness, this outsiderness, be a permanent fixture of my identity now? When Andrew made the radical decision to join the Army just before we married, I hadn\u2019t guessed I\u2019d one day be considering this question. I hadn\u2019t anticipated an Army life at all when we fell in love, and yet, when he made the impassioned argument for joining, I wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. My husband is not an easily categorizable man: He\u2019d be equally at home at a gun range and a poetry reading. He found a way to fit in at Fort Benning because he is skilled at negotiating different worlds. He gets lonely too, but he has the architecture of the Army to hold him up, and I\u2019m the home he always returns to.Army wives, on the other hand, are left to erect their own scaffoldings. Andrew is in a rapidly deployable combat unit with backbreaking daily hours.

Before we moved, I\u2019d snobbishly envisioned my stint at Fort Benning as a kind of anthropological study, a view into another world.But from almost the moment we arrived, I sensed just how much I\u2019d need these women, so I made every effort to inch my way into their lives. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t even navigate a conversation with most of them. We had nothing in common; we were separated by the chasms of life experience, education, politics, cultural vocabulary.Still, we forged relationships in the iron of showing up. We flew to emergency rooms, school pickups, maternity wards, kitchen counters. During my high-risk pregnancy with Fiona, Andrew was deployed; I spent so many nights at a friend\u2019s house in those months that my Maps app registered her address as \u201cHome.\u201dMy life with the other wives was like life with family: intense, necessary for survival, claustrophobic and never enough.

I became the de facto babysitter, the honorary aunt at Mother\u2019s Day lunches.They taught me everything I know about parenthood: You get through the days by force of will, by relying not on family or husbands but on friends \u2014 and often, brutally, on just yourself. You welcome people\u2019s help with open arms, but recoil from anyone\u2019s pity. And on the overwhelming days, you let your kids cry, walk into the summer heat of the backyard, and chug a beer.You also snuggle them past dawn and nurse them through every sickness and let them sleep in your bed when they cry. You need those kids as much as they need you. They are your anchors. Without them, you might drown or drift away.After free play, my blind date and I walk home, our babies cuddled in carriers. In the past week, spring has come to coastal Washington, the winter rains finally gone. Snowy white blossoms shower the ground and bursts of rhododendron fill front yards. Fiona and I spend our afternoons wandering these cracked sidewalks, peeking in the windows of old Tacoma craftsmen.The mom asks if I\u2019d like to come to Easter brunch at her house.\u201cThere will be gluten free options,\u201d she adds nervously.I hesitate.\u201cThere will be some really good people,\u201d she says.In Georgia, I went to barbecues with \u201creally good people,\u201d young parents who had climbed out of hard backgrounds and carved out lives for themselves and their children. At first, I\u2019d dreaded these barbecues, until, one day, I stopped dreading them. The wives and I never came to understand each other, really, but we allowed life to happen to us together, appearing on each other\u2019s doorsteps with children in pajamas after blowout fights with husbands, after pipes bursting and miscarriages and late night phone calls alerting us of casualties overseas.Maybe that is all there is to know or understand in any human exchange: the asking to be let in.

But they have plenty of money \u2014 $650 billion of it \u2014 and that\u2019s growing.According to the Hurun Report, a research organization in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy in China, the net worth of the 153 members of China\u2019s Parliament and its advisory body that it deems \u201csuper rich\u201d amounts to $650 billion, up by nearly a third from a year ago. That is just a touch below Switzerland\u2019s annual economic output.Delegates to Parliament, or the National People\u2019s Congress, rubber-stamp most of the policies set out by the party\u2019s leadership and are expected to approve Mr. Xi\u2019s plan to scrap term limits and allow him to rule indefinitely when they meet in Beijing next week. But the gathering provides businesspeople with an opportunity to hobnob with one another. The title of delegate also gives them extra cachet in making business deals.The number of billionaires in China\u2019s legislature could contribute to the perception that the government is out of touch in a country where disposable income per capita was just over $4,000 in 2017. But many Chinese are proud of how quickly the ranks are growing. China added 210 billionaires over the past year \u2014 about four a week \u2014 40 percent more than the United States, according to a separate list of the global rich by Hurun.The wealthiest lawmaker is also China\u2019s richest person, Pony Ma, whose net worth is $47 billion. He is the founder of Tencent, which owns WeChat, a social media mobile app that is indispensable in Chinese life. Tencent is now valued at $540 billion, more than Facebook.Mr. Ma was trailed by Xu Jiayin, the chairman of the property developer Evergrande Group, whose net worth is $41 billion. Mr. Xu was China\u2019s richest person in 2017, according to Hurun.Other Chinese property developers also dominated the list. Lee Ka-kit, vice chairman of Henderson Land Development, is worth $34 billion, while the net worth of Country Garden Group\u2019s founder, Yang Guoqiang, reached $32 billion.The fortunes of China\u2019s entrepreneurs have changed significantly since the Communist Party, which was founded to work for the interests of workers and stamp out capitalism, welcomed businesspeople into the party more than a decade ago. About 20 percent of the nearly 3,000 delegates to Parliament are businesspeople, according to government news media.Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, and an expert on money and politics in China, said that being a member of the National People\u2019s Congress \u201caffords a considerable protection for the wealthy.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re part of the NPC, you become a state cadre, and so the local police can\u2019t arrest you easily without cause,\u201d he said, referring to the congress.\u201cThat\u2019s not the case for a wealthy person who has no affiliation with the Chinese government, and wealth becomes very vulnerable to predatory action by a local government.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

Late Thursday, he said he did not agree with what he wrote in the memo \u201cand I didn\u2019t agree with it even when I wrote it.\u201d He added that \u201cthe purpose of this post, like many others I have written internally, was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company.\u201dAfter BuzzFeed published the memo, Mr. Bosworth deleted it from an internal message board where it had originally been posted. In a statement to BuzzFeed, Mr. Zuckerberg praised Mr. Bosworth as \u201ca talented leader who says many provocative things\u201d and said that he and most people at Facebook did not agree with the memo and that the company had realized that it could not just be about connecting people.Facebook employees said on Friday that discussions were raging across the company regarding the merits of the post. Some called for executives to aggressively pursue action against those leaking to the media, said two Facebook employees, as well as for the company to do more to screen for potential whistle-blowers during the hiring process.\u201cBetween overwork and leadership direction evidenced thusly, I could never stay,\u201d wrote Mr. Muffett, who formerly worked as a Facebook engineer.\u201cThere are some amazing engineers working at Facebook, folks who care deeply about user privacy, security, and how people will use the code that they write,\u201d Mr. Muffett said later in a message. \u201cAlas this episode may not help\u201d to achieve more transparent internal product discussion, he said.An earlier version of this article misstated Adam Mosseri\u2019s position at Facebook.

{"Headline": "Facebook to End News Feed Experiment in 6 Countries That Magnified Fake News", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Thursday that it would end an experiment in six countries that separated posts from news sites and publishers from other material on the social network.Facebook stopped short of acknowledging that the changes made in the experiment, called Explore, contributed to that increase in misinformation, but the company said it could have done a better job communicating with publishers about what was happening.Also on Thursday, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, said his company was looking for ways to measure the \u201chealth\u201d of conversations on Twitter.In a series of tweets, Mr. Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter has been home to a number of people who use the platform to harass, bully and mislead.After Facebook released Explore in the six countries, it was quickly criticized by independent news sites and nongovernmental organizations. The changes, they said, made it harder for trusted sources of information to reach local populations. They also said the experiment had led to an increase in false and salacious news being shared in those countries.Stuart White, editor of The Phnom Penh Post, an English-language newspaper in Cambodia, said traffic from Facebook to his site had plummeted because of the changes to Facebook\u2019s main News Feed \u2014 the scrolling stream of content that greets people when they log into the social network.The experiment took place during a crackdown by the country\u2019s leader, Hun Sen, on political opponents, activists and media, effectively transforming the struggling democracy into a one-party state. Journalists were arrested, and newspapers were shut down. Facebook had emerged as an important, more independent channel for information.\u201cWhether or not Facebook likes it, it has established itself as the main market for news in places like Cambodia,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIt would be helpful if they acknowledged that responsibility.\u201dFabiola Chambi, the web editor of Los Tiempos, the main newspaper of the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, said Explore had reduced traffic to the site by 30 to 60 percent. Ms. Chambi said the Explore function was a constant source of confusion for publishers and readers who thought their access to news had been the subject of an experiment by a foreign company.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an idea that was ever well received, and garnered plenty of rejection,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would guess this had something to do with their decision to reverse course.\u201dHowever, the move did force the newspaper for the first time to think about life after Facebook. \u201cWe had to confront the declines and in the end found some creative ways to improve traffic and maintain a loyal audience,\u201d Ms. Chambi said.Facebook\u2019s role as a kingmaker among publishers has played a central role in a debate over the responsibilities that social media companies have to police content on their own platforms.Facebook has said those News Feed changes were not related to Explore, but there are similarities in the way the company is looking to play down material from publishers.While Facebook has said it was emphasizing meaningful interactions, Mr. Dorsey said Twitter was determined to find \u201cholistic and fair solutions\u201d to its problems.It was unclear how either Twitter or Facebook will measure the new method by which they said they will judge their platforms, or how they will affect the billions of people who use them.Nicholas Casey contributed reporting from Medell\u00edn, Colombia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Russian Trolls Crept Into the Trump Campaign\u2019s Facebook Messages", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the message from Matt Skiber arrived in the mailbox of the Facebook account for Donald J. Trump\u2019s Florida campaign in early August 2016, it raised no flags, despite its slightly awkward attempts at colloquial American English.It was one of thousands of inquiries about getting involved \u2014 in this case asking for the campaign\u2019s support in planning \u201ca YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town\u201d \u2014 that were fielded by an overextended staff that was mostly new to presidential politics.The campaign employee who oversaw the Facebook account took more than two weeks to get back to Mr. Skiber, according to private Facebook messages obtained by The New York Times. The employee, who did not want to be remembered as the victim of a Russian plot and asked for anonymity, thanked Mr. Skiber for his enthusiasm and creativity and recommended that he contact Chad Tucker, the Florida communications director, at his campaign email address. Adding a thumbs-up and American flag emojis, the employee told Mr. Skiber, \u201cWe can win this!\u201dA review of the private Facebook messages, as well as interviews with the Trump campaign operatives who were targeted by Russians, reveal that Mr. Trump\u2019s team was susceptible to Moscow\u2019s interference campaign. It preyed on unsuspecting staff members who were more interested in capturing the enthusiasm of supporters of their unorthodox nominee and did not envision the seemingly far-fetched possibility that Russians might enlist them as unwitting players in a scheme to undermine American democracy.\u201cNobody reasonably would have asked \u2014 or even thought to ask \u2014 \u2018Are you sure you\u2019re not with Russia?\u2019\u201d said Karen Giorno, a Republican operative who was the Florida state director for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign at the time it was contacted by the Internet Research Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something that normally you would think you have to watch out for.\u201dThe Trump campaign\u2019s operation in Florida, as in many key states, was thinly staffed, inexperienced and often overwhelmed by the demands of a white-hot presidential race. Any procedures for vetting and verifying people or groups who sought to get involved were not widely shared by campaign staff members. And they were generally not on the lookout for infiltration efforts by anyone, let alone by Russians who had gone to great lengths to create false identities.The informal setup and small staff was typical of the on-the-ground operations of most statewide or presidential campaigns, which tend to be chaotic hives of activity where offers of volunteer assistance are usually welcomed with little scrutiny.\u201cI would have been more concerned with whether or not the opposition would try to infiltrate our campaign,\u201d Ms. Giorno said, \u201cor whether someone who was trying to represent the campaign had a criminal record, or had the right character or background.\u201dMs. Giorno said she was not involved in running the Facebook account and was \u201cshocked\u201d by the revelations in the indictment that someone on her staff had unknowingly opened the door for the Russians.But, she added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you stop that. Anybody can put up a fake profile on anyone.\u201dThe Trump re-election campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cOut of respect for the special counsel, we are not going to comment.\u201dThe employee who oversaw the Facebook account had wide latitude and focused primarily on policing for offensive content on the public-facing portion of the page, while also trying to respond to everyone who privately expressed an interest in boosting Mr. Trump.Using the information provided by the employee, the Russians at the Internet Research Agency emailed Mr. Tucker, the campaign\u2019s Florida communications director, from an account set up under another alias, Josh Milton, court documents show. The Russians presented the Milton persona as the \u201cteam leader\u201d of a pro-Trump social media group called Being Patriotic, according to a Facebook message.Being Patriotic had planned rallies in 13 \u201cconfirmed locations\u201d in Florida and asked the campaign for help at each one, the Russians using the Josh Milton email address wrote to Mr. Tucker, according to the indictment.Days later, on the recommendation of the campaign employee operating the Florida Facebook account, the Russians contacted another campaign staff member, Beatriz J. Ramos, who served as the coalitions director for the Trump campaign in Florida, according to the indictment, which does not identify either Mr. Tucker or Ms. Ramos by name.Mr. Tucker and Ms. Ramos said that they received a high volume of messages during the campaign, and had no recollection of receiving, let alone responding to, the messages. Both said they could not recall any messages that prompted suspicions about Russian outreach, though they acknowledged they were not attuned to that possibility, either.\u201cNo one was talking about the Russians back then, so it\u2019s not like something that anyone was looking out for,\u201d said Mr. Tucker, adding that his job did not include vetting volunteers or communicating with people who wanted to set up rallies. He worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition after the election and is now a telecommunications official based in South Carolina.Ms. Ramos and Mr. Tucker said they could not check their campaign email accounts because they no longer had access to them. The messages sent by the Russians via Facebook are no longer accessible from the Trump campaign\u2019s Florida account, the employee said, because the Matt Skiber account from which they were sent was deactivated.According to the indictment, the Russians deleted social media accounts and emails \u201cin order to avoid detection and impede investigation\u201d once it became apparent that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team was working with Facebook and other social media companies to investigate Russian interference. Mr. Mueller\u2019s team did collect at least some of the Facebook messages and emails sent to the Trump campaign officials in Florida.The dates of the Facebook messages obtained by The Times roughly correspond to those referenced in the indictment.Mr. Tucker, Ms. Giorno, Ms. Ramos and the employee who sent the Facebook messages said they had not been contacted by the special counsel.\u201cWe were never notified or aware of any Russian efforts to interfere in the election by the F.B.I. or any other agency,\u201d Ms. Giorno said. \u201cAs someone who worked very closely with then-candidate Trump, I can tell you that security and integrity of the process was paramount to him and his senior staff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nell Scovell Speaks Truth to the Funny Men in Power", "Date": "2018-03-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyLOS ANGELES \u2014 Early in her career, the comedy writer Nell Scovell sold her first script, an episode of the meta-sitcom \u201cIt\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show,\u201d and then met its star for feedback.\u201cYou write like a guy,\u201d Mr. Shandling told her. She was thrilled.\u201cAt the time, that was the nicest thing you could say to me,\u201d she said wryly last month, perched on her couch near a window in her airy, modern apartment in the Brentwood neighborhood here. Even though she later felt uneasy about the remark, she said, at the same time, getting that kind of validation from one of her favorite comics was an invaluable boost.Her writing has a punchy forcefulness, peppering stories with irreverent punch lines and juicy gossip. But in person, she can be more cautious. Despite being a sharp critic of Hollywood, her memoir positions her firmly as a member of it. After attending Harvard and working at Spy magazine, she wrote television scripts and speeches, crafting jokes for everyone from Barack Obama when he was president to Henry Kissinger. \u201cWith that accent,\u201d she said of the former secretary of state, \u201ceverything is funny.\u201dShe started examining the numbers, and while she knew female writers were scarce on Mr. Letterman\u2019s shows, she was surprised to find that she was one of only seven women in 27 years. Her essay described the office as a \u201chostile work environment,\u201d but that was really a jumping-off point to a more prescriptive argument rooted in the stark numbers stacked against women in late night. She contended that shows needed to look beyond their networks of people to make change.Ms. Scovell heard from many female writers who read the essay and had stories to tell. She started reaching out, encouraging others to apply for jobs. Then she played matchmaker by contacting executives and head writers. \u201cI tried public shaming,\u201d she said, adding that not much changed apart from a few hires. \u201cSo I decided to play the inside game.\u201dWhen Jimmy Kimmel took over the 11:30 p.m. time slot on ABC, she wrote a letter to Anne Sweeney, president of the ABC Television Group at the time, about the need for more women in late night, attaching a copy of her Vanity Fair piece. As she recounts in her book, two days later she received a message from Molly McNearney, the head writer for the show (and now Mr. Kimmel\u2019s wife). Ms. Scovell passed along the names of two writers (Bess Kalb, Joelle Boucai), who were hired.She also suggested female writers to Tim Carvell, a longtime friend who was head writer at \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and became the executive producer of \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d the John Oliver program where the original writing staff included two women (Jill Twiss, Juli Weiner) referred by Ms. Scovell. \u201cShe made a project of suggesting women when there was an opening for jobs, and has a great eye for talent,\u201d Mr. Carvell said, describing her as a singular figure in late night. \u201cEvery time someone is staffing up, I tell them to talk to Nell.\u201dSince her essay was published, the issue of representation has become much more widely discussed, but Ms. Scovell said of the talk of change resulting from #MeToo: \u201cI have a very pessimistic take. I think women are speaking up because we have nothing left to lose.\u201dShe added that if the David Letterman scandal broke today, she didn\u2019t think it would unfold any differently. When asked if she thought he should have been fired, she paused, considering the question as her cheerful demeanor became slightly more reserved, even wary, before saying she didn\u2019t know. \u201cI want to be very clear,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not the sex police.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Scovell wrote jokes for Mr. Letterman when he performed at the Kennedy Center Honors, and she took the opportunity to ask him about her essay and female writers. He brushed it off, saying he never read the article. She sent him a copy of \u201cLean In\u201d in Finnish and when he responded with a joke, she thought it was hilarious.\u201cIn TV, you look to make characters consistent, but in real life, we\u2019re not consistent,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re brave and sometimes we\u2019re not. Sometimes we\u2019re very aggressive and sometimes we back right down.\u201dMore women in show business are telling their stories now, but that doesn\u2019t mean the climate has radically shifted. \u201cThe first Emmys I went to was in 1990 when the five nominees for best comedy were \u2018Designing Women,\u2019 \u2018Golden Girls,\u2019 \u2018Murphy Brown,\u2019 \u2018Cheers,\u2019 \u2018Wonder Years,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThree and a half were created by women. That hasn\u2019t happened since. The numbers go up and down. My sense is they\u2019re inching up but I\u2019ll be happy when I see three shows out of five nominated again.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the event at which David Letterman used jokes written by Nell Scovell. It was the Kennedy Center Honors in 2014, not the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Key Question in Pulse Trial for Orlando Gunman\u2019s Wife: How Much Did She Know?", "Date": "2018-03-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO \u2014 Moments before Omar Mateen unleashed bloody terror inside the Pulse nightclub in June 2016, he purchased a ticket to the club\u2019s popular Latin dance night, a federal prosecutor told jurors here on Wednesday, painting a chilling picture of a gunman preparing to carry out a massacre.\u201cPeople were just dancing, enjoying their lives and talking, and Omar Mateen was standing there, looking at all of his future victims,\u201d James D. Mandolfo, an assistant United States attorney, told the rapt courtroom. \u201cThey had no cover. They had no defense. They had no idea about the horrible events that would unfold.\u201dProsecutors portrayed Ms. Salman as a calculating partner who joined Mr. Mateen on trips to scout possible targets and who fabricated a cover story for him on the night of the shooting. They have charged her with aiding and abetting Mr. Mateen and with lying to the F.B.I.; if convicted, she could face life in prison.\u201cMembers of the jury, Omar Mateen was a monster,\u201d Linda Moreno, one of Ms. Salman\u2019s defense lawyers, said in her opening statement, which followed Mr. Mandolfo\u2019s. \u201cBut Noor Salman is a mother, not a monster. Her only sin is that she married a monster.\u201dA small group of Pulse victims and their families filed into Judge Paul G. Byron\u2019s courtroom on Wednesday. Several women wiped away tears during Mr. Mandolfo\u2019s retelling of the shooting. He spoke about Bobby Rodriguez, a clubgoer who survived the massacre by playing dead in a bathroom stall for three hours, just a few feet away from Mr. Mateen, who had holed up in the bathroom. Ms. Rodriguez later took the witness stand and described the horror of hearing people try to flee, only to be shot dead.Ms. Salman appeared emotional during the opening statement by Ms. Moreno, her lawyer. Ms. Moreno spoke of Ms. Salman\u2019s love for her son, who was 3 at the time of the shooting. Wearing her hair in a long ponytail and looking older and more weary than she did in the Facebook photograph published widely after her arrest, Ms. Salman dabbed her eyes with a tissue as her lawyer spoke. Later in the day, she turned around and blew a kiss at her relatives sitting in the second row.Jury selection for the trial took more than a week, and concluded on Monday. Eighteen jurors \u2014 12 women and six men \u2014 sat in the courtroom on Wednesday. Six of them are alternates who will not take part in deliberations unless they are needed to replace excused jurors, but none of the 18 will be told which of them are alternates until the trial concludes.With warnings beforehand to the victims and their families in the courtroom, prosecutors played graphic videos from police body cameras, capturing Mr. Mateen\u2019s gunfire and the screams of the wounded.Adam Gruler, an off-duty police officer who was working as a guard at Pulse the night of the shooting, was choked with emotion on the witness stand as he recalled victims trying to flee the carnage. Nelson Rodriguez, a nightclub patron who lost two friends in the rampage, had to compose himself several times before he could finish his account of a frantic escape.Prosecutors said Ms. Salman had participated in Mr. Mateen\u2019s preparations for the attack, including making financial arrangements intended to provide for her and her son after his death. They cited location data from cars and cellphones showing that the couple drove to City Place, a shopping mall in West Palm Beach, and to Disney Springs in Orlando.\u201cThe defendant and Omar Mateen were casing targets in the middle of the night with their child,\u201d Mr. Mandolfo said.Ms. Moreno countered that those were just family trips for Ms. Salman.Crucial to the outcome of the trial will be what jurors make of statements that Ms. Salman gave to the F.B.I. on the day of the attack. While the shooting was still underway, law enforcement officers went to the family\u2019s apartment in Fort Pierce, Fla., at about 4:30 a.m. and found her asleep there. She was taken to a local F.B.I. headquarters and remained with agents, speaking without an attorney, until midnight.During that time, Ms. Salman gave statements that agents said were inconsistent. She also signed written statements appearing to acknowledge that she was aware of what Mr. Mateen had planned, and saying that she was sorry.\u201cThe evidence was able to corroborate almost all of her admissions,\u201d Mr. Mandolfo said.But investigators were unable to back up Ms. Salman\u2019s supposed admission at the time that she and Mr. Mateen had driven by Pulse and had identified the nightclub as a possible target. GPS data never placed them at Pulse.Ms. Moreno said the agents had decided Ms. Salman was guilty before they had any evidence against her, and \u201cwere able to manipulate and coerce her.\u201d She repeatedly called attention to the fact that agents had not recorded their conversations with Ms. Salman: \u201cNo video or audio, even though they were at the F.B.I. headquarters.\u201dOn the night of the shooting, Mr. Mateen first went to Disney Springs, where he had been a few days earlier with his wife. He went into the local House of Blues club and bought a T-shirt, Mr. Mandolfo said, but apparently was deterred by a heavy police presence from mounting any attack there. Mr. Mateen then got back in his rented van, the prosecutor said, and used Google to search for nightclubs in downtown Orlando. The first one that came up was named Eve. The second was Pulse.Ms. Moreno said that sequence of events contradicted the prosecution\u2019s charges. \u201cOmar Mateen didn\u2019t know where he was going that night,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if he didn\u2019t know, how would his wife know?\u201dEarlier in the evening, Ms. Salman had sent Mr. Mateen a text message telling him that if his mother asked about his whereabouts, she would tell her he was out with a friend, identified only as Nemo. Prosecutors said that was a cover story Ms. Salman fabricated to avert suspicion.The defense countered that Nemo, who lived in Maryland, told the F.B.I. that he was frequently Mr. Mateen\u2019s own cover to cheat on his wife. According to Ms. Moreno, Mr. Mateen liked to date older women and frequented online dating sites.Later on the night of the attack, Ms. Salman texted Mr. Mateen to ask where he was; he did not respond. She tried again after a time, reminding Mr. Mateen he had work the next day, according to the defense.This time Mr. Mateen responded, asking if she had heard what had happened. She asked what he was talking about.\u201cI love you babe,\u201d he wrote.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}

Looking around the room I was struck by the eclectic mix of people, a reflection of Jiva\u2019s history as well as Australia\u2019s. For one thing, a lot of us had been refugees from civil wars who resettled here, back in the days when the country\u2019s refugee policy was not so hard-line: Iraq, Bosnia, Sri Lanka \u2014 where Jiva and his family hailed from \u2014 and Vietnam, in my family\u2019s case.

{"Headline": "Acrimony F.C.: M.L.S. Teams and Fan Groups Navigate a Rocky Marriage", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor more than two decades, Major League Soccer and its most ardent fans have had a unique, if sometimes uneasy, relationship.Using quick-cut video montages filled with colored smoke, swirling flags and scarves held aloft, M.L.S. has long trumpeted its passionate supporter culture as evidence of its health and long-term viability \u2014 proof that the match-day spectacle of M.L.S., if not the standard of play, now rivals some of the most prominent leagues in the world.But still the fans turn up. No story of a new M.L.S. franchise is complete without a breathless account of season tickets sold and stories of paradigm-shifting instant fan bases. No recent season has ended without a news release boasting of a record for attendance, with crowds of more than 50,000 in Seattle soon overtaken by attendances of 70,000-plus in Atlanta.The fans generally love the attention. The league loves the validation.And in New Jersey, the Red Bulls in January took the extraordinary step of revoking official recognition of one of their oldest supporters groups, the Garden State Ultras. The Red Bulls said the decision \u2014 the G.S.U. claimed it was a first for the league \u2014 followed repeated disciplinary infractions, culminating in an episode on the last day of the 2017 season in which the team said a G.S.U. member dropped a flare into the family section of a rival team\u2019s stadium.Yet the relationships between teams and their supporters have always had a certain tension built into them. The supporters groups of the original M.L.S. teams in particular \u2014 a group that includes Columbus, D.C. United and the Red Bulls team originally known as the MetroStars \u2014 are proud of their independent histories.As the league plants its flag in new markets \u2014 a 23rd franchise, Los Angeles F.C., will join M.L.S. this season, and expansion teams in Nashville and Miami were recently approved \u2014 many of the oldest groups see themselves as the true keepers of the institutional memories of their teams, and even of the league itself.The message to Precourt and the league was clear: Columbus fans would not abandon the decades of cultural capital they had expended without a fight.\u201cIt\u2019s the basis of my longest standing friendships in this country,\u201d Graham Randall, an English expatriate member of the Crew Union supporters group, said of his relationship with the team. \u201cNow I see it through the eyes of my 11-year-old son. The news that the team might not be here at some point made me realize I would lose a huge thread in my life in the last 13 years.\u201dSince the missteps of the league\u2019s early days, when M.L.S. acquired a reputation for gimmickry that it struggled to shake, the emergence of a genuine independent supporters culture has been viewed as a necessary step toward credibility, and it remains vital to the league\u2019s vision of itself. But managing the dance between \u201corganic\u201d support and a strong league office can be delicate.\u201cThe supporters groups are really smart and creative \u2014 I mean, you see the work that goes into the giant tifo displays alone \u2014 and they have smart leaders who communicate really well with the clubs and basically police themselves,\u201d said Mark Abbott, the league\u2019s deputy commissioner. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do much, though we do set down guidelines for acceptable behavior.\u201dYet that desire for authenticity and passion often yields only symbolic displays of these qualities. It is one thing for fans to emulate a banner style imported from Italy, or the capo-led nonstop singing of South America, or the pop-parody chants of English soccer. But any organized fan groups that might actually feel and act on any of the enmity toward their rivals swiftly comes up against the realities of how the American sporting experience is managed and policed.And it doesn\u2019t help that even notionally unified fan sections can end up Balkanized. The Garden State Ultras, for example, were one of three main Red Bulls supporters groups housed in what is known as the South Ward at the team\u2019s stadium, Red Bull Arena. Yet collective sympathy for the G.S.U.\u2019s loss of its official status was tempered by the differing flavors of support that make the adjacent Empire Supporters Club and Viking Army as much rivals for attention as natural allies.Still, where there is a point of agreement among league, teams and fans, it is that there is little desire for fan groups to emulate the worst types of hooliganism seen in other parts of the world. If anything, today\u2019s M.L.S. fan groups emphasize a positivity that would look gauche to some of the groups they notionally emulate: charity fund-raisers, clothing drives and events supporting social issues from anti-racism initiatives to gay rights.Corey Furlan, one of the Sons of Ben founders, said of the apparent paradox: \u201cLook, we\u2019re Philadelphia sports fans \u2014 loud, obnoxious, whatever \u2014 but the type of people who care deeply about our team also give their energy, care and passion in other aspects of their life. We didn\u2019t just want to drop into Chester for 17 home games a year. We wanted to put down roots.\u201cI mean, players and coaches come and go, but we\u2019re the people who are going to be here forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Gilberte Levy, who can trace her family tree here back to the 1600s, will also cook some of the kosher recipes that Proven\u00e7al Jews have been making for centuries.Haroseth, the fruit paste that evokes the bricks and mortar used by Jewish slaves in the Passover narrative of the Old Testament, is part of every Seder ritual. Her 13th-century recipe includes dried apricots, figs, raisins and chestnuts, reflecting the sunny climate of this Mediterranean region. And a traditional whole veal breast stuffed with Swiss chard will be the centerpiece of her table.Because there is no longer a shochet, a kosher butcher, in Carpentras, Ms. Levy must order the meat from Marseille, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) away. \u201cOnce, the community\u2019s shochet slaughtered chickens, lamb, and goats right inside the synagogue building,\u201d she said.Carpentras became a center of Jewish life after 1306, one of many occasions on which Jews were expelled from the Kingdom of France. Like other nearby sanctuaries such as Avignon and Cavaillon, Carpentras was not in France, but within the Comtat Venaissin, a papal state, where Pope John XXII decreed that refugees would be welcome. With more than 1,000 Jews among its population of about 10,000, Carpentras became known as \u201cla petite Jerusalem,\u201d with a large ghetto arising around its famous synagogue.The ghetto had kosher butchers and grocers, and for cooking, the residents shared two communal ovens at the synagogue: one used year-round for bread, and the other for Passover matzos.For more than 300 years, by papal decree, the ghetto was locked at night to protect the residents, and unlocked each morning to allow them to shop, travel and work under strictly limited conditions.In some periods, \u201cJewish men living in the carriero could only be horse traders, secondhand clothing and furniture dealers, or tailors,\u201d said Ms. Levy, using the term for ghetto in Shuadit, a Hebrew-French-Proven\u00e7al dialect that is almost extinct. Jewish men and women alike had to wear a yellow item of clothing when outside the ghetto, to denote their difference.In 1791, when French Jews were finally granted citizenship, most Jews still living in Carpentras moved to cities, including nearby Avignon and Marseille. But not Ms. Levy\u2019s ancestors. Many have served the synagogue as its rabbi; she continues the tradition as a historian and volunteer.Her great-grandmother No\u00e9mie Cohen B\u00e9daride \u201cwas one of the last to bake coudoles in the synagogue\u2019s oven,\u201d Ms. Levy said, using the Shuadit word for matzo.The community was decimated by influenza in 1918, and then again in World War II. Ms. Levy\u2019s grandparents survived, hidden from the Nazis in the nearby village of B\u00e9doin, where they were protected by the mayor, local Communists and members of the Resistance.Dr. Meyer Benzekrit, the synagogue\u2019s current president, believes that the ancient synagogue of Carpentras will once again become the heart of a vital Jewish community. Behind and beneath its unassuming exterior are a perfectly preserved Baroque interior, the original ritual bath with fresh water from an underground stream, a slaughterhouse and the bread ovens. All are being excavated and renovated.Most traditional foods of the Proven\u00e7al Jews have been forgotten, but a few live on. Some old-time bakeries here sell brassados, bagel-like rolls that are boiled and then baked. Lightly sweet and sometimes spiked with anise, orange flower water or orange peel, they were adopted by Christian bakers as a Lenten and Easter tradition. Ms. Levy makes her own crunchy brassados with matzo meal.To start her Seder meal, Ms. Levy serves chicken soup with a mashed hard-boiled egg and crushed matzo. Then, the veal with its stuffing of chard, a vegetable that is in constant use in Provence. She sees her family\u2019s cuisine as part of French culinary tradition, not different or separate from it.In this tiny enclave, she said, it has always been understood that Jewish dishes were simply adapted from the local food, according to the laws of kashrut.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to prove anything or hide anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why Carpentras feels like home.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A majority of their found photos were taken by, and mostly of, white middle-class Americans \u2014 more so than in Europe or elsewhere, although Japan and the United Kingdom are relatively well-represented. Mr. Schulman and Ms. Halkin intend eventually to search more regional web platforms, to broaden the locus of the archives.\u201cSometimes we have a back story that\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mr. Schulman said. He recalled one woman, who salvaged a box of slides left unclaimed when her neighbor died, sent them to the Anonymous Project with a detailed letter remembering the life of this man who had lived next door to her. Time, loss and change lend a mournful touch to the Anonymous Project, since the subjects are unknown and many of them are most likely long dead. But there is also a sense of honor and joy in reviving these moments for contemporary viewers, offering a personal portal that transforms the lives of strangers into timeless archetypes of human kinship. \u201cMemories are what make us human more than anything else in life,\u201d Mr. Schulman said. \u201cThe way we talk about memory, that\u2019s our human DNA.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "20 Years After the Shooting on the Playground", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionWhen I was 12 years old I went to five funerals in one week. My classmates and I sat clutching one another on crowded church pews listening to Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d wearing thick white ribbons on our chests like scarlet A\u2019s. We were thrust into a small and terrible \u201csurvivors club.\u201dThe Westside Middle School shooting is often forgotten, not because it happened 20 years ago, but because it happened so many shootings ago. Before terms like \u201cmass shooting\u201d and \u201cactive shooter\u201d entered our common vernacular, one of my classmates stole into our rural middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., right after lunch. He pulled the fire alarm, sending the rest of us out onto the playground, where he and another heavily armed classmate fired on us from the nearby woods. My best friend, Paige Herring, was killed that day along with three other girls and our beloved sixth-grade English teacher. Ten other people were injured.I\u2019ve had a lot of practice over the years trying to tell that story as quickly as possible, to jog people\u2019s memories with the buzzwords. Not many people outside of our little community remember Westside. \u201cWhich shooting was yours?\u201d people ask.The shooting at Westside was 13 months before Columbine. At the time, it was an anomaly and seemed to jolt the entire country. America mourned with us \u2014 buckets of flowers, handmade cards and books on grief poured in, making us feel less alone.The ritual is now familiar, and I see it in the outpouring of support for the students from Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed last month. The list of the unthinkable \u2014 kids shot at school \u2014 has gotten so much longer since 1998. Every time another shooting occurs, I enter a near-catatonic state. It\u2019s almost impossible to talk about with anyone who hasn\u2019t experienced one, though. How do you bring that up on a third date after the shooting at Pulse or with your cubicle mate after the massacre at Newtown?There\u2019s one group who understands all of this: my classmates from the playground, my fellow survivors. We call ourselves the Westside Warriors. It\u2019s with them, on our class Facebook page, that I feel least alone when new tragedies occur and where I can visit Paige in vivid color just as she was. I imagine that most alumni pages are saved for hilarious pictures of bad hair and weird jeans or used to swap stories about how crazy 10th-grade homecoming was. We don\u2019t share stories like that. We share pictures of the classmates we lost. We talk about how hard it is to turn off the TV after the newest deadly event. We communicate to keep the memorial garden, our old school playground, manicured. We collect condolence gifts to send to the newest victims as if we\u2019re the ambassadors of grief. It\u2019s what was done for us. Most important, the Facebook page is our refuge every March.This March 24 will mark the 20th anniversary of the shooting at Westside Middle School. It\u2019s also the chosen date of the March for Our Lives rally, part of the movement led by students to do something about gun violence.I had already been dreading this March. Not only was I to mourn the 20th anniversary of our shooting, but also the Las Vegas shooting, from last fall, and Sutherland Springs, Tex., immediately following, in November \u2014 the sadness of each shooting attached itself to my own. The Facebook page had been steadfast, though, there for anniversaries, other shootings or just the down days, and we members help each other get through. I imagined on the 20th anniversary that we would come together and indulge in our grief as always. We would post and text and email and call, carrying the torch for our sweet, sad, little day.Then 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.So, this March 24 \u2014 20 years after the shooting on our playground \u2014 will no longer be about just us. My immediate reaction to hearing about the March for Our Lives was anger and indignation, because now Paige\u2019s memory would be one mixed in with so many.I called a friend from the playground, and we talked it through and agreed to march. And it felt good to have something to do on that terrible day, a day when it\u2019s normally hard to even get out of bed. We now had a plan. We would be together in Washington, standing on our grown-up feet and remembering Westside while walking for everyone who\u2019s experienced this. And I thought the Warriors would agree; I thought that would be the clear consensus.That\u2019s why my breath was taken away by a post to the Facebook group that denounced the march entirely. Some members were upset that the day was being taken from us, but many were even more upset about the agenda of the event. They thought it was purposely planned to drive a political point home, one that they did not agree with.People posted that the organizers were \u201cagainst all guns,\u201d that they chose \u201cour day of remembrance\u201d for their political agenda. People talked about arming teachers, increasing security, running \u201clockdown drills.\u201dI understand that some people make an argument for preparedness over prevention, but it is an argument that I can\u2019t accept. If my classmates think back to 1998, I imagine they\u2019ll remember our teachers were white as sheets and frozen with fear. I personally had to shove a grown woman aside in order to dial 911 because she was in understandable shock. One teacher was able to pull a student to cover and safety, but that was the most she could do. She couldn\u2019t have fought off our attackers and I don\u2019t think it would have been right to ask her to. No person knows how he or she would react in a time like that, so the idea of arming teachers lends itself to a false sense of security.Beyond my lack of confidence in the practicality of arming teachers as a solution, the discussion made me incredibly sad. It meant we accept this as our new norm. Westside was the beginning of an epidemic. It was jarring to find a group of survivors \u2014 my former classmates \u2014 as divided as our country. It felt like they were responding with jaded, grown-up brains instead of the honest, childhood hearts we had when we were younger.I cannot accept that more guns will solve the issue of more shootings. Some of my classmates wrote that they \u201cdon\u2019t want to be lumped into the gun debate,\u201d but you cannot talk about a shooting without talking about guns.They send journals to the newest survivors, encouraging them to write their feelings and begin their healing. But this is a generation that has grown up with many platforms to voice their opinions, and they\u2019re not satisfied with hiding their thoughts in a journal tucked away on a shelf. Standing up, speaking out and marching may be part of their therapy. One of the comments to our Facebook thread read: \u201cIt\u2019s just all different than ours was. These people have a serious agenda: to get rid of guns.\u201d That\u2019s true. It is different than ours. These victims are helping themselves by fighting for common-sense gun laws to save the future.Each March 24 is harder for me than the last because, as an adult, I\u2019m able to better define how horrific the shooting really was. In less than 10 minutes on that playground, my classmates and I gained a deeper understanding of evil and fear than most people experience in their entire lives. I can\u2019t trade the Warriors for a group that agrees with me, but I can march this weekend in Washington to ensure that in 20 years Emma Gonz\u00e1lez won\u2019t be writing to remind you of her story and her friends. She\u2019ll be writing to commemorate the day we stood up and said never again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Come for the Values, Stay (or Leave) for the Vintage", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolHere at Wine School, we are nothing if not flexible. A case in point is the three bottles of Bordeaux we have been drinking over the last month.The plan was to use these three wines to talk about the array of good values that can be found in Bordeaux if you seek them out. This is just about always a worthy, counterintuitive subject, as Bordeaux\u2019s reputation is that of a luxury world in which the prices and the egos are both vastly inflated.So why are we even drinking these wines?Because it is important to understand both how to interpret vintage assessments and what Bordeaux tastes like in a difficult year like 2013. Moreover, wines from good producers are fascinating to try in every sort of vintage, simply to taste how the conditions are expressed and how wines can sometimes transcend them.The three bottles I recommended were: Ch\u00e2teau Aney Haut-M\u00e9doc 2013, Ch\u00e2teau Moulin de Tricot Haut-M\u00e9doc 2013 and Ch\u00e2teau le Puy Emilien Francs C\u00f4te de Bordeaux 2013.The two Haut-M\u00e9docs are from the so-called Left Bank, the region to the west of the Garonne River encompassing the M\u00e9doc north of the city of Bordeaux and Graves to the south. The Emilien is from Francs C\u00f4te de Bordeaux on the Right Bank, the area north and east of the Dordogne River.\u201cWhy did you pick two Left Banks and one Right Bank?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeems like we would be comparing apples to oranges.\u201dWell, sort of. Except in this case we were talking about the larger entity of Bordeaux rather than the specific terroir of one appellation within that region. In addition, I\u2019m thrilled that so many readers take the challenge of buying three bottles and comparing them. That adds another dimension to Wine School. But I don\u2019t expect all readers to do that, and it is not necessary. All you need is one of the bottles to participate.Now, many readers drank wines from other vintages, and found enjoyable wines, bearing out the original intent of the selections. But even those who drank the 2013s found some pleasure in the wines.For me, the 2013s recalled Bordeaux I drank in the 1980s, resolutely dry, with flavors more herbal than fruity. Consumer tastes have evolved over the last 30 years, and many people would describe these wines as lean and weedy. Napa Valley, known for the opulent fruitiness of its wines, would fall to its knees and beg forgiveness if it produced bottles like these. But honestly, these wines are a lot easier to drink with food today than many highly praised Napa bottles.The key element here is \u201cwith food.\u201d I believe that wine is at its best as part of the synergy of food, wine and conversation, even if the conversation is simply an internal dialogue. And that, to me, is how these 2013s need to be enjoyed.Without food, they were tart and somewhat cedary. More modern styles of Bordeaux, which you would see in vintages like 2012 or 2015, are rounder, fruitier and easier-going. You can enjoy a glass on its own, even though it would still improve with food. For me, the 2013s came alive with braised pork shoulder, fulfilling the bottom-line requirement of a wine, as is generally the case with classic Bordeaux, of simply being a good, fresh drink.The Moulin de Tricot was herbal, straightforward and refreshing. The Aney seemed a bit riper and smoother, though also compact and refreshing. The le Puy had almost a menthol edge to its aroma. It seemed a trifle richer than the Haut-M\u00e9docs, and a little more tannic. It was pure and also refreshing.None of these bottles really have the potential to age. They lack structure, and the tart flavors will not evolve in particularly attractive ways. Yet these wines have their uses. They are ready to drink now, and if they are on a restaurant wine list, a 2013 might be preferable to a wine from a better vintage that is not yet ready to drink. But I would not want to pay a lot of money for them.Regardless of the particulars of these \u201913s, the question comes up: What priority should consumers place on vintages?In my experience, when thinking about vintages, too much emphasis is placed on those years that critics have deemed great. These years often require many years of aging before they can be pleasurable.Meanwhile, years that may not conform to certain definitions of great may still offer great pleasures, while being cheaper and ready to drink far sooner.I could go on and on with that sort of thing. But that does not mean the critics were wrong about the 2013 Bordeaux. Those wines are certainly drinkable, but if you have an opportunity, compare them with the 2014s, which, to my mind, is an absolutely delicious vintage. The \u201914s will offer far more pleasure, more nuance and complexity, and will evolve beautifully. Nonetheless, the critics prefer the 2015s, which are richer and rounder.\u201cBefore food, it was no one\u2019s favorite,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt only shone \u2014 or let\u2019s say \u2018glowed\u2019 \u2014 with the lamb, where its weight lent balance and dignity.\u201dSuch differences of opinion are exactly why educated wine consumers need to go beyond critics to drink for themselves. Only by calibrating a sense of their own tastes can people develop a sense of whom to pay attention to and whom to ignore. The voice in your own head knows best.Advertisement"}

Others told of being made to do domestic work at a manager\u2019s house.Seven former employees have now begun legal action against the charity, seeking 3.6 million pounds, or about $5 million, in damages, according to a spokesman for ONE.On Sunday, the spokesman, Ian Koski, confirmed in emails and a phone call that the organization had received notification of an intent to file. Bono was not named in the filing.The accusations were revealed in November 2017 when a former ONE employee from the Johannesburg office, Idriss Ali Nassah, referred on Twitter to the abuse accusations against the powerful Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and told of problems at the charity.According to Mr. Koski, the organization, whose previous chief executive died in 2016, got wind of the brewing scandal when other employees began sharing their experiences on social media. The charity then opened an investigation.\u201cThe investigation yielded evidence of unprofessional conduct and, in particular, what I would characterize as bullying and belittling of staff between late 2011 and 2015 in our Johannesburg office,\u201d the statement said.Ms. Smith said that staff members were \u201ccalled names\u201d and confirmed that some had accused a manager of demanding that they carry out domestic tasks at her home. In addition, she said, the group found out that its African branch had been operating as a \u201cnonresident taxpayer\u201d from 2010 to 2015 and had not been paying taxes.Ms. Smith said that the organization could not confirm the accusation of attempted sexual coercion and retaliation, which the statement described as \u201cappalling claims.\u201d However, she added, \u201cWe do not discount any allegation \u2014 we investigate them and will continue to do so should others arise.\u201dThe statement said the inquiry had concluded that \u201cthe situation was not adequately addressed nor resolved by executive management at the time.\u201dMs. Smith, who joined the company in 2017, has apologized to all 14 employees who came forward with complaints, Mr. Koski said. Seven of them say they intend to sue, he said, including Mr. Nassah, who posted the first message on Twitter.ONE, which Bono helped found in 2004, has nine million volunteers and staff members around the world: in Abuja, Nigeria; Berlin; Brussels; Johannesburg; London; New York; Ottawa; Paris; and Washington, where the charity has its headquarters.The charity does not depend on government financing, raising funds through corporations and individuals. It advocates government action on causes like battling tuberculosis and malaria.The charity has a global operating budget of $35 million. Former Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain; Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer; and Aliko Dangote, Nigeria\u2019s wealthiest person, are among the prominent figures on its board.Bono said he had been aware of \u201cconcerns about low morale and poor management in this office but nothing along the lines of what emerged recently.\u201d\u201cThe poorest people in the poorest places being bullied by their circumstance is the reason we set up ONE,\u201d he added. \u201cSo to discover last November that there were serious and multiple allegations of bullying in our office in Johannesburg left me and the ONE board reeling and furious. You question the whole reason you\u2019re doing this.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe head office failed to protect those employees and I need to take some responsibility for that. In fact, if they would agree, I would like to meet them and apologize in person.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the South African city of Johannesburg.

It is so powerful it is like a country.\u201dSome lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users.\u201cThe sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere is no excuse for delay.\u201dCambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law.The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals.The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201coperational\u201d roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns.Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate \u201cknowing and willful\u201d violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules.\u201cIt defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause\u2019s vice president for policy and litigation.In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company\u2019s privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform.The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users\u2019 browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook \u201clike\u201d button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit.Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica\u2019s use of Facebook user information.While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years.The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.Nicholas Confessore and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Goes to Hollywood. Will Its Story Have a Happy Ending?", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKnown for its bold designs and its big marketing campaigns, Apple relishes its status as a dominant force in the corporate world. So it was noteworthy when one of its executives, Eddy Cue, struck a note of humility during a discussion this month at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Tex.\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about making television,\u201d said Mr. Cue, a senior vice president who oversees the team in charge of the company\u2019s original programming initiative. \u201cSo what skills does Apple bring to that? And the viewpoint is: very little. There\u2019s other things we bring. We know how to create apps, we know how to do distribution, we know how to market. But we don\u2019t really know how to create shows.\u201dAs Mr. Cue\u2019s words suggested, Apple\u2019s new venture has taken the company far from its Silicon Valley comfort zone and thrust it into alien territory: Hollywood.Apple\u2019s plans to make itself into a big player in the entertainment industry are now coming into focus. In recent months, the company has outspent Facebook and YouTube \u2014 two other tech companies that have also taken steps into original programming \u2014 as well as the traditional TV studios. In a few cases, it has also beaten Netflix in bidding wars.Since October, Apple has made deals for 12 projects, nine of them \u201cstraight-to-series\u201d orders \u2014 an aggressive method of creating new programming that skips the pilot-episode stage.Apple\u2019s Hollywood prospects seemed dim as recently as last June, when it rolled out its first original series, a reality show called \u201cPlanet of the Apps.\u201d Although it had some big names attached \u2014 including Gwyneth Paltrow and the former NBC Entertainment co-chairman Ben Silverman \u2014 the show was largely perceived as a dud.The two executives moved quickly to build Apple Worldwide Video from the ground up, expanding its staff to roughly 40 people and opening divisions for adult dramas, children\u2019s shows and Latin American and European programming. In putting together its slate of 12 projects (and counting), Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht made deals with big names including Reese Witherspoon (for three shows), Steven Spielberg, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan, Jennifer Aniston, Octavia Spencer and Kristen Wiig.\u201cWe\u2019re all in,\u201d Mr. Cue said in Austin. \u201cWe\u2019re completely all in.\u201dWhat remains to be seen is whether the tech giant\u2019s efforts will lead to success in an industry where, as the screenwriter William Goldman once observed, \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201dApple was built on the careful work of engineers who created platforms and products that helped define tech culture. But there is a difference between making successful products and creating hit shows \u2014 a lesson learned the hard way by Microsoft and Yahoo, which not long ago had big plans for original programming, only to abandon them.Producers and entertainment executives who have met recently with Apple executives said the company has been leaning toward programming in keeping with its bright, optimistic brand identity. In other words, it seems possible that Apple will shy away from projects that are gratuitously dark or heavy on social issues. They added that the company was targeting somewhere between March 2019 and the summer of that year to roll out its slate of new programming.\u201cApple just gets it,\u201d Ms. Witherspoon said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey get our vision and they just stepped up and they really wanted to be in business with us in a big way.\u201dAlthough the company has bought projects at a quick pace, it has said that it will not follow the high-volume strategy favored by Netflix. Mr. Cue, who has been at Apple for nearly three decades, cited Pixar as a model when he was interviewed at South by Southwest. And while it is true that the Disney-owned animation company has a stellar track record, it also has the luxury of making only one or two movies a year; even the most successful TV studios wind up with more misses than hits.Apple has not shared specifics with its new business partners on how it will distribute the shows, but they may be housed in its TV app, which allows access to video services like HBO Now and Hulu. Nor has the company announced whether its projects will be behind a pay wall, but the company will most likely require viewers to have subscriptions to access its shows at some point.As Apple moves deeper into Act One of its foray into entertainment, it is pinning its hopes on Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, who made their names at Sony despite being saddled with budgets significantly smaller than those of their rivals.\u201cWhen we got in the basic cable business, people said, \u2018You\u2019ll never hit the big home run,\u2019\u201d said Steve Mosko, the former head of Sony\u2019s TV unit, who served as the boss of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht. \u201cAnd we said, \u2018That\u2019s O.K., we\u2019ll just hit singles and doubles and maybe we\u2019ll hit a homer. Fortunately, we did, with \u2018Breaking Bad.\u2019\u201dAfter a slow start, \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d went on to score big ratings and generate serious advertising revenue only after Netflix began streaming old episodes.With that show, which went on to win 16 Emmys, Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht had one of the first \u201cbinge-watch\u201d hits, suggesting that they had a sense for the type of programming suited to the medium of streaming. They will have to pull off the same trick once again to give Apple\u2019s new venture a Hollywood ending.Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Neither Black Nor White in the Mississippi Delta", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo photographers document a community of Chinese-Americans in the birthplace of the blues.It is easy to understand why the blues was born here.\u201cThe Chinese have been in the Delta for more than a hundred years,\u201d said Frieda Quon, a retired librarian who speaks with a southern drawl. \u201cWhen we came initially, we didn\u2019t have rights. We couldn\u2019t go to the white schools, couldn\u2019t even get a haircut, could not go to the hospitals. We were second-class citizens. After the civil rights era, we gained more rights. I think the communities realized, \u2018Hey the Chinese are really making a contribution.\u2019\u201d Ms. Quon was among a dozen Mississippians of Chinese descent who were photographed and interviewed by Andrew Kung and Emanuel Hahn. Though the photographers had only met in New York in 2017, they have much in common apart from being Asian-American \u2014 both became photographers after attending business school and working for tech start-ups.In the course of their project, Mr. Kung and Mr. Hahn recorded oral histories and found that the Chinese residents that they met were at times very much like their neighbors.Gilroy and Sally Chow\u2019s family takes the football rivalry between the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State seriously. So seriously that they now sit in opposing stands to keep the peace between family members who back opposing sides. Shawn Kwan, 25, whose family owns a store in Greenville, said he appreciated Mississippi\u2019s gun culture. \u201cWe can openly carry the firearm in public and we do have a concealed carry \u2014 like keep it under your shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do that in any other state. That\u2019s another reason why I\u2019m kind of anchored down to the South.\u201d At the same time, many members of the community retain elements of their families\u2019 Chinese culture, and their frequent gatherings with family and friends often feature Chinese cuisine.\u201cI\u2019m a fourth-generation farmer in my family and I want to continue the tradition,\u201d Mr. Pang said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of neat how we all immigrated and settled here,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I understand if you have to follow where the money is. The only reason why you\u2019re still stuck in the Delta is because you\u2019re a farmer, teacher, or someone in the medical field. There\u2019s nothing really here anymore.\u201d Mr. Kung, the photographer, is a child of Chinese immigrants and grew up in a diverse neighborhood in San Francisco. Mr. Hahn\u2019s parents are Korean Christian missionaries and he grew up in Singapore, Cambodia and South Korea before moving to the United States to attend New York University. \u201cLiving in large cities, we were both used to hearing this narrative of Asians being the model minority,\u201d Mr. Kung said. \u201cWe wanted to tap into untold stories when Asian-Americans made a big impact in their respective communities. These stories fly under the radar. Who would think there is a Chinese population in the Mississippi Delta?\u201dThey arrived in Mississippi with data, and some preconceptions, Mr. Hahn said. They knew Mississippi was one of the poorest states in the country, with an economy heavily reliant on agriculture, and that the Delta had long flat roads that seemed to go on forever. But once there they also found a tightly knit Chinese-American community that \u201crelied on family and roots, which helped them get through some of the racial tension from the past to the present,\u201d Mr. Kung said. \u201cOftentimes, as Asian-Americans in large cities, we don\u2019t have that same level of community or that same level of ties because there are so many of us in New York, San Francisco and L.A. that we kind of take that level of community for granted,\u201d Mr. Kung explained. \u201cSeeing that level of intimacy for me, as a young Asian-American living in the States, was a very heartwarming thing to see, especially in a place where you wouldn\u2019t really imagine there would be tons of Asians or Chinese-Americans\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Breitbart, Facing Headwinds, Tries a New Tack: Live Events", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreitbart News is taking a step into the live events business.Following the lead of other media companies seeking fresh sources of revenue, the right-wing news and opinion site is set to host its first-ever town hall in suburban New Orleans next month, a panel on privacy and technology with the commentator Ann Coulter and Peter Schweizer, the author of \u201cClinton Cash.\u201dIt\u2019s an experiment for a site that has lately been confronting declining web traffic and turbulence in its top ranks. Stephen K. Bannon, the site\u2019s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January. Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.The Louisiana event is \u201cthe latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,\u201d said Alexander Marlow, the site\u2019s editor in chief.By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media. News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.The panel will be live-streamed \u2014 on Facebook.Mr. Marlow, who will serve as moderator, said that tickets to the event would be free and that costs would be partly covered by Free Our Internet, a group that bills itself as \u201cfighting the tech-left\u2019s takeover of the internet.\u201dMr. Schweizer, who collaborated with Mr. Bannon on his investigations into Hillary Clinton, is finishing a documentary about the role of tech companies in filtering the news. Another scheduled guest, Robert Epstein, a former editor of Psychology Today, is expected to be featured in Mr. Schweizer\u2019s film.Breitbart was a champion of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, which Mr. Bannon eventually joined. The site has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and its writers routinely flog the establishment media: Last year, its reporters worked to undercut reporting by The Washington Post about misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama.Mr. Bannon\u2019s ouster, from the White House and then from Breitbart, cut into the site\u2019s cachet. But Breitbart is still among the top-ranked sites on Facebook, and several of its journalists were treated as celebrities at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference.Facebook\u2019s handling of its users\u2019 data has come under scrutiny in part because of a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked on the Trump campaign and was co-founded by Mr. Bannon. Facebook has banned the company from its platform, saying it misused personal data from Facebook that was provided to it.Mr. Marlow said he knew little about Mr. Bannon\u2019s role in the company, though he defended Cambridge Analytica as engaging in the same kind of data-driven electioneering that left-leaning groups have done in the past.Advertisement"}

And this sci-fi fishland doesn\u2019t exist. But it could \u2014 not long from now. They explained how their finned robot was created, and how her first ocean swim on a coral reef outside of Fiji went. Robotic fish like her could be essential to understanding and protecting marine life in danger of disappearing in a fragile ocean environment, threatened by human activity and climate change.This foot-and-a-half long robot mimics a real fish. She can swim in the ocean at speeds up to half-its-body-length a second and at depths up to 60 feet below the surface. SoFi has a battery that will last 45 minutes before she shuts down. For this group of MIT roboticists, SoFi was a dream, combining their love of diving with their work on soft robots. She was also an engineering challenge.SoFi started as an nine-inch silicon tail that wiggled with the assistance of a hydraulic pump. SoFi had to swim in the ocean \u2014 at multiple depths.This meant waterproofing, buoyancy control, tweaking weight distributions and figuring out an unobtrusive way to share information underwater. It also meant compact equipment. \u201cWe wanted to build a fish,\u201d said Mr. Katzschmann. \u201cAnd the fish can\u2019t be as big as a submarine \u2014 unless we wanted to build a whale.\u201dA couple years later SoFi had a finned body and head equipped with a camera, two-way hydrophone, battery, environmental sensors, operating system and communication system that allowed a diver to issue commands using a souped-up Super Nintendo controller. The communication system was the biggest challenge, said Mr. Katzschmann, because normally it requires a cable. Common remote signals used for piloting aerial drones don\u2019t travel below water. But sound waves do. They built their own language, sending coded messages on high-pitched sound waves between SoFi and the diver. Different bits of information were assigned their own tones, kind of like how numbers are represented by dial tones when you make a phone call. A processing system decoded and relayed the messages to tell the diver things like \u201cSoFi is currently swimming forward\u201d or command her to \u201cturn left, 20 degrees.\u201d\u201cOur primary goal was to make something for biologists,\u201d said Mr. Katzschmann. He envisions a future network of sensor-clad SoFis for studying schooling dynamics or monitoring pollution over time. Currently he\u2019s working on primitive A.I. so SoFi can use her footage to identify and track real fish.But what if a real fish \u2014 or a shark \u2014 tracks SoFi instead? \u201cIf a shark would have come and ate our fish, that would have been the most amazing footage,\u201d Mr. Katzschmann said. _____Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As India\u2019s Tensions Boil, Even a Statue of Gandhi Isn\u2019t Safe", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEERUT, India \u2014 The vandals attacked a statue of Gandhi in the southern state of Kerala, breaking its wire-rimmed eyeglasses.They targeted a monument to Lenin, using a hydraulic jackhammer to destroy the sculpture in the northeastern state of Tripura.They shattered a statue of a revered figure among Dalits, lower-caste Indians, leaving it in pieces in Meerut, about 50 miles north of New Delhi.The attacks were part of a wave of vandalism that has unleashed accusations and recriminations and sent political tensions boiling over as, one by one, at least six monuments have been vandalized since Monday.Indian opposition parties attribute the attacks to supporters of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, emboldened after a landslide victory in state elections in the country\u2019s northeast last weekend.The opposition parties say the backers of B.J.P. and its allies foster a climate of intolerance and target other Hindus who oppose them, as well as religious minorities such as Muslims.But the B.J.P., which says the party is inclusive, denied its supporters were behind the attacks and dismissed the accusations as part of a political smear campaign. It noted that someone had taken a hammer to a bust of its own founder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who heads the B.J.P.-led government, issued a strong condemnation on Wednesday of the vandalism, promising swift retribution against the vandals, no matter their affiliation.But the vandalism appeared to be aimed mostly at figures who are important to Dalits, whom some B.J.P. supporters disdain. Discrimination, although forbidden by law, is widespread in India\u2019s stratified society.On Wednesday morning, district officials in Meerut discovered a statue of B.R. Ambedkar in pieces. The Dalits revere Mr. Ambedkar for enshrining their rights in the Indian Constitution.Officials, hoping to avert anger from the local Dalits, moved within hours to replace the statue, erecting a new one so hastily that most of the fingernails chiseled into the hand clutching India\u2019s Constitution were missing. The ears were rendered as blocklike ovals on either side of the head.\u201cHe\u2019s like our god,\u201d said Kapil Kumar, 25, who helped replace the statue. \u201cWhat we have today is because of him. Whatever respect and chances in life we have, is because of him.\u201dThe violence began in the town of Belonia in Tripura State, after the B.J.P. swept local elections, ending more than two decades of Communist control. The Tripura branch of the Communist Party of India says B.J.P. supporters had celebrated their victory by ransacking and burning the party\u2019s offices.Then, on Monday, a crowd chanting B.J.P. slogans surrounded a statue of Lenin in Belonia. Using a construction vehicle with a hydraulic jackhammer, they destroyed the monument \u2014 an episode captured on a cellphone camera and shared widely.\u201cVictory to mother India,\u201d protesters can be heard chanting on the video.Victor Shome, the media officer for B.J.P. in Tripura, said the Communists had destroyed the statue. \u201cWe are a responsible party,\u201d Mr. Shome said on Friday. \u201cWith the help of the local administration, we are looking seriously into this incident to see how it happened.\u201dThe Communists claim otherwise. \u201cThe statue\u2019s destruction was symbolic of the victory of the right over the left,\u201d said Tapas Datta, the secretary for the local Communist Party branch in Belonia.Belonia\u2019s police say B.J.P. celebrations got out of hand but did not explicitly blame the party.\u201cIt seemed some criminal elements took over a bulldozer, parked on the side of the street,\u201d said Manchak Ipper, the superintendent of the police in the south Tripura district, which includes Belonia.\u201cThey forced the driver to bring down the statue,\u201d Mr. Ipper said by telephone. \u201cI would say it was overenthusiasm.\u201dBut the vandalism spread across India.On Wednesday, residents of Kolkata found the damaged bust of the B.J.P. founder, Syama Prasad Mookerjee, a hammer taken to the eyes and the face blackened with paint.On Thursday, the glasses on the giant statue of Gandhi in Kerala were broken. Mr. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a member of the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which was outlawed after the assassination for a period but is active today and allied with the B.J.P.In Meerut on Friday, the Dalits were seething, blaming upper-caste Tyagis for defacing Mr. Ambedkar\u2019s statue. The Tyagis are jealous and angry, they say, about the Dalits\u2019 progression. Mr. Ambedkar was a founding father of postcolonial India and helped elevate Dalits socially, economically and politically, moving the community away from their more commonly known moniker, \u201cthe untouchables.\u201dDalit groups in Meerut are promising to replace the statue with an even bigger one, double the height of the current rendering.But several villagers from the Tyagis caste have accused the Dalits of destroying the statue themselves in order to rally their voters in coming by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, which includes Meerut.Mr. Kumar expects the tensions to worsen.\u201cIn the future, this won\u2019t calm down.

{"Headline": " How Nasdaq C.E.O. Adena Friedman Beat the Odds on Wall Street", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycorner officeShe grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she\u2019s running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up, and she got stuff done. It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn\u2019t been the case for her. Today, Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq\u2019s culture more collaborative, grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She\u2019s also overseeing Nasdaq\u2019s continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Nasdaq\u2019s MarketSite location in Times Square.Tell me about your parents. My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls. My parents got married when they were still in college, so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids, but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9, she decided to go to law school, and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person, and my dad was really, really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me, to see how she transformed herself.It was a really important part of me growing up, being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life. I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up, and our science teacher \u2014 who was a man \u2014 said: \u201cO.K., well, let\u2019s work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.\u201d It was not at all like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s hard.\u201d It was more like, \u201cGreat, let\u2019s get you well positioned to be able to do that.\u201dDid you always want to get into finance?I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of \u201cOf course your congressman\u2019s going to represent all of your interests.\u201d I came away saying, \u201cWow, progress is slow.\u201dWhat drew you to Wall Street?In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager, you have to own the four P\u2019s of marketing \u2014 product, placement, pricing and promotion. If you own the product, it\u2019s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn\u2019t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods, but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq.You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then? There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done.When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be gone for three months, and you\u2019ll come back.\u201d He really just didn\u2019t even factor it into his decision making.What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren\u2019t receiving equal treatment?First of all, make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me, and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside, and I said: \u201cSpeak up. You are really, really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else, and I can assure you your voice will be heard.\u201dNext time she had an opinion, she spoke up, and everyone was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d Then she was empowered to do it again and again. And still, some women may face discrimination. What then? If you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re getting the opportunities that you should be getting, maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then, of course, if you really feel like you\u2019re not being treated properly, as a person, there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern, to H.R., to legal.When you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group, you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O. Was that a difficult transition? The C.F.O. role is actually the hardest role in the company. One minute you\u2019re having to manage risk, and the next minute you\u2019re having to advise your C.E.O. on how to take risk. What I found frustrating about the C.F.O. role is you\u2019re not the ultimate decision maker. I prefer to be the risk taker.Most people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade, but that\u2019s a small part of the business. What is Nasdaq today? We are a great capital market ourselves. But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world. We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world today.Are you going to allow initial coin offerings on Nasdaq?You have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts, two totally different things. The blockchain, as a technology, has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets. You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership. I think that the S.E.C. is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an I.C.O. I.C.O.s as constructed today, outside the construct of a regulatory framework \u2014 that\u2019s not something we\u2019re getting involved in. What\u2019s your leadership style? We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate. When we\u2019re in a room and we want ideas to flow, including my crazy ideas sometimes, we say, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s have some light bulbs.\u201d It\u2019s just an idea, could be a really bad one, but let\u2019s put it on the table, let\u2019s talk about it. But once we make a decision, or if there\u2019s something that I really need the guys to just go do, I just say, \u201cGuys, this is a mandate.\u201dWe\u2019ve had a couple of situations, even really recently, where we hadn\u2019t brought any women into the interview process, and suddenly we did and were like, \u201cWhoa, she is probably the best candidate for the job.\u201d So it actually really does make a difference.How has Wall Street changed for women in the past 10 or 15 years? Do you see a difference between now and then?I\u2019ve had three very important sponsors of my career, all men. And it\u2019s not like they sat there and had to do a lot to push, push, push me forward. They offered advice when I asked for it, and they gave me opportunity when they saw it, and that\u2019s all they had to do. My career has been frankly an exemplary example of how women can succeed in Wall Street. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Benjamin Netanyahu Is Questioned in 3rd Corruption Case in Israel", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was questioned by the police on Friday as a possible suspect in a third bribery case, the weightiest so far in a string of corruption investigations that are jeopardizing his political future.Officers questioned Mr. Netanyahu about a case involving Shaul Elovitch, an Israeli telecommunications tycoon accused of using his popular Hebrew news site to provide positive coverage of Mr. Netanyahu and his wife in return for regulatory and financial benefits worth tens of millions of dollars.A large black screen was drawn on Friday morning across leafy Balfour Street in Jerusalem, concealing the prime minister\u2019s official residence and the comings and goings of investigators. Outside, a small but noisy group of demonstrators beat drums and held placards with slogans against corruption.Those cases are now being examined by state prosecutors and the attorney general, who will ultimately decide whether to file charges pending a hearing with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers. The process could take months.Inside the Balfour Street residence, Mr. Netanyahu was questioned for hours under caution as a possible suspect, according to the police. His wife, Sara, was questioned simultaneously as a suspect in the same case at the fraud investigation unit\u2019s headquarters in Lod, central Israel.Mr. Netanyahu has made a point of maintaining a high-profile presence on the world stage, traveling in recent weeks to India, where he was treated like royalty; to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; and to an international security conference in Munich.Denying all wrongdoing, Mr. Netanyahu has been trying to project a business-as-usual approach despite his mounting legal troubles, aiming to burnish his credentials both at home and abroad as an international player.The case involves a dicey mix of political power, big business and personal relationships. Mr. Netanyahu is a friend of Mr. Elovitch, who owns the Eurocom Group holding company, which owns Bezeq, the Israeli telecommunications giant that has long had a near-monopoly on land lines in the country.Bezek owns Walla, the Israeli news site that has provided lopsidedly flattering coverage of the Netanyahus for months or years. Sara Netanyahu, a friend of Mr. Elovitch\u2019s wife, Iris, is reported to have sent messages to her with demands to tilt the coverage in her husband\u2019s favor. Mrs. Elovitch has already been arrested in the affair and spent several days in detention.Among other things, the Communications Ministry is said to have pushed regulators to allow the merger of a money-losing satellite network, Yes, also owned by Mr. Elovitch, with Bezeq, a deal that would have reaped huge tax savings for Mr. Elovitch.At a hearing for two of the suspects in the case in a Tel Aviv court this week, Yehudit Tirosh, a prosecution lawyer, pointed a finger at Mr. Netanyahu in his role as communications minister.\u201cThis is a grave case of giving and receiving bribes,\u201d Ms. Tirosh was quoted as saying by the Israeli news media. \u201cThe term \u2018positive coverage\u2019 is misleading. This is harnessing a leading website in return for regulatory favors by the minister of communications and the director general of the Ministry of Communications.\u201d The value of the regulatory benefits was about $500 million, she said.Jack Chen, a lawyer representing Mr. Elovitch, said in an interview on Friday that the allegations were \u201cbaseless,\u201d and that his client categorically denied that there was ever any such deal.Mr. Netanyahu, who has been accused of accepting nearly $300,000 in gifts over 10 years, has found himself and his close associates accused on a variety of fronts:\u2022 Case 2000, in which Mr. Netanyahu is suspected of back-room dealings with Arnon Mozes, publisher of the popular newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, to ensure more favorable coverage. The police have also recommended charges in that case.\u2022 Case 3000, which involves suspicions of corruption surrounding a multibillion-dollar purchase of submarines and other naval vessels from a German shipyard. Mr. Netanyahu is not a suspect in that case, though some of his closest confidants are.\u2022 Case 4000, which was the subject of the police questioning on Friday.The Walla news site has changed its tune in recent months, offering some considerably less fawning coverage of the Netanyahus.Advertisement"}

Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.\u201cThe last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\u201d Erin Egan, Facebook\u2019s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.\u201dLate Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card.\u201dWe want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,\u201d Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement.\u201cThis product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people\u2019s privacy on Facebook.\u201dHow much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook\u2019s data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the company\u2019s new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past.Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said.\u201cThe past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

PerryA filmmaker in Los AngelesFor a long time now, Mr. Perry had wanted to leave Facebook.But Facebook was also where Mr. Perry promoted his films, where he posted ads seeking help on the set, and where he communicated with colleagues and a \u201cmassive number\u201d of his friends and relatives.Until he heard about Cambridge Analytica.\u201cI suspected this stuff was going on, but this is the first time it\u2019s been plainly exposed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems so malicious, and Facebook seems so complicit all the way up and down, like it doesn\u2019t care about its users.\u201dMr. Perry, 39, has since deleted his profile and plans to switch to Twitter and Instagram for his social media needs.\u201cIt was an easy decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the end of the world.\u201d______Dan ClarkA retired Navy veteran in MaineMr. Clark kept one Facebook account to chat with friends and a separate account to keep tabs on members of his family nationwide.

{"Headline": "In This Corner of Maryland, Holidays Mean a Stuffed Ham", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALL TIMBERS, Md. \u2014 William Andrew Dent was the stuffed ham king around here.There was a time when you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a family in St. Mary\u2019s County that didn\u2019t make a stuffed ham, at least for Thanksgiving, Christmas or Easter. But here, as everywhere, home cooking waned. Families got smaller. The will and skill needed to boil 20 pounds of cabbage-stuffed ham faded. People turned to country stores like Dent\u2019s to fill the gap.\u201cWe have the second-best stuffed ham in the world,\u201d Andy Dent told me in an interview at his bar the day before he died. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s is the best. But ours is easier.\u201dCapturing the precise recipe is like trying to get an artist to explain how to paint a landscape. Still, there are common building blocks. You start with a corned ham, which is a whole, fresh ham that has taken a long vacation in salt. (Good luck, by the way, finding one outside the county \u2014 especially one that weighs less than 20 pounds.)Next, you chop several pounds of cabbage, kale and onions, then perk it all up with enough black and red pepper \u201cto give it some bite,\u201d as cooks here say.From there, the recipe diverges into a debate that runs the length of the county. In the north, cooks will tell you to add a lot of kale. In the south, kale is just an accent color, if it goes in the stuffing at all. Whether mustard seed, celery seed or celery itself belongs in the stuffing depends on the version you grew up eating.The stuffing is packed into pockets cut deep into the meat with techniques that vary from cook to cook. What\u2019s left over \u2014 and there will be a lot left over \u2014 is pressed around the ham. The whole thing is wrapped in cheesecloth (or a clean pillowcase or T-shirt) and boiled for four or five hours.Then, you drain the ham and set into the refrigerator to chill, although plenty of people just leave it in the cooking liquid out on the back porch during cool weather. You slice it cold, serving the ham as a main dish or tucked into soft potato rolls or between slices of white bread. Don\u2019t ask about mustard or mayonnaise. You don\u2019t want to start an argument.A ham stuffed with cabbage simmering on the stove for hours makes a lasting olfactory impression, and not necessarily a good one. Unprompted, even the hams biggest fans allow that the smell can linger for days.Even though fewer people are cooking the hams, its cultural significance endures. Retired sailors who spent time at the naval station near the mouth of the Patuxent River have had them shipped to California or even Alaska for holidays, the freight costing more than the ham itself. A couple living an hour north in Washington ordered one for their wedding.Stuffed hams are a big auction item, too. Gilbert Murphy, another of the county\u2019s grocery store ham masters, said one of his once brought in $850 for a local charity.Mr. Murphy runs Murphy\u2019s Town & Country in a part of the county that locals call the Seventh District. The store has been in his family since 1949, before the supermarket chains and the Dollar Generals started moving in, when most people still cooked stuffed hams at home.He makes about 400 a year selling them for church dinners, to big families who need a holiday centerpiece, and for $12.99 a pound at the store. The Dent brothers sell a lot by the pound, too.\u201cThere are a lot of young people who\u2019ll come get a sandwich, but they\u2019re not going to make one,\u201d Andy Dent said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to be bothered, but they have to have the ham.\u201dMr. Dent would make at least dozen a week. Around Thanksgiving and Christmas, that number doubled. He was particularly proud of his stuffed ham egg rolls, which are a relatively new invention. He sold a lot of $16 pizzas with stuffed ham as a topping, too. Even his cordon bleu, which costs $16 including two side dishes, was stuffed with stuffed ham.Everyone from St. Mary\u2019s knows that life\u2019s big events should be punctuated with stuffed ham, so they served it at his funeral.\u201cWe sure did,\u201d said his brother, David. \u201cWe had stuffed ham sliders and some of the stuffed ham egg rolls.\u201dMs. White and other regional historians say it\u2019s more likely that the dish has Afro-Caribbean roots; indentured or enslaved West Africans would season the greens and onions left over in the winter garden with red pepper, and stuff it into jowls or whatever chunks of pork they had on hand.But as in so many parts of the South, the line between black and white food is blurry.\u201cIt floated up and got adopted into the white food traditions,\u201d Ms. White said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re cooking and you can\u2019t read, you are going to follow your own instinct and taste but adjust it for the white people for whom you are cooking.\u201dThe result is an amalgam of a dish, with a cooking method that has been developed and passed on in classic folk tradition \u2014 with generations of observation and repetition, both in black households and white.During the last 30 years of his life, he must have stuffed more than 1,000 hams to raise money for the Roman Catholic Church and schools their seven children attended. Ever the engineer, he built a 4-foot-by-8-foot plywood table covered in plastic to make the process of stuffing dozens of hams at once a little more efficient.Every Christmas, he would haul it into the kitchen for a ham-stuffing party. Friends would bring their boiling pots and several pounds of chopped vegetables, dumping them onto the communal table.Preparing the stuffing is one of those culinary tasks certain men like to take on. Mr. Bowes took it very seriously. The stuffing wasn\u2019t ready until he had spiced it precisely, using a formula that was impossible to quantify but boiled down to this: If it looks right, smells right and tastes right, then it\u2019s right.Over the past few years, Mrs. Bowes said, she and her husband talked about whether they should stop the ham-stuffing parties. They were both getting old, and the kitchen was always so crowded when they set up the table. Still, the idea that the family tradition might end made them sad.\u201cYou wonder, if Mom and Dad die, are the kids going to take it up?\u201d Mrs. Bowes said.At least one is. For the past few years, their son Matt, who works for the electric company and has four children of his own, has been slowly learning the craft. In fact, last Christmas his father acted more like an executive chef, giving final approval to his son\u2019s stuffing.This Christmas, for the first time, Matt will be on his own at the table. Standing in his parents\u2019 kitchen a few weeks ago, the thought brought a lump to his throat.\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least, I think I\u2019m ready.\u201dAnd to drink ...Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anatomy of a School Lockdown: A Threat, Then the Anxious Wait", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFULTON, Ill. \u2014 Chris Tennyson, the principal of Fulton High School, was winding his way through the school hallway just before lunch on Tuesday when a female student stopped him, worry etched on her face.From the quiet of Mr. Tennyson\u2019s office, she handed him her phone. On it were screenshots of Snapchat messages sent that morning from a former student.\u201cI\u2019m locked, loaded, and ready to go,\u201d one message read. \u201cPeople will be hurt, hell maybe even killed. I won\u2019t stop.\u201dWithin three minutes of reading the messages, Mr. Tennyson called the police, setting off a response that would force a lockdown of three public schools in Fulton and send several municipal and county law-enforcement agencies in northwestern Illinois hunting for a suspect. Parents throughout this hilly, blue-collar town on the Mississippi River were soon notified that their children, ranging from kindergarten to 12th grade, were being held in their classrooms for their own safety.In his five years as the principal at Fulton High, Mr. Tennyson, a former Illinois police officer, had never presided over an unplanned lockdown of his school. This time was different.\u201cThere\u2019s no standard answer for when you get the police involved,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw what was written as a threat.\u201dCommunities find themselves navigating a fine, sometimes blurred, line between vigilance and overreaction. A high school in Westport, Conn., was evacuated after a student was overheard threatening a teacher. Worries over a toy gun caused a lockdown at three schools in Arlington, Tex. In Pensacola, Fla., a middle school went into lockdown after a rumor spread that there was a gun inside the school, terrifying students; the rumor turned out to be false.Attentive school administrators are facing a daily dilemma: Take every possible threat seriously and risk a needless disruption to the school day, a noisy police response and a crush of worried parents. Or, ignore what could be a real threat and risk the nightmare of your school becoming the next Parkland.In Fulton, a city of 3,300 people just across the river from Iowa, Tuesday morning began like any other.Students showed up for classes at Fulton High, a low-slung brick building where a red sign in front heralds its team name, the Steamers.Mr. Tennyson, a burly, gregarious former police officer known to his students as \u201cMr. T,\u201d was making his usual rounds through the hallways, passing rows of shiny lockers where students had fastened Post-its with inspirational messages. (\u201cTry to be a rainbow in someone\u2019s cloud,\u201d one read.)Before he became a principal, Mr. Tennyson, 48, spent years as a school resource officer in suburban Chicago. He vividly remembers the day of the Columbine massacre in 1999, when he watched news reports from the high school where he was responsible for student safety.\u201cWe just thought, \u2018Oh my goodness, how could this ever happen in a school?\u2019\u201d Mr. Tennyson recalled. \u201cI knew that the world had changed.\u201dOn Tuesday morning, when Mr. Tennyson read the messages on the worried Fulton High student\u2019s phone, he instantly knew who was involved. This high school is small \u2014 288 students \u2014 and the student who had handed over her phone told him that the messages were from Blake Dornbush, an 18-year-old who graduated from Fulton High last year and had played on the football team.In the eyes of Mr. Tennyson, who knows all of his students, he and Mr. Dornbush had a great relationship. But it had been almost a year since they talked.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with his life,\u201d Mr. Tennyson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t know the stressors in his life. There\u2019s no way for me to determine anything that\u2019s going on with Blake in the last year.\u201dHe picked up the phone and called the police.The Fulton Police Department is housed in a former bank, eight blocks from the high school.Lt. Donnie R. Pridemore was on duty Tuesday morning. At 11:05 a.m., he got word of a threat at the high school, and when he heard the name of the suspect, Mr. Dornbush, he made an instant connection. This was Fulton. The lieutenant knew Mr. Dornbush\u2019s parents.Lieutenant Pridemore immediately told school administrators that if they had not yet gone into lockdown, they should now. The elementary, middle and high schools in Fulton instituted a \u201csoft lockdown,\u201d where students are kept in their classrooms and out of hallways.Jenna Schrader, 18 and a senior, was in the library. She was calm, she said later, reasoning that if the situation was truly dire, the school would have gone into full lockdown with even more extreme measures.After 45 minutes, though, other students began to grow nervous, she said.\u201cYou always think about what could happen,\u201d she said.As the students waited, police went to Mr. Dornbush\u2019s home, a pale yellow house with burgundy shutters, where he lived with his parents. Nobody was home.Mr. Dornbush\u2019s parents, called by police, told them that their son was at school. The Midwest Technical Institute in Moline, Ill., where he is studying welding, was a short drive down the river.After a while, Mr. Dornbush returned a call from police on his phone and drove up Route 84 from Moline under strict instructions from the officers. Trailed by unmarked police cars, he drove directly to the Fulton Police Department, where he was interviewed about the Snapchat messages, the police said. Lieutenant Pridemore said he arrested Mr. Dornbush, who was charged with two counts of felony disorderly conduct.Mr. Dornbush was booked into the Whiteside County Jail, where he would remain until Wednesday afternoon, the authorities said, when he was released on $25,000 bond. Mr. Dornbush did not respond to messages, and a woman who answered the door at Mr. Dornbush\u2019s house on Thursday declined to talk. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.Lieutenant Pridemore said that a recent breakup with the student who got the Snapchat messages may have been behind what had happened.\u201cHe knew what he did was wrong,\u201d Lieutenant Pridemore said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a great explanation for why he did it.\u201dAt the Sunrise diner in Fulton on Thursday morning, as a waitress made the rounds and refilled coffee cups, one topic of conversation briefly dominated the room: the lockdown at the schools.Melissa Werner, sitting in a booth by a window, said that her son, Blake, is a 15-year-old sophomore at Fulton High. He seemed to be fine once the lockdown was over, she said, though he was shaken while it was happening. After what occurred on Tuesday, she gave him a stern reminder.\u201cI told my son, \u2018You have to watch every little thing that you say,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018People don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being serious.\u2019\u201dPolice said that before Tuesday, they had not had any contact with Mr. Dornbush, aside from a few traffic stops. They searched the Dornbush home and found no weapons.Tod Goodell, a friend and former classmate from Fulton High, said he believed that Mr. Dornbush was harmless.\u201cI know Blake and I also know he would not hurt anyone,\u201d he said in a Facebook message. \u201cHe said what he said out of anger and I know he regrets it. He wasn\u2019t going to do anything he said he\u2019d do.\u201dThe uncertainty of that \u2014 whether a threat will result in violence or amount to frightening, rash talk \u2014 has sent schools into lockdowns, again and again. Belligerent claims and rumors of violence spread instantaneously in the never-slowing flood of social media. In light of the Parkland attack and other school shootings, Lieutenant Pridemore said, there is no way that police now can risk overlooking a detailed threat.\u201cWe can no longer say, \u2018Aww, he didn\u2019t mean it,\u2019\u201d Lieutenant Pridemore said. \u201cTimes have changed.\u201dDarryl Hogue, the superintendent of the school district, said he was satisfied that the incident at Fulton High was \u201cisolated, independent and definitely over.\u201dHe said he has no way of knowing whether someone will follow through on a promise of violence or not.\u201cI think of that all the time,\u201d Mr. Hogue said. \u201cWas it a real threat? It was a threat enough that we had to act upon it. I don\u2019t know the intentions of the young man.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley Knew of a Star\u2019s Alleged Abuse. He Still Works There.", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "A top Morgan Stanley broker was repeatedly accused of violence against ex-wives and girlfriends. Bank managers were told. But he kept his job.Supported byOver 15 years, four women in Lake Oswego, Ore., a wealthy Portland suburb, sought police protection against the same man, court filings show.\u201cHe threatened to burn down my house with me in it,\u201d one woman wrote in her application for a restraining order. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do next,\u201d a second wrote. \u201cHe choked me so hard it left a mark on my throat,\u201d wrote another. \u201cHe is scaring my children and me,\u201d a fourth woman said.Yet the man, Douglas E. Greenberg, remains one of Morgan Stanley\u2019s top financial advisers \u2014 and a celebrated member of the wealth management industry.For years, Morgan Stanley executives knew about his alleged conduct, according to seven former Morgan Stanley employees.Morgan Stanley received a federal subpoena related to one abuse allegation, according to a lawyer for one of the women. In another instance, a Morgan Stanley manager alerted his superior when Mr. Greenberg was charged with violating a restraining order, according to three former employees. Another manager at the firm liked and replied to a Facebook post by one of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s ex-wives in which she described his abuse. On yet another occasion, an official from the bank\u2019s New York headquarters flew to Portland to investigate, two former employees said.Despite this information, Morgan Stanley apparently took no action against Mr. Greenberg. He is still an employee and a member of the elite \u201cChairman\u2019s Club,\u201d which recognizes brokers who not only are top producers but also meet certain \u201cconduct and compliance standards.\u201dThis week, after The New York Times contacted Morgan Stanley with questions about Mr. Greenberg, the bank put him on \u201cadministrative leave pending further review of this situation,\u201d said a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, Christy Jockle. \u201cWe are committed to maintaining a safe and professional work environment and will take appropriate action based on the facts of the matter.\u201dReached on his cellphone this week, Mr. Greenberg said he had no comment. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that a reporter from New York would somehow have all this information just on her own,\u201d he said. He did not respond to additional detailed requests for comment.None of the women Mr. Greenberg is said to have abused were employed by Morgan Stanley. But employees in the finance industry \u2014 especially those who manage money for clients \u2014 are judged in part on their character. That puts the onus on companies, and regulators, to police their conduct even outside the office.Financial advisers like Mr. Greenberg have to share certain information about themselves publicly, under rules intended to help investors find trustworthy money managers. For example, brokers have to inform the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, if they declare bankruptcy or are charged with any felony or with a misdemeanor related to money.But there is just as much information that does not have to be disclosed \u2014 and that means that people with checkered histories can continue to thrive in the industry.On Finra\u2019s website, each broker\u2019s history is displayed in a vertical timeline, with red dots marking the date of each trouble spot.There are five red dots on Mr. Greenberg\u2019s timeline. They represent a 1984 charge, eventually dismissed, of theft by check; a 2001 charge of criminal mischief in the first degree, also dismissed; two disputes with clients; and a regulatory penalty.But that record does not reveal Mr. Greenberg\u2019s other run-ins with law enforcement and the judicial system, which are not required to be disclosed to Finra.In 2000, Mr. Greenberg admitted in an arbitration proceeding that he had phoned someone who did a lot of business with a colleague and told him, inaccurately, that the colleague was known for shady business practices, according to a record of the proceeding. Mr. Greenberg was not punished for what the three-person arbitration panel deemed was defamation because the statute of limitations had expired, the panel said in its decision.In December 2006, Mr. Greenberg was charged with harassment and criminal mischief, according to court papers and a police blotter item in The Lake Oswego Review. He had violated a restraining order taken out by his ex-girlfriend, the second woman to ask for protection against him, according to the court papers. Mr. Greenberg eventually pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespass and agreed to limitations on his movements, according to a plea deal reviewed by The Times.And eight years later, Mr. Greenberg was charged with violating another restraining order taken out by a different ex-girlfriend. The woman, Anne Cost, had obtained the order against Mr. Greenberg after, she said, he threatened to burn down her house. Now, she told the police, Mr. Greenberg was menacing her again, trailing her in his car.\u201cYou could have placed a pizza box between her back bumper and Mr. Greenberg\u2019s front bumper he was so close to her,\u201d a Lake Oswego police officer, John J. Brent, wrote in his report of the incident, which was reviewed by The Times. Ms. Cost declined to comment.After that September 2014 arrest, Mr. Greenberg\u2019s mug shot appeared online in a report about the arrest. Morgan Stanley employees in Seattle and Portland shared it via text messages and emails, according to the seven former Morgan Stanley employees, most of whom said they did not want to be identified because they feared retribution by Mr. Greenberg or the bank.\u201cEverybody knew,\u201d said Jani Beatty, a former vice president at Morgan Stanley\u2019s private bank. She added, \u201cI considered him my friend until I understood the full extent of his actions against his intimate partners.\u201dWhen he learned of the arrest, Paul Amsbury, a Morgan Stanley branch manager and Mr. Greenberg\u2019s boss, passed information about it, including the mug shot, to Curtis Peterson, the firm\u2019s Pacific Coast regional director, in San Francisco, according to Ms. Beatty and two other former bank employees. Mr. Amsbury\u2019s message: Mr. Greenberg was not fit to represent Morgan Stanley and should be dismissed.Mr. Amsbury declined to comment. Mr. Peterson did not respond to requests for comment.After Mr. Amsbury flagged the arrest, a high-ranking compliance official from Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York offices flew to Portland to meet with Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Amsbury, the former employees said. (Ms. Beatty, who worked in a separate business line in Mr. Greenberg\u2019s office, said she did not recall the visit.)Morgan Stanley officials soon were confronted with more issues involving Mr. Greenberg.In June 2015, his second ex-wife, Traci Williams, wrote a series of Facebook posts that described her ex-husband\u2019s alleged physical and verbal abuse. The posts did not name Mr. Greenberg, but there was little doubt about whom she was referring to. Her friends commented on the posts and criticized Mr. Greenberg by name. And a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg complained about the posts to Ms. Williams\u2019s lawyer.Among the commenters was Alex Burlingame, a Morgan Stanley manager in Seattle who had worked with Mr. Greenberg for years. He \u201cliked\u201d the post and added a personal message: \u201cHang in there, Traci! So sorry to see that one acts this way. Nancy and I r thinking of you!\u201dMr. Burlingame did not respond to requests for comment.That summer, Ms. Williams said she started receiving what she perceived to be threatening letters in the mail. \u201cI CAN SEE YOU,\u201d read one message made up of letters cut out from magazines. She reported the harassment to the Portland police, who opened an investigation. Their main suspect was Mr. Greenberg, according to emails between Ms. Williams, her lawyer and a Portland police officer that were reviewed by The Times.The police eventually turned the case over to federal prosecutors, according to a July 2015 email to Ms. Williams from the Portland police officer. The United States Postal Inspection Service was also part of the investigation.One day in early 2016, federal authorities showed up at Mr. Greenberg\u2019s Morgan Stanley office to serve a subpoena related to the investigation, according to Edie Rogoway, Ms. Williams\u2019s lawyer. On March 1, Greg Nyhus, an assistant United States attorney, said in an email to Ms. Rogoway, reviewed by The Times, that his office was reviewing documents obtained from several subpoenas.A spokesman for Mr. Nyhus\u2019s office declined to comment.Ms. Williams, meanwhile, asked her lawyer to complain to Morgan Stanley that Mr. Greenberg was making it hard for her to access her children\u2019s Morgan Stanley wealth management accounts.Ms. Rogoway said she spoke to a Morgan Stanley lawyer, Bernard Kornmehl, about the accounts. Mr. Kornmehl declined to comment.She said she told him that Mr. Greenberg had a history of abusing women.Later that day, Ms. Rogoway emailed Ms. Williams about the conversation. She reported that Mr. Kornmehl had said that \u201cmany sides\u201d were aware of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s alleged history.An earlier version of this article misstated who paid a $32 million settlement involving the former Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly.

{"Headline": "More Than Just a Sell-Off in Tech?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching.\u2022 Are we witnessing the end of the tech mania?\u2022 Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.\u2022Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?\u2022 Mark Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress.\u2022 SoftBank and Saudi Arabia are planning the world\u2019s largest solar energy project.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like Facebook, Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.\u2014 Peter EavisThe reason?Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.\u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201dMr. Swan added:\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dHow concerned should investors be?GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:\u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201dOn a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:\u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.\u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201dThe fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.About Mr. Begor\u2022 The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.\u2022 Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate\u2019s real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company\u2019s consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.His pay packageEquifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.Companies like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being. This is precisely the type of event that is capable of slaying a nascent industry in the crib.The tech flyaroundThe $200 billion solar power project would be the largest in the world and could help Saudi Arabia lessen its dependence on oil.Deals flyaroundBut the response has not been universal, as publishers weigh lost profits against reputational risks in an industry dominated by women.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of a bonus at the center of a legal battle between Lloyds Banking Group and Eric Daniels, the former chief executive.

{"Headline": "A Town Quebec Would Rather Forget: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi! This is Dan Bilefsky, writing to you from the passenger seat of a tan Volvo as I travel from Quebec City to Saguenay, an industrial center in the province, on the last leg of my road trip across Quebec.I also had a wine-fueled meal at L\u2019Affaire est Ketchup, where young chefs conjure up exquisitely wrought dishes of octopus and rack of lamb on an old-style electric stove as diners gyrate to loud French pop music in between shots of Vermouth.The nondescript town, which seems frozen in a 1950s time warp and has one set of traffic lights, a post office, a church and a d\u00e9panneur, or convenience store, ignited a provincewide culture war about a decade ago when a city counselor, Andr\u00e9 Drouin, introduced a code of conduct warning immigrants not to stone women or light them on fire. It also explained the importance of Christmas trees.The only thing was: The town didn\u2019t have any immigrants.The code of conduct spurred a backlash with liberals ridiculing the town as racist, closed-minded or worse. But the town\u2019s many defenders, including social conservatives, said it was merely trying to protect Quebec\u2019s way of life.At first, the reception was equally frosty as local residents glared at me suspiciously. People who eventually talked to me did not want to give their full names.The message, though, was clear: Even after 10 years, the town was still reeling. One man said the code was the first subject strangers brought up when he said he was from H\u00e9rouxville. A woman said the town was tired of the attention.But another woman defended the code, saying immigrants to Quebec had to conform to local custom.Across Quebec, on radio shows and on social media, commentators tut-tutted me for going to H\u00e9rouxville, suggesting that there were more interesting places. Others accused me of being out of touch with Quebec.But my road trip suggests otherwise.More than a decade later, Quebec seems consumed by some of the same questions about identity.\u201cThe situation for us has gotten worse over the past decade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has taken blood to flow for us to build bridges again.\u201dAs I travel across Quebec, I am constantly reminded how a province with a French-speaking population surrounded by an Anglophone majority in the rest of the country is understandably sensitive when it comes to preserving Quebec\u2019s culture.Moreover, because Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois revolted against the strictures of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960s, secularism is deeply ingrained and outward signs of religion can cause discomfort.The Volvo is passing snow-covered mountains as we head to Saguenay, a center for the forestry and aluminum industries. There, I want to explore how globalization and factory closings have affected a region that is among the most separatist in the province.On a different note, I also want to sample the region\u2019s vaunted meat pies, known as tourti\u00e8res!Advertisement"}

But I usually want polenta to be the main event, and to have the meaty part of the meal play the lesser role, much as it was served long ago.Polenta\u2019s humble origins lay in basic, savory gruel for the poorer classes. Good fortune in hunting or foraging could supply ingredients for a juicy, substantial rag\u00f9 to ladle on top. But even today, there\u2019s nothing better than a bowl of plain polenta with a dab of good butter or olive oil, salt and pepper, and a handful of grated Parmesan.Modern Italian cooks follow suit, topping polenta with sausages simmered in tomato sauce, a mushroom stew or braised rabbit. And the custom still exists, for those remembering or imagining village life, of pouring a pot of steaming polenta on a large board, spooning a saucy concoction over it, and placing it on the table for communal consumption and distributing spoons instead of plates. It\u2019s a wonderful way to serve a casual festive meal.The other night, with polenta on the brain and with a pound of fresh wild Gulf shrimp from the fishmonger, I made an impromptu dinner. I channeled, sort of, the Southern American favorite, shrimp and grits, and set my polenta to boil.A word of warning, though: For the best results, polenta needs a good 45 minutes to an hour on the stove. Recipes that counsel any less do cooks a disservice. The cornmeal needs time to swell, absorb liquid and develop the corn\u2019s sweetness. Undercooked polenta tastes bitter.While the polenta cooked, I peeled the shrimp and gathered the other ingredients for a spicy stew: a few hot Italian fennel sausages, an onion, some tomato pur\u00e9e and a splash of wine. The stew itself takes only about 15 minutes to cook.There, on a large platter, was a golden mound of polenta, surrounded by a full-flavored, aromatic, saucy partnership of land and sea. I quickly chopped up some scallions, parsley, capers and lemon zest to sprinkle over everything.And to drink ...Often when a dish includes tomato sauce, the inclination is to pick a red. But whites can go especially well, particularly with fresh tomato sauces and one like this, which incorporates seafood and the spicy heat of hot fennel sausage. I would look for wines that combine a lively acidity with a richer texture. Good Soaves come to mind, as does a rare white from the Piedmont region of Italy made of timorasso, a grape that might have disappeared had a few determined growers not resurrected it. Other options include ribolla gialla from Friuli-Venezia Giulia and fiano from Campania. You might also consider some of the so-called orange wines, whites made almost like red wines, macerated with their skins, which gives them an amber tinge and a tannic rasp.

{"Headline": "Google Is Trying Too Hard (or Not Hard Enough) to Diversify", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "The internet giant is being sued by former employees who say the company is going too far with diversity. Other lawsuits accuse it of the opposite.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Google became one of the first technology companies to release a race and gender breakdown of its work force. It revealed \u2014 to no one\u2019s surprise \u2014 that its staff was largely white or Asian and decidedly male.Since then, Google has made modest progress in its plan to create a more diverse work force, with the percentage of women at the company ticking up a bit. But a spate of recent incidents and lawsuits highlight the challenges the company has faced as it has been dragged into a national discussion regarding politics, race and gender in the workplace.Google is being sued by former employees for going too far with its diversity effort. It is also being sued for not going far enough.\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201dGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201dInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.In 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.In January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.Some Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.Last month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201dMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201dIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201dMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.The two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.Mr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.Ms. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201dSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.Google\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwakaAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Chaos After Trump", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat happens to American politics after Donald Trump? Do we snap back to normal or do things spin ever more widely out of control?The best indicator we have so far is the example of Italy since the reign of Silvio Berlusconi. And the main lesson there is that once the norms of acceptable behavior are violated and once the institutions of government are weakened, it is very hard to re-establish them. Instead, you get this cycle of ever more extreme behavior, as politicians compete to be the most radical outsider. The political center collapses, the normal left/right political categories cease to apply and you see the rise of strange new political groups that are crazier than anything you could have imagined before.If America follows the Italian example, by 2025 we\u2019ll look back at Trump nostalgically as some sort of beacon of relative normalcy. And by the way, if America follows the Italian example, Trump will never go away.Silvio Berlusconi first came to power for the same reasons Trump and other populists have been coming to power around the world: Voters were disgusted by a governing elite that seemed corrupt and out of touch. They felt swamped by waves of immigrants, frustrated by economic stagnation and disgusted by the cultural values of the cosmopolitan urbanites.In office, Berlusconi did nothing to address Italy\u2019s core problems, but he did degrade public discourse with his speech, weaken the structures of government with his corruption and offend basic decency with his Bunga Bunga sex parties and his general priapic lewdness.In short, Berlusconi, like Trump, did nothing to address the sources of public anger, but he did erase any restraints on the way it could be expressed.This past weekend\u2019s elections in Italy were dominated by parties that took many of Berlusconi\u2019s excesses and turned them up a notch.Italy is now a poster child for the three big trends that are undermining democracies around the world:Berlusconi, like Trump, undermined those norms. And now Berlusconi\u2019s rivals across the political spectrum have waged a campaign that was rife with conspiracy theories, misinformation and naked appeals to race.Third, the deterioration of debate caused by social media. At the dawn of the internet, people hoped free communication would lead to an epoch of peace, understanding and democratic communication. Instead, we\u2019re seeing polarization, alternative information universes and the rise of autocracy.In Italy, as with Trump and his Facebook campaign, the social media platform seems decentralizing, but it actually buttresses authoritarian ends.The underlying message is clear. As Mounk has argued, the populist wave is still rising. The younger generations are more radical, on left and right. The rising political tendencies combine lavish spending from the left with racially charged immigrant restrictions from the right.Vladimir Putin\u2019s admirers are surging. The center is still hollowing out. Nothing is inevitable in life, but liberal democracy clearly ain\u2019t going to automatically fix itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canceled Deals and Pulped Books, as the Publishing Industry Confronts Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsElizabeth Rusch\u2019s picture book about Mario Molina, the Mexico-born chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his work studying the destruction of the Earth\u2019s ozone layer, was a decade in the making. It took her nearly 30 drafts to get it right, and she was thrilled when the children\u2019s publisher Charlesbridge acquired it in 2013. The book was finally due out next month.Then, news broke that the book\u2019s illustrator, David Diaz, had been accused of sexual harassment. Worried the book would be clouded by the controversy, Charlesbridge decided to postpone publication of \u201cMario and the Hole in the Sky,\u201d pulp the finished copies and hire a new illustrator.\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that people won\u2019t be able to read this version,\u201d said Ms. Rusch, who posted a comment on Facebook strongly supporting the women who came forward. \u201cBut it\u2019s the right thing to do for the book, and the industry, as painful as it was.\u201dThe list of prominent authors mired in harassment scandals has grown in recent months, and now includes best-selling children\u2019s book authors, prominent political journalists and a National Book Award-winning novelist. As allegations of sexual harassment sweep through the publishing industry \u2014 resulting in canceled book deals, boycotts by bookstores and expulsions from writers\u2019 conferences \u2014 publishers, agents and editors are grappling with how to tackle the issue. As in the entertainment business, where celebrated actors have lost starring roles in TV shows and movies, publishing companies are facing painful trade-offs as they cut ties with accused men in hopes of minimizing any collateral damage.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty tumultuous time,\u201d said Sarah Burnes, a literary agent with the Gernert Company. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get it right all the time, but I do think people understand now that these situations are more often about power, and not about sex.\u201dThe disparate responses underscore the commercial and ethical challenges publishing houses face. Some, including Hachette Book Group, are expanding the use of morals clauses and \u201cauthor conduct\u201d clauses in book contracts, which allow publishers to cancel book deals if the author is credibly accused of unethical behavior. But some editors and publishers say privately that it\u2019s difficult to impose a code of conduct on writers, who are not their employees.\u201cI was very saddened to see how many women had left the industry or quit writing or quit illustrating because of something that had happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are losing talent because of this, and we need to find a way to privilege the women who have been hurt over the men who make publishing houses a lot of money.\u201dAnother blockbuster author, Jay Asher, whose young adult novel \u201cThirteen Reasons Why\u201d has more than four million copies in print, was let go by his agent following a chorus of online accusations that he had harassed women and behaved in a predatory manner at an annual industry conference. (Mr. Asher has disputed the women\u2019s claims.)Grove Atlantic and Hachette Book Group, which both publish Mr. Alexie\u2019s books, issued statements saying that they were surprised and troubled by the accusations, but that they will continue to publish his earlier books.Publishers face complex calculations as they weigh whether or not to cut ties with an author. Canceling a book can lead to lost profits, but publishing and promoting a book by an author accused of misconduct can have other negative ramifications.After the recent rash of allegations against prominent authors, Jamie Thomas, a manager and children\u2019s book buyer at the bookstore Women & Children First in Chicago, removed books by Mr. Asher, Mr. Dashner and Mr. Alexie from the store\u2019s shelves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have our customers having to come in here and ask why we\u2019re supporting someone accused of sexual misconduct,\u201d she said.Danielle Foster, the co-owner of Bookworks in Albuquerque, said that she will not reorder books by Mr. Alexie and will instead be featuring works by up-and-coming Native American authors. Still, she is wary of limiting customers\u2019 access to books by popular writers and said the store still has \u201cmany books on our shelves by accused authors.\u201d\u201cThese discussions need to happen among booksellers and publishers, and at the same time, do you censor the art?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the stance that we don\u2019t want to censor or ban anything.\u201dBut at a moment of heightened scrutiny, some publishers are willing to sacrifice worthwhile books \u2014 and lose money \u2014 to signal their support for the #MeToo movement.\u201cApparently no industry is exempt from the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and misogyny,\u201d said Yolanda Scott, the associate publisher and editorial director of Charlesbridge, which destroyed finished copies of the picture book \u201cMario and the Hole in the Sky\u201d after harassment allegations against its illustrator surfaced. \u201cWe want the children\u2019s publishing world to be a safe and equitable space.\u201dThough finished copies had already gone out to book critics and pulling it at such a late stage was costly, Charlesbridge decided publishing the book with Mr. Diaz\u2019s name and illustrations might dampen enthusiasm for the title from readers, reviewers, librarians and booksellers. The company, now searching for a new illustrator, has pushed the publication to 2019.In an interview, Mr. Diaz acknowledged that he made flirtatious comments and advances at a conference hosted by the Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators and that he had gone through harassment training after the society\u2019s board received a complaint about his behavior in 2012. He also went through a probation period where his conduct was regularly reviewed. When a separate allegation arose in the fall of 2017 about a sexual comment that Mr. Diaz made to a woman at a conference five years earlier, before his harassment training, Mr. Diaz voluntarily resigned from the board and apologized to the woman who made the complaint.\u201cIt stings a little bit, knowing the work that I\u2019ve done, but I support their choice,\u201d Mr. Diaz said about Charlesbridge\u2019s decision to withdraw the book with his illustrations. \u201cIf I were the author, I would want my book to have every chance at success, without anything attached to it that might hinder it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Carla Vallejos Blanco, 29, of Corrientes, Argentina, was visiting New York with a friend, a woman who decided to skip the flight. Two other men were killed: Tristan Hill, 29; and Daniel Thompson, 34, whom a law enforcement official described as an employee of the helicopter tour company that operated the craft.Mr. Hill was engaged to be married, according to his younger brother, Brendan. The date was less than two months away.\u201cHe always inspired me to be better,\u201d Brendan Hill said. \u201cI was getting ready to write a speech for the wedding, not the eulogy for his funeral.\u201dTristan Hill was one of three brothers raised in Reno, Nev. He played basketball at Missouri Valley College, and he stayed involved with the sport after graduation. He coached with the Boys and Girls Club of America and organized a charity basketball camp for children in Reno, a fund-raiser for the Boys and Girls Club.Brendan Hill said he was always jealous of his brother\u2019s drive, and Mr. Hill\u2019s short career showed a young man with wide interests and varied talents. He worked at the Sierra Nevada Corporation for a time, and briefly co-owned a bar in Reno called the Stamp Social Club, which was in the basement of an old 1930s post office.

{"Headline": "Why Reining in Amazon Could be Difficult: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon.\u2022 Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.\u2022 Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.\u2022 Another FANG stock took a tumble.\u2022 The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments.Amazon hasn\u2019t responded to President Trump\u2019s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won\u2019t.Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.\u2014 Peter EavisNew York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:\u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201dNew York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.Here are the proposed changes:1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201dShares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages.Their lawyers separately said the government\u2019s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.- Chad BrayTammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.Ms. Kiely, who will be based in Menlo Park, Calif., joined Goldman in 1999 and had headed its semiconductor investment banking team since 2006, becoming a partner in 2014.

{"Headline": "Hitting the Road in Quebec and Looking for Your Guidance: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy colleague Dan Bilefsky, who has returned to his native Montreal to join our Canada reporting team, is embarking on an exciting, new project as The Times continues to expand its presence on the ground in Canada. And, as he explains below, he\u2019s looking for your help:Twenty-eight years ago, I left Montreal to go to university. Eventually, I became a foreign correspondent, a path that took me from hunting war criminals in the Balkans to reporting on human rights abuses in Turkey and even to writing about a high-tech brothel in Antwerp.Now I am back home to cover Canada along with our other correspondents, Catherine Porter, Ian Austen and Dan Levin. I am especially eager to rediscover my home province of Quebec, to understand its multiple identities and preoccupations.So I am taking a road trip, driving across Quebec, from March 12-22. And I am appealing to you \u2014 readers in Quebec as well as the rest of Canada \u2014 to be my guides.My trip comes as The Times is renewing its focus on Canada, which has become our largest and most engaged international market. Our roots here go deep. The paper has been covering Canada since 1851, its first year of operation. The nation\u2019s birth in 1867 was front-page news.These days, in an era of populism across the border and across the Atlantic, Quebec\u2019s evolution offers many lessons, for both Canada and the world.The Quebec of my youth was a place of simmering cultural battles. French Quebecers were agitating for their rights to be respected, while thousands of Anglophones were fleeing.Today, separatism is largely in retreat, poutine is a national treasure, though proudly Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and people the world over see Canada \u2014 and Quebec \u2014 as enviable social and economic models.During my trip, I plan to visit Montreal, Maniwaki, H\u00e9rouxville, Quebec City and Saguenay \u2014 five places that show very different faces of the province.I will start in Montreal, where, among other things, I plan to meet with Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, 27, the charismatic co-leader of Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, a left-wing party that supports an independent Quebec. He was one of the leaders of the large 2012 student protests against increases in university tuition fees that energized a new generation of political activism in the province.After Montreal, it\u2019s off to nearby Maniwaki, where I will visit the indigenous reserve Kitigan Zibi. There, I will join colleagues from The Times\u2019s Race Related team in a Facebook chat with Cezin Nottaway, an Algonquin chef who is as adept hunting moose with a shotgun as she is wielding a spatula and frying pan.Then I will visit H\u00e9rouxville, which, fairly or not, more than a decade ago became synonymous with a xenophobic Quebec after the town council unanimously adopted a code of conduct calling on immigrants not to stone women or set them on fire. I am interested in finding out whether and how attitudes have shifted.Last stop is Saguenay, where many manufacturing jobs have been lost because of globalization. I want to learn how this has shaped people\u2019s perspectives there.I want your help in building out the rest of my itinerary and figuring out what else I should do. Who are the cultural figures and interesting local characters I should meet? What sites, neighborhoods or restaurants should I visit? Who can show me a slice of the real Quebec?And because no road trip is complete without some music to blast in the car, I want you to send me your favorite songs to be an ideal soundtrack for driving through Quebec. (I have been told that my current list, which includes Leonard Cohen, Garou and Roch Voisine, needs a radical update.) I plan to publish a playlist from the best suggestions.As always, Netflix sometimes changes its mind at the last minute about programming so some of Scott\u2019s recommendations may not appear on your screen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brutal Choice in Houston: Sell Home at a Loss or Face New Floods", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBuilt to FloodKATY, Tex. \u2014 When Hurricane Harvey struck Houston, floodwaters swept through Eileen and Jeff Swanson\u2019s two-story brick home, blanketing the first floor in muck and nearly destroying a domestic existence 12 years in the making. Their china cabinet, in the family for three generations, was reduced to a sodden mess. A couch, once a soft red, had blushed into a watery burgundy; the carpet squished like grass at the bottom of a marsh. A dirty foot-high water line ran wall to wall, marking the local crest of an event that the National Weather Service called \u201cthe most significant tropical cyclone rainfall event in United States history.\u201dAfter the floodwaters receded, the Swansons returned to a house ravaged, endless questions, few answers \u2014 and a looming decision.They are not alone. Hundreds of homeowners in Canyon Gate at Cinco Ranch, a quiet subdivision in a west Houston suburb, are mired in a slow, frustrating effort to rebuild. Others have formed an uneasy exodus, their attachment to familiar places and routines irreparably battered by a storm that dumped 50-plus inches and caused widespread flooding. They are now selling their gutted homes at well below pre-storm prices.The fundamental decision \u2014 stay or go \u2014 is one being faced by homeowners all around the Houston area. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of storms like Harvey, no neighborhood is immune from being flooded again. But the Swansons and other homeowners in Canyon Gate face a far more certain prospect: Their neighborhood is on land that was designed to be flooded. It is part of a reservoir that was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s to prevent catastrophic flooding downtown, a fact that developers did little to publicize when they built Canyon Gate in the 1990s.On a blistering September afternoon at the Swanson house, 20 box fans and an industrial blower ran nonstop in a battle against rot and decay. The family was still consigned to five rooms upstairs, and Ms. Swanson, 48, a senior executive assistant at an industrial automation company, was downstairs watching a YouTube demonstration of how to hang wallboard. At the top of the steps, Mr. Swanson, 52, was compiling a mental to-do list: Make another trip to Home Depot, haul more stuff to the storage unit, get back in time to help with the delivery of a stack of new wallboard. Their 23-year-old son Allen, who is severely developmentally disabled, was watching television. It was already a familiar routine. \u201cIt feels like our life is somewhere between, \u2018Where do I start?\u2019 and \u2018Why isn\u2019t this getting done?\u2019\u201d Mr. Swanson said.There was a lot keeping the Swansons in Canyon Gate. They had paid off the house, purchased in 2006 for $225,000, just a few months before the flood. That freed them from a monthly mortgage. The home was close to their younger son Nick\u2019s school and in a neighborhood they loved, and they had adapted the space to suit Allen\u2019s disabilities \u2014 he has seizures, so they needed open areas where they could watch him from other parts of the house. In a hundred different ways, floods or no floods, this was their home.And yet the case for leaving was clear. Two weeks before the floods, Mr. Swanson had quit his job as a security guard, with the intention of looking for work without so many late hours. The Swansons had some savings, but the money was meant to pay for Nick, 17, a high school junior, to attend college. With only one income, there was little money left over for repairs and renovations that would cost upward of $60,000.Hanging over the entire process was the knowledge that a similar \u2014 or even worse \u2014 flood could hit again, possibly even as soon as the next hurricane season. \u201cI am pretty sure we would not have moved into this house if we knew,\u201d Ms. Swanson said.Hugh Durlam knew he was staying. As a 13-year resident and former homeowners association board member, Mr. Durlam was completely invested in Canyon Gate. But he wanted to know what happened to others in the neighborhood. So on the Canyon Gate Facebook page he administers, he recently posted a survey asking homeowners if renovations were completed or close to completion, if they were still rebuilding, or if they had not yet started.Of the 202 responses, all but two were involved in some kind of renovation.\u201cThis is going to be a brand-new 20-year-old community. It\u2019s worth saving,\u201d said Mr. Durlam, who works for a Houston engineering firm. He supports a plan to deepen the reservoir and build a levee to protect the neighborhood, he said, \u201csomething that should have been done a long time ago.\u201dChristina Raena Micu isn\u2019t certain about what to do next. When Harvey hit, she anxiously watched television footage of the storm from a Dallas hotel room, where she had taken shelter with her husband and two of her three children. Her 20-year-old son had stayed behind, sending dispatches as the waters invaded their neighborhood, before finally evacuating in chest-deep water with only a backpack.Inside Ms. Micu\u2019s home, everything on the first floor was submerged within or floating atop a couple of feet of muddy water. When she returned from Dallas, she rushed to her bedroom hoping her collection of childhood photos had somehow survived. She had left the photo albums in a pile on the carpeted floor with plans to one day organize them on a bookshelf. They were stuck together, the images swirled into watercolor blurs, too damaged to save. But what she saw next was more immediately concerning: mold.\u201cI have a 5-year-old son with asthma who has already been hospitalized once for it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t just move back in. It\u2019s much more complicated than that for me.\u201dAfter she moved her family into an apartment about 10 minutes away, signing a one-year lease with some financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ms. Micu, a real estate investor, embarked on a monthslong renovation of her flood-soaked home, ripping out the floors and walls and repeatedly treating the house with mold bombs, foggers and air purifiers.Almost every day, Ms. Micu weighed her choices. Some days, she was sure she would stay. The house was in a safe neighborhood, roomy with a swing set in the backyard. Before the storm, she was even planning an addition. Other days, she knew moving was her only choice. Both options were expensive. Selling meant taking a big hit: She paid $183,000 for the house six years ago and figured it was not worth much more than half of that now. But for as long as they lived in their temporary apartment, she was paying rent and a mortgage. FEMA gave her about $16,000, but the renovation bids were all around $70,000.By the time the four-bedroom house passed a mold test in February, Ms. Micu was thinking that she might split the difference. Move her family elsewhere, but keep the house as a rental. \u201cWith my son\u2019s immune system, I can\u2019t have a situation where the mold is a trigger,\u201d said Ms. Micu, a Houston native whose parents are Filipino immigrants. \u201cI can\u2019t take the chance.\u201dSomething else was nagging Ms. Micu. She wondered how the subdivisions could have been built in a reservoir. And if they had to be sacrificed, shouldn\u2019t the homeowners be compensated?\u201cThis pushed our lives in another path,\u201d she said. \u201cHow could we have known that we would return from Dallas and practically have to start over?\u201dThe questions are what pushed her to look for a law firm. In September, she became one of the lead plaintiffs in a federal class-action suit against the Army Corps of Engineers.\u201cHarvey took away my photo album with pictures from every year of my life. It took so many things. It took the purse that my husband bought me as a gift. He spent three months looking for it,\u201d she said.\u201cHarvey took away my sense of security, but so did the Army Corps of Engineers. What happened to us was wrong.\u201dWhen Paulette Delynn Archer, 70, greets a visitor in the doorway of her one-story brick house, she is framed by large picture windows that reveal the emptiness inside, where flooding and renovation have left little more than wood studs between the front door and the back patio.\u201cCome in, let me show you the house,\u201d Ms. Archer offered in a cheery voice that soon gave way to silence. \u201cWell, this used to be my house. Now it\u2019s just a shell.\u201dMs. Archer had once delighted in having guests over to see her four-bedroom home, where everything was the color of soft gold or pumpkin. This is where she had raised her only son, where her husband and mother spent their final days, where she had planned to spend her remaining days. But the four feet of mud and water that gushed through the house had demanded something radically different.Two decades ago, Ms. Archer and her husband had paid roughly $200,000 for the house and watched it appreciate to more than $300,000. She said it would cost well over $100,000 to renovate the house and her FEMA grant would only cover a small fraction.In the mornings, while staying at a La Quinta Inn, Ms. Archer would make lists in a blue three-ring binder of items lost, mostly items that came to her in her dreams. \u201cI finally stopped trying to sum up my entire life. It was just too stressful. But that list told me that as much as I loved my house, there was no way out of this but to sell,\u201d said Ms. Archer, who spent the first part of her career as a flight attendant then became a police officer for the Port of Houston Authority. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a loan at my age and with no job. How would I pay it back?\u201dShe had lost everything once before, as a teenager in a house fire. The crushing loss felt the same; the inability to recover felt far different.Like other homeowners, Ms. Archer said she had no idea the house was built in a reservoir. She was told over and over that she did not need flood insurance, she said. Two or three times she purchased it anyway and then let the policy expire.Three years earlier, she had taken out a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners over 62 years old to convert equity into cash. After the flood, her house was worth less than the loan balance. It left her in a terrible bind. \u201cI am sitting here thinking that I am not going to be able to get out of this situation,\u201d she said.Most residents whose homes flooded during Hurricane Harvey had no clue that their gated community was built in an area prone to such damage in extreme storms.She eventually negotiated with the lender to offer the house as a short sale for $125,000. Earlier this month, Ms. Archer closed on the sale and walked away for good. Now fearful of floods and the sound of hard rain, she plans to move near a nephew in Dallas, where she will re-enter the job market 10 years after her retirement.\u201cThere is no way I could have imagined I would be starting over at this point in my life,\u201d she said, then sighed deeply. \u201cI know everything will be O.K. Eventually.\u201dOn a fall afternoon, as they were in the garage sorting the few salvageable pieces \u2014 the roar of trucks carting debris in the distance \u2014 Mr. Swanson turned to Ms. Swanson, his wife of 24 years.\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave. Do you?\u201d he blurted out. Ms. Swanson shook her head. Neither did she.For the Swansons, rebuilding was the only choice. They knew it would be hard, but this was home.Instead of returning to work, Mr. Swanson pitched in on the repairs. \u201cFor now,\u201d Ms. Swanson said, \u201cit make more sense for Jeff to be home helping with the house rather than to be on a job making $12 an hour.\u201d The couple also bought flood insurance.In October, they received a FEMA grant for about $10,300, part of the more than $91 million the federal agency distributed in Fort Bend County. They also received donated kitchen countertops and cabinets through a state program and a $25,000 grant from Fort Bend Recovers, a local public-private disaster assistance coalition, for construction costs. There was still a gap, but it was manageable, and less than the cost of a new house and mortgage.The numbers made sense, but Mr. Swanson said he also had a more personal reason for staying.\u201cIt took me this many years to finally become a Texan,\u201d he said. \u201cHarvey is not going to run us away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is It Time for More Adult Supervision at Facebook?", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMr. Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old Harvard dropout, has encountered doubters every step of the way since starting Facebook in his dorm room and building it into a juggernaut valued at more than $500 billion. The hubris accumulated from the achievements is now plain to see. Mr. Zuckerberg seems either oblivious to \u2014 or incapable of assuming \u2014 the responsibilities of running an enterprise of extraordinary political, cultural and social influence.It is evident even in the company\u2019s lame response to the latest imbroglio. The New York Times and The Observer of London chronicled, with the help of a whistle-blower, how a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, exploited Facebook user information. Worse, they say, Facebook knew about it and failed to alert customers. The tin-eared first lines of defense over such harrowing claims were to argue that what occurred was not technically a \u201cdata breach\u201d and to belatedly suspend the firm\u2019s account.Responses from outside Facebook were notably, and deservedly, more severe. Lawmakers in the United States called for investigations into the leaks. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she sits. A Conservative British lawmaker called for him to testify in a parliamentary inquiry over Russian meddling in Britain\u2019s referendum to leave the European Union. For over a year, Mr. Zuckerberg has been ducking such requests even as he embarked on a road trip across America last year to meet people in every state.Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Mr. Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across the social network didn\u2019t influence the presidential election.

{"Headline": "The Price They Pay ", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York Times and ProPublica, the independent, nonprofit investigative journalism organization, collaborated on this article.The burden of high drug costs weighs most heavily on the sickest Americans.Drug makers have raised prices on treatments for life-threatening or chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis, diabetes and cancer. In turn, insurers have shifted more of those costs onto consumers. Saddled with high deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs that expose them to a drug\u2019s rising list price, many people are paying thousands of dollars a month merely to survive.For more than a year, President Trump and Democrats in Congress have promised to take action on high drug prices, but despite a flurry of proposals, little has changed. These are the stories of Americans living daily with the reality of high-cost drugs. And there are millions of others just like them.With an annual income of less than $20,000, Ms. Johnson doesn\u2019t come close to being able to afford the 12 medications her doctors have prescribed for congestive heart failure, diabetes and related complications.She is one of the many who finds herself \u201cin between,\u201d as one of her doctors described it, narrowly missing the requirements for assistance but making too little to afford her prescriptions.Here\u2019s a rundown of the math: Ms. Johnson\u2019s Social Security disability income of $19,560 in 2017 placed her above the cutoff for receiving additional government assistance for her prescriptions, called Extra Help, even though nearly every dollar of her income is already spoken for, from paying Medicare premiums to food and other household expenses.These are tough choices. Sometimes she stops taking the short-acting Novolog, staying on the longer-acting insulin, Tresiba, as well as her heart medications, like bumetanide and digoxin. \u201cI prioritize the heart stuff over the insulin because the heart stuff is more immediate,\u201d she said.Ms. Johnson understands the risks; she was a health educator for people with H.I.V. and AIDS, helping patients enroll in programs that lowered their drug costs.Her blood sugar has risen dangerously high, and a little over a year ago, she was hospitalized for three weeks because she said she wasn\u2019t on the right diuretic to reduce excess fluid.Last June, she was approved for the Novo Nordisk assistance program, allowing her to begin taking the Novolog insulin again. As of mid-November, Ms. Johnson had spent $2,782 on prescription drugs, not counting the cost of the free insulin, according to a report provided by her pharmacy.For another drug, Entresto, an expensive treatment for heart failure, Ms. Johnson participates in a clinical trial that provides the drug for free. Once that ends, she faces another hurdle: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a discount or I\u2019m not going to be on Entresto anymore.\u201dIn January, she started all over again. \u201cI\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people are as well.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: In a statement, Novo Nordisk said it provided some forms of insulin at reduced costs to help patients who are struggling. \u201cThis patient is an exceptional example, reminding us that we need to continuously evaluate how we keep our support programs sustainable while covering as many of those in need as possible.\u201d Ms. Bostwick was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2013. Insurance covered the first drug she took, Tecfidera, but required her to contribute $1,000 a month.\u201cI didn\u2019t cry when I was handed the diagnosis of M.S.,\u201d Ms. Bostwick said. But after learning how much prescriptions would cost, \u201cThat was when I felt truly helpless.\u201dMs. Bostwick, a former journalist, has coverage through her husband\u2019s employer because she can no longer work. They hit their $4,500 annual deductible in the very first month of every year because Gilenya, the drug she had been taking until last fall, carried a list price of about $5,500 a month. The couple put aside $375 every month to make sure they could cover that deductible. The New York Times would like to hear from people about their experiences paying for prescription drugs.The Bostwicks, who recently decided to divorce, have drained their savings, given up family vacations, and sold a motorcycle, a car, furniture and other belongings. Changes to her husband\u2019s employee benefits this year means another $1,000 out of pocket annually. Ms. Bostwick, who is disabled, said she plans to sign up for Medicare coverage after she loses access to her husband\u2019s insurance.Ms. Bostwick suffered severe side effects that led her to stop taking Gilenya, and she\u2019s recently been approved to begin a new drug, Ocrevus.\u201cThis is such a huge bill and it\u2019s not really something that we can forgo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re your basic middle-class couple. We don\u2019t have an extravagant lifestyle or anything like that. But we always seem to fall through the cracks.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND:In a statement, Novartis pointed to its patient assistance program that eliminates monthly out-of-pocket costs for most commercially insured patients (Ms. Bostwick said her family income is too high to qualify for most assistance programs).In 2007, Mr. Botts was 24 and three weeks into his first year at the University of San Francisco School of Law when he was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a blood cancer. His doctor prescribed Gleevec, an effective but expensive medication that until recently cost more than $140,000 per year. The price recently began to go down in the face of generic competition.Mr. Botts had no money to spare. For the first months of his treatment, he was able to take another patient\u2019s unused medications that were no longer needed (she was dying and his oncologist had connected them). Then, after receiving coverage through a former employer, Mr. Botts moved up his wedding date so he could switch to his wife\u2019s policy. But between his deductible and out-of-pocket costs, his expenses added up. Mr. Botts applied for assistance through a program run by Gleevec\u2019s maker, Novartis, but said he was rejected because his wife made slightly too much.Without options, Mr. Botts tapped into his law school loans. \u201cAt 24, when you\u2019re really not making any money, you don\u2019t really have any options other than that,\u201d he said.Mr. Botts dropped out of law school. \u201cWhen everyone else is 24, 25 and going out and partying,\u201d he was worried about ensuring he had money \u201cso I could make sure I paid for my chemotherapy meds and still go to class.\u201dToday, he owes more than $73,000. He works at a debt collection company in the Bay Area, managing corporate relationships for banks. The irony is not lost on him. \u201cWe have a huge pile of medical debt that resulted from all of this. It just hasn\u2019t been paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be paying those up until the day I die.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: Diabetes has driven nearly all of Ms. Walker\u2019s adult life.Ms. Walker, who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 9, dropped out of college, forgoing her aspirations to be an artist, in part because she needed health insurance. She sought out retail jobs with coverage, selling suits at Men\u2019s Warehouse and Jos. A. Bank. She got an insulin pump, helping keep her stable. Even then, she struggled to pay her out-of-pocket costs, spending $300 a month for insulin and other supplies.Last fall, she became unemployed after taking a new job that didn\u2019t work out. Without coverage, Ms. Walker stockpiled empty vials of insulin in her refrigerator, using a syringe to suck out whatever drops were left. She once turned to Facebook, pleading for help, and within 45 minutes a nearby resident offered her two insulin pens.By December, Ms. Walker obtained subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. She pays a premium of $3.95 a month and $25 a month for insulin.But even though her health coverage is more secure, she still worries that she could wind up rationing her insulin again if the health care law were repealed.\u201cI think in an alternate universe, there\u2019s a me that\u2019s not diabetic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wonder what she\u2019s doing. What life is she living? I\u2019m stuck.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: The drug makers have been accused of price-fixing in several patient lawsuits, and several states are investigating.Despite the uproar, all three manufacturers raised their list prices again in 2017, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database from Elsevier, an information analytics company.Last year, Ms. Williams\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Amy, began complaining about an itchy bottom \u2014 a classic sign, her doctor later informed her, of pinworms. Ms. Williams gave Amy an over-the-counter medicine and her daughter\u2019s symptoms seemed to improve.When the pinworms returned a while later, the doctor prescribed albendazole, a prescription treatment that has been around for decades. Ms. Williams thought little of it, until she checked the price with her pharmacist. The drug cost $724 for a four-tablet treatment, and according to her drug plan, she had to pay about $250. Because her doctor recommended that all four family members be treated, she was suddenly facing a $1,000 bill.To save money, Ms. Williams decided to fill prescriptions for her daughter and herself, but to buy the over-the-counter treatment for her husband and younger daughter, who did not have symptoms.A few weeks later, Ms. Williams found pinworms in her younger daughter\u2019s diaper, and had to pay $250 for another round of albendazole.She said she is furious that she was forced to pay $750 for an old drug. \u201cThey price it because they can,\u201d said Ms. Williams said. \u201cWall Street decided they could make money off prescription drugs, which is just scary and depressing.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: A spokesman for Impax Laboratories declined to say why Amedra raised the price.Ms. Williams saved her bottle of albendazole as a bitter reminder of how she once had to pay hundreds of dollars for a handful of pills. The other day she noticed a detail she had not seen before: Impax does not even make the drug. It is still manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., Mr. Knutson had begun a two-pronged treatment aimed at attacking a large tumor threatening his pulmonary artery. As chemotherapy dripped into his bloodstream, he learned that his insurance company wouldn\u2019t cover the second phase, a pill called Xeloda that he could take at home.Doctors at Mayo wrote to the Knutsons\u2019 prescription benefits manager, CVS Caremark, to explain that Mr. Knutson\u2019s kidney disease made him a bad candidate for the usual treatment, with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.After a denial and failing two appeals, Mr. Knutson, a retired farm equipment salesman, and his wife Julie, decided to pay for the drug themselves. \u201cWe felt like we didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Mrs. Knutson said. After using a coupon they found online, the pill cost $1,000 per prescription. After three courses of the drug, Mr. Knutson\u2019s tumor shrank enough to enable surgery. He is now in remission.After the operation, the Knutsons appealed again \u2014 this time through the state\u2019s insurance commissioner. Within 24 hours, the reviewer ordered CVS to cover the pills.The Knutsons received a check in July 2016 for $2,790.81; they turned around and donated $3,000 to the Mayo Clinic.The fighting took its toll, Mr. Knutson said. \u201cWhen you are in that situation, you are really fragile, not as capable as you are when you are healthy in an everyday situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to make it so difficult that you just give up.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: While CVS Caremark said in a statement that it respected the care provided by the Mayo Clinic\u2019s oncologists, it added: \u201cThis case illustrates that medical experts can disagree on whether experimental therapy may work for a patient, and we certainly hope it has for Mr. Knutson.\u201d Every three months, Mr. Yeagley, a stock trader, hops into his car and drives seven hours \u2014 390 miles \u2014 from his home outside Philadelphia to a Walmart half a mile across the Canadian border. There, he buys Xeljanz to treat his son Jonathan\u2019s alopecia areata, a type of hair loss caused by an immune disorder. He drives back the same day.In the United States, Xeljanz costs about $50,000 a year (through a drug discount website). That\u2019s after Pfizer raised the price of Xeljanz by nearly 8 percent in January. In Canada, the price tag is $15,000. \u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money to throw away,\u201d said Mr. Yeagley, who has made five trips so far. Mr. Yeagley\u2019s son spoke on FaceTime with a Canadian doctor who asked for pictures and reviewed laboratory results before writing a prescription so the Yeagleys could legally obtain the drug in Canada.Jonathan, who is 20, worries about shouldering the costs in the future. \u201cI don\u2019t tell him that I think about it a lot but I do think about it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for what he does for me but I don\u2019t know how long it can go on.\u201dTHE BACKGROUND: Advertisement"}

There, if they make it, they will spend the winter breeding before heading back to birth and raise their young on the island.The Inuit, who share an intimate connection with these caribou, have always said that a few lead and the rest follow along this treacherous Arctic journey. Now, new technology is confirming this centuries-old indigenous wisdom.Their methods may also contribute to the study of other animal migrations in the wild. There are even lessons for your average human: In scary situations, it\u2019s nice to have others around.Scientists have known that social interactions of organisms from bacteria to humans influence the decisions they make as species. But it\u2019s difficult to study these interactions among migrating animals.Scientists have studied caribou migrations by counting passing animals, taking aerial photos and attaching GPS collars to track the movements of a few members. But drone videos offer a more complete view of the varying behaviors of migrating caribou.The researchers in this study were able to observe how sex or age influenced interactions while traveling, looking at who stayed close to whom and which animals started movements and which copied. They discovered, for example, that calves rely on social cues and stay close to others, but mature bulls were more autonomous.\u201cIf you want to understand the full picture you have to consider the social context, because in this group of moving species, the interactions between individuals can be just as important as the traits of individuals themselves,\u201d said Dr. Berdahl.He thinks that when these caribou come together, they can better sense and respond to the perilous ice they cross. It\u2019s called collective sensing.In the future, combining drone footage of behavior with high resolution maps of terrain may offer clues to how these animals and others deal with danger.\u201cSo many migratory species travel in groups,\u201d said Dr. Berdahl. \u201cNature\u2019s had countless years to discover and perfect these algorithms for controlling distributed systems,\u201d and now it\u2019s time we uncover and use them.____Using information from a research institution, a video credit on an earlier version of this article misstated the videographer who recorded a video.

{"Headline": "Prince William Will Go to Israel, in First Official Visit by a British Royal", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrince William, who is second in line to the British throne, will visit Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories in the occupied West Bank. No specific date was announced. His father and grandfather have traveled to Israel, but not as part of an official royal visit.The British announcement, coming barely a week after the Trump administration said it was accelerating the opening of a United States Embassy in Jerusalem, was more good news for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is mired in corruption investigations. The embassy opening is expected on May 14, to mark the 70th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel.\u201cThis is a historic visit, the first of its kind, and he will be welcomed here with great affection,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said of the prince\u2019s visit in a statement.But old grievances and present-day realities mean that traveling between Israel and the Palestinian territories will likely require all the royal finesse William can muster.Israel\u2019s 70th anniversary also marks 70 years of the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes and became refugees during the hostilities leading up to, and the war surrounding, Israel\u2019s creation.Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in a statement, \u201cPrince William, who accepted an invitation from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, will be a welcome guest, not just of the leadership but of the Palestinian people who will provide him with the opportunity to share their stories firsthand and connect on a human level.\u201d\u201cThis trip will also serve to enhance diplomatic and cultural relations between His Royal Highness and the people of Palestine,\u201d Ms. Ashrawi added.Israel has extended many invitations before, but all previous visits by British royals have been classified as private and unofficial.In October 1994, the queen\u2019s husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, attended a ceremony honoring his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, at Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial, for hiding Jews in her palace during the Nazi occupation of Greece.The queen\u2019s eldest son, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and the heir to the throne, attended the funerals in Jerusalem of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the former prime minister and president Shimon Peres in 2016.After Mr. Peres\u2019s funeral, Prince Charles made a discreet visit to the grave of his grandmother Princess Alice at the Church of Mary Magdalene on the Mount of Olives. The visit was all the more diplomatically delicate because the grave is in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 war in a move that was not internationally recognized.Some critics retorted that given its colonialist past, Britain should be the last country to preach about occupation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking at the Paralympics With a New York Times Photographer", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylensPYEONGCHANG, South Korea \u2014 After parking his car at the Paralympics Alpine skiing venue, Chang W. Lee climbed 40 steep steps, scaled a hill with an imposing gradual incline, passed through security, climbed some more steps, walked up another hill, climbed two more sets of metal steps labeled \u201cCaution: Slippery Surface,\u201d trudged across a flat expanse of snow, scaled another small hill to ride a chair lift, climbed still more slippery steps, trudged across more snow and then finally lumbered down a ramp.That was just to get to the media center.To reach his position on the mountain, he had to take a gondola further up the course. Throughout the whole trek, he lugged 50 pounds of gear.\u201cA lot of times, I said, \u2018Why am I doing this? I could go easy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lee said, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be here only once, and every second counts, every moment counts.\u201dMuch of it is skill and anticipation, of course \u2014 understanding the terrain to know where to stand and when. But a fair amount of instinct is involved: And he has exceptional instincts. At the biathlon on Tuesday March 13, he positioned himself where he could not only see the skiers cresting a hill, but also the finish line, framed by flags whipping in the wind. Then, one of his favorite images from the games unfolded right before him in a moment that he called a triumph of the human spirit. The American biathlete Oksana Masters, who had dislocated her elbow in a fall a few weeks earlier, reinjured it late in the race and, crying, had to stop. Eileen Carey, the head coach of the American para-Nordic team, ran over, bent down so Masters could climb on her back and then carried her off the course. Mr. Lee said he was the only photographer to chronicle it.\u201cOf course, I cried,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who was happy to learn that Masters won the first of two golds in her race the next day. \u201cIt\u2019s what this Olympics is about and this Paralympics is about. It\u2019s about how much you want it and how much you want to challenge yourself and how much you want to overcome the challenges you face. It was a really beautiful moment to me.\u201dFor much of our time together, Mr. Lee photographed subjects, and themes, that corresponded with stories I wrote. But when I left on Friday, he was pleased to have three full days to shoot what he wanted, when he wanted and how he wanted.On Sunday, that meant a frenetic dash across the sprawling Paralympic ecosystem. In the morning, to the Nordic venue, for the final two cross-country races. In the evening, to the Olympic Stadium, for the closing ceremony. In between, Mr. Lee overcame transportation problems to arrive in Gangneung, about 40 minutes away, as overtime dawned in the Para ice hockey final between the U.S. and Canada. He had two remote cameras set up on the catwalk above the ice. Rushing inside, though, he had time to grab only one camera and a 400-millimeter lens. His legs cramped as he ran.He checked the camera battery: 10 percent left. \u201cI couldn\u2019t risk it going back to get a new one,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cI had to be there.\u201d Less than four minutes into overtime, Declan Farmer of the U.S. scored the winning goal. As the team celebrated, Mr. Lee noticed out of the corner of his eye the backup goalie, Jen Lee, limping onto the ice. An American flag draped around him, his prosthetic leg in full display, Lee bent to hug Farmer. Mr. Lee got the shot. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the best Paralympic photo I\u2019ve seen.\u201d It was the perfect way to cap his time here, Mr. Lee said. \u201cThis Olympics and Paralympics, I happened to be in the right place all the time.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chez Ma Tante, Where Falafel and Kedgeree Live in Harmony", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What they most closely resemble are the pancakes I\u2019ve made on camping trips, from a mix, with about a quarter-stick of melted butter in a smoking-hot pan over a fire. Each one is the size of Frisbee because too many people are waiting for breakfast for any space in the pan to be wasted.Assuming my campfire pancakes were to catch a chef\u2019s eye, the standard way of turning them into a brunch dish would be to refine them. The heat would come down so they\u2019d cook to an even golden-brown. My quantity of butter would seem insane in a professional kitchen, so it would be cut. The batter would probably be thinned to make the pancakes shorter and more elegantly rounded.This is just what the chef Aidan O\u2019Neal at Chez Ma Tante does not do to the pancakes. Rising up from a small flood of maple syrup, they look and taste as if they\u2019d been made in the woods. I will gladly admit they\u2019re better than mine. At weekend brunch, they are on virtually every table.Mr. O\u2019Neal and his chef de cuisine, Jake Leiber, do not lack skill in the kitchen, but they know when to resist cheflike impulses and think like hungry campers. Their healthy disregard for refinement spills over to the dinner menu, which recently expanded to seven nights a week from five, just as the restaurant is approaching its first birthday.To start, you might smear a gob of chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 on a tangy slice of miche charred over the grill, or some head cheese, a spreadable pink composite of meat not quite held together by drippy pork goo. The most rustic thing you can eat there at night, though, has to be the thick steak carved out of a pork shoulder, rubbed with mustard and maple syrup, and striped with wide, dark grill marks. Smeared over the top is a salsa verde made from fresh parsley and other herbs that were whole about three or four slashes of a knife ago. Stewed Puy lentils spill across the rest of the plate. The look may say it was thrown together, but the full, lasting flavors tell you it wasn\u2019t.It is hard to say exactly what kind of food Chez Ma Tante serves, apart from the consistently good kind. The website calls it \u201cfood that can only be described as European.\u201d This isn\u2019t particularly helpful or specific; I\u2019ve never eaten anything there that seemed Finnish, say, or Bulgarian.If the menu has a theme, you won\u2019t guess it from the dining room. A collection of brown chairs and black tables on a black floor in an undecorated white room, it is as austere as a Shaker chapel, although one with a long, well-populated bar against the wall.No hints are forthcoming from the cocktail list, either, which plays it close to the vest with daiquiris, Negronis, Cosmopolitans and so on. It is the first cocktail list I\u2019ve seen in a long time on which I recognized every drink.The name Chez Ma Tante was borrowed from a stainless-steel slot of a place in Montreal known for its steam\u00e9, a steamed hot dog in a steamed bun. An \u201call dressed\u201d steam\u00e9, meaning it\u2019s loaded up with mustard and coleslaw, is a new feature on the brunch menu in Greenpoint. Apart from that and a recurring maple motif \u2014 the jugs of syrup on a shelf outside the kitchen are not just for show \u2014 the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois influence is minimal.A minor British theme seems undeniable. First off, the French fries are unmistakably English chips: twice-fried wedges that are steamy and starchy on the inside. If I were from England myself, I\u2019d probably call them \u201cproper chips,\u201d even though they come with a little cup of aioli on the side.Whether Chez Ma Tante\u2019s kedgeree is a proper kedgeree I don\u2019t know. It is, essentially, white rice dyed yellow with curry powder and mixed with hard-cooked egg and flaked cod. A fair amount of butter seems to be involved. On top is a crunchy salad of celery stalks and leaves. Somehow it\u2019s rich and refreshing and soothing and exciting at the same time.How did falafel, fried to a crackle and served over hummus and harissa with pickle wheels, get here? Not sure, but it is a great improvement over most of the vegetarian options you meet around town.Salads, too, are better than usual: shavings of kohlrabi and apples imbued with lemon; roasted almonds and raisins over white shreds of stracciatella cheese; a Caesar whose romaine leaves are small and tender, and whose croutons are closer to fried crumbs.The night ends with straightforward bistro desserts. Maple returns one more time in a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e; its torched sugar crust is repeated, in a lighter form, on the surface of a lemon tart wedge; the tarte Tatin is classic, although the caramel one night was a little more bitter than it needed to be.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption misidentified a dish at Chez Ma Tante. It contains falafel, not preserved lemon.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chat Room of Their Own", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFriends wrote back, half-seriously, suggesting she start a group for their cohort, but what to call it? Black Cohosh (for the herbal remedy)? How about What Would Virginia Woolf Do? one friend joked darkly, because of course what Woolf did, at 59, was kill herself.That would be everything from the peevishly quotidian (complaints about dry skin or men not shutting cabinets) to the truly harrowing (suicide ideation; job loss at middle age; bad marriages; domestic abuse; and children suffering from drug addiction).And sex. There would be lots of chatter around sex: requests for tips on technique; concern about \u201cthe handful of limp\u201d of an older boyfriend; vaginal atrophy; dry vaginas; sex toys; bad sex; no sex; anal sex; the viability of hiring a male prostitute; who has an orgasm first during sex: weird places to have sex; obligatory sex; sex with an ex; tantric sex; group sex; and many, many posts about coconut oil (see \u201cdry vaginas,\u201d above).Ms. Collins, who lives in Brooklyn Heights in a modish duplex apartment overlooking the East River, is emblematic of a certain demographic: mostly white \u2014 though Ms. Collins is half-black \u2014 expensively educated and housed liberals. You would assume that group would mirror itself online and stay small and homogeneous. But within a year of its founding, WWVWD, to use its colloquial abbreviation, had more than 1,300 members; the week after the presidential election there was an increase of another 1,000, Ms. Collins said, with many seeking a way to marshal themselves for political action.The original group, which Ms. Collins changed from \u201csecret\u201d to \u201cclosed\u201d (meaning it can be seen by the public), begot subgroups, for those who wanted to focus on philanthropy, activism, business networking and writing. Woolfers in New York City began meeting in person, as Ms. Collins led field trips to Toys in Babeland, the sex accessories emporium on the Lower East Side, and hosted Scrabble tournaments and clothing swaps.Woolfers have also swapped houses and apartments, rented each other rooms and raised money for groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Trust for Public Land. Recently, four Woolfers spent a day at the Wallkill Correctional Facility, joining a mentorship program for inmates there.There are now more than 7,600 Woolfers across the country, from New York City, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as you might expect, but also from Arkansas, Chicago and Maine. And Ms. Collins, who spent a few weeks last month on a cross-country road trip with a new boyfriend meeting Woolfers in Memphis and Telluride, Colo., among other spots, has a new book, out in April, called \u201cWhat Would Virginia Woolf Do? And Other Questions I Ask Myself as I Attempt to Age Without Apology.\u201d It is a sometimes wince-inducing primer on fashion, sex, marriage, divorce, money and health gleaned from her experience as Woolfer in chief, and with contributions from her Woolfer sisters.It also has memoirish elements: Ms. Collins details her adventures in the orgy tent at Burning Man (she and her ex brought their own sheets, and kept to themselves), her struggles with depression and her adherence to an expensive beauty routine that involves fake eyelashes and Botox. She also cops to divorce envy, and notes the benefits of prenups, long-term-care insurance and pharmaceuticals like Xanax. In its breezy candor, the book is as appealing and appalling as the conversations of the Woolfers online, though it lacks the tartness and invective that occasionally erupts there, turning a you-go-girl group of self-affirmers into an unruly scrum.Because when thousands of women get together on social media, what could possibly go wrong?\u201cWe do fight sometimes,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about super-candid things, and people have strong opinions. If you\u2019re talking about whether or not to let your 16-year-old have sex or whether to have an affair or how to tell your colleague at work that she\u2019s a jerk, people will have strong responses.\u201dWhen one long-married woman wrote about the heartache she was feeling because her lover of five years had broken up with her, many Woolfers were upset by her adultery, Ms. Collins said, and she had to step in to remove comments that were aggressive, moralistic and vitriolic. When a white Woolfer reported that a black man in a park had exposed himself to her, many in the group were inflamed that she had noted his race.At first, Ms. Collins read every post herself, to steer the conversation and defuse tension. But when the group swelled to 3,000, she asked some of the early Woolfers to help her moderate; now, about 20 women have oversight of what\u2019s posted. Politics, race and infidelity are topics that reliably lead to problems. \u201cI\u2019ll be out somewhere and I\u2019ll get a text from someone saying basically there\u2019s a huge fight in Aisle 6 and what do we do?\u201d Ms. Collins said.Early last year, Ms. Collins chastised the group for what she saw as occasional reflexive pettiness. \u201cThis is not a liberal arts college, circa 2016,\u201d she wrote in part. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to give trigger warnings. Bring on the posts about money concerns and racism concerns and class struggle, but don\u2019t blame fellow members without real cause. Assume goodness, please.\u201dJenny Douglas, an early Woolfer and moderator, said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a post you don\u2019t like, we say, \u2018Scroll on by.\u2019 You don\u2019t need to pick a fight with everything or anyone you disagree with. When we are meeting online and tackling subjects that are so nuanced, you can lose that nuance. Those tender subjects are tricky to tackle in any form.\u201dJust a few weeks ago, a moderator quit the group after a discussion of moderator practices \u2014 how they vetted posts, for example \u2014 left her feeling bullied, she said.There are over-posters, and drunk posters; there are angry, cursing posters \u2014 whose words are promptly removed, Ms. Collins said \u2014 and posters who are a tad self-righteous. And there are the lurkers and the hate readers, along with those who are repelled or bored or disappointed by the particular window into women\u2019s lives that the group affords them.\u201cI always think that Virginia Woolf would be mortified at having her name associated with this group,\u201d said Daphne Merkin, the memoirist and cultural critic, who is a member of the group but does not post anything. \u201cAt first I thought it was going to be some kind of literary meeting of the minds. That there would be some interesting comments about Jean Rhys. Instead it\u2019s, \u201cWhat do you do with your dildos?\u201d Or this sort of subclinical despair about no longer having a flat stomach.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that stuff is beneath me,\u201d Ms. Merkin went on. \u201cI mean, I once wrote a story on buffing up the vagina, but these revelations are very cosmeticized. There\u2019s little wit, but maybe wit takes more time than social media allows. This is more like the stuff you tell your girlfriend at the end of the day, the eye-glazing end of intimacy. There\u2019s intimacy that\u2019s thrilling, but this isn\u2019t.\u201dConversations have leaked outside the group, like the time one woman wrote of her son\u2019s bad behavior, and another Woolfer told her own child, who happened to know the son, who then told the son of his mother\u2019s revelations about his conduct.\u201cIt was pretty easy to figure out who it was,\u201d Ms. Collins said of the offending member. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018This is super-uncool,\u2019 and we removed her from the group. The way we dealt with it was to write about it, so everyone knew what had happened. Ironically, and because I\u2019m a bigger personality, I\u2019ve probably suffered more than others for this.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean to be \u2018too much,\u2019 as a woman?\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk about this a lot in the group.\u201dMs. Collins is happy to share her labial regimen (see \u201ccoconut oil,\u201d above), the minutiae of her sex life and the unraveling of her second marriage, which ended in part because of the meddling of a Woolfer, as it happens.\u201cThe marriage was strained, and I had been wanting a second dog for a while,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t, but like most women I do most of the work around the house and pay my fair share.\u201d She asked the Woolfers, in essence, \u201cAm I a jerk if I just go ahead and get the dog?\u201d\u201cI thought it would be a throwaway thread,\u201d she said. \u201cBut suddenly there were like 600 comments,\u201d evenly divided in opinion. (She didn\u2019t get the dog.)It turns out that one Woolfer who read the thread was an old friend of Ms. Collins\u2019s husband, and the woman told him about his wife\u2019s query. \u201cHe came home pretty angry, and the marriage ended pretty much the next day,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Ms. Collins said of her group, \u201cI see it as incredible content potential and, though this sounds a little grandiose, possibly culture shifting. These women are powerful, and they have made me feel more powerful.\u201dThere\u2019s a continuing conversation about whether the group is getting too big and how or if to control for privacy. When the news of Facebook\u2019s breaches broke last week, the moderators again discussed restricting new members or moving to a different platform. \u201cMaybe one day we\u2019ll have an app or some other platform for more intimacy,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cBut for now, here we are, basically addicted and not budging.\u201dUnfortunately, the recipient was a germophobe, and was horrified to have received such an intimate, secondhand device, as she explained. Did Ms. Seiden want it back? If so, she\u2019d leave it with her doorman.\u201cBut it was a schlep and I just wanted to put the incident behind me, so I never did pick it up,\u201d Ms. Seiden said. \u201cMy dream is that the doorman gave it to a woman in his life, or that a slightly awkward exchange ensued in which the doorman had to return the vibrator to its recipient, passing it clumsily to her and in my dream, by the time she gets up to her apartment, she can\u2019t resist, transcends her putative germophobia, and gets herself off like a rock star.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Sweden\u2019s Preschools, Boys Learn to Dance and Girls Learn to Yell", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 Something was wrong with the Penguins, the incoming class of toddlers at the Seafarer\u2019s Preschool, in a wooded suburb south of Stockholm.The boys were clamorous and physical. They shouted and hit. The girls held up their arms and whimpered to be picked up. The group of 1- and 2-year-olds had, in other words, split along traditional gender lines. And at this school, that is not O.K.Their teachers cleared the room of cars and dolls. They put the boys in charge of the play kitchen. They made the girls practice shouting \u201cNo!\u201d Then they decided to open a proper investigation, erecting video cameras in the classroom.Science may still be divided over whether gender differences are rooted in biology or culture, but many of Sweden\u2019s government-funded preschools are doing what they can to deconstruct them. State curriculum urges teachers and principals to embrace their role as social engineers, requiring them to \u201ccounteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns.\u201dExactly how this teaching method affects children is still unclear.For instance, the children at these schools do not show a strong preference for playmates of the same gender, and are less likely to make assumptions based on stereotypes. Yet, the scientists found no difference at all in the children\u2019s tendency to notice gender, suggesting that may be under a genetic influence.At the Seafarer\u2019s Preschool, the effort sometimes has the feeling of a venture into uncharted territory.On a recent Friday in Hammarbyhojden, south of Stockholm, Elis Storesund, the school\u2019s in-house gender expert, sat bent over a work sheet with two teachers of the 4- and 5-year-old Seagulls, reviewing their progress on gender objectives.\u201cWhen we are drawing,\u201d said Melisa Esteka, 31, one of the teachers, \u201cwe see that the girls \u2014 they draw a lot \u2014 they draw girls with lots of makeup and long eyelashes. It\u2019s very clear that they are girls. We ask, \u2018Don\u2019t boys have eyelashes?\u2019 And they say, \u2018We know it is not like that in real life.\u2019\u201dMs. Storesund, 54, nodded thoughtfully. \u201cThey are trying to understand what it is to be a girl,\u201d she said.Ms. Esteka looked frustrated. She had set a goal for herself: To stop the children from identifying things as \u201cfor girls\u201d or \u201cfor boys.\u201d But lately, her students were absorbing stereotypes from billboards and cartoons, and sometimes it seemed like all the slow, systematic work of the Seafarer\u2019s Preschool was flying away overnight.\u201cThere is so much they bring with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey bring the whole world with them. We can\u2019t stop that from happening.\u201dSweden\u2019s experiment in gender-neutral preschools began in 1996 in Trodje, a small town near the edge of the Baltic Sea. The man who started it, Ingemar Gens, was not an educator but a journalist who dabbled in anthropology and gender theory, having studied Swedish men seeking mail-order brides in Thailand. Newly appointed as a district \u201cequal opportunity expert,\u201d Mr. Gens wanted to break down the norm of stoic, unemotional Swedish masculinity.Two schools rolled out what was called a compensatory gender strategy. Boys and girls at the preschools were separated for part of the day and coached in traits associated with the other gender. Boys massaged each other\u2019s feet. Girls were led in barefoot walks in the snow, and told to throw open the window and scream.\u201cWe tried to do that \u2014 to educate boys in what girls already knew, and vice versa,\u201d said Mr. Gens, now 68. A wave of criticism broke over him, but that was expected.\u201cThey said we were indoctrinating the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI say we\u2019re always indoctrinating kids. Bringing them up is indoctrination.\u201dTeachers were required to review videotapes of themselves with the children, to identify subtle differences in the way they interacted with boys and girls. Many found that they used more words, and more complex sentences, with girls.Helena Baggstrom, who taught at one of the schools, recalled watching footage of herself in a cloakroom, attending to children as they bundled up to go outside. She saw, to her shock, that she had helped one boy after another get dressed and run out the door. The girls, she realized, were expected to dress themselves.\u201cIt was hard at first to see patterns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw more and more, and we were horrified at what we saw.\u201dThe strategy of separating boys and girls was later set aside in favor of a \u201cgender neutral\u201d approach intent on muting differences. Still, the spirit of Mr. Gens\u2019s experiment had percolated through the government. In 1998, Sweden added new language to its national curriculum requiring that all preschools \u201ccounteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns\u201d and encourage children to explore \u201coutside the limitations of stereotyped gender roles.\u201d Adoption of the practices varies widely, depending on the school\u2019s director.But in a political environment deeply split over immigration, gender-equality policies enjoy the support of Sweden\u2019s largest parties, the center-left Social Democrats and the center-right Moderates.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be regarded as against equality,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody wants to be against equality.\u201dIn Trodje, the first wave of preschoolers to attend gender-neutral preschools are now 20-somethings.Elin Gerdin, 26, part of that first wave, is studying to be a teacher. In appearance she is conventionally feminine, her long dark hair coaxed into spirals with a curling iron. This is something she points out \u2014 that in appearance she is conventionally feminine. It is the first sign that she views gender as something you could put on or take off, like a raincoat.\u201cThis is a choice I have made because this is me,\u201d she said of her appearance. \u201cAnd this is me because I am a product of society.\u201dThere are moments when her early education comes back to her in flashes.Ms. Gerdin\u2019s friends have begun to have babies, and they post pictures of them on Facebook, swathed in blue or pink, in society\u2019s first act of sorting. Ms. Gerdin gets upset when this happens. She feels sorry for the children. She makes it a point to seek her friends out and tell them, earnestly, that they are making a mistake. This feels to her like a responsibility.\u201cWe are a group of children who will grow up, and we will have children, and we will talk to them about this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not easy to change a whole society.\u201dThat process was just beginning at the Seafarer\u2019s Preschool on a recent morning, when the children scrambled out of voluminous snowsuits. Underneath his, Otto, a sturdy 3-year-old, was wearing a dress.Otto prefers to wear dresses because he likes the way they fan out when he spins around, and it does not make him unusual here. Up until now, no one in Otto\u2019s life \u2014 not his grandparents, or babysitters, or fellow 3-year-olds \u2014 has told him that boys do not wear dresses, said his mother, Lena Christiansson, 36, matter-of-factly. She would like this to continue as long as possible.This expectation has become increasingly common, said Ms. Storesund, the Seafarer\u2019s gender specialist.\u201cNow, parents ask us, \u2018What are you doing about gender?\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Storesund is on hand to confront classroom dilemmas: When boys in the group for 3-year-olds refused to paint, or dance, and the group threatened to split along gender lines, she was brought in to unpack the problem, tinkering with the activities until she coaxed the boys back to equal participation.Preserving a gender-neutral environment is not simple. Carina Sevebjork Saur, 57, who has been teaching at the school for a year and a half, said she often catches herself saying the wrong thing, like an offhand compliment on a child\u2019s appearance.\u201cYou are on your way to saying something, as a reflex, but you have to hold it back,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can comment on clothes in other ways: \u2018Oh, my goodness, how many polka dots!\u2019\u201dThe effort is compensated, teachers said, by the impression that they are unraveling mysteries, and as spring approached, some changes could be observed among the Penguins.One of the group\u2019s teachers, Izabell Sandberg, 26, noticed a shift in a 2-year-old girl whose parents dropped her off wearing tights and pale-pink dresses. The girl focused intently on staying clean. If another child took her toys, she would whimper.\u201cShe accepted everything,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said. \u201cAnd I thought this was very girlie. It was like she was apologizing for taking up space.\u201dUntil, that is, a recent morning, when the girl had put a hat on and carefully arranged bags around herself, preparing to set off on an imaginary expedition. When a classmate tried to walk off with one of her bags, the girl held out the palm of her hand and shouted \u201cNo\u201d at such a high volume that Ms. Sandberg\u2019s head swiveled around.It was something they had been practicing.By the time March rolled round, the girl had gotten so loud that she drowned out the boys in the class, Ms. Sandberg said. At the end of the day, she was messy. The girl\u2019s parents were less than delighted, she said, and reported that she had become cheeky and defiant at home.But Ms. Sandberg has plenty of experience explaining the mission to parents.\u201cThis is what we do here, and we are not going to stop it,\u201d she said.Christina Anderson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what you need to know.An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study \u2014 enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook.

{"Headline": "They Were Fans of the Chef. Now They Run His Restaurant.", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it\u2019s not all that remarkable that an Indian restaurant sits within a four-level, sandy pink Mission-style villa that used to be a Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! museum.The couple say they have invested all their money in the business, quit their day jobs and dream of opening Kapoor restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip and in Los Angeles International Airport.Why have they taken on such an enormous risk? Simple. They\u2019re the celebrity chef\u2019s biggest fans.\u201cSanjeev Kapoor is the No. 1 chef in India,\u201d Mr. Ghotra declared. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a side business. We are 100 percent devoted.\u201dOn a recent Sunday afternoon, Mr. Ghotra, 46, and Ms. Kaur, 45, hurried into the restaurant, which has been in soft-opening mode since August and will officially open this spring. They had parked their olive Maserati Levante so it stretched over two handicapped spots.Ms. Kaur, who speaks rapidly and mainly in superlatives, was talking about getting her hair colored at the salon, while Mr. Ghotra, the more subdued, data-minded half of the pair, quietly organized the business cards at the host stand.They ushered their two children, ages 9 and 10, into the back office, and switched the seven television screens around the restaurant to Food Food, Mr. Kapoor\u2019s 24-hour television channel. Both Ms. Kaur and Mr. Ghotra have been watching his shows for years.\u201cEverything I learned \u2014 Indian food, Indian-Chinese, Indian-Thai \u2014 he taught me,\u201d Ms. Kaur said, pointing to one of the TVs. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s part of the family right now!\u201d\u201cKhana Khazana,\u201d Mr. Kapoor\u2019s most famous show (the title means \u201cFood Treasure\u201d), inspired Mr. Ghotra to start cooking as a teenager. He earned a master\u2019s degree in travel and tourism at Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, a university in Indore, but after marrying Ms. Kaur and immigrating to the United States in 1998, he wound up in sales at the stone company MS International. Ms. Kaur, who received an M.B.A. from Savitribai Phule Pune University, was working in marketing for a TV channel called PTC Punjabi.In early 2015, Ms. Kaur connected on Facebook with an old broadcasting colleague, Satyaki Mukherjee, who manages franchising for Mr. Kapoor. Mr. Mukherjee mentioned that the chef was interested in entering the American market with his midpriced, family-friendly franchise, the Yellow Chilli.\u201cI started thinking about how in Southern California, when Indian professionals or family come in from India, they want to eat Indian food, but there\u2019s not a nice place to take them,\u201d Ms. Kaur recalled. Seeing the potential in opening a restaurant with Mr. Kapoor\u2019s name attached, the couple applied to become full-time franchisees.That November, they flew to Mumbai to meet with Mr. Kapoor and his team. The first time Ms. Kaur shook hands with the famous chef, she said, \u201cit was the same feeling I got when Michael Jackson came to Mumbai.\u201dIn a recent interview, Mr. Kapoor, 53, said he had been approached over the years by individuals interested in opening his restaurants in America, but most were just fans, with little sense for the realities of running a business.\u201cBeing a fan is actually a negative for me, because those people think that when you sign up with me, people will come to the restaurant just because of my name,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I meet with people, I paint a pretty poor picture. I ask them, \u2018When everyone else is having fun, are you O.K. working even on Christmas, Holi, Diwali?\u2019\u201dMr. Ghotra and Ms. Kaur were different, he said. They were unfazed by the challenge.\u201cUnfazed is an understatement,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cThey were mad. But we need mad people. We need that kind of passion. Opening a restaurant is a bigger commitment than getting married. I could tell what this restaurant meant to them. And they could eat well.\u201dEach of the 45 Yellow Chilli locations worldwide, including branches in Oman and Canada, is designed to look more or less the same on the inside. The Buena Park interior is stripped-down and neutral-toned, more contemporary and minimalist than colorful and Indian-inspired. Inside the entrance is a high-contrast black-and-white image of Mr. Kapoor.The menu is dominated by hearty north Indian dishes that are signatures of Mr. Kapoor, like the rich lentil stew Lalla Mussa Dal, and Shaam Savera, spinach-coated cheese dumplings submerged in a thick tomato gravy. Mr. Ghotra and Ms. Kaur hired all of the restaurant\u2019s kitchen staff themselves, and then the corporate chef for Mr. Kapoor\u2019s company, Pradipto Das, flew in to help with menu development and training.But the couple have their own ideas about how best to appeal to the American market.First, they\u2019re looking to target only Indian-Americans, who may be more familiar with the chef. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run after any other crowd,\u201d Mr. Ghotra said. \u201cThis brand is so deep in Indian minds. But for non-Indians who don\u2019t know him, it will take a couple of years to cultivate that brand.\u201dBuena Park attracts hordes of tourists to attractions like Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, but the couple plan instead to appeal to the large Indian populations in nearby cities like Irvine and Artesia. \u201cIf 5,000 people come once a month and spend $25, that is our break-even,\u201d Ms. Kaur said.The restaurant will participate in South Asian wedding expos, local festivals surrounding Indian holidays like Holi and Diwali, and events for groups of South Asian college students. For the grand opening, Ms. Kaur hopes to invite Indian-Americans in the area for two days of ticketed dinners and cooking demonstrations featuring Mr. Kapoor, who will fly in for the occasion.The couple are also looking into turning the restaurant\u2019s adjacent banquet hall \u2014 a sprawling space with disco balls, flashy chandeliers and shiny, pearl-white wallpaper \u2014 into a club for young Indian-Americans. The restaurant hosted a New Year\u2019s Eve party; the 350 tickets, priced from $100 to $125, sold out two weeks in advance.They are thinking about painting the exterior white, to make it stand out more among the other flamboyant attractions in the area. To lend a more high-end feel, they\u2019ve been testing a valet parking service, even though the restaurant has its own 66-car lot.\u201cPeople started complaining, saying, \u2018How could you have so much parking, and then I have to pay for it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ghotra said. \u201cBut we are just trying to create a certain experience.\u201dMr. Ghotra and Ms. Kaur say they have sunk almost $1 million into the space. \u201cWe sold our house and a few other possessions,\u201d Ms. Kaur said. \u201cWe told the kids, \u2018Your college money is in there.\u2019\u201dIn addition to overhead costs, they pay a franchise fee and monthly royalties to Mr. Kapoor\u2019s company. \u201cPeople said, \u2018You could open a restaurant with $200,000 \u2014 why invest close to a million?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ghotra said. \u201cIt\u2019s because we wanted to create a brand.\u201dNeither sees this investment as a gamble.By \u201cintangible benefits,\u201d Ms. Kaur was referring to the celebrity that she believes she and her husband have attained ever since they started associating with Mr. Kapoor.\u201cIn my M.B.A. WhatsApp group, I am the star,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to be recognized. We want to make enough Benjamins, but if you are not recognized, what the heck?\u201dMs. Kaur exclaimed, \u201cWe can go down in Wikipedia as the guys who got Sanjeev Kapoor to America!\u201dWhile Yellow Chilli has been in soft-opening mode, locals have slowly been filtering in, curious to try the restaurant when they see the Sanjeev Kapoor connection.Tushar Sobti used to frequent the Yellow Chilli in Jalandhar, where he grew up. He was excited to try the Buena Park location, but ultimately felt that some of the dishes fell short. \u201cHave a spoonful of Lalla Mussa Dal in India, and have a spoon of it here. It\u2019s just different,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s more flavorful in India.\u201dBut on hearing about the grand opening event featuring Mr. Kapoor, Ms. Sinha\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cReally? He\u2019s coming here?\u201d she asked. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll stop by.\u201dHe said it could be difficult for the Yellow Chilli to resonate deeply in the community, because with a franchise \u201cthere is always an agenda to just make more money.\u201dMr. Ghotra and Ms. Kaur envision turning the Yellow Chilli into an American chain \u2014 \u201cthe Indian answer to Olive Garden: authentic Indian food for the middle class,\u201d Mr. Ghotra said. They would also like to open branches of Mr. Kapoor\u2019s fast-casual chain, the Yellow Chilli Express, in the Los Angeles airport and local strip malls.Ms. Kaur cut in: \u201cThat\u2019s vetoed.\u201dThe two think frequently about what they will do when they make their first million from the restaurant: They\u2019ll finally take down that Buddha statue (they\u2019re too superstitious to do so right now), buy an expensive house in the Hollywood Hills and open a Hard Rock Cafe-style restaurant for Bollywood movies.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to God,\u201d Ms. Kaur said, before quickly correcting herself. \u201cI mean, thanks to Sanjeev Kapoor.\u201dcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age. Shouldn\u2019t You Be Paid for It?", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneShould Facebook pay us for our puppy pictures?And yet the idea is gaining momentum in Silicon Valley and beyond: Facebook and the other technological Goliaths offering free online services \u2014 from which they harvest data from and about their users \u2014 should pay for every nugget of information they reap.The spring break pictures on Instagram, the YouTube video explaining Minecraft tactics, the internet searches and the Amazon purchases, even your speed following Waze on the way to spend Thanksgiving with your in-laws \u2014 this data is valuable. It will become more valuable, potentially much more so, in the not-too-distant future.It is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.Users\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.Data is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.We may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201dAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?How about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.A critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.The transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.But whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?Today, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.Google and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.Companies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201dThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?In any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bubbles, With Joy: P\u00e9tillant Naturel\u2019s Triumphant Return", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesThis genre of sparkling wine, now known as p\u00e9tillant natural, or p\u00e9t-nat, is made by a method so old that the French term for it is \u201cmethode ancestrale.\u201d It\u2019s most likely how the original sparkling wine was made, however many centuries ago that was, although that was almost certainly an accidental creation.Millenniums before Pasteur, early winemakers, sensing that the fizzling, bubbling and ruckus of the fermentation process seemed to be complete, might have stowed their product in sealed containers. But if the fermentation had halted only temporarily, as sometimes happens in cold temperatures, it would begin again in the container when the temperature warmed.The creation of carbon dioxide in the confined space would either carbonate the liquid or, if the pressure was high and the container weak, cause it to explode.This is the essence of p\u00e9tillant naturel, though it is now done with intention, often with the help of modern refrigeration equipment, and without shattered glass.But what is delicious has a way of catching on. This informal, unpretentious sparkling wine, which can be made from an untold number of grapes in styles ranging from hazy, unfiltered and full of sediment to clean-as-a-whistle, has caught on all over the winemaking world.Yet it\u2019s not quite \u201cthe new ros\u00e9.\u201d It\u2019s not being made in industrial quantities, nor has it achieved brand-name status in supermarket aisles. It has ridden the wave of interest in natural wines, which will never be a mass-market phenomenon, no matter how important they are to discerning consumers nor how influential they have been to the wine industry.What was most obvious in our tasting was the high level of quality. This was surprising, not because I associate natural wines with inconsistency but because every type of wine has its share of lemons.The flaws in some natural wines glare more because they are not typical in the modern age, when technology and artifice can eliminate issues like excessive volatile acidity or barnyard aromas that come from unwanted yeast strains. But to me, the tedious insipidity of many processed wines is just as much a flaw.Yet these p\u00e9tillants, an almost completely random category where anything goes, showed very few flaws. They were not only easy, approachable and refreshing, the best had resonance, depth and length. And they were diverse.Some were simply straightforward easy drinking, but others were nuanced and complex, a description rarely associated with p\u00e9tillant naturel. Some seemed raw, as if the producer had captured in the bottle the transformation of juice into wine. Others had a yeasty, bready weight that is seen more often in Champagne.\u201cThey are not just a gimmick,\u201d Florence said. Kimberly said she was struck by the texture, rawness and pleasing eccentricity of the wines.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had such a preconceived notion of p\u00e9tillant naturel as an easy sparkling wine,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was great diversity.\u201dLike some of the more hands-off p\u00e9t-nats, this was cloudy, almost hazy. As with any p\u00e9tillant naturel, or Champagne-style sparkler, after the yeasts are finished with their fermenting duties, they die, leaving sediment in the bottle.In Champagne, and in some p\u00e9t-nats, the sediment is disgorged, a process of maneuvering the sediment to the neck of the bottle and then ejecting it. But some of the more natural p\u00e9t-nats avoid this step, which can leave a hazy appearance. There is no harm in this; the dead yeast, or lees, can improve the flavor and texture and also can act as an antioxidant. But you might want to keep the bottle standing up so the sediment settles.As different as these wines were, they shared a sort of joyousness and lack of pretension. They are intended to be enjoyed with relish rather than sipped with contemplation, though they will not disappoint if you feel compelled to take notes. They are moderately priced as well, costing largely $20 to $30.

{"Headline": "Five Things I Learned on My Quebec Road Trip: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi! It\u2019s Dan Bilefsky. It\u2019s been a frenetic 11 days on my road trip through Quebec. I ended the trip in proud and scenic Saguenay, an important center for forestry and aluminum, and am now returning home to Montreal.Images from the journey have stayed in my mind.Muslim worshipers kneeling on the floor in a Quebec City mosque pocked with bullet holes from an attack over a year ago. Revelers dancing Sunday at midnight at a Quebec City bistro. The Indigenous radio DJ in Maniwaki who affirms his identity by proclaiming one Algonquin word a day on the radio. The Quebec flags fluttering in H\u00e9rouxville, the sleepy village that introduced a code of conduct reminding immigrants not to stone women.I undertook my travels to learn more about the province, where I grew up and recently returned after 28 years away. It was a fun adventure, guided by your suggestions.Here are five things I learned:Immigrant groups, whether Jews or Muslims or Sikhs, feel like a minority in a province where secularism is ingrained culturally because of the historic revolution against the influence of the Catholic Church in the 1960s. \u201cWe are all minorities in Quebec,\u201d the detective novelist Louise Penny told me. \u201cIt creates a frisson\u201d in everyday life.This bifurcated cultural swagger makes Quebec unique in Canada and, as a former resident of London and Paris, I sometimes feel transported back to those places without having to hop on a plane.At a sprawling aluminum factory in Chicoutimi, which supplies aluminum to American car companies, workers warned that American consumers would suffer in the event of a trade war. \u201cWe just can\u2019t afford for that to happen,\u201d one told me.In Quebec City, a large group of teenagers at St. Charles Garnier College told me they saw their future in a globalized Quebec that is firmly a part of Canada. In Montreal, young people seemed more intent on finding the hippest cafe than whether they needed to order a coffee in the language of Shakespeare or Voltaire.Yet there were notable exceptions, including in industrial Saguenay where the desire for national self-determination remains strong. \u201cOur generation is facing the broken dream that independence isn\u2019t going to happen any time soon,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Bouchard, a leading intellectual.This convivial excess became a leitmotif of the trip, and seems to reflect a culture marinated in French joie de vivre and a North American reverence for supersized everything. It also comes down to a Quebec spirit of hospitality and mischievous fun.Next week, I return the newsletter to Ian Austen. Thanks for reading.Advertisement"}

The sun is shining today.This past year has been a bumpy ride for our crumbling subways.Sure, we could grumble about delays and overcrowding.

I was about to leave for vacation, so we were unusually affectionate in the train car \u2014 something I hesitate doing, as the subway isn\u2019t always the best place for queer P.D.A. We were kissing and embracing before I rushed off the train at the West Fourth Street station. One stop later, my boyfriend called and told me a man handed him a note as he was getting off the train. The note read: \u2018Thank you for being brave enough to be affectionate in public.\u2019\u201d\u2014 Parker Field, 25, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn\u201cOn a trip over the Manhattan Bridge I stood near a mother and her 5-year-old son, who started to fuss and cried: \u2018I can\u2019t wait!\u2019 Calmly and swiftly, the mother turned to the boy\u2019s backpack, found a Thermos in a side pocket, drank its contents, and quietly positioned herself as a shield for her child as he emptied his bladder into the emergency container. In moments, the mother had tightened the lid on the Thermos. Before she could wonder what to do next, the young woman sitting closest to her produced a plastic bag and handed it over. Another gave her a tissue. Grateful smiles and nods passed between the small group.\u201d\u201cA few months back I got on a 7 train at Court Square on the early side of rush hour and actually got a seat. I felt a tinge of annoyance at the man with his bike on the train sitting across from me.

{"Headline": "This Is What I Do When I Hear the Bombs Explode", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Whenever I hear a blast go off in my hometown the first thing I do is call my little brother.Ehsan, 17, is the kind of kid who\u2019s always out \u2014 riding his bicycle with a pack of friends, playing pickup soccer on one of Kabul\u2019s dirt fields (grass is a luxury here). My parents and I are always trying to restrain him, warning him to stick to safe places. But he refuses. \u201cWhere is there any safe place here? Can you show me? If you can, I will go there.\u201dThen I grabbed my notebook and a spare phone battery and went to the scene. I didn\u2019t have to go, my bureau chief said, but I felt I had to go. As usual, I was shaking like wind rustling a treeful of leaves, all over, but I didn\u2019t care.This would be the eighth suicide bombing I\u2019ve witnessed here in Kabul, and I am sick to death of them.In some ways it was the worst one I\u2019ve seen, perhaps because one of the first things I noticed was a boy lying on his face, his leg blown off, and from a short distance away he looked just like my little brother. Again, I almost called home to check where Ehsan was, before I remembered I had just left him.People at the scene were angry and chased away all the other journalists. I guess because I was shaking so much nobody noticed me.I understand their anger. They don\u2019t want their agony to be material for journalists; in the moment of their awful sorrow, they don\u2019t want their spectacle to be shared by strangers.They\u2019re looking for someone to blame, and we\u2019re right there; the terrorists are not.But I want them to know that first of all I\u2019m a reporter and I should do my job. I want to see what is happening, see how people are dealing with it. And most of all, I want the world to know about Afghanistan, about how they are killing my people. I also want them to know that I have not forgotten the face of a single one of those victims I\u2019ve seen and I probably never will.I was very close to that one. The Enlightenment Movement, started by my fellow Hazaras, a largely Shiite minority group, drew a huge crowd to an anti-government demonstration by mainly young people like me. We were filled with enthusiasm and happiness that we were finally reclaiming our people\u2019s long-denied rights. It was a hot July day and I took refuge from the afternoon heat in the shade of a wall.That wall saved my life. I have no words to describe the horrible sound of that blast, a sound I had never heard before. Dust filled the air and I was lying on the ground, too shocked to move. Which was fortunate because a few minutes later came another blast \u2014 a vicious trick of terrorists to get first responders as well. Flying glass cut my nose, but I had no other injury.Far worse was what I saw: the dead and dying, the dismembered victims and distraught survivors, the terrible screams of agony and suffering, and the howls of despair and rage. The blast killed 84 and wounded more than 400.Police at the scene were as shocked as everyone else; and some of them were out of control, firing everywhere for no reason. One officer leveled his pistol straight at me. He looked crazed, as if he were about to shoot, when a man came and knocked his gun arm down. I was frozen with shock until an old man grabbed my hand and ordered me to run with him.Many of my friends were among the dead and wounded, I would later learn. \u201cWe are changing history,\u201d my friend Sharif Dawlat Shahi, a ministry of education employee, wrote on his Facebook page that morning. It was the last thing he ever wrote.After that I had a hard time sleeping; I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about those who perished, and the scenes I had witnessed. When I did sleep, I dreamed of them.During the day, some noise or incident would remind me of what happened and I would begin shaking all over. People thought I looked cold, but it happened on hot days, too. At those times, I would forget the most simple words in my native Dari; sometimes it was so bad I couldn\u2019t even speak English anymore.I got a temporary job with Oxfam in the remote province of Daikundi, which brought some respite because there was no internet there, so I couldn\u2019t see the news of what was happening in Kabul. Phones didn\u2019t usually work either, so I couldn\u2019t call my brother.That bothered me after awhile, so I returned to Kabul and worked as a freelance journalist until July of last year, when I was hired by The New York Times.It has been a bad period for suicide bombings. I went to seven more as a reporter; they happened to occur on days when I was on duty or on call, though my colleagues went to many as well.Then early this month a bomb did go off in our neighborhood, and this time my brother did not answer his phone. My mother and I were both calling him. I was shaking and crying, but I went to the scene anyway, and en route my sister texted that Ehsan was okay. He had been playing football.A lot of my friends and family members ask why I keep doing this kind of reporting. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, who will?\u201d I respond.The mother of that boy, Mustafa, who looked like my brother, Ehsan, kept talking to his body, and everyone around her was terrified by her towering grief: \u201cMy handsome son, my handsome son. My teenager. God knows how I raised you. Why has he let you die?\u201dFinally it got too dangerous to stay at the scene so I texted my bureau chief that I had to leave. I was shaking, of course.As I left I saw a boy on a bike. He was dressed just like my brother. I had told Ehsan, \u201cStay home!\u201d So I chased after the boy until I caught up to him.

Is She a Woman?", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis series of images emerged from a simple prompt: \u201cDraw an effective leader.\u201dIn terms of gender, the results are almost always the same. Both men and women almost always draw men.\u201cEven when the drawings are gender neutral,\u201d which is uncommon, Dr. Kiefer said in an email, \u201cthe majority of groups present the drawing using language that indicates male (he) rather than neutral or female.\u201dAnd yet, her clients often insisted that what they meant by \u201che\u201d is actually \u201cboth.\u201dThe authors focused on one particular act associated with leadership: speaking up with ideas to move a team or company forward.In one experiment, participants were asked to call into a monthly sales team meeting of a fictional insurance company, during which they would hear from either an Eric or an Erica. Later they were asked to rate the speaker on the degree to which he or she had \u201cexhibited leadership,\u201d \u201cinfluenced the team\u201d or \u201cassumed a leadership role.\u201dThe Erics who spoke up with change-oriented ideas were far more likely to be identified as leaders than Erics who simply critiqued their team\u2019s performance. But Ericas did not receive a boost in status from sharing ideas even though they were exactly the same as the Erics\u2019. Life, of course, does not unfold like a scripted call. And in a second experiment, the researchers attempted to investigate the benefits of speaking up in the \u201cwild.\u201d The researchers asked participants in a 36-team skills competition at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point to fill out a series of questionnaires before, during and after their competition.The authors acknowledged that there were limitations in studying this atypically male-dominated place, but the nature of the competition allowed them to control for athletic ability, cognitive ability and other factors.Still, after the competition, when participants ranked who they wanted to be the team leader, only the men who had spoken up with ideas received a boost.A negative response to female assertiveness \u2014 known as the \u201cbacklash effect\u201d \u2014 has been documented in other studies on gender and leadership.So what\u2019s going on here? The researchers believe that results may be related to what you saw in those drawings earlier.\u201cPeople have these prototypes in their head about what a leader looks like,\u201d Dr. McClean said. \u201cWhen we see an individual, we ask, \u2018Do they fit that?\u2019\u201dIf they don\u2019t \u2014 even if they are acting like a leader \u2014 it\u2019s harder to identify them as one.It\u2019s that the capacity to \u201ctake charge,\u201d which is strongly associated with one\u2019s ability to lead, continues to be considered a largely male characteristic, she said.But Erica was taking charge. Why didn\u2019t anyone see that?How can this problem be overcome? One reliable way to help people to see more women as leader-like, she has found, is to expose them to more women in actual leadership positions._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Li Ao, Writer and Political Firebrand in Taiwan, Dies at 82", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLi Ao, a Taiwanese writer and politician whose fiery anti-establishment polemics, provocative antics and unwavering support for reunification with mainland China made him one of Taiwan\u2019s most recognizable, if divisive, public figures, died on March 18 in Taipei, the capital. He was 82.The Taipei Veterans General Hospital, where he died, said the cause was brain cancer.Mr. Li was known affectionately as the \u201cmadman\u201d of Taiwan\u2019s literary and political circles \u2014 a man who vigorously defended freedom of speech and rarely missed an opportunity to exercise that freedom, even when it was denied to him by the government.He wrote more than 100 books, mostly about history and politics, and more than 90 of them were banned by the authorities during Taiwan\u2019s long decades of martial law, which ended in 1987.He also had broad popular appeal as the host of several political talk shows, cementing his fame on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.In his later years he dabbled in politics, even running for president in 2000.In interviews, Mr. Li spoke often about his admiration for beautiful women and the politically liberal early 20th-century Chinese philosopher Hu Shih.Li Ao was born on April 25, 1935, in Harbin in what was then the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. His father, Li Dingyi, was an educator and school principal who had eight children \u2014 six daughters and two sons \u2014 with Mr. Li\u2019s mother, Zhang Kuichen.\u201cTo be patriotic, you must follow the Kuomintang, and only the Kuomintang, forever,\u201d Mr. Li wrote. \u201cRegardless of how many contributions you may have made, the party is benevolent simply for not calling you a \u2018traitor.\u2019 This is a lesson my father learned painfully.\u201dFollowing the victory of the Communists over the Kuomintang in 1949, a teenage Mr. Li and his family joined the wave of defeated Nationalists retreating to Taiwan. Not long after, he began to make his name as a writer while he was a student at National Taiwan University.In 1961, Mr. Li, then 26, had graduated and completed a brief stint in the Taiwanese military when he began writing for a popular, liberal literary magazine called Wen Hsing, or Apollo.At the time, Taiwan was more than a decade into a nearly 40-year period of political repression known as the White Terror, during which the Kuomintang imposed authoritarian rule and arrested and tortured tens of thousands of Taiwanese accused of spying for Communist China. At least 1,000 were executed.Despite the immense pressures on intellectuals, the young Mr. Li emerged as a rare voice of dissent, railing against traditional Chinese culture and the Kuomintang government while advocating for the adoption of Western cultural values like liberalism and democracy. Under Mr. Li\u2019s editorship, Apollo became one of the most influential reformist magazines in Taiwan.In 1965, Mr. Li made a daring decision to publish an essay in Apollo lambasting the Kuomintang propaganda chief. In response, the government shut down the publication.\u201cLi Ao was one of the first people in Taiwan to really speak out against the Kuomintang,\u201d said Chen Fang-ming, chairman of the Graduate Institute of Taiwanese Literature at National Chengchi University. \u201cHe helped foster the spirit of resistance in my generation. In the 1960s, before there were any movements outside the party, Li Ao \u2014 one man with a pen \u2014 helped pave the way for a new era.\u201dIn 1971, Mr. Li was arrested and charged with helping Peng Ming-min, a prominent dissident who advocated for Taiwanese independence, flee the country. After a court found Mr. Li guilty of attempting to subvert the government, he spent five years in prison, and his case drew wide international attention.With Taiwan\u2019s transition toward democracy and freedom of speech in the late 1980s, the ban on Mr. Li\u2019s books was lifted. Soon after, dissenting voices like his were no longer so rare.In his later years, Mr. Li was often criticized at home for supporting the reunification of Taiwan and mainland China. In 2000, he ran for president on a platform of reunification, openly calling for \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d but received only 0.13 percent of the vote.In 1980, Mr. Li was briefly married to the Taiwanese actress Terry Hu. In 1992, he married Wang Chih-hui. He is survived by Ms. Wang; their children, Lee Kan and Lee Chen; as well as a daughter, Li Wen, from a previous relationship.\u201cAll over the world leaders have machine guns and tanks,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cSo I\u2019m telling you that in the pursuit of freedom, you have to be smart. You have to use your cunning.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Want to Purge Your Social Media Timelines? Can You Spare a Few Hours?", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixBut before you go there, ask yourself a simpler question: Why do you hoard so much data on social networks in the first place?For many of us, our timeline of posts has piled up since we signed up for Facebook and Twitter. While the social networks portray their products as time capsules of your fondest memories and conversations, the experience of poring through past posts is more like rummaging through a digital junk drawer of good, bad and ugly moments. And the hoarded data is just sitting out there for others to see, including potential employers who are doing background checks and any enemies who may be trying to dig up something against us.So why keep eternal timelines?I posed my question to Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches courses on social media. She said many of us leave up our timeline of posts because Facebook and Twitter don\u2019t make it simple to clean them up. There\u2019s no button to set ablaze a large swath of content, like a year\u2019s worth or even a month\u2019s worth of posts. So we leave everything, including silly comments from our college years and rants we made when we were angry about politics or other matters.\u201cIf you say something online, it has a different kind of permanence,\u201d Ms. Papacharissi cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s always there to haunt you.\u201dSo over the last two months, I decided to do something different by trying to erase that permanence. Specifically, I used web tools to eradicate the vast majority of my Facebook and Twitter posts. Those turned out to be impractical and tedious to use \u2014 though automated, the programs were flawed and missed many posts after several attempts. The chore took about five hours, spread out over weeks.While I walked away from the ashes of my digital self feeling less haunted, I confess my methods may not be worth the trouble, though there are other, more practical solutions. Yet cleaning up your timeline is an exercise I recommend in moderation if you care about your privacy.Here\u2019s how I did it \u2014 and what I learned.Since Facebook and Twitter offer no simple method for doing a mass purging of timelines, you will likely have to rely on third-party tools. I picked two well-reviewed programs: TweetDelete for cleaning up my Twitter account and Social Book Post Manager for handling my Facebook account.From there, you can choose to delete tweets that are more than a week old. The app takes a few minutes to delete large batches of your tweets. One major caveat: Because of a technical limitation, TweetDelete can delete only the last 3,200 tweets on your account. So to clear out roughly 14,000 tweets that were more than a year old, I had to run the app four times. (I\u2019ve had a lot to say on Twitter over the last decade, O.K.?)My Facebook timeline was tougher to manage. After skimming my last 14 years\u2019 worth of Facebook posts, I concluded there was nothing worth keeping. So I opted to purge everything.Social Book Post Manager lets you delete months\u2019 or years\u2019 worth of content \u2014 or everything, which I chose. The problem was, even after I used the app to scrub through my entire timeline six times, the tool missed about a dozen posts. There is a setting to adjust the speed at which the app deletes posts, and I had to choose the minimum speed to do a complete purge.The process was agonizing: I watched years of my youth play back in slow motion, including dated, satirical jokes and photos of myself wearing vintage clothing back when that was a fashion trend, before the tool deleted each post one at a time.After I finished scrubbing my Facebook timeline, I concluded that my delete-everything approach was probably not worth most people\u2019s time. And even after all that time, my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me \u2014 including photos from my 21st birthday (need I say more?) \u2014 because that content was not mine to delete.To help people reminisce, Timehop every day surfaces photos and posts published from years past on Twitter and Facebook. Ms. Gebhart uses the tool to incrementally audit her timeline to see if there was something from the past she might not want lingering around.She said that she rarely found posts worth deleting, but that most people might enjoy this light exercise for peace of mind \u2014 and to protect their public reputations.Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.Beyond the technological difficulties of doing a social media purge, you may decide it\u2019s not right for you. Ms. Papacharissi, the communication professor, said people formed sentimental attachments to their memories on social media, as they do with clothing and old photographs.\u201cThey present a timeline of who we were, of who we are now and who we would like to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like this always-on story. It\u2019s difficult to disconnect that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Cook Over an Icelandic Geyser? Because You Can", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREYKHOLT, Iceland \u2014 Standing in the mud of the Myvatn geyser field in northern Iceland, Kolla Ivarsdottir lifted the lid of her makeshift bread oven. It had been fashioned from the drum of an old washing machine and buried in the geothermally heated earth. All around us mudpots burbled and columns of steam shot skyward, powered by the heat of nascent volcanoes.Ms. Ivarsdottir, a mother of three who sells her bread in a local crafts market, reached into the oven and retrieved a milk carton full of just-baked lava bread, a sweet, dense rye bread that has been made in the hot earth here for centuries. She cut the still-hot loaf into thick slices. It is best eaten, she said, \u201ccompletely covered by a slab of cold butter as thick as your hand, and a slice of smoked salmon, just as thick.\u201d We settled for bread and butter \u2014 still a supernal combination.\u201cDo many people cook other things this way?\u201d I asked, eyeing the natural heat sources all around me.\u201cNot much,\u201d she replied. \u201cSometimes a goose that a hunter shot, but most often, just the lava bread.\u201dI found this surprising in an energy-rich and conservation-minded country that is also a pioneer in modern Nordic cuisine. In this era of slow cookers and sous-vide, wouldn\u2019t it be possible, I wondered, to make a whole meal using Iceland\u2019s natural geothermal ovens?I did more than wonder: I decided to test my proposition, a quest that led me last summer on a wide-ranging tour of this island\u2019s culinary riches.A call to the restaurant critic and fish exporter Kjartan Olafsson, my go-to source for all things Icelandic, caught him in the midst of haying for the horses that carry him and his wife on off-road forays into the wilderness. In this land of rapid weather changes and not much arable land, the folk wisdom of making hay while the sun shines is a deeply held article of faith.\u201cI have just the guy for you,\u201d he said.Before embarking on this experimental venture, Mr. Sigfusson was a traditional fine-dining chef. He cooked in elegant restaurants and for visiting dignitaries like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to whom he served an appetizer of puffin crudo.Puffins, it should be noted, are not protected as an endangered species in Iceland. They are one of the few native game birds available to Icelandic hunters. In keeping with the law, Mr. Sigfusson hunts them only in the traditional way, by dangling over the edge of treacherous cliffs, wielding a 15-foot pole with a net at the end.Mr. Sigfusson and his wife, Asborg, returned to Reykholt, his native village, after raising their children in Reykjavik. They were looking for a slower pace of life. He did not foresee the runaway success that the tomato restaurant would have, but he still maintains a small-town existence, more in tune with nature. He is proud of his successful recent effort to marshal local opposition to the installation of street lamps.\u201cI moved here because I want the moonlight, the stars and the Northern Lights,\u201d he said.\u201cThe water we are drinking fell as rain and snow on that glacier 700 years ago,\u201d Sigfusson said, pointing west to the mountains of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which rise up from the North Atlantic rift that marks the separation of Eurasia from North America.We were standing on the hill above Reykholt, where the town\u2019s geyser has been capped with a roughly finished housing of concrete, topped by a ramshackle smokestack. From that source, the village channels steam and hot water that supply part of the heat and power needs of the modern community.Some of the hot vapor is also diverted to the village\u2019s communal oven, where Mr. Sigfusson proposed to cook our meal. It\u2019s a much safer way to cook in geothermal heat than tiptoeing around boiling geysers.He opened the geyser oven, propping it up with a fence post so that I could peer in safely. The escaping steam was as hot as a sauna and, at the bottom of the oven, a good deal hotter (about 200 degrees Fahrenheit, or 93 degrees Celsius). It smelled a bit sulfurous, too, but that comes with the territory when tapping the heat of the Earth\u2019s core.We agreed to meet the following morning to cook a menu of local fare, including trout from the nearby Tungufljot River and grass-fed Icelandic lamb, a hardy local breed that has the same salty succulence of the famous French agneau de pr\u00e9-sal\u00e9, lamb raised in salt-marsh meadows.For dessert, Mr. Sigfusson suggested abrystir, made from the first milk (nutrient-dense colostrum) produced by a nursing cow. \u201cWhenever one of our cows gave birth, my grandma would take some of the milk and put it in a teakettle set into a pan of hot water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so rich that pretty soon it had set into a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e all on its own \u2014 no eggs.\u201dThe next day broke bluebird-bright, with cotton-candy clouds and a light breeze. \u201cFirst we forage,\u201d Mr. Sigfusson said when we met. \u201cWild herbs are everywhere.\u201dOur small group ranged along the hillside. The ground was carpeted by wild thyme, with purple flowers the size of a gumdrop nestled among tender flavorful leaves. In the lusher folds and hollows, we found angelica, a plant with a floral, almost verbena note and just a touch of bitterness \u2014 well suited to contain the broad flavors of the unctuous lamb.Mr. Sigfusson lopped off two stalks of wild hops to season the broth, a new use \u2014 at least to me \u2014 of the brewmaster\u2019s mainstay.As we prepped the meal, he offered us cold beers and appetizers: smoked ptarmigan and cured salmon on rye crackers, with tomato jams and chutneys from the restaurant and, as with just about everything one eats in Iceland, cold fresh butter.The ptarmigan had been smoked over dried smoldering sheep dung, which is pretty much the only thing you can use for smoking in this relatively treeless landscape, where a 15-foot fir tree towers like a sequoia.With the tailgate of his truck serving as our work surface, we separated some greenhouse romanesco into florets and tossed them into a Dutch oven. We cubed baby kohlrabi, did the same with the smoky brined lamb shoulder, then added the herbs, the hops and a half-dozen glugs of cream. As we worked, the geyser would blow its top every seven minutes, and we had to pause, retreating beyond the reach of its warm, misty spray.We left the oven to work its magic and, a few hours later, returned to unburden it of our meal. The bread, Jon\u2019s own variation on this Viking staple, could have easily sufficed for the whole meal had we not exercised some restraint. The trout was flaky and herbaceous. The milk pudding, topped with a jam of green tomatoes, ginger, and honey was super-creamy.But the star of the show was the lamb braise. The meat was salty and smoky, the creamy gravy enriched with the captured juices of lamb, romanesco and kohlrabi, and everything suffused with wild thyme, angelica and hops \u2014 which brought the sweetness-enhancing quality of fresh tarragon. I made a note to try it under the skin of my next roast chicken.The breeze was gentle, and the ground was soft and dry enough to lie or sit on without getting damp. Late afternoon sun lit up the landscape formed by long ago by lava flows. It looked like pale-green velvet rippled by the breeze.I\u2019ll admit to a tingle of schadenfreude as I looked over at Hekla to see to see if the soul of anyone on my hit list was plunging into hellfire, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it. The day was too lovely, the natural world too congenial and the food too satisfying to yield to uncharitable fantasies.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified a chimney on a hill above Reykholt. It is a vent for the geyser, not for the communal oven.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sex Trafficking Bill Heads to Trump, Over Silicon Valley Concerns", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate gave final approval on Wednesday to legislation that strengthens the policing of sex trafficking, over the opposition of many internet companies. Lawmakers are trying to catch up to the reality of prostitution long after the bartering of children and adults moved from the streets to the web.The 97-to-2 vote was the culmination of a multiyear effort by Republicans and Democrats to allow state law enforcement officials to go after websites like Backpage.com that facilitate sex trafficking. The bill would also suspend protections that shielded internet companies from legal liability for the content on their sites.The legislation has pitted lawmakers against Silicon Valley companies and civil liberties groups, which hold starkly differing views on the government\u2019s oversight of the internet. Big tech companies like Facebook and Google have flourished with little regulation for years, but they have come under intense scrutiny after their platforms were manipulated by foreign agents during the 2016 presidential election.\u201cThe president and his entire administration are firmly committed to holding those who participate in these horrific crimes accountable, and look forward to continued work with these stakeholders in order to put an end to this scourge,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said in a statement after the vote.\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which convened hearings on sex trafficking. \u201cThis is clearly illegal activity. It was happening online. But I think in the future, tech companies have to understand that it\u2019s not the wild West, and they have to exercise responsibility.\u201dPaul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen, said the sex trafficking bill would not directly hurt big internet companies. But he said it was \u201ccracking the door open to broader platform liability for other types of content.\u201d\u201cToday, it\u2019s sex trafficking,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd down the road, it\u2019s content from foreign governments.\u201dInternet companies have feared the bill would weaken a crucial legal shield that since 1996 has guarded them from liability for illegal content on their sites. They point to the safe harbor provision as the foundation for the growth of internet commerce. Civil liberties groups have decried the bill as a threat to free speech and a limit to the free flow of content on the web.But that protection for websites, lawmakers argued, has been abused and needed revision so law enforcement could pursue the worst perpetrators, such as Backpage.com, a popular classified advertising site that freely advertises sex for sale, while hiding behind the safe harbor clause.The new bill will allow state police and attorneys general to go after sites that knowingly host sex trafficking content. It will also allow victims of sex trafficking to sue such sites for damages.\u201cThis is legislation that is overdue in my view, and it\u2019s required,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who was a co-author of the bill with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe courts have told us that. The district attorneys have told us that. The attorneys general told us that.\u201dWhen it was introduced in August 2017, the bill attracted immediate support from law enforcement and advocates for victims of sex trafficking. It also drew intense opposition from tech companies and free-speech advocates, who say any weakening of liability protections would lead to abuse by law enforcement, hurt start-ups that cannot afford to fight lawsuits and stifle free speech.The law \u201cwould almost certainly cause irreparable harm to free speech and the internet economy,\u201d said Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs chief for Open Technology Institute at New America, a research and advocacy group.But with prominent fights flaring over Russian election interference, data breaches and other scandals, the biggest tech companies \u2014 no longer wishing to publicly oppose a bill fighting sex trafficking \u2014 retreated from their lobbying effort in recent weeks.The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Facebook, Google, Netflix and Apple, has backed off from the strong stance they had against the bill when it was introduced.\u201cThe internet industry shares the goals of lawmakers who want to put an end to trafficking online, and Internet Association will continue to be a key partner with policymakers on this important issue,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, president of the group, who added that it would work to preserve other aspects of the liability shield.The legislation stemmed from a two-year Senate investigation led by Mr. Portman into Backpage.com, the classifieds page rampant with ads for prostitution and sex trafficking.

Behind him, a drummer lifts his arms joyously in the air. It is the type of club photo we have seen many times, often taken in famous venues like the Savoy Ballroom, Caf\u00e9 Society or the Cotton Club. Except this one was taken in Seattle, a city known more for grunge than great jazz. Photographing clubs in the 1940s, Mr. Smith documented a heroic period for Seattle jazz, a scene that jump-started the careers of luminaries like Quincy Jones, Ray Charles and Ernestine Anderson. Unlike other nightclubs, where patrons of color were barred except on designated nights, the integrated establishments of Jackson Street, in the city\u2019s predominantly black Central District, embraced African-American performers and customers. Mr. Smith, who died in 2008 at the age of 92, was born to Jamaican immigrant parents and grew up in the Central District in a close-knit West Indian community. \u201cWhen my father ... was given a Kodak camera as a preteen, he fell in love with photography,\u201d noted the younger Mr. Smith. \u201cFrom then on, he always had a camera. It was like a universal key that opened doors and gave him license to go anywhere.\u201dAfter traveling the Pacific as a steward on steamships, Mr. Smith returned to Seattle in the 1940s, raising a family in the District. Documenting Seattle\u2019s after-hours jazz scene, the enterprising and self-taught photographer started On the Spot, a business that sold photographs to club patrons. Through Mr. Smith\u2019s lens, we witness an impressive range of jazz musicians performing, including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Lionel Hampton. After the jazz nightclub scene largely shut down in the mid-1950s, Mr. Smith, who remained a letter carrier by day, became the go-to photographer for events, celebrations, and gatherings in the African-American community. These intimate images also chronicled the broader cultural and demographic shifts of the Central District.Mr. Smith\u2019s photographs bear witness to this social and cultural transformation: the beauty parlors and barber shops that were vital to the district\u2019s business sector; the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, the nation\u2019s first intercollegiate African-American fraternity; the \u201cInternational Fighting Irish\u201d youth football team, sponsored by the Japanese-American Veterans Association and open to children of all races; Mardi Gras, a weeklong summer festival evocative of its New Orleans counterpart; and the singer and pianist Hazel Scott, who refused to perform in segregated venues, playing the Civic Auditorium in 1947.The photo of Ms. Scott is a reminder that Seattle\u2019s African-American jazz scene was not immune to racism. While the Jackson Street clubs drew renowned musicians, the mainstream press did not cover them, focusing instead on the classical music venues favored by white people. As prejudice banished a rich and flourishing music scene from the cultural mainstream, Mr. Smith faithfully documented it for posterity. His photographs tell us as much about the present as they do about the past. The once bustling and self-sufficient neighborhood he documented for more than half a century has changed dramatically. Gentrification, the decline of affordable housing, the influx of young, mostly white tech workers, and the continued legacy of racism and segregation have transformed a predominantly black neighborhood into a mostly white one: In 1970, the black population of the Central District was 73 percent. By 2014, it had dwindled to less than 20 percent. In this context, Mr. Smith\u2019s documentation of Seattle\u2019s African-American community testifies to the possibilities of the past as well as the diminished opportunities of the present. \u201cIt surprises me why there weren\u2019t more people taking these pictures back then,\u201d he once remarked. In light of the vanishing of a dynamic community, it is fortunate that at least one talented and devoted photographer saw fit to embrace this responsibility.

{"Headline": "Rice, Coming Off the Sidelines, Becomes a Centerpiece", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI have a theory about why even experienced cooks are intimidated by plain rice. Cooking rice is mysterious in the same way as baking a cake. There are proportions you need to stick to religiously, a cooking process that you can\u2019t see, and a rest period during which you can only cross your fingers and hope for the best. It\u2019s all an act of faith where you trust heat, time and a particular ratio of liquid to rice and have no control over the outcome.My inclination to turn rice into a meal in itself, or at least a substantial part of the meal, rather than a side dish, has its origins in my roots in the Middle East. When I was growing up in Jerusalem, a weekend meal in either an Arab or Jewish household could be a pot of rice, slowly cooked with plenty of vegetables and possibly meat pieces strewn through. For a fancier occasion this formula would become a pilaf with saffron, nuts and dried fruit, elevating the plain rice to aristocratic heights.For my turmeric rice, for example, I added tomatoes to the rice, which meant I needed a little less cooking liquid than I normally use. Then I worked taste by taste, adding spices and other flavors to balance out the intensity of the tomatoes. Another dish, far more involved, required more fine-tuning. My maqluba \u2014 a traditional upside-down rice cake with tomatoes on top \u2014 simply wouldn\u2019t cook evenly since it was so large. So, instead, I parboiled the rice, and then just steamed it with a small amount of extra water in the dish to finish off the cooking. (It only took six attempts to get that formula just right!)In all these dishes, the wise cook will remember that cooking the rice correctly is the most important step; everything else can be adjusted, re-seasoned, or covered with herbs or \u2014 if all else fails \u2014 melted cheese.Advertisement"}

Mr. Zuckerberg wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.The janitor is another story.Other places have saner methods. Finland and Argentina, for example, have tailored fines to income for almost 100 years. The most common model, the \u201cday fine,\u201d scales sanctions to a person\u2019s daily wage. A small offense like littering might cost a fraction of a day\u2019s pay. A serious crime might swallow a month\u2019s paycheck. Everyone pays the same proportion of their income.For a justice system committed to treating like offenders alike, scaling fines to income is a matter of basic fairness. Making everyone pay the same sticker price is evenhanded on the surface, but only if you ignore the consequences of a fine on the life of the person paying. The flat fine threatens poor people with financial ruin while letting rich people break the law without meaningful repercussions. Equity requires punishment that is equally felt.Plus, scaled fines might encourage more equitable prosecution. That\u2019s particularly true in cities like Ferguson that went easy on wealthier residents but treated poor people like cash cows. After all, the city would get more bang for its buck pulling over a rich driver with a blown blinker.This moment is different. Amid a flourishing national movement to reform our criminal justice system and tackle income inequality, the progressive fine is an idea whose time may finally have come.Alec Schierenbeck is a lawyer from Brooklyn.Advertisement"}

But the M.I.T. researchers, using software to identify and weed out bots, found that with or without the bots, the results were essentially the same.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of disheartening at first to realize how much we humans are responsible,\u201d said Sinan Aral, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and an author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not really the robots that are to blame.\u201dHere are other findings from the research.The stories were classified as true or false, using information from six independent fact-checking organizations including Snopes, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org. To ensure that their analysis held up in general \u2014 not just on claims that drew the attention of fact-checking groups \u2014 the researchers enlisted students to annotate as true or false more than 13,000 other stories that circulated on Twitter. Again, a tilt toward falsehood was clear.\u201cThe comprehensiveness is important here, spanning the entire history of Twitter,\u201d said Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University. \u201cAnd this study shines a spotlight on the open question of the success of false information online.\u201dThe M.I.T. researchers pointed to factors that contribute to the appeal of false news. Applying standard text-analysis tools, they found that false claims were significantly more novel than true ones \u2014 maybe not a surprise, since falsehoods are made up.The study\u2019s authors also explored the emotions evoked by false and true stories. The goal, said Soroush Vosoughi, a postdoctoral researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and the lead author, was to find clues about what is \u201cin the nature of humans that makes them like to share false news.\u201dThe study analyzed the sentiment expressed by users in replies to claims posted on Twitter. As a measurement tool, the researchers used a system created by Canada\u2019s National Research Council that associates English words with eight emotions. False claims elicited replies expressing greater surprise and disgust. True news inspired more anticipation, sadness and joy, depending on the nature of the stories.The researchers provided an example of two business stories, and how much more time it took the true one to reach 200 retweets. The example also shows the judgment calls made by fact-checking organizations.The M.I.T. researchers said that understanding how false news spreads is a first step toward curbing it. They concluded that human behavior plays a large role in explaining the phenomenon, and mention possible interventions, like better labeling, to alter behavior.Mr. Roy acknowledged the challenge in trying to not only alter individual behavior but also in enlisting the support of big internet platforms like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, and media companies.\u201cPolarization,\u201d he said, \u201chas turned out to be a great business model.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Facebook\u2019s Data Sharing Went From Feature to Bug", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftNo longer, he said, would Facebook be a closed-off software product like every other social network. Instead, it would become an open platform and invite outside developers to build apps and programs on top of it.Later, popular games like FarmVille arrived, and apps like Tinder and Spotify began allowing their users to log in using their Facebook credentials. In some ways, it was a fair trade. Facebook got to weave itself more deeply into users\u2019 internet habits, and the outside app developers got access to a big audience and valuable data about their users. In all, millions of apps have been created with Facebook\u2019s open platform tools.Through it all, Facebook\u2019s users were mostly unfazed. Sure, these apps collected data about their lives. But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?What happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn\u2019t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn\u2019t stolen from Facebook\u2019s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called \u201cthisisyourdigitallife.\u201dThat app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.Technically, only this last step violated Facebook\u2019s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they\u2019ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it\u2019s unclear how many do.This kind of broad data collection is not only allowed but encouraged by Facebook, which wants to keep developers happily building on top of its platform. Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.But in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.\u201cIt seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people\u2019s data,\u201d said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was \u201cextremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.\u201d\u201cWe thought that every app could be social,\u201d Mr. Bosworth wrote. \u201cYour calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn\u2019t materialize the way we had hoped.\u201dBut the core functions of Facebook\u2019s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like \u201cthisisyourdigitallife\u201d out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn\u2019t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.\u201cEverything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,\u201d said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. \u201cThey\u2019re in your home, in your business, in your car. It\u2019s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.\u201dIn Facebook\u2019s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook\u2019s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook\u2019s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.In this context, it\u2019s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans. After all, why else would the quiz be there?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Social Media Be Saved?", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftI don\u2019t need to tell you that something is wrong with social media.The primary problem with today\u2019s social networks is that they\u2019re already too big, and are trapped inside a market-based system that forces them to keep growing. Facebook can\u2019t stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks can\u2019t stop selling coffee \u2014 it\u2019s the heart of the enterprise.Many of the fixes being proposed involve regulation. The Honest Ads Act, a bill in the Senate, would require greater transparency for online political ads. The European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, aims to give users greater control of their digital information trails.If we\u2019re really serious about changing how social networks operate, far more radical interventions are required. Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the market-based pressures that got us here.Facebook, they write, is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests. It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant, centralized enterprise, with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platform\u2019s governance.Instead, the authors ask, what if a social network was truly run by its users?\u201cIf you\u2019re contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence, you should share in the value you\u2019re creating,\u201d Mr. Heimans told me.\u201cHe could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.Another radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email \u2014 so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another, across a common protocol.Instead of one big Facebook, a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes \u2014 Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook \u2014 all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense. Rather than requiring a one-size-fits-all set of policies that apply to billions of users, these nodes could be designed to reflect users\u2019 priorities. (A network for privacy hawks and one for open-sharing maximalists could have different data-retention rules, and a network for L.G.B.T. users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules.) If a node became too toxic, it could be removed without shutting down the entire network.\u201cEmail is the most resilient social network on the internet,\u201d Mr. Schneider said, \u201cand the thing that allows it to adapt is that it\u2019s an open protocol, and people build apps on top of it, and we evolve how we use it.\u201dNone of this is a panacea. But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests, rather than those of a faceless corporation.A single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid, Tinder and Bumble wasn\u2019t the way they were designed or the companies behind them \u2014 it was how long they had existed.New apps, she said, were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates. Older apps, by contrast, were eventually overrun with creeps and predators, no matter how well built they were.A similar theory might apply to social networks. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years, but they were by and large cleaner, with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior. Today, the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors, and many of our \u201csocial graphs\u201d \u2014 Facebook\u2019s term for the webs of digital connections we create \u2014 are clogged with years\u2019 worth of clutter.I\u2019d go even further, and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic \u201cself-cleaning\u201d option, which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used, friendships and followers they no longer interacted with, and data they no longer needed to store. If these tools were enabled, users would need to take affirmative action if they didn\u2019t want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or years.Making social graphs temporary, rather than preserving them forever by default, would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks\u2019 business models. But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene, and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded. It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks, when things were fresh and fascinating, and not quite so scary.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of registered users on Mastodon. It is more than a million, not more than 140,000.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Worst People", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEarly Tuesday morning, Donald Trump tweeted:\u201cThe new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!\u201dLies. Of course the White House is in chaos. It\u2019s just that Trump has lived his whole life in a state of chaos, so it feels perfectly normal to him. The only energy around Trump is a vortex of complicity and incompetence.Furthermore, it should be clear to us all at this point that Trump\u2019s public relations approach to dealing with unfavorable news is simply to rush to the nearest microphone \u2014 or log into Twitter \u2014 and say that the exact opposite is true, even when his statement is an easily provable lie.Being right is never the point; retaliation is the point.\u201cThe White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job. You know, I read where, oh gee, maybe people don\u2019t want to work for Trump, and believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office. They want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9; it\u2019s just a great place to work. It\u2019s got tremendous energy.\u201dThen Trump lurches into emperor mode, discussing how much he enjoys the gladiator-style blood sport of the administration he has:\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it and I think it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201dTrump ended by boasting that \u201cI have a choice of anybody.\u201d He continued, \u201cI could take any position in the White House, and I\u2019ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.\u201dPart of that is due to the extraordinary level of turnover in this administration.\u201cTrump\u2019s turnover is record-setting, more than triple that of Obama and double that of Reagan. In looking at why Trump has experienced such high turnover, I argue he has valued loyalty over qualifications and suffered from a White House that has functioned in a chaotic manner.\u201dThis is exactly the opposite of what Trump told us would happen.In April 2016, Trump wrote on Facebook, \u201cI am self funding and will hire the best people, not the biggest donors!\u201d when posting an article about Democrats\u2019 hopes to work in a potential Hillary Clinton administration.\u201cO.K. I would do a number of things. I would, No. 1, I would start negotiating great trade deals using \u2014 I know the best people.\u201d\u201cTrack record, great competence, love of what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re getting along with people, references, I mean no different than when you\u2019re running a company, how you hire top people. It would be no different.\u201dTrump later added: \u201cYou need people that are truly, truly capable, and you need, and I think so much has to do with past history: how\u2019ve they done, how\u2019s it all worked out. You understand what I mean by that, perhaps better than anybody. And, we have to get the best people.\u201dIt all turned out to be a lie.Trump is the worst boss who hires the worst people: People who confess to crimes, are secretly operating as foreign agents, allegedly beat their wives and have absolutely no expertise in the area in which they work.When you choose loyalists and sycophants over experts and professionals, this disaster of an administration is what you get.Advertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.For the first time, the Pied Piper crew is running things. Did that change how you approached the story?It felt pretty natural. In a way, some of this to me is analogous to stuff that happens in Hollywood. I started out making animated shorts in my house by myself. Then when \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d happened, I had people fighting over it \u2014 there was the stress of, am I getting screwed here? And eventually I had about as many people working for me on \u201cBeavis and Butt-Head\u201d as Richard [Thomas Middleditch] does in Season 5, and that became just as stressful. I\u2019m not someone who enjoys telling people to do something they don\u2019t want to do, and Richard is the same way. So there\u2019s plenty of comedy that can come from stuff like that.How did T. J. Miller\u2019s departure affect the show?What did you make of his bomb-throwing exit? [Laughs.] It seemed very much like T. J. \u2014 I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. He\u2019s a brilliantly funny guy. I\u2019ve seen these quotes \u2014 he\u2019s always been a good put-down artist. But yeah, I don\u2019t know what to really make of it, and it\u2019s not any of my business anymore, you know?The show started off making fun of the goofy grandiosity of the tech industry, but the current perception of Silicon Valley is more critical. Has the show changed as a result?Yeah, and actually we deal with that this season, with what Richard\u2019s building. It\u2019s like that quote: If you\u2019re getting the service for free, then you\u2019re the product. Those servers and all the infrastructure and engineers cost money. So, you\u2019re paying by them looking for keywords in your email and popping ads up.Which is familiar to anyone who\u2019s had a sneaker ad follow them around online.Yeah, if they did. There have been a couple discussions about it, and about how we would do it, but nothing concrete yet. I think you\u2019d have to have Bobby and all of them be older. The Simpsons are such iconic characters; Bart could be that age forever because it\u2019s a more surreal show. But with \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d being on 13 years, I think people were really starting to wonder why Bobby\u2019s still the same age.Even when we were shooting the movie, the wardrobe designer showed me these shoes \u2014 they weren\u2019t out in the world yet. And she said, \u201cThis is a start-up, they\u2019re making these shoes and they\u2019re going to look completely ridiculous.\u201d Plastic shoes with holes in them. And I said to her, \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m worried about is, what if these things blow up and by the time the movie comes out, they\u2019re everywhere?\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s never going to happen. No one is going to buy these things.\u201d And then, the movie comes out, and they are all wearing Crocs, and those shoes were just becoming huge. So, I think that was a sign that maybe a lot of these dumb things are going to come to pass.It was the Croc in the coal mine.[Laughs.] Oh man.You have a remarkable track record of creating things that seem to stick with people, whether it\u2019s \u201cIdiocracy\u201d or \u201cOffice Space\u201d or characters like Hank and Bobby Hill. Do you have a personal favorite?Well for Lumbergh \u2014 I\u2019m old enough to remember when an office job sounded great. I worked at Jack in the Box and worked construction, those kinds of jobs, and I remember thinking, \u201cOh my God, you can work in an office? That would be wonderful.\u201d And then the first time I did it, I had that type of boss \u2014 that passive-aggressive boss. I would rather have a guy yelling at me on a construction site. I had done an animated version but the way Gary Cole played that character, I thought that was something really great that hadn\u2019t been done yet. So, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m pretty proud of that one.An earlier version of this article included a quotation from Mike Judge that misstated Google\u2019s Gmail ad policy.

{"Headline": "The New \u2018Superpredator\u2019 Myth", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. DiIulio has retracted some of his ideas, but the damage is done. The \u201csuperpredator myth\u201d ushered in a wave of intensified policing and harsher sentences that fueled mass incarceration.Something similar is happening today.The way the police and prosecutors are trying to dismantle youth gangs \u2014 haphazardly putting teenager\u2019s names into gang databases, issuing civil injunctions, levying broad conspiracy charges and increasing deportations \u2014 is also a misguided panic that is likely to have the same effect.This kind of law enforcement relies on the same logic that has driven much of the enormous increase in incarceration over the last 40 years. It wrongly assumes that deterrence and incapacitation are the only ways to change the behavior of young people and that any teenager who commits a crime is a hardened sociopath.California has pursued this punitive approach for many years and has little to show for it. For example, the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit, tasked with combating gang-related crime, achieved a temporary drop in crime. But the unit disbanded in the late 1990s after officers were accused of widespread brutality, framing of suspects and stealing then reselling drugs. The city\u2019s problem with gang violence persists.Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities also use gang databases to subject young people to heightened surveillance, criminal penalties, deportation and inclusion in broad-reaching civil injunctions. These databases have come under scrutiny because a child may be included for arbitrary reasons, like wearing a certain color of clothing or hanging out in a particular park. Portland, Ore., eliminated its database last year after a local journalist pressed the Police Department for information about its contents and use. California also passed a law requiring that people be notified when they\u2019re added to a database and giving them the right to petition to be removed from it.Similar concerns have been raised about the use of gang injunctions that criminalize people based on their alleged connection to a gang. The restrictions on association are often impossible to abide by, given their broad scope. In many cases, to avoid associating with \u201cknown gang members\u201d means people can\u2019t see certain relatives, walk to school with certain friends or visit local parks.The use of large-scale conspiracy cases is also problematic. A few years ago, the New York Police Department began Operation Crew Cut, which involves long-term investigations of people suspected of being gang members in high-violence areas. Working with prosecutors, the department has conducted dozens of high-profile raids in which more than 2,000 young people have been arrested on state and federal conspiracy charges.The Police Department believes that by targeting small groups of people responsible for much of the city\u2019s gun violence, such raids have helped reduce the number of shootings over the past two years. Crime is down in targeted areas, but crime is also down across the city and the country. So it\u2019s impossible to isolate the raids as the reasons for these declines.It\u2019s also unclear whether the gains in New York will be durable. Gang-suppression efforts in other parts of the country rarely show long-term success, in part because teenagers in poor, racially segregated communities will continue to face the challenges of insecurity and hopelessness that drive youth violence.Through the New York Police Department\u2019s use of conspiracy cases, these raids cover a wide range of behaviors that are not acts of violence, like marijuana possession. This approach misunderstands the nature of gangs and the dense social networks inhabited by these young people targeted for prosecution. Despite overheated rhetoric from the police, politicians and the media, there is often very little evidence in these conspiracy cases of an organized hierarchical structure to these alleged gangs, which instead are often loose affiliations without purpose beyond socializing and seeking mutual safety.Most of the raids in New York have been concentrated in and around public housing developments, where teenagers have little choice but to develop continuing relationships, even if those acquaintances are involved in violence. The police claim that because these young people spend time together in a park, were previously arrested together and are seen together in Facebook posts, they are in a well-defined gang engaged in ongoing crime and violence. But that is much too simplistic.Prosecutors rely heavily on these conspiracy charges, not because they involve true criminal enterprises but because they can be used as leverage against defendants. State conspiracy and federal RICO anti-racketeering statutes allow prosecutors to threaten decades of prison time based merely on evidence of associations and potentially unrelated low-level criminal charges from the past.The gang designation also usually makes defendants ineligible for bail, giving them a stronger incentive to provide evidence against others or take a plea deal. In many cases, the only evidence against a defendant accused of violence is the testimony of someone in jail hoping to avoid prosecution. Many young people have complained to their public defenders that during questioning, the police have pressured them to hand over social media passwords, even when they have not been charged with a crime and in the absence of a parent or legal representative.Many of the defendants in the New York City cases are jailed before trial for long periods of time and face possibly decades in prison, even though a vast majority of them are not being accused of actual involvement in violence. That leaves their families to choose either getting evicted from public housing or agreeing that their child will be banned from their home forever. Communities are undermined as young people are forced to testify against their neighbors to avoid prosecution.Instead of doubling down on gang-suppression policing, New York City should invest in better alternatives. The city supports 18 Cure Violence programs to reduce shootings. The program\u2019s sites, often a substantial portion of the area\u2019s police precinct, rely on community-based \u201cviolence interrupters\u201d who work with young people. New York also promulgates anti-violence public health messaging and involves young people in social activities like art programs and service projects.When community-based alternatives are well funded and well operated, they can make a real difference in reducing gun violence. Though no one program will solve all of our violence problems, it\u2019s time to dial back the criminalization approach and give communities the resources they need to create lasting public safety.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Backs Off Political Argument in Antitrust Case", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. AT&T and Time Warner will counter those arguments by saying that even with a merger, it is an underdog against online giants like Facebook and Google.\u201cIf TV-program distributor AT&T acquires TV-program producer Time Warner, American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief submitted on Friday evening.In its brief, AT&T countered by saying, \u201cThis merger has never been about making Time Warner programs less accessible or more expensive. Just the opposite: It is about making Time Warner and AT&T more competitive during a revolutionary transformation that is occurring in the video programming marketplace.\u201dThe trial, one of the biggest antitrust showdowns in decades, will begin March 19 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. It is expected to last about three weeks.AT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.But late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal. AT&T and Time Warner has dropped \u201cselective enforcement\u201d as a defense, according to the new filings.Even absent the question of presidential interference in the deal, the trial is pivotal for the telecom and media industries, providing a clue about the chances of other industry deals, like Disney\u2019s bid for 21st Century Fox. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey Bewkes, are expected to take the stand.\u201cThis is the single most important decision this year\u201d for technology, telecom and media firms, said Amy Yong, a research analyst at Macquarie Group in New York. \u201cIt will frame regulation and mergers and acquisitions going forward and raise questions about all the consolidation in the past, too.\u201dIf the judge sides with AT&T and Time Warner, he would usher in the creation of a new kind of corporate behemoth \u2014 one with nationwide reach via wireless and satellite television service that would also have control over a movie studio and channels like HBO, CNN and TNT, which has valuable basketball sports rights.The company would have a leading position to negotiate licensing deals with rival telecom and media firms. It would also be in a stronger position against fast-growing streaming video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.The trial will also reveal much about the state of the industry. Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.The Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.AT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content. The company said it would argue that the merger of two companies that do not compete would be a stronger competitor in a market that had many new companies from Silicon Valley, like Facebook and Netflix.\u201cAs will be demonstrated at trial, the new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google, and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies as market leaders in both video programming and video distribution,\u201d AT&T said in its brief.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a research analyst at Macquarie Group.

{"Headline": "Philando Castile Charity Pays Off Lunch Debt for Hundreds of Students", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, a year and a half after his death, a fund-raiser created in Mr. Castile\u2019s memory is continuing his legacy. Last week, the creator of the charity, Philando Feeds the Children, delivered a $35,000 check to St. Paul Public Schools \u2014 enough to finish paying off the debt owed by every student enrolled in the National School Lunch Program at the district\u2019s 56 schools, including Mr. Castile\u2019s former campus.Ms. Fergus created the charity last fall as a class project with her students in Psychology 212. It had a more modest goal then: to raise several thousand dollars to cover students\u2019 cafeteria debts at J.J. Hill. But the donations came rushing in, easily surpassing their expectations and raising tens of thousands of dollars in a few months.In October, Ms. Fergus delivered the first check, a $10,000 payment to St. Paul Public Schools, the district said. Combined with the $35,000 donation last week, Philando Feeds the Children has covered the debts of at least 1,788 students, the district said on Sunday night.\u201cThis fund-raiser demonstrates the kind and generous spirit our community members hold in their heart for the students of S.P.P.S.,\u201d Toya Stewart Downey, a school district spokeswoman, said in an email.Mr. Castile knew firsthand the hardships many students face. In 2002, at 19, he joined the nutrition services department of St. Paul Public Schools. He became a supervisor in 2014 and had been working at J.J. Hill for several years at the time of his death. On Sunday, his mother, Valerie Castile, shared a news article about the charity\u2019s work on her Facebook page.\u201cGOD Gave US Your Spirit Of Love And Kindness,\u201d wrote Ms. Castile, who did not return a call seeking comment on Sunday. \u201cYour Legacy Will Live Forever!!\u201dIn the school district, about 70 percent of the roughly 37,000 students are enrolled in free or reduced-price lunch, a federal program that pays for a student\u2019s entire meal or a large part of it. Students whose families are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, automatically receive free lunches at school. Others are eligible based on income: A student in a family of three would qualify for free lunch if the household made less than $26,546 a year.Every St. Paul student who goes through the cafeteria line receives a meal, and those who are charged a full or reduced price have the amount withdrawn from a personal account. If that account is insufficiently funded, a debt accrues. But the school district, not the families, is ultimately responsible for the bill. If an account balance is never paid, the district relies on donations or digs elsewhere into its budget to cover the cost.Although the donations from Philando Feeds the Children have covered the debts of students enrolled in the federal program, the district still has $100,000 in lunch debt, said Stacy Koppen, its director of nutrition services. Additional students could qualify but have not turned in their applications, and others just miss the financial cutoff for eligibility.\u201cOur goal is to enroll them in the lunch program if we can,\u201d Ms. Koppen said in an email on Sunday. \u201cDonations are used to cover unpaid meal charges, but that amount of money is finite.\u201dSix months after the fund-raiser started, people have donated more than $148,000, according to its website. The organizer\u2019s ambitions have grown, too: Ms. Fergus wrote on the site that she now hoped to collect $999,999, raising enough to pay lunch debts in schools across Minnesota.Advertisement"}

Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s 45-year-old chief executive, would fit in the group. So would Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who co-founded the search engine as graduate students two decades ago; Susan Wojcicki, an early employee who runs YouTube; and most of the company\u2019s other high-ranking executives.For years, the self-appointed leaders of Silicon Valley were young people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 with age-appropriate behavior. They adopted brash mottos like \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d and eschewed work-life balance in favor of all-night hacking sessions in offices that looked more like college dorms. Their successes were cheered, and their sins were shrugged off as the cost of innovation.There\u2019s a lot of growing up happening in today\u2019s tech industry, where former whiz kids made their fortunes and are now settling down, starting families and starting to think about their legacies. Tech\u2019s work force remains young \u2014 according to PayScale, the median employee at the five largest tech companies is around 30, roughly a decade younger than the median American worker \u2014 but the industry\u2019s leaders have gotten older, and are seemingly more attuned to the power they wield.\u201cFive years ago, there was no talk of empathy or moral responsibility,\u201d said Om Malik, a venture capitalist who has written about the tech industry for years.In recent weeks, I spoke to numerous industry insiders about this coming of age. Here\u2019s what I learned.Tech leaders are becoming more realistic and introspective.Gregor Hochmuth, 33, an early engineer at Instagram, said some of today\u2019s internet giants had grown up with positive-thinking cultures that left them vulnerable to abuse.\u201cThe idea that a product could make your life worse was not in anyone\u2019s perception,\u201d said Mr. Hochmuth, who left Instagram in 2014.That perspective helps explain the shock many founders felt when the internet grew into the foundation of global culture and commerce, and products they had built as quirky experiments became pieces of critical infrastructure.\u201cNo one was thinking about \u2018Wow, in 15 years, billions of people are going to be using this site every day,\u2019\u201d said Andrew McCollum, 34, one of Facebook\u2019s founders, who left the company in 2006 and is now the chief executive of Philo, an internet TV company. \u201cThe goal was \u2018How do we create something great?\u2019 \u2014 not \u2018What\u2019s our plan for world domination?\u2019\u201dTwitter, another company started by young idealists, is the latest tech giant to put itself under the microscope. In a series of tweets early this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said the company was trying to improve the health and civility of its platform after years of neglect.You could chalk these statements up to self-interest. But Maureen Taylor, a leadership communication expert who frequently coaches tech executives, said this kind of earnest self-examination was becoming more frequent among founders.\u201cAs you get older, you realize your responsibilities are bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are becoming very thoughtful about the ramifications of technology, and remembering that the whole point was to make the world a better place.\u201dTheir new outlook is making them more protective and risk-averse.\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\u201cBefore fatherhood, I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I\u2019d support,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cIncreasingly, what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens.\u201dIndustries run by older executives aren\u2019t necessarily paragons of virtue, either. (See: Wall Street.) But there is something to be said for caution, and tech companies now seem aware that they\u2019re playing with live ammunition.\u201cYou become more responsible when you have more to lose,\u201d Mr. Malik said.It also may make their companies more vulnerable.Silicon Valley works a bit like a forest \u2014 as old trees decay and die, they decompose and fertilize the next generation of growth. And today\u2019s largest tech companies are beginning to show their age. Facebook is 14 years old, and Twitter is 12. Google, at 20, is now nearly as old as Microsoft was in 1998, when Google was started.Mr. Ellison was wrong, of course. Tech wasn\u2019t stagnant, but the generation of mature companies that included Oracle was on its way to being eclipsed by newer and scrappier ventures.If history is any indication, that cycle will repeat itself and a new crop of young tech leaders will emerge. But hopefully they\u2019ll learn from the mistakes made by their predecessors. Technology is too important now, and we can\u2019t afford another generation of na\u00efvet\u00e9.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica Whistle-Blower Contends Data-Mining Swung Brexit Vote", "Date": "2018-03-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The whistle-blower Christopher Wylie held a roomful of British lawmakers rapt for three and a half hours on Tuesday, like a pink-haired, nose-ringed oracle sent from the future to explain data.In one of the longest sessions in recent memory, Mr. Wylie made a number of jaw-dropping assertions, most significantly that the company\u2019s exploitation of personal data had swung the results of Britain\u2019s 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He also suggested that his predecessor at Cambridge Analytica was murdered.But mostly, Mr. Wylie tried to explain data-mining. He looked like a cerebral skate-rat, which might in other circumstances have undermined his credibility, but in this case it seemed to help. He was polite. He resembled, as one journalist put it, \u201ca patient grandson trying to set up a Skype call with his gran.\u201dHis message was clear: If you aren\u2019t already worried about how your personal data is being used, now would be a good time to start. \u201cThe way I like to think of it, data is the electricity of our new economy, and electricity can be quite dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe enjoy the benefits of electricity, despite the fact that it can literally kill you.\u201dMr. Wylie\u2019s testimony bluntly contradicted that of his former boss, Alexander Nix, who has recently appeared before the same committee twice. Mr. Wylie said a cluster of pro-Brexit organizations employed a Canadian subsidiary company, Aggregate IQ, which provided them with SCL\u2019s store of data.\u201cI think it is completely reasonable to say that there could have been a different outcome of the referendum had there not been, in my view, cheating,\u201d he said.He also suggested that Russian intelligence agencies could have easily scooped up the company\u2019s vast library of data on American voters in advance of the 2016 elections in the United States, because Aleksandr Kogan, the scientist who collected it, made regular return trips to Russia.\u201cPut a key logger in Kogan\u2019s computer in Russia and you\u2019ve got everything,\u201d Mr. Wylie said. He added: \u201cIt would make it incredibly easy for them to get access to this data. For me, that\u2019s concerning and I think it should be looked into.\u201dMr. Wylie\u2019s appearance has coincided with a surge of collective dismay over data-mining, and many found themselves riveted by his testimony on Tuesday. Georgia Rakusen, 33, a user researcher at a technology firm in London, urged her Twitter followers to tune into the hearing, which she called \u201cabsolutely gripping stuff.\u201dHis testimony, she said, \u201cwas something that, as a lay person, you could watch and start to grasp the enormity of how your data is used.\u201d\u201cI think maybe people are just beginning to open up, to realize that maybe it\u2019s not just about ads, maybe it\u2019s not just what bands I like,\u201d she said. Ms. Rakusen, who described her own work as \u201ca space where we are supposed to make people click more,\u201d said she hoped that employees of large technology companies would come forward more, looking at whistle-blowers like Mr. Wylie and Edward J. Snowden.\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the whole three and a half hours,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I basically didn\u2019t get any other work done during that time.\u201d\u201cIt was no longer this niche, shady firm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a firm that was making a massive impact on the world. It\u2019s a process of coming to terms with what you have created, and the impact that has had.\u201d\u201cI am incredibly remorseful for my role in setting it up,\u201d he added, his voice wavering. \u201cI\u2019m the first person to say that I should have known better. But what\u2019s done is done.\u201dHe was caustic on the subject of his former boss, Mr. Nix, who he said enjoyed the colonial challenge of manipulating the affairs of less developed countries. He recalled that once, they were late to a meeting because Mr. Nix had to collect a chandelier he had bought for $283,000.\u201cYou have to remember that a lot of these people are very wealthy already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thing that I learned is for certain wealthy people, they need something to keep them occupied. They need projects. And for certain wealthy people, going into the developing world and running a country is something that appeals to them.\u201dAt times, he seemed slightly pitying of British officials who are investigating data-mining, saying they did not have enough resources and lacked a \u201crobust technical background.\u201d\u201cI have had to explain and re-explain and re-explain and re-explain, you know, how relational databases work, what is an eigenvector, what is dimensionality reduction,\u201d he said.\u201cThey have been working really, really hard. But as a point of observation, one of the weak points that I\u2019ve seen \u2014 again, this is an empathetic criticism \u2014 is the lack of technical people,\u201d he said, apparently searching for a polite way to say it. \u201cThey have had to ask me a lot of questions that a database engineer would not ask.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a really tough one right now.\u201d Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump\u2019s victory felt \u201clike a ton of bricks dropped on my chest.\u201d Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them.Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Mr. Trump \u201chas been great for business and really, really good for tech,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Mr. Shapiro said that he had voted for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent, in 2016, but that he and many tech executives had come around on Mr. Trump. While they disagree with him on immigration and the environment, they have found areas where their interests align, like deregulation and investment in internet infrastructure.Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side.In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump\u2019s invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president.Dean Garfield, head of the Information Technology Industry Council, a 102-year-old advocacy group that represents the biggest tech firms, said his members walked a tightrope, supporting and opposing the president on different issues. Lately, he said, \u201cwe have reached balance in the tightrope.\u201dThe equilibrium marks a turnabout from what had been a testy relationship between Mr. Trump and the tech sector. On the campaign trail in 2016, Mr. Trump was so critical of tech companies that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, once joked he might send Mr. Trump to space in a rocket.Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses.The president was quick to tweet the news.Messages to the account were not returned. Google declined to comment.Two days later, Facebook\u2019s policy chief, Joel Kaplan, distanced the company from Mr. Goldman\u2019s comments.\u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research from Washington.Advertisement"}

It is the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman.With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year.After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.Here\u2019s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201dMr. Mnuchin said:\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201dMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.Shares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.The overall problem: Reports about how the data firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from 50 million Facebook users are highlighting just how much governments itch to regulate the tech giant.Through his holding of special voting shares, Mr. Zuckerberg has an especially powerful position at Facebook that might shield him from the normal forces of accountability. C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.Critics\u2019 cornerShares of Oracle are down 9.3 percent this morningPerhaps more concerning for investors was the slowdown in Oracle\u2019s cloud-computing business last quarter.\u2022 Fiscal fourth-quarter guidance: up 19 percent to 23 percent.\u2022 Fiscal third quarter: up 32 percent from a year ago.\u2022 Fiscal Second quarter: up 44 percent.\u2022 Fiscal first quarter: up 51 percent\u2022 Fiscal fourth quarter: up 58 percentThe tech flyaround\u201cWe must ensure that protectionism doesn\u2019t become the dominant force in the world but that we continue to promote open markets.

I take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections, and that they\u2019ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data. I take a certain mordant pleasure in watching Mark Zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late-Obama-era liberalism.But the liberal establishment\u2019s fixation on Facebook\u2019s 2016 sins \u2014 first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the Trump campaign or its appendages \u2014 still feels like a classic example of blaming something new because it\u2019s new when it\u2019s the old thing that mattered more. Or of blaming something new because you thought that \u201cnew\u201d meant \u201cgood,\u201d that the use of social-media data by campaigns would always help tech-savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals \u2014 and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the Trump era a reality.No doubt all the activity on Facebook and the apparent use of Facebook\u2019s data had some impact, somewhere, on Trump\u2019s surprise victory. But the media format that really made him president, the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited, wasn\u2019t Zuckerberg\u2019s unreal kingdom; it wasn\u2019t even the Twitter platform where Trump struts and frets and rages daily. It was that old pre-internet standby, broadcast and cable television, and especially TV news.Start with the fake news that laid the foundation for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your Facebook feed, but the sort broadcast in prime time by NBC, under the label of reality TV. Yes, as media sophisticates we\u2019re all supposed to know that \u201creality\u201d means \u201cfake,\u201d but in the beginning nobody marketed \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d that way; across most of its run you saw a much-bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed, week after week and season after season, as a titan of industry, the for-serious greatest businessman in the world.That was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump\u2019s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.Except that she didn\u2019t beat him, in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news, in particular, is designed to feed. In 2016 this polarization didn\u2019t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro-Trump as he dispatched his G.O.P. rivals; it also meant that a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn\u2019t pro-Trump enough.The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office. But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage, because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting-match model. This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right-versus-left election, in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans \u2026 and in the end that\u2019s what most G.O.P. voters did.My own CNN experiences were positive; I admire the many fine journalists who work in television news. But it was clear enough being in that orbit in 2016, as it should be clear to anyone who watched Trump\u2019s larger relationship to his television coverage, that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization, and that it was ripe for exploitation by a demagogue who was also a celebrity.Which is not to say that the current freakout over Facebook doesn\u2019t make a certain kind of sense. Beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often-genuinely-sinister side of Silicon Valley into stolen-election theories, there\u2019s a strategic wisdom to the center-left establishment\u2019s focus on the internet.But like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than Facebook to make Donald Trump president, it won\u2019t have served the truth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a MetroCard and Needles, a Vet Makes House Calls", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharacter Study\u201cI knock lightly because dogs can get upset if you knock loud, or with a cat, it might run under the bed,\u201d said Dr. Levy, a veterinarian who specializes in acupuncture, exclusively by house call.This house call was for Harpo, a 10-year-old toy fox terrier with a liver tumor that was diagnosed a year ago as terminal and untreatable.\u201cThey told me to just keep him happy for his last couple of months,\u201d said Harpo\u2019s owner, Jess Caragliano, 36, who heard that Dr. Levy, 61, could help provide palliative care during Harpo\u2019s last few weeks.Dr. Levy\u2019s rounds are mostly in Manhattan but he will take on patients as far as the city\u2019s subway system extends. He sometimes sees a dozen patients a day, which means plenty of miles on his unlimited use MetroCard.\u201cI swipe that card clean\u201d, said Dr. Levy, who often spends as much time on trains and buses as he does with his patients, and does much of his paperwork in transit.Dr. Levy, a certified veterinary acupuncturist, assists with rehabilitation and pain management for pets whose owners want to avoid medication or surgery. He also gets referrals from other vets who have been unable to help a pet with traditional medicine.Nervous or aggressive pets are often more cooperative in familiar surroundings, said Dr. Levy, who treats many older or debilitated cats and dogs that are too fragile, physical or emotionally, to travel.Acupuncture can make pets with cancer more comfortable by stimulating points in the body that help with pain relief, or increase energy, the immune system and appetite, said Dr. Levy, who sat beside Harpo on a rug and inserted a red tipped needle into the top of the terrier\u2019s head.This is a calming point, explained Dr. Levy, where the yin energy pathways converge. He then inserted a needle between the dog\u2019s shoulder blades, a yang energy point that was \u201csort of like turning up the thermostat.\u201dAnother needle just beyond the last rib would affect the kidney, which \u201chouses the fire of life \u2014 it\u2019s like a pilot light,\u201d and can help with arthritis and mobility issues, he said.Typically, pets fall asleep soon after the needles are inserted. Harpo, a high-energy dog usually excited by visitors, did just that, despite the ambulance sirens and car horns outside.He gave a reflexive yap at some footsteps in the hallway, then put his head down and napped soundly.Dr. Levy grew up in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, and became interested in veterinary medicine as a child after seeing his pet dachshund, Mushroom, suffer from chronic back problems.Dr. Levy travels with a thick bag, or sometimes several, stuffed with medical records, equipment and acupuncture needles. He typically charges $195 for an initial visit and $150 for each follow-up.After visiting Harpo, Dr. Levy took a bus and three trains to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit Nana, a 14- year-old shepherd mix that collapsed in July and became immobile.Nana\u2019s owner, Vanessa Soderstrom, 40, said that a veterinarian told her, \u201cWhen the big dogs go down, they don\u2019t get back up, and that I\u2019d have to put him down.\u201dBut after a few acupuncture treatments by Dr. Levy, Nana began walking again, she said.Dr. Levy made preparations to put needles along the dog\u2019s back.Dr. Levy is no stranger to celebrity, having treated Mick Jagger\u2019s cat as well as dogs for the likes of Lou Reed, Joan Rivers and Marvin Hamlisch, he said.\u201cSome people like to rub shoulders with celebrities \u2014 I like to rub muzzles with their dogs,\u201d said Dr. Levy, who also founded a pet-themed rock band called Pet-Rox, which has performed benefit concerts for animal welfare groups.The band\u2019s members come from the animal-welfare community. Some who have cycled through over the years include a pet psychic, a sea-lion trainer, dog walkers and a pet lawyer.At one point, the band had a pet tarot card reader on percussion. Dr. Levy sings and plays guitar.He said the band began as a semi-serious venture playing cover songs like \u201cOctopus\u2019s Garden\u201d and \u201cRockin\u2019 Robin,\u201d but after encouragement from Bernadette Peters and Mary Tyler Moore at a pet charity event, the group turned to originals written by Dr. Levy, often on the subway between house calls.\u201cOne time, we played an event at the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pretty cool \u2014 the sea lions were howling behind us.\u201dThe ParticularsName Dr. Jeff LevyAge 61Who He Is Veterinary acupuncturistWhere He\u2019s From Mill Basin, BrooklynTelling Detail He met his wife through a kitten rescue operation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Researchers Learned to Use Facebook \u2018Likes\u2019 to Sway Your Thinking", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerhaps at some point in the past few years you\u2019ve told Facebook that you like, say, Kim Kardashian West. When you hit the thumbs-up button on her page, you probably did it because you wanted to see the reality TV star\u2019s posts in your news feed. Maybe you realized that marketers could target advertisements to you based on your interest in her.What you probably missed is that researchers had figured out how to tie your interest in Ms. Kardashian West to certain personality traits, such as how extroverted you are (very), how conscientious (more than most) and how open-minded (only somewhat). And when your fondness for Ms. Kardashian West is combined with other interests you\u2019ve indicated on Facebook, researchers believe their algorithms can predict the nuances of your political views with better accuracy than your loved ones.Cambridge Analytica now says it has destroyed the user data it collected on Facebook. Raw data reviewed by The Times suggests the information, or copies of it, may still exist. In either case, specific user information was merely a means to an end, a building block in a far more ambitious construction: a behavioral model powerful enough to manipulate people\u2019s activity and, potentially, sway elections.Many respondents who took the quiz through the myPersonality app authorized it to gain access to their Facebook profile data, and information about their friend network \u2014 access that was allowed by the social network at the time. That allowed researchers to cross-reference the results of the quiz \u2014 numeric Ocean scores \u2014 with the users\u2019 Facebook \u201clikes,\u201d and build a model from the correlations they found between the two. With that model, the researchers could often make precise guesses about subsequent users\u2019 personalities using only a list of their likes, no 100-question quiz necessary.In that study, the researchers compared the accuracy of their model with personality assessments made by the respondents\u2019 friends. The friends were given a 10-question version of the myPersonality quiz and asked to answer based on their knowledge of the respondents\u2019 personalities.Based on a sample of more than 32,000 participants who were assessed by both the model and one or two friends, the researchers found that the model, using just 10 likes, was more accurate than a work colleague. With 70 likes, it was more accurate than a friend or roommate; with 150, more accurate than a family member; and with 300, more accurate than a spouse.When Cambridge Analytica approached the Psychometrics Center about using its models, the center declined. Cambridge Analytica then turned to Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at Cambridge University who was familiar with the center\u2019s work. Dr. Kogan developed a Facebook app called \u201cthisisyourdigitallife,\u201d a quiz similar to myPersonality, and used it to harvest data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles. Of those, 30 million contained enough information to generate personality profiles. Only 270,000 users authorized Dr. Kogan\u2019s app to have access to their data, and all were told that their information was being used for academic research.Cambridge then pitched its services to potential political and commercial clients, ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Facebook has now banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform, as well as its parent company and Dr. Kogan. In Facebook\u2019s eyes, Dr. Kogan\u2019s infraction was not collecting the data, but giving it to Cambridge Analytica.By handing over that information to a private company, Facebook said, Dr. Kogan violated its terms of service.Facebook in 2015 changed its policies, including altering rules about how third-party apps can gain access to information about users\u2019 friends. But user data collected through such apps over the years probably remains in the wild, not to mention the models that can continue to be used to target people around the world.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Michal Kosinski, a researcher who helped develop the model that created personality profiles from Facebook \u201clikes.\u201d He is a professor of organizational behavior, not a professor of computer science.Advertisement"}

Tyler Buchanan, the editor of The Athens Messenger, Mr. Hagerman\u2019s local newspaper, said he was rattled by Mr. Hagerman\u2019s decision to remain uninformed.Again, I'm not angry if Hagerman does not want to read The Messenger, or any other news outlet. However: while he enjoys a fun \"experiment\" of ignoring the world around him, his fellow residents of Glouster, Athens County, Ohio & beyond are living in the real world. 10/I am an African-American openly gay man. Such a sealed off life is not even an option for me or those like me. I suppose on some level I may harbor some deep-seated envy of this choice to retreat. Only a man of privilege \u2014 and a white man \u2014 can remove himself in this way.Those of us for whom existence means fending off onslaughts to our fundamental humanity can afford to not know and prepare for the latest threats. Our lives \u2014 almost always under siege in some way \u2014 also move us to protect and bond with those similarly situated, and we are obligated to protect them as they in turn inform themselves and take action to protect us. It would also be an abdication of responsibility to be a good citizen \u2014 to be informed and to work to make life better for others.Whatever judgment I would pass on Mr. Hagerman is the same judgment I would pass on people who retreat from the world into their own political bubbles. That goes for those on the left and the right. I appreciate his approach more than any of them.Mr. Hagerman can hide from Trumpism only because he is wealthy and white. Lack of engagement might make him feel healthier, but it doesn\u2019t absolve him of responsibility in democracy. I can\u2019t think of one historical example that ended well when citizens of privilege chose to ignore politics.Not many people can disconnect from their phones for even just ten minutes. We have become sheep, being led around by marketers and pundits. This man is totally unique and an inspiration to many who would like to be able to do what he is doing: being his own person.Honestly, there are times that I wish I could do the same. But I can\u2019t. Being a grandfather, I am sick worried that my children and my grandson will be badly hurt from the decisions that are made in the White House. I am old enough and realistic enough to know that my views, expressed here and elsewhere, most probably won\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind about anything. But, I see that as a way to feel that I am not alone, but connected to the rest of humanity.If this guy is successful with his plan and ultimately donates the restored land to his local community as his own \u201cWalden Pond\u201d project, I daresay his contribution will be much more meaningful and long-lasting than if he spent his days stressed out and yelling at a TV screen. Good for him.That said, if we all did that, this country would be in more serious trouble than it already is. But it\u2019s nice to know that there are people out there doing other things besides being held hostage by the current horrors of the daily news cycle. A reminder that life goes on, I guess, sometimes in spite of us.I\u2019m a native of Athens County, where Mr. Hagerman resides. On Nov. 8, 2016, I knocked on doors in the Glouster area. I might\u2019ve even knocked on his, who knows. Many of his neighbors voted for Donald Trump, while others didn\u2019t bother voting at all. Some of them didn\u2019t have rides to the church that served as their polling location (though we did offer to drive them).I don\u2019t fault them for not participating in a system that did not appear to acknowledge their existence. But I think about Mr. Hagerman, and the resources available to him. And how he chooses to squander them on personal comfort. In the same situation, I don\u2019t think his neighbors would do the same.Mr. Hagerman is not alone. My wife has blockaded all political news since Election Day as well. However, she does have a vague sense of nonpolitical news.She does follow Facebook but has several kinds of blocks on her computer to keep the content politics free. It isn\u2019t that hard to do. She just changes the subject t if politics come up.Part of her reasoning is that as a senior she may not live long enough to see things turn around. She can\u2019t fix anything so there seems to be no point in being stressed all the time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Come-Ons, Takedowns and Insults: What It\u2019s Like to Write Comedy as a Woman", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.On the first day that Nell Scovell arrived at her office as a writer on \u201cLate Night With David Letterman,\u201d a new colleague stopped to greet her. They chatted amiably about mutual friends. And then he laid it out: \u201cBefore this is over,\u201d he told her, \u201cI will see a tampon fall out of your purse.\u201d\u201cI felt strangely shaken as he walked away,\u201d Scovell writes in \u201cJust the Funny Parts: \u2026 And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys\u2019 Club.\u201d The remark puzzled her for decades. Then, doing research for another book, she learned to identify it not merely as adolescent posturing from a man-child but as what she terms \u201cstereotype threat.\u201dNo moment is too sacred to puncture: Scovell was invited to meet with Joss Whedon, the creator of \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d \u2014 then her favorite show on TV \u2014 about a staff position. She was 38 weeks pregnant at the interview. \u201cBoy, are you fat,\u201d Whedon said. (His producer followed up with, \u201cShould I put down a tarp?\u201d) She didn\u2019t get the job.If the sprinkling of sociological terms like \u201cstereotype threat\u201d sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Scovell collaborated with Sheryl Sandberg on her study-laden blockbuster, \u201cLean In.\u201d Sandberg, the Facebook executive, provides the TED Talk-ready foreword to \u201cJust the Funny Parts,\u201d writing that \u201cwhoever said feminists weren\u2019t funny never met Nell.\u201d (At her own mother\u2019s funeral, Scovell, one of five siblings, held up an envelope and announced that it contained \u201cthe name of mom\u2019s favorite child.\u201d) A career in the entertainment industry \u2014 scaled like a jungle gym, not a ladder \u2014 meant Scovell lived \u201cLean In\u201d long before she wrote it, Sandberg says. \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is a record of her scramble, retrofitted with post-\u201cLean In\u201d indignation. (She took Shandling\u2019s words as a compliment at first.)The bar for contemporary women-in-comedy books was set in 2011 with Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cBossypants,\u201d which managed advice that was both hilarious and accurate \u2014 no pigtails or tube tops at the office, no diet foods in meetings and cry at work if you must because \u201cit terrifies everyone.\u201d Scovell\u2019s lessons are less jokey and more emotionally bare; she even confesses a few things that our feminist foremothers have taught us to keep buttoned up \u2014 like the lines that she crossed, too \u2014 which feels freeing. Over all, though, \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d functions best not when Scovell is recounting some backstage encounter on \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d or \u201cNewhart\u201d but when she\u2019s rankled. My first laugh came on Page 58, when Scovell, her contributions on a show once again ignored, asks a female co-worker: \u201cAm I corporeal? You can see and hear me, right?\u201dGender aside, her comedy bona fides are solid: Scovell is from a large, neurotic, bookish, mercilessly honest \u2014 though loving \u2014 Jewish family in Massachusetts. She went to Harvard and wrote for Spy magazine. With a few biographical tweaks, she could be Conan O\u2019Brien. (The two intersected as writers on a short-lived \u201980s talk show.) In typical overachiever fashion, even her failures \u2014 Scovell writes that she was too full of self-doubt to apply for The Harvard Lampoon \u2014 led her somewhere: She became a sportswriter for The Boston Globe, then moved to New York and got a staff job at Vanity Fair. But Scovell soon realized that her high-concept style was better suited for TV. \u201cWriting for TV made way more sense than writing for magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd by sense, I mean money.\u201dFor aspiring writers, the book has just enough practical advice on story pitches and script editing to qualify as a how-to. \u201cWhen I write, I feel like an optometrist, constantly flipping between lenses and asking: \u2018Is this better? Is this?\u2019 Slowly, the work comes into focus,\u201d she explains. An appendix lists all of her jobs, from Lifetime movies to \u201cNCIS,\u201d and, more bracingly for those starting out, the dozens of scripts unproduced over her 30-year career. Along the way, she married an architect and had two sons, and she is brisk about the fact that her husband\u2019s staying at home with the boys \u2014 carting them around to sets as she wrote, produced and directed \u2014 is what made her employable.In her 40s and beyond, female executives kept her afloat, she says. Scovell built up a deep network of friends and allies, though strikingly, even in the photos of her gang, she is usually the only woman. The book is laid out like the old joke about the arc of a Hollywood career: Part 1: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201d Part 2: \u201cGet me Nell Scovell!\u201d Part 3: \u201cGet me a younger, cheaper Nell Scovell!\u201d And finally: \u201cWho is Nell Scovell?\u201dJust as she is getting to that last stage, however, she meets Sandberg, whose spirit infuses this book: in the references to studies about how men are perceived as confident while women are taught to deflect credit, or in the anecdotes about how Scovell is judged on her presumed emotions rather than her actual abilities. When the two women worked together on \u201cLean In,\u201d Scovell was overjoyed to find an outlet for her frustration \u2014 finally, here was data to back up her sense of inequity! \u2014 and for the reader, that emotional shift comes not a moment too soon, as one thing that\u2019s sacrificed in her litany of miscreants is a larger sense of why she loves or even wants a career in entertainment anymore. \u201cRunning a show is like being beaten to death with your own dream,\u201d a producer she worked with on the series she created, \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch,\u201d says.There are career high points, too; I would have gladly read another chapter on the feminist platform presented by \u201cMurphy Brown.\u201d But through connections made at Facebook, \u201cLean In\u201d brings an even more rarefied opportunity: writing jokes for President Obama. Finally, the payoff! Scovell is understandably giddy at crafting one-liners for the White House Correspondents Dinner, to be delivered by the leader of the free world \u2014 a man who just happens to know how to land a punch line.There\u2019s no time to wallow, now, in that era\u2019s ending; there\u2019s too much to fix. Though no doubt Scovell would have had it otherwise, the fact that \u201cJust the Funny Parts\u201d is landing at such a charged moment \u2014 when women are exquisitely, bruisingly fed up \u2014 may be a stroke of luck. In her introduction, Scovell does joke about calling the book \u201cJust the Angry and Bitter Parts,\u201d but says she hoped not to outright discourage young writers. Besides, she adds, \u201cthat would be an eight-volume set.\u201dMelena Ryzik is a culture reporter at The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Saw a Genocide in Slow Motion", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAKHINE STATE, Myanmar \u2014 Sono Wara spent the day crying. And even after her tear ducts emptied, her shirt was still wet from leaking milk.Her newborn twins had died the previous day, and she squatted in her grass-roof hut, shattered by pain and grief. She is 18 and this was her first pregnancy, but as a member of the Rohingya ethnic minority she could not get a doctor\u2019s help. So after a difficult delivery, her twins lie buried in the ground.Sometimes Myanmar uses guns and machetes for ethnic cleansing, and that\u2019s how Sono Wara earlier lost her mother and sister. But it also kills more subtly and secretly by regularly denying medical care and blocking humanitarian aid to Rohingya, and that\u2019s why her twins are gone.Entering Myanmar on a tourist visa, I was able to slip undetected into five Rohingya villages. What I found was a slow-motion genocide. The massacres and machete attacks of last August are over for now, but Rohingya remain confined to their villages \u2014 and to a huge concentration camp \u2014 and are systematically denied most education and medical care.This is my fourth trip in four years to cover the Rohingya, a Muslim minority despised in a mostly Buddhist country, and initially I used the term \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d But along with many human rights monitors, I\u2019ve come to conclude that what is unfolding here probably qualifies as genocide.Sono Wara was unable to receive any prenatal or emergency care. In a crisis, a Rohingya can request police permission to go to a government clinic down the road that serves the general population, but it lacks a doctor, and Rohingya are often fearful of being attacked. They also must pay for a police escort at the clinic, adding to the cost.\u201cI was afraid to go,\u201d Sono Wara said in a catatonic voice. \u201cThe clinic doesn\u2019t care about Rohingya.\u201dOn top of her physical and emotional pain is a constant fear. Her village wasn\u2019t attacked in the August wave of violence, but, Sona Wara said, \u201cThat could happen here.\u201d In 2012, people from a nearby village attacked with machetes and killed her mother and sister.One theory is that Myanmar is trying to create such misery and fear that the Rohingya will flee on their own, so that the army doesn\u2019t need to bother with the messy business of massacres. Sono Wara said that she and her husband have discussed trying to escape to Malaysia \u2014 a perilous journey that often involves rape, robbery and death.What\u2019s happening to those left behind in the villages is a more banal kind of brutality. In one remote hamlet reachable only by boat or footpath, I saw a stunted 4-year-old, Umar Amin, being bathed by his big sister.I pulled out a MUAC strip, used to assess child malnutrition by measuring the upper arm, and Umar Amin was in the red danger zone, signifying severe acute malnutrition. He can\u2019t walk or talk and desperately needs help, but he has never been able to see a doctor.International aid groups are ready and eager to help children like Umar Amin, but the government often blocks them, especially in northern areas near the Bangladesh border. It is difficult to understand this denial of humanitarian access as anything but an intentional policy of grinding down and driving out the Rohingya \u2014 one reason I see this as a slow-motion genocide.What of \u201cThe Lady,\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi, who won her Nobel for her resolute struggle for the human rights of Myanmar? She is now the effective leader of Myanmar\u2019s government and has emerged as not only an apologist for this genocide, but also as complicit in it.I was able to get a tourist visa because I was leading a segment of a tour sponsored by The New York Times Company to Myanmar. The visa came with a stern warning that I must not do any reporting. In general, I believe that journalists should obey the laws of countries they visit, but I make an exception when a regime uses its laws to commit and hide crimes against humanity.In one case on this trip, I arrived after dark so I would be less likely to be spotted. In others, villagers advised me on what paths to take to avoid the police. To get to two villages, I took a boat around a police checkpoint.In one of the villages reached by boat, I met Zainul Abedin as he mourned his wife, Jahan Aara, 20, who had died in childbirth, along with their baby. It was her first pregnancy, and she got no medical help.\u201cMaybe she would have died even in a hospital, but at least she would have had a chance,\u201d Zainul Abedin said. \u201cThis way she didn\u2019t even have a chance.\u201dHe is thinking of trying to escape, which would entail paying human traffickers $2,300 to smuggle him to Malaysia. The authorities hound aid workers and journalists, but they seem to look the other way from these human traffickers.Many of those who set out die en route. Zainul Abedin knows the risks because his own father fled in hopes of reaching Malaysia and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\u201cWe are like a bird in a cage,\u201d Zainul Abedin told me. \u201cThey give us less and less, we get smaller and smaller, and then we die. Or we can try to flee, and then they can kill us.\u201dThe Rohingya have been confined to their villages and the concentration camp for almost six years now, with restrictions tightened further after the August massacres. Elders complained to me in particular about the loss of education, as Rohingya aren\u2019t allowed to attend regular schools. Villages try to run informal schools of their own, but without textbooks, desks and proper teachers, not much learning happens, and even the most brilliant children have no hope of ever attending high school or a university. The result is a lost generation.Many Myanmar readers will find my reporting unfair, for their narrative is very different. Htun Aung Kyaw, a leader of the Arakan National Party, the main political party here in Rakhine State, told me the key points as he sees them: The Rohingya are illegal immigrants, they have been trying for decades to create a separate Islamic state, they include armed insurgents who commit atrocities, and they burn their own villages so as to discredit the Myanmar government.Ordinary citizens often seem to have been manipulated by anti-Rohingya propaganda, particularly on Facebook. One moderate Rakhine village leader, U Maung Kyaw Nyunt, told me that the hatred toward the Rohingya has escalated because of the arrival of smartphones and Facebook, resulting in virulent anti-Rohingya propaganda depicting them as murderous terrorists who commit atrocities against Buddhists.\u201cYoung people are using their smartphones a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see with their eyes; they just see with their phones.\u201d\u201cI have arguments with my son about this,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cFacebook has been bad for Myanmar.\u201dThe military has internet units trained by Russia, and one theory is that the army may be behind part of the social media campaign against the Rohingya.The West doesn\u2019t have much leverage over Myanmar, and China protects it on the United Nations Security Council. David Mathieson, a longtime human rights analyst in Myanmar, said that outside protests about the Rohingya have been largely ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive, as when exaggerations play into the Myanmar narrative of victimhood.Still, we can work with other countries to raise the cost of ethnic cleansing, and under international law we have an obligation to take steps to address genocide (although the law does not stipulate that these actions must be particularly significant). A crucial first step is targeted sanctions against Myanmar leaders, as bipartisan legislation in both the House and the Senate proposes. The bill passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but needs approval from the Senate Republican leadership to go forward.By that standard, the grass-roof hut where Sona Wara weeps over her lost twins cries out to us as a center of the universe.Advertisement"}

The five boroughs and Westchester are on track to get anywhere between 7 and 11 inches of snow, and some areas of New Jersey may see as much as 20 inches.In New Jersey, heavy snow has toppled trees and taken down power lines, disrupting travel along multiple New Jersey Transit rail lines.And it has taken a toll on the region\u2019s electrical grid, which was already struggling after Friday\u2019s storm knocked out power to more than 2 million people. Currently, power outages are affecting more than 17,000 customers in the city and Westchester, more than 184,000 in New Jersey, 21,500 on Long Island, and at least 7,700 people upstate.Here\u2019s how your trip home is looking:As predicted, New Yorkers were treated to the somewhat rare phenomenon, characterized by lighting and thunder during a snowstorm.It appears, we\u2019re told, when cold air settles above warmer, moist air on the ground.This imbalance can create a strong vertical draft of air, which can cause lightning followed by a clap of thunder, said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It also produces more snow.\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason you get stronger rain in a thunderstorm,\u201d Mr. Maloit said. The vertical drafts move precipitation into the clouds more efficiently and \u201ceventually the cloud won\u2019t be able to support the precipitation and it will come down.\u201dHere's what it sounds like.We\u2019ll keep you updated on the storm throughout the evening commute.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We love a good snow day.As the need to go out into the world melts away, so do its distractions.Cooking can be the evening\u2019s entertainment.Binge-watching feels not only guilt-free, but necessary.And we finally get to make time for our favorite snowstorm activity: doing nothing at all.But we\u2019d like to know about your snowy weather rituals.

{"Headline": "They Push. They Protest. And Many Activists, Privately, Suffer as a Result.", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShe lay curled in bed for days, paralyzed by the stresses of a life that she felt had chosen her as much as she had chosen it.About three years earlier, the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., had spurred Ashley Yates into activism. She would evolve from street protester in her hometown of St. Louis to Black Lives Matter organizer in Oakland.But Ms. Yates would also feel the pressures of a job that seemed unrelenting: responding repeatedly to the deaths of black residents in communities across America, struggling to win policy reforms that would benefit black people and rallying others to support her causes.And then, as last year wound down and Ms. Yates felt so depressed that she could not get out of bed, she was reminded of the most dire consequence of an activist life \u2014 untimely death.And as Ms. Yates, 32, remembered Ms. Garner\u2019s radicalism and youth, her problems with money and stress, she saw herself. If someone as widely recognized as Ms. Garner could meet such an early demise, then who in the movement was safe, Ms. Yates wondered.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely scary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to make you want to quit.\u201dNext month, the world will commemorate the 50th anniversary of one of the most prominent premature deaths in the history of the black liberation struggle, that of Martin Luther King Jr. And whereas he died from an assassin\u2019s bullet at the age of 39, dying young continues to rock social justice activists today.The deaths have their own unique causes. But with each fallen comrade, activists are left to ponder their own mortality and whether the many pressures of the movement contributed to the shortened lives of their colleagues.Along with the long hours, constant confrontation and frequent heartbreak they experience, activists work for little or no pay and sometimes struggle for basic needs like food and shelter even as they push for societal change.An essential part of activism these days, those on the front lines say, is ensuring that they and their comrades work through all the stress, whether it\u2019s with meditation, therapy or just taking breaks from the struggle.\u201cIt\u2019s much more front and center than it ever was when I was coming up as a young organizer 20 years ago,\u201d Cat Brooks, an Oakland-based activist, said of self care.In many ways, Ms. Garner\u2019s story represents the perils activism can inflict on a life.She grew up poor in New York. Her father died a very public death in 2014, one she would witness through bystanders\u2019 videos of a police officer on Staten Island confronting her father on the street, putting him in a chokehold and tackling him to the ground. Mr. Garner lost consciousness and died after crying out in distress, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201dIn late 2014, she connected with Reggie Harris, a political operative and activist, who helped her as she entered the world of activism. Ms. Garner read titles like \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d \u201cSlavery By Another Name\u201d and \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X.\u201d She developed an understanding of structural racism and how race was a factor in her father\u2019s death, Mr. Harris said.\u201cFor me, that was a turning point,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cShe was picking out a very reasonable, attainable set of goals, instead of just saying, \u2018No justice, no peace.\u2019 \u201dMs. Garner would meet later with lawmakers and law enforcement officials, travel the country to speak to activist groups and became a surrogate for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic nomination.Her approach of rattling those in power left her isolated in some ways.Whereas some activists have been able to parlay their work into a level of celebrity \u2014 speaking tours, book deals, cozy relationships with politicians and Hollywood A-listers \u2014 Ms. Garner did not enjoy those luxuries.Ifeoma Ike, a lawyer and strategic consultant who mentored Ms. Garner, said it bothered her that Ms. Garner did not get invited to major conferences and other events, even as her father\u2019s story was among those used to rally support.\u201cShe just wasn\u2019t valued enough while she was here,\u201d Ms. Ike said. \u201cThat being said, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that I feel extreme pride about her contributions.\u201dBeyond the stresses of activism, life weighed on Ms. Garner.She grew frustrated that a state grand jury declined to indict the officers involved in her father\u2019s death and that the Justice Department insisted on patience as it conducted its investigation, which remains open. She had trouble getting funding for the Garner Way Foundation she was starting.Her relationship with her family was strained \u2014 sometimes over activism, other times over personal clashes.\u201cNo matter what I said or what I did, she was going to do what she wanted to do,\u201d said her mother, Esaw Snipes. \u201cShe lived her life by her own terms.\u201dAnd then there were the stresses of living in poverty. Her housing situation was constantly in flux and she struggled to cobble together money to support her two children, Mr. Harris said. She occasionally received financial support from Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network and sometimes took in speaking fees, but people often balked at paying her for appearances, Mr. Harris said. She could not hold down a full-time job amid all her activism, but had started writing an autobiography that she hoped would help raise money.\u201cA lot of times fame comes well before the checks come,\u201d said Selena Hunn, a lawyer and friend of Ms. Garner.Ms. Garner often smoked cigarettes to channel her stress, Mr. Harris said, but friends saw small signs that she became more mindful of her health in her final months.A couple of weeks later, Ms. Garner went on a vacation to the Poconos with her daughter and foster mother. On Dec. 20, she posted on Facebook a picture of herself in a bubble bath with the caption, \u201cJust what I needed.\u201dThree days later, Ms. Garner suffered a heart attack and was in a coma.The news would quickly ripple through activist circles.\u201cLet\u2019s lift up Erica Garner,\u201d Kristian Blackmon, a St. Louis-based activist, posted to her Facebook page on December 25.Five days later, Ms. Garner died.In a group text message chat, Ms. Blackmon and other black female activists lamented that Ms. Garner could have been any of them, and how resistant the system was to change.\u201cIt kills us in every way possible,\u201d said Brittini Gray, an organizer who goes by Ree Belle, recalling what they discussed in the group chat.In Oakland, Ms. Yates forced herself out of bed to mourn the loss of Ms. Garner with friends and fellow activists.They decided that they needed to fight on, because that\u2019s how Ms. Garner would have wanted it.\u201cI went back to life, I guess,\u201d Ms. Yates said. \u201cBut with a lot more anger.\u201dFollow John Eligon on Twitter @jeligonAdvertisement"}

Because he is a taskmaster and a visionary and a billionaire, people in Hollywood and Silicon Valley pay close attention when he speaks.\u201cThere is so much fleece,\u201d says the chairman of IAC, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve been going for 30 years.\u201dOn this rainy afternoon, by the fireplace in the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired stone and wood living room of his dreamy mansion, Mr. Diller is all charm, with a healthy dose of self-deprecation. He\u2019s dressed in a red checked flannel shirt, a burgundy Herm\u00e8s hoodie, baggy jeans and black Tod\u2019s loafers.We are eating cold salads and drinking hot tea, served by the butler, Victor. And we are hopscotching topics, from Silicon Valley taking over Hollywood to Jared & Ivanka & Josh & Karlie to pornography to his company\u2019s dating websites to the time Harvey Weinstein tried to throw Mr. Diller off a balcony in Cannes to how his friend Hillary Clinton is faring to the mogul\u2019s dismissal of Donald Trump (whose Secret Service code name is Mogul) as \u201ca joke\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201dI tell him that a friend of mine, an executive in network television, fretfully asked her Hollywood psychic how long Mr. Trump would last as president and the psychic asserted that it wouldn\u2019t be more than two years and that the president would be felled by a three-page email. (The only problem with this prediction being, I don\u2019t think Mr. Trump emails.)\u201cI would so love it if he were being blackmailed by Putin,\u201d Mr. Diller says with a sly smile. \u201cThat would make me very happy. This was a man of bad character from the moment he entered adulthood, if not before. Pure, bad character. Ugh, Trump.\u201dHe shrugs off what he calls Trump\u2019s \u201cnormal, vicious Twitter attacks\u201d on him. After Mr. Diller mocked Trump\u2019s campaign in 2015, Trump tweeted: \u201cLittle Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!\u201dMr. Diller waves off talk of Mr. Trump opening the door to more celebrity presidents, saying, \u201cI want this to be a moment in time where you go in and pick out this period with pincers and go on with life as we knew it before.\u201dHas the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr. Trump?\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he replies.He has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies, but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter.\u201cI mean, we were friendly,\u201d he says of Ivanka, in the time before Mr. Trump became president. \u201cI would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner. And I, as everyone did, was like, \u2018Oh, my God, how could this evil character have spawned such a polite, gracious person?\u2019 I don\u2019t think we feel that way now.\u201dAt 76, having seen around the corner to tech and pulled together the ragtag group of internet ventures at IAC into a thriving whole, Mr. Diller has \u201cmellowed beautifully,\u201d as one producer here who has known him for many years puts it.His dogs are jumping up on our chairs. He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.For about $100,000, a South Korean firm \u201creincarnated\u201d Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \u201ctest tube,\u201d and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\u201cThese dogs, they\u2019re the soul of Shannon,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane was horrified that I was doing this but she\u2019s switched now to say, \u2018Thank God you did.\u2019\u201dDoesn\u2019t he want to clone himself into a \u201cKiller Diller,\u201d as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he says with a grimace.I ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s joke at David Geffen\u2019s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine\u2019s house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201d\u201cIt is a funny joke,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s close to true.\u201dIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?He says he met Mr. Geffen, whom he considers \u201cfamily,\u201d when the two were teenagers in the William Morris mailroom in Los Angeles.\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and this scrawny person comes into the mailroom and he said, \u2018I\u2019m in the mailroom at William Morris in New York. I had a week off for the holiday so I wanted to come and work here.\u2019 And I thought \u2018Oh, my God, on your vacation?\u2019 Because for me, vacation was Hawaii.\u201dWe talk about how Hollywood has changed, and I ask how the #MeToo era will affect the content of movies.\u201c\u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 has some of the most violent and extreme sexual messiness that you could imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cO.K., it was made a year and a half ago. Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don\u2019t think it affects content.\u201cI mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\u201dOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\u201cI see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201cGod knows, I\u2019m hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I\u2019m not talking about rape and pillage. I\u2019m not talking about Harveyesque. I\u2019m talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that\u2019s what we have. You get accused, you\u2019re obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\u201dMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\u201cIt\u2019s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMatch.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I\u2019m starting to hear that out of Tinder. It\u2019s funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don\u2019t want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\u201dI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\u201cDoes Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\u201d Mr. Baitz asked. \u201cHollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 \u2018Silkwood,\u2019 \u2018Five Easy Pieces,\u2019 \u2018Reds\u2019?\u201dSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d he should know.\u201cWhat an undertaking,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing how it holds?\u201dCalling \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d \u201cbeautiful but silly,\u201d he says he wouldn\u2019t want to run a movie studio now. \u201cIt would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\u201dOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \u201cessentially, no one went to see them.\u201dGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business \u2014 he says there are still streets out here named \u201cDillerdale\u201d and \u201cBarrydale\u201d \u2014 Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.He says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \u201ca completely different universe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 instead of buying old stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blows my mind. It\u2019s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\u201dHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \u201cHe has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he\u2019s really impressive.\u201dI ask how the tech community\u2019s noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\u201cThey\u2019re tech people,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of romance in them. They don\u2019t have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\u201d But they can grow, he says. \u201cWhen I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\u201dHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \u201cOur overlords are not them,\u201d he says. \u201cOur overlords are artificial intelligence.\u201dAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it\u2019s fascinating, he looks skeptical.\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me. I\u2019m a very seducible person.\u201d He also says he\u2019s a \u201cjinxable\u201d person.Ms. von Furstenberg says that when she met Mr. Diller 43 years ago, \u201cWhat I found so incredibly appealing is that behind the very forceful, determined and engaged human being, there was shyness and reservation. He\u2019s not a pig. I mean, in no way.\u201dHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.On another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house \u2014 Mr. Diller likes to drive fast \u2014 they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\u201cBoth of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: \u2018One day, we will be that couple,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\u201dThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\u201cWhen he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\u201d says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \u201cLady Bird\u201d for the screen and \u201cBetrayal,\u201d \u201cThe Humans,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.Given that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and blessedly greenlighted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\u201cI left Fox before Fox News came into being,\u201d he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \u201cplayed a bad hand very well.\u201dI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.Mr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \u201cHarvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, \u2018Harvey, don\u2019t ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone in that manner.\u2019\u201cAnd Harvey, about six feet away, said, \u2018I\u2019m going to throw you off the terrace.\u2019 And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him? And somehow a bear came into my mind.\u201d He says he pulled himself up into a menacing stance, as you\u2019re supposed to do if you have to confront a bear.\u201cAnd it so surprised him that he stopped and I got out with a small amount of honor,\u201d he says.He adds: \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dSpeaking of bad behavior, I ask if he knew Mr. Trump back in the day in Manhattan.He said that when he was in his mid-30s, running Paramount, Mr. Trump invited him to lunch.\u201cAnd you know when people compliment you without foundation?\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cAnd they do it too much? It\u2019s really irritating. It\u2019s kind of offensive. And he spent the entire time saying how great I was. He didn\u2019t know me. And afterward, I walked around the corner and I thought, \u2018I never want to see that man again.\u2019 Decades passed and we would run into each other, but I literally never spoke to him again.\u201dHe says he has gone to a couple of Broadway shows recently with Hillary Clinton and that \u201cshe\u2019s well with herself again and she has a role to play.\u201d\u201cSince the beginning of media and advertising, the holy grail has been the precise targeting of the ads,\u201d he says. \u201cAlong comes the internet with almost perfect aim, and now the entire concept is being called antisocial. That\u2019s a most ironic but momentous thing.\u201dMr. Diller\u2019s friends say he is quiet about his philanthropy. He flinches when I use the term \u201cDiller Island,\u201d saying it should be called \u201cPier 55.\u201dNow he is working on an idea concocted by Alex von Furstenberg, Diane\u2019s son whom Mr. Diller also calls his son, to build a gondola up to the Hollywood sign and a circular catwalk around it, so that people can tour and hike around it.He is very proud of the success of the High Line, the elevated park he helped fund on the West Side of Manhattan. \u201cWho would have dreamed so many people would come?\u201d he marvels.Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York, pulled the Hudson Island project, a $250 million family park and cultural center, out of the ashes, moving past attempts by Douglas Durst to block it. (Hasn\u2019t that family done enough damage?)\u201cThe delay cost us $25 million or something like that,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing. My family\u2019s lucky. So who\u2019s counting? Can I actually say, \u2018Who\u2019s counting?\u2019 That\u2019s awful. But it\u2019s true. There\u2019s a lot about the absurdity of wealth. I have so many friends who continue to make absurd amounts of money and count it. I think if you\u2019re really lucky, who\u2019s counting?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Putin\u2019s \u2018Invincible\u2019 Missile Is Aimed at U.S. Vulnerabilities", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia threatened the West with a new generation of nuclear weapons Thursday, including what he described as an \u201cinvincible\u201d intercontinental cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo that could outsmart all American defenses.The presentation by Mr. Putin, which included animation videos depicting multiple warheads aimed at Florida, where President Trump often stays at his Mar-a-Lago resort, sharply escalated the military invective in the tense relationship between the United States and Russia, which has led to predictions of a costly new nuclear arms race.While Mr. Putin may have been bluffing about these weapons, as some experts suggested, he cleverly focused on a vulnerability of American-designed defenses: They are based on the assumption that enemy nuclear missiles fly high and can be destroyed well before they reach their targets.The new class of Russian weapons, he said, travel low, stealthily, far and fast \u2014 too fast for defenders to react.Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement, in his annual state of the nation address, seemed intended chiefly to stir the patriotic passions of Russians at a moment when he is heading into a re-election campaign, even though his victory is assured in what amounts to a one-candidate race.He also used the speech to reassure Russians that the military buildup was taking place even as the government was spending big sums to improve the quality of their lives.But the main attention grabber in the speech was the weapons, which Mr. Putin described as a response to what he called the repudiation of arms control by the United States and its plans for a major weapons buildup.The Trump administration has said that countering the world\u2019s two other superpowers, Russia and China, was becoming its No. 1 national security mission, ahead of counterterrorism.It has largely blamed Russia\u2019s military modernization for that shift and has justified new work on nuclear weapons and bolstered missile defenses as the appropriate answer.Mr. Putin may have further fueled the tension on Thursday by essentially declaring that Russia\u2019s military brains had made America\u2019s response obsolete.He said a team of young, high-tech specialists had labored secretly and assiduously to develop and test the new weapons, including a nuclear-powered missile that could reach anywhere and evade interception.\u201cWith the missile launched and a set of ground tests completed, we can now proceed with the construction of a fundamentally new type of weapon,\u201d Mr. Putin said.The threats evoked the bombast of the Cold War. But this time they are not based on greater numbers of bombs but increased capabilities, stealth and guile.Mr. Putin\u2019s boasts about undersea nuclear torpedoes and earth-hugging cruise missiles emphasized the uselessness of American defenses against such weapons.Oddly, apart from a reference to renewing the American nuclear arms enterprise in his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump has said almost nothing about the new era of competition with Mr. Putin or Russia. With multiple investigations into whether his campaign\u2019s connections to Russians had influenced policy, he has neither protested the Russian buildup nor publicly endorsed, in any detail, his own administration\u2019s plans to counter it.The cruise missile was among five weapons introduced by Mr. Putin, each shown in video mock-ups on giant screens flanking him onstage. He threatened to use the weapons, as well as Russia\u2019s older-generation nuclear arms, against the United States and Europe if Russia were attacked.\u201cWe would consider any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies to be a nuclear attack on our country,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin said he could not show the actual weapons publicly, but assured his audience of Russia\u2019s main political and prominent cultural figures that they had all been developed.If Mr. Putin was not bluffing, said Aleksandr M. Golts, an independent Russian military analyst, then \u201cthese weapons are definitely new, absolutely new.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about nuclear-armed cruise missiles, that\u2019s a technological breakthrough and a gigantic achievement,\u201d he said in an interview. But, he added, \u201cThe question is, is this true?\u201dSeveral analysts writing on Facebook and elsewhere leaned toward the bluff theory. Given the recent history of Russian launch failures or premature crashes, the idea that Russia suddenly possessed a new generation of flying weapons strained credulity.\u201cThe real surprise in among all of this is a nuclear-powered cruise missile,\u201d said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cIt was talked about in the \u201960s, but it ran into a lot of obstacles. To the extent that the Russians are seriously revisiting this is pretty interesting.\u201dSuch technology could alter the balance of power, but Mr. Barrie questioned whether Russia was even close to deploying it.\u201cDoes reality mean you have an item in the budget saying, \u2018Develop nuclear propulsion for a missile?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOr does it mean, \u2018We\u2019re going to have one ready to use soon\u2019? I\u2019d certainly want to see more evidence to believe that.\u201dMr. Putin said Russia had developed the weaponry because the United States had rejected established arms control treaties and was deploying new missile defense systems in Europe and Asia.President Barack Obama said that he was willing to negotiate cuts deeper than the 1,550 arms that Washington and Moscow are permitted to deploy under the 2010 New Start treaty, which took full effect last month. But it expires in a few years, and neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Trump has shown interest in renewing it.The United States has also accused Russia of violating the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. After Mr. Putin\u2019s speech, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, said Mr. Putin essentially confirmed that by trumpeting the country\u2019s development of new nuclear weapons.Mr. Putin was correct that the United States is investing in expanding missile defenses. But those were not meant to counter Russia\u2019s huge arsenals, but rather the launching of a few missiles by a state like North Korea.The new Russian weapons would render such defenses obsolete, Mr. Putin gloated, and if anyone found a workaround, \u201cour boys will think of something new.\u201dOther weapons the Russian leader discussed included a ballistic missile called Sarmat that could round either pole and overcome any defense system; hypersonic nuclear weaponry that fly at 20 times the speed of sound; and unmanned deepwater submarines that could go huge distances at enormous speed.Political analysts said it was an effective campaign ploy whether the weapons existed or not. \u201cHe\u2019s giving people the image of a desired future, of a future for Russia, and that\u2019s appealing for his domestic audience,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow think tank.The reality that the country lacks the money to pay for a giant increase in social spending combined with a new generation of weapons was beside the point, Mr. Makarkin said.\u201cPeople may say Russia depends on oil, Russia doesn\u2019t have the money, but the population at large doesn\u2019t care about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just want to know that we are a superpower.\u201dOn the social front, Mr. Putin promised to double government spending on health care and raise pensions. He said Russia would reduce the poverty rate \u2014 official statistics indicate that around 14 million Russians live below the poverty line \u2014 by 2024.Mr. Putin also said that life expectancy, currently at 73, a leap from when he first took office in 2000, should exceed 80 by 2030.Critics doubt that Russia will ever have the means to deliver so much, given its stumbling economy and relatively depressed oil prices. Max Trudolyubov, a newspaper columnist and political analyst, called the speech a modern version of the Czar Cannon, a giant 16th-century piece of armament that sits on the Kremlin grounds and that legend holds never really worked.For years, Mr. Putin has chafed at the perceived disrespect showed to him and Russia by the United States. \u201cNobody listened to Russia,\u201d he said near the end of the speech, to huge applause. \u201cWell, listen up now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the age of the Czar Cannon. It is from the 16th century, not the 15th century.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Reporting was contributed by William J.

Let\u2019s talk about tech.The stock market hasn\u2019t been kind to new consumer start-ups. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely.On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits.But it has one thing going for it, and it\u2019s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry \u2014 a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.Spotify\u2019s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016.But Spotify is worth rooting for. It\u2019s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It\u2019s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers \u2014 Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I\u2019ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones.That\u2019s the best reason to hope it survives.So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out.There was also a lot of interest in \u201calgorithmic bias,\u201d the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren\u2019t thought of as a natural audience for new tech \u2014 older people, for example, or people in rural areas. \u201cDon\u2019t overlook the folks who are being left behind,\u201d said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind.Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That\u2019s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You\u2019re never as safe as companies say you are.Good question!So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I\u2019m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse \u2014 how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world.When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat. See you then!Advertisement"}

I\u2019m taking a road trip across the province to learn more about my birthplace and home. I hope readers will help guide me.But I want to learn more. So I plan to drive across the province beginning on March 12, and to visit Montreal, Maniwaki, H\u00e9rouxville, Quebec City and Saguenay \u2014 five places that tell very different stories about Quebec.In Montreal, I intend to, among other things, chat with Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, 27, the charismatic co-leader of Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire, a left-wing party that supports independence for the province. He was one of the leaders of the student protests in 2012 against increases in university tuition fees, which energized a new generation of political activism in the province.Then I will visit H\u00e9rouxville, which, justly or not, more than a decade ago became synonymous with a xenophobic Quebec after the town council unanimously adopted a code of conduct calling on immigrants not to stone women or set them on fire. I am interested in finding out whether, and how, attitudes have shifted.My final stop will be proud and scenic Saguenay, where many manufacturing jobs have been lost because of globalization. I am interested to learn how this has shaped attitudes there.But I need readers in Quebec and Canada to help flesh out my itinerary and make suggestions about what I should do. Who are the local characters I should meet? This could be everyone from the resident historian to cultural figures, community leaders or the resident clown. (The more interesting, dynamic and fun, the better.)What places, both known and off-the-beaten-track, should I visit? Which neighborhoods should I go to? What questions should I ask?And \u2014 very important \u2014 where should I drink and eat to understand the province\u2019s rich food culture?Also essential: No road trip is complete without some music to blast in the car, so I am appealing to readers to send me their favorite songs to make an ideal soundtrack for a trip across Quebec. I have been told that my current list, which includes Leonard Cohen, Garou and Roch Voisine, needs a radical update! I plan to publish a playlist from the best suggestions.Please send me your suggestions above. I can\u2019t wait to hear from you \u2014 and to hit the road!Advertisement"}

It was on fire.\u201dThe beginning of the video, which was taken last year, shows Johnnie Jermaine Rush being approached by Verino Ruggiero, an officer in training, shortly after midnight on Aug. 25 at a street corner near a baseball stadium in Asheville, about 120 miles west of Charlotte.\u201cYou didn\u2019t use the crosswalk four times in a row,\u201d Officer Ruggiero says in the video.\u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is go home, man. I\u2019m tired!\u201d Mr. Rush says. \u201cI just got off of work.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got two options, I can either arrest you or write you a ticket,\u201d Officer Ruggiero says.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, man.

Officer Chris Hickman, who was training Officer Ruggiero and wearing the body camera, orders Mr. Rush to put his hands behind his back. Mr. Rush runs, and the officers chase him, eventually tackling him to the ground.During the arrest, Mr. Rush was shocked with a Taser, choked and beaten by Officer Hickman, according to police records.At several points, while pinned to the ground, Mr. Rush cried, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201dThe camera footage also shows Officer Hickman hitting Mr. Rush on the head over and over with a closed fist, and Mr. Rush crying out in pain as he is shocked with a Taser.Mr. Rush could not be reached for comment.When Councilwoman Smith first saw the video, she said she was \u201cimmediately disturbed.\u201dShe recognized Mr. Rush, she said, from her work last year with the nonprofit Green Opportunities, a work force development organization that provides training programs to people in marginalized communities.She described him as a hardworking man who was eager to learn and who had expressed an interest in construction and carpentry. \u201cHe was looking for opportunities to gain more skills so he could qualify for higher-paying jobs,\u201d she said.On the day Mr. Rush was approached by the officers, he was walking home after the end of his dishwashing shift at a Cracker Barrel restaurant, according to the arrest report.Police records show he was charged with second-degree trespass, impeding traffic, assault on a government official and resisting a public officer. In September, all of the charges were dismissed after Todd M. Williams, the district attorney in Asheville, reviewed the body camera video, police records show.Mr. Williams did not respond to repeated requests for comment.In a statement last week, Chief Hooper apologized for the episode, calling the actions in the video \u201cunacceptable.\u201dShe also told WLOS that the Police Department was rethinking its protocol for excessive force cases.The two administrative investigations of Officer Hickman, which concluded in December, took several months. It was not until January that the criminal investigation began, the results of which are expected to be given to the district attorney next week. Officer Ruggiero is not under investigation.The administrative investigations revealed that Officer Hickman had used excessive force during the arrest and that he had engaged in \u201crude and discourteous behavior\u201d on four other occasions with other members of the public, according to police records. Chief Hooper decided to terminate him in January, personnel records show, but before she could deliver the news, he notified the department of his resignation, the documents say.Officer Hickman could not be reached for comment.A supervisor who responded to the scene on the night of Mr. Rush\u2019s arrest was disciplined for unsatisfactory performance after failing to immediately disclose all of the details gleaned from interviewing Mr. Hickman and Mr. Rush, and neglecting to view the body camera footage that day.\u201cShe kind of yelled a little bit, saying: \u2018You\u2019re lying. You\u2019re lying. My officer is not going to do that,\u2019\u201d he said.The City of Asheville has filed a petition requesting that the Police Department release additional body camera footage from the night of Mr. Rush\u2019s arrest to provide the public with a \u201ccomplete picture of the incident.\u201dAsheville, a city of nearly 90,000 in the Appalachian Mountains, is deeply segregated, Councilwoman Smith said. Only about 12 percent of the population is black.\u201cAsheville has an issue where we place value on certain people and we devalue other people based on their race, their politics, their economic situation or their placement within Asheville,\u201d Councilwoman Smith said.In a statement, the mayor of Asheville, Esther E. Manheimer, called the video \u201chighly disturbing.\u201d\u201cWe are better than this.

{"Headline": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseOver the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections.By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds.Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a \u201cbuy\u201d in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.)It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, \u201cpriced for perfection.\u201dWhatever else can be said about Facebook\u2019s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection.Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)With Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.Not only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201dThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\u201cMost people hadn\u2019t given much thought to how their data is used,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201dThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201dHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201dEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201dAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the given name of Facebook\u2019s chief executive.

Vindu Goel, a technology reporter for The Times who moved last year from San Francisco to Mumbai, India, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat? What do you like about it, and what could be better?It\u2019s the most reliable way to reach someone. Traditional SMS text messages cost money and are basically all spam or security verifications.So WhatsApp is the main way people communicate \u2014 words, links, photos, videos, holiday greetings. Since WhatsApp is linked to your phone, Indians give out their mobile numbers the way Americans give out email addresses.I do wish it were easier to search WhatsApp messages \u2014 something I do all the time in Gmail \u2014 and it would be helpful to be able to use a single account from multiple phones, as you can do with other services.Cellphone service in India is still spotty, so I carry one iPhone and one Android, with SIM cards for India\u2019s three biggest carriers and power banks to recharge them both. If I have to go somewhere in heavy traffic, I often turn one phone into a Wi-Fi hot spot and work on my laptop from the back seat while the driver worries about the road.How do people use tech differently in India compared with the United States? What are the most popular homegrown apps there? Jio offers local TV and many movies through its own apps. Amazon Prime and Netflix operate here, too.What are the biggest consequences of people in India getting onto the internet for the first time via their smartphones?I don\u2019t think we really know yet.Most new users know little or no English. So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.The combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.One big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.What is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like? Mumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.In tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.With so many major banks here, there is also an emerging scene of so-called fintech companies that are trying to apply technology to disrupt traditional financial services.Traditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.Still, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.I doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Air purifiers!Like China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.So we run Swiss-made IQAir purifiers for at least part of every day.Our 2-year-old is obsessed with FaceTime on our iPhones.

{"Headline": "Meet TESS, Seeker of Alien Worlds", "Date": "2018-03-26", "News": "Out ThereNASA\u2019s new spacecraft, to be launched next month, will give scientists a much clearer view of the planets orbiting stars near to us.Supported byKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. \u2014 The search for cosmic real estate is about to begin anew.There it will spend the next two years, at least, scanning the sky for alien worlds.TESS is the latest effort to try to answer questions that have intrigued humans for millenniums and dominated astronomy for the last three decades: Are we alone? Are there other Earths? Evidence of even a single microbe anywhere else in the galaxy would rock science.Thanks to efforts like Kepler\u2019s, astronomers now think there are billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy, which means the nearest one could be as close as 10 to 15 light-years from here.And so the torch is passed. It\u2019s now TESS\u2019s job to find those nearby planets, the ones close enough to scrutinize with telescopes, or even for an interstellar robot to visit.George Ricker, an M.I.T. researcher and the leader of the TESS team, expects to find some 500 Earth-sized planets within 300 light-years of here, close enough for a coming generation of telescopes on the ground and in space to examine for habitability \u2014 or perhaps even inhabitants.But there will be more than planets in the universe, according to TESS.\u201cTESS is going to be a lot of fun,\u201d Dr. Ricker said. \u201cThere are 20 million stars we can look at.\u201d The spacecraft will be able to do precise brightness measurements of every glint in the heavens, he said. \u201cGalaxies, stars, active galactic nuclei,\u201d his voice trailing off.Most of the exoplanets will be orbiting stars called red dwarfs, much smaller and cooler than the sun. They make up the vast majority of stars in our neighborhood (and in the universe) and presumably lay claim to most of the planets.Like Kepler, TESS will hunt those planets by monitoring the light from stars and detecting slight dips, momentary fading indicating that a planet has passed in front of its star.The mission\u2019s planners say they eventually expect to catalog 20,000 new exoplanet candidates of all shapes and sizes. In particular, they have promised to come up with the masses and orbits of 50 new planets that are less than four times the size of the Earth.Are they so-called \u201csuperearths,\u201d mostly rock with a veil of atmosphere, or \u201cmini-Neptunes\u201d with small cores buried deep inside extensive balls of gas?Data from Kepler and astronomers suggests that the difference is mass: fertile rocks often are less than one and a half times the size of the Earth, while barren ice clouds often are bigger. Where the line really is, and how many planets fall on one side or the other, could determine how many worlds out there are balls of freezing vapor or potential gardens.\u201cWe need to make precise mass measurements,\u201d said David Latham of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who is in charge of organizing astronomers to follow up the TESS observations.To that end, the team has procured 80 nights of observing time a year for the next five years on a spectrograph called Harps North, which resides on an Italian telescope on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, a part of Spain off the coast of Africa.Harps \u2014 for High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher \u2014 can measure the mass of a planet by how much it makes its home star wobble as it goes around in an orbit. Such measurements, if precise enough could help distinguish the composition and structure of these bodies.TESS is one of NASA\u2019s smaller missions, with a budget of $200 million; by comparison, Kepler had a budget of about $650 million.Recently TESS, partly clad in shiny aluminum foil, stubby solar panels folded modestly against its side, was sitting on a round pedestal inside a plastic tent. The tent occupied one corner of a cavernous \u201cclean room\u201d in a remote building on the scrubby outskirts of the space center here, amid palms and canals and flocks of cormorants.The spacecraft is about the size of a bulky, oddly shaped refrigerator, festooned not with magnets but with mysterious nozzles and connectors. Four pairs of blue-clad legs were sticking out from underneath the pedestal, as if high-tech mechanics were working under a car.The engineers were taping plaques to the bottom of the spacecraft, including a memory chip containing drawings by schoolchildren who had been asked to imagine exoplanets might look like.Standing to the side, in a \u201cbunny suit\u201d of protective material that left only his bespectacled eyes visible, Dr. Ricker was staring into the tent at his new spacecraft, as if he were watching his car get fixed, and exchanging rocket talk with the engineers who had designed and built it.Dr. Ricker has been a rocket scientist, building astronomical satellites to be shot into space, for pretty much his entire career as a researcher at M.I.T.\u2019s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.Asked if planets represented a departure for him, Dr. Ricker shrugged, \u201cNot so much.\u201d All his work has involved delicate measurements of things changing, what he called \u201ctime-domain astronomy.\u201dThe key to this work is to maintain very stable and sensitive detectors \u2014 the imaging chips that are elite relatives of the sensors in your smartphone \u2014 so that they can reliably record the changes in brightness, just a few parts per million, that signal a planet passing by its star.Dr. Ricker said he and his colleagues had started \u201cnoodling\u201d about a planet-finding mission back in 2006. After they lost out in a competition for NASA\u2019s Small Explorers program, which are less expensive missions, the scientists re-entered a competition for a larger mission in 2010 \u2014 and won.They had gone to great lengths to design a compact spacecraft that would fit the rockets NASA used for Small Explorers, and so were nonplused when NASA selected SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, which can carry a much larger payload, to launch the TESS mission.\u201cTESS looks like a little toy inside the Falcon 9,\u201d Dr. Ricker said. But a toy with potential.On top of the spacecraft are four small cameras, each with a 24-degree field of view, a stretch of sky about the size of the Orion constellation.The cameras will stare at adjacent sections of sky for 27 days at a time, and then step to the next spot. In the course of the first year, the researchers will survey the entire southern hemisphere of the sky; in the second year, they will stitch together the northern sky. If the mission is extended beyond two years, they will repeat.Dr. Ricker and his colleagues have prepared a list of 200,000 nearby stars whose brightness will be measured and reported every two minutes in what they call the spacecraft\u2019s \u201cpostage stamp\u201d mode. Meanwhile, images of the entire 24-degree swaths of sky will be recorded every half-hour.That cadence is perfect for finding and studying current favorites in the race to locate habitable exoplanets, namely those circling the ubiquitous red dwarf stars, or M dwarfs, in astronomical jargon. \u201cThis is the era of the M dwarf,\u201d Dr. Seager said.Because they are so much cooler and less luminous than the sun, their \u201cGoldilocks\u201d zones \u2014 where in principle liquid water is possible \u2014 lie only a few million miles out from each star, instead of the 90 million miles from which the Earth circles the sun.At the shorter distance, a year in the life of a red dwarf planet is only 10 to 30 days. If TESS is watching that bit of the sky for 27 days straight, it may see three dips in brightness because of transits, enough to certify the planet as a real candidate and to start investigating its reality.But reality, as Dr. Seager noted, might not be the same as habitability, at least for the fragile likes of us. Red dwarfs are very unstable and given to violent solar flares, she said.At least one, Dr. Seager pointed out, was as energetic as a famous solar flare called the Carrington Event in 1859, which destroyed telegraph service on Earth and sent auroras as far south as the Equator.\u201cPersonally, I will always hold out for the true Earth twin, one we feel a kinship with,\u201d Dr. Seager said, referring to a planet like ours that circles a bigger star like the sun.To start its excellent adventure, TESS will be launched into an unusually eccentric orbit that takes the satellite all the way out to the moon at its farthest point. Gravitational interaction with the moon will then keep TESS in a stable 13.7-day orbit for as long as 1,000 years, Dr. Ricker said.The great apogee, the farthest distance from Earth, will minimize obstruction and interference from our planet. The spacecraft will radio its data back once every orbit, when it is closest to Earth, at about 67,000 miles up.Dr. Latham called it \u201ca slick orbit.\u201d But it will take almost two months and many rocket burns to get there and begin to do science. If all goes well, that would be the middle of June.Sometime during that process, Dr. Ricker said, the team will turn the spacecraft\u2019s cameras on the Earth for a last look at home.Asked if he was ready to be Mr. Exoplanet, Dr. Ricker winced. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking forward to,\u201d he said, \u201cis getting some data to look at.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the launchpad that Tess would use. It was not an old Apollo launchpad, but was used for Air Force rockets and is now leased to SpaceX.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yes, Adults Can Have Chocolate for Breakfast. Really.", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteNo matter how much cream and honey you pour into your bowl, no matter the raisins or raspberries that dot the top, there will always be something gray and Dickensian about a bowl of morning porridge.Unless, that is, you add chocolate. Because chocolate oatmeal splits the difference between porridge and pudding: It\u2019s soft; it\u2019s custardy; and it\u2019s profoundly bittersweet.Even better, since unsweetened cocoa powder is naturally fat-free and full of antioxidants, this is one chocolate breakfast cereal that can be considered healthful \u2014 at least until you start adding on the sugar and cream.A much simpler method is to whisk some unsweetened cocoa into your boiling water before adding the oats, then to sweeten the mixture to taste at the end. I like the ratio of one tablespoon cocoa powder to a half-cup steel-cut oats, but you can vary that, making it more or less intensely chocolaty. Dutch-processed cocoa, which has been alkalized to reduce its acidity, will give you a darker chocolate flavor, while natural cocoa powder is a bit brighter and more fruity, so use whatever you have.On most mornings, I\u2019ll stop there. But sometimes, on the dreariest days, when I know I need something extra special to lure me out of bed, I\u2019ll toast the oats in browned butter before adding them to the pot. That touch of caramelization adds a wonderful, nutty depth.Without any added sweetener, chocolate oatmeal is almost shockingly bitter. But a drizzle of honey or maple syrup or a sprinkling of sugar tames it without turning it into dessert. Likewise, substituting milk \u2014 be it whole milk, coconut milk or nut milk \u2014 for up to half of the cooking water softens the bite.My favorite toppings for a bowl of chocolate oatmeal are a lump of sweet butter, a shower of Demerara sugar and a few tiny flakes of sea salt. The contrasts \u2014 bitter and buttery, sweet and salty \u2014 make it much more complex and sophisticated than the average bowl of porridge, even if it sounds like the kind of thing you\u2019d serve to children. But don\u2019t be fooled. Children will love it, but this recipe for chocolate oatmeal is as adult as porridge gets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "#MeToo Called for an Overhaul. Are Workplaces Really Changing?", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWomen have spoken. Men have fallen. Corporations are nervous. But are American workplaces making real progress in curbing sexual harassment?Five months after allegations against Harvey Weinstein led to the mass baring of past secrets, the focus is turning to the future. Government is stepping up efforts: In Washington, the House of Representatives is preparing to train every worker, down to the most junior intern, and state legislators across the country are proposing ambitious new laws. Corporate boards and investors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley are going on the offensive, probing for problems to avoid being surprised. Entrepreneurs are developing apps and programs to help victims discover if their harassers have targeted others. Women in entertainment, advertising and other industries are demanding fundamental shifts, including more females in leadership roles.The #MeToo moment has shifted social attitudes, inspired widespread calls for change and resulted in unprecedented accountability. But the revelations about the pervasiveness of harassment \u2014 and of the legal and institutional failures to address it \u2014 illuminate how tough it will be to extinguish.\u201cWe can\u2019t fire our way out of this problem,\u201d said Paula Brantner, who runs sexual harassment workshops for nonprofits and businesses, pointing out that removing individual offenders is not enough.Even as dramatic headlines have captured attention, many women say they\u2019ve seen zero change in their own workplaces. At a Mexican restaurant in Lake Elsinore, Calif., a server named Nikkie Parra fumed through a recent shift as one customer recalled the time he asked her to wrestle his penis, another compared a fold in a bar rag to a vagina and her boss sang, \u201cNikkie Nikkie Nikkie, can\u2019t you see, sometimes those hips just hypnotize me.\u201dShe gathered the courage to ask co-workers to join her in a lawsuit. When the boss caught wind of her plans, she was fired. \u201cIt felt like hopelessness,\u201d she said later. \u201cIt felt like this is not going to change. Especially with what\u2019s going on in the media and all the celebrities, and this still happens.\u201dWomen with wider influence share those anxieties. When Tina Tchen, a lawyer and former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, left the White House, she thought she would quietly restart her legal career focusing on workplace issues. Now she is helping to guide the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, an initiative that sprang up virtually overnight, spearheaded by women in entertainment, and that faces a critical question: whether the more than $20 million donated so far can fund both immediate legal help for low-income workers like Ms. Parra and a longer-term strategy of filing potential landmark cases.Ms. Tchen has also been working with organizations that have faced harassment allegations: the Service Employees International Union, which was particularly embarrassed given its mission of protecting workers; and Pixar Animation, where John Lasseter, perhaps the most revered animator since Walt Disney, recently took a leave of absence.Across industries, Ms. Tchen says she sees plenty of resolve for fighting harassment, but a lack of proven mechanisms. \u201cThe tool kit is a little bit bare,\u201d she said, explaining that there is no consensus on how to report a repeat offender who goes from job to job, or address more minor infractions with measures short of suspension or firing.But among some major corporations, a fear-driven shift has begun: Harassment is now considered not just a legal liability, but also a serious reputational and business risk. Executives and boards are beginning to look at harassment \u201cthe same way you think about other risks to your organization\u201d like security or hacking, said Kaye Foster-Cheek, former head of human resources for Johnson & Johnson and a member of three boards.\u201cFor the first time I\u2019m seeing a discussion about, \u2018Even if this behavior doesn\u2019t rise to the level of legal sexual harassment, we won\u2019t tolerate it,\u2019\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president of the Society for Human Resource Management.In the past, the burden for uncovering misconduct was almost always on victims, but now some companies are assuming a fact-finding role. More are turning to anonymous but detailed employee surveys with questions like \u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d and \u201cHave you experienced harassment?\u201d If workers say yes, the company won\u2019t know the particulars, but it can initiate investigations or increase training.More companies are now accepting that \u201ccomplaint and reporting procedures have failed,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, who helped establish the field of sexual harassment training and, as an investor, has helped push through changes at Uber and other companies.More traditional strategies, like sexual harassment training, are also booming. \u201cI could be booked between now and 10 years from now and still not fulfill the degree of demand,\u201d said Stephen Paskoff, a longtime trainer whose clients include Coca-Cola and Verizon Wireless.The most effective training is expensive, requiring small-group sessions, deep looks at organizational culture and frequent follow-up. But even those who deliver it warn that it is not a complete solution. \u201cDo you think if Harvey Weinstein went to a harassment training class it would have prohibited his behavior?\u201d Mr. Paskoff asked.And in some cases, the public pressure on companies just means that more quiet financial force is being used. Several employment lawyers say that settlement amounts have been rising. \u201cCases are settling for premium dollars very quickly,\u201d said Debra Katz, a lawyer in Washington, who added that she had settled three cases against chief executives in recent months. Employers are \u201cpaying to avoid the public black eye, being outed as harassers,\u201d she said. (New Jersey and other states are considering bans or limits on secret settlements, setting up what is likely to be a fight between those who argue that the agreements enable harassment by burying the problem and those who stress that they are often a woman\u2019s best recourse.)Etelbina Hauser, a Honduran immigrant who cleans houses in Seattle, said she felt bolstered by the Hollywood women who spoke out about harassment. \u201cIt makes me feel powerful because I feel like all women are joining together,\u201d she said in Spanish. Two men have exposed themselves to Ms. Hauser while she was cleaning their homes. A third propositioned her for sex. In each case she fled, gave up the job and essentially kept the experience to herself.Self-employed workers like Ms. Hauser have no colleagues, no human resources department, no concrete employment policies. \u201cIn many cases no one knows this woman is working there,\u201d said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.When The New York Times asked a number of low-wage employers if they had taken new steps in recent months to prevent harassment, almost none said yes. Some would not comment; others, including Walmart, Target, Sears Holdings, Subway, Costco, Aramark and ABM Industries, said they already had the right policies and procedures in place.California legislators are working on what activists hope will be a model for the rest of the country: building up state-level protections for victims of sexual harassment to patch the gaps in the federal rules. One proposed state law extends the statute of limitations. Another specifically defines the business roles it addresses: not just \u201cemployer,\u201d but also producer, director, investor. Another would make supervisors personally liable for any retaliation. \u201cThese are wholesale changes in the law; they are new rights,\u201d said Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, an anti-discrimination group helping to push the California bills.Just this week, Washington State enacted laws to make it easier for women to come forward about harassment, including by prohibiting nondisclosure agreements that prevent them from describing their experiences.Several weeks ago, Renee LaChance, a general contractor in Portland, Ore., was discussing a renovation with a male electrician when he unleashed a stream of explicit comments about her breasts.\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention?\u201d she asked him, flabbergasted that all the recent news about harassment had not deterred him.Her solution was simple. \u201cI\u2019m the person in power in the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI fired him on the spot.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an entrepreneur who has been contacted during the vetting of male venture capitalists.

{"Headline": "Jacobs\u2019s Pursuit of Qualcomm Faces Long Odds: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Jacobs\u2019s pursuit of Qualcomm faces long odds.\u2022 Repo helped fell Bear Stearns. Is the market fixed?\u2022 Toys \u201cR\u201d Us shows the follies of the last round of private equity megadeals.When Michael Dell took Dell private in 2013, he had a clearly stated mission and a large stake in the company.The same can\u2019t be said so far of Paul Jacobs.The former C.E.O. of Qualcomm and a current director told the company\u2019s board this week that he is thinking of making a bid for Qualcomm.Mr. Jacobs owns only a tiny slice of Qualcomm, and if his plans to take the company private gain ground, he will need a very compelling story.Mr. Jacobs would have to offer a price that is high enough to convince shareholders to tender their shares. But the higher the price, the more debt Mr. Jacobs would have to raise to finance the deal.This is where a strong vision is important. His backers would need to see how Qualcomm\u2019s performance might actually improve.Making that case would be tough. All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.But Qualcomm\u2019s stock price may already largely reflect a settlement with Apple. That means some shareholders may be happy to take, say, the $79 a share that Broadcom was offering for Qualcomm before the Trump administration nixed its bid.\u2014 Peter EavisQualcomm was co-founded in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs, who took the company public and grew it into a mobile chips behemoth. He later passed the baton to his son, Paul Jacobs.Mr. Jacobs, a Qualcomm director, sent the company\u2019s board a letter on Tuesday saying he wanted to explore taking the chip maker private and that he intended to talk to potential funding sources about the possibility, according to people briefed on the situation who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. The board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday where Mr. Jacobs\u2019s move \u2014 and whether he should stay on the board \u2014 is expected to be discussed, the people said.Any takeover attempt by Mr. Jacobs faces extraordinarily tough obstacles. As an owner of less than 1 percent of Qualcomm shares, Mr. Jacobs would have to find investors to purchase equity in a transaction, as well as bankers willing to fund debt. Since Qualcomm directors had rejected Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion offer as inadequate, the total price tag would likely have to be higher.\u2014 Don Clark and Andrew Ross SorkinTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\u2014Peter EavisNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic. But look at the margins, and you\u2019ll find some worry.To be clear, the consensus is that deal-making will keep going. Here\u2019s what Michael Carr, one of Goldman Sachs\u2019s global co-head of mergers, said in a presentation yesterday:\u201cOur theory is that we are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure, and that is causing M.&A. to happen. Sometimes you have to do something because your neighbor is doing it.\u201dYet here are the things that people here have worried about:And Mr. Carr acknowledged, \u201cThe relationship between the White House and Beijing is far from great.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la MercedFrom Monday, the Federal District Court in Washington will play host to a legal battle that could determine how Americans watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and CNN: the Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner.The ruling could affect major pending health care mergers and may have ramifications for the tech economy. If the deal is allowed, AT&T argues, it could act as a bulwark against the power of digital media giants such as Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook. Or it could create an entertainment behemoth that holds consumers hostage, as the government insists.The hostile takeover bid is dead, killed by President Trump. But the other major threat to Qualcomm\u2019s business is still around \u2014 and buying chips from it.Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.\u201cThis didn\u2019t come out of Cfius at the end of the process. That creates suspicion.\u201dToys \u201cR\u201d Us\u2019s private equity backers had saddled it with $5 billion of debt. That classic buyout strategy might not work so well in the digital era, when spending on interest payments rather than innovation can mean handing your customers to Amazon.Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals.A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition.Two recent bankruptcies that fit the pattern: the radio company iHeartMedia and the New York grocery chain Tops.Pandora, the company\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.Lloyd Blankfein has announced his successor at Goldman Sachs. Jamie Dimon has started to outline who would replace him at JPMorgan Chase. And so the two top bankers of their generation are set to ride off into the sunset sooner rather than later.Dimon and Blankfein had a good run. They began as chief executive officers within six months of each other in 2006, with the global mania in financial assets nearing its peak, and emerged from the crisis that soon followed with their reputations not just intact but burnished \u2014 at least among fellow Wall Streeters.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has garnered praise for expanding rights of women in the country, allowing them to drive and attend sports events. Yet his own mother may not be benefiting from that openness.U.S. officials interviewed for this story believe, based on several years of intelligence, that MBS took action against his mother because he was concerned that she opposed his plans for a power grab that could divide the royal family and might use her influence with the king to prevent it. The officials said MBS placed his mother under house arrest at least for some time at a palace in Saudi Arabia, without the king\u2019s knowledge.More from The Hollywood Reporter:\u201cThey threatened me, and I understood immediately that threat put me and my family at risk, and this exposure would put my professional life at risk as well. I foreclosed that possibility by disclosing the details to my family, and then when I discussed it with Bob, he and I agreed that I had placed the company in an untenable position and as a result, I should resign.\u201dUnanswered questions: Were the police brought in? And are there more shoes to drop from this case?Advertisement"}

What makes their voices uniquely powerful?When have youth-led movements influenced policy in the past, and what can we learn from them?_________Warm Up:Ask students to respond in writing to the following questions, then discuss them in pairs, small groups or as a whole class:\u2022 Can people under age 21 make a real impact on society? For example, can they be instrumental in changing laws or policies on issues they care about? How? What examples from the past or present can you think of to support your opinion? List as many as you can.\u2022 What qualities, skills, circumstances or perspectives are unique to young people \u2014 whether today or in the past \u2014 and how might they help make their voices uniquely powerful?_________Watch, Listen or Read:Depending on how much time you\u2019d like to spend, you can choose from three different options to have your students learn more about the activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.Invite them to share ideas in small groups, then, as a class, compile their lists on the board.Finally, follow up by asking students to discuss:\u2022 What actions seem to be most effective? Why?\u2022 Do you think these students be able to make a lasting impact on this issue? If yes, why? If no, why not?\u2022 What barriers might they run into? Why?\u2022 What suggestions do you have for these student activists?\u2022 What reactions or questions do these students\u2019 activism raise for you? Why?For example, here is one comment we received from Jordyn I. of Westfield, N.J. Do your students agree?I believe that my generation has the power to change the world more than any group before us. Unlike the generations in decades past, we have more information available to us than ever before. Social media, arguably the most powerful tool of communication in the history of the world, is at our fingertips. With the click of a button, our words can be shared with millions. All it takes is one tweet, one post on Instagram or Facebook. And a second later, your opinion is broadcasted everywhere. The internet has empowered us to have the ability to change the world, even at the young ages that we are._________ Discuss Student Rights in the Context of Planned School WalkoutsWhat is your classroom, school or district\u2019s policy on walkouts? How many of your students plan to participate?\u2022 Do people under 18 have the same rights as adults? If not, how do they differ \u2014 and why?\u2022 Do students under 18 have the same rights in school as they do out of school? If not, what examples can you give?Marches, walkouts and sit-ins are the embodiment of our core freedoms: the right to speak out, to assemble peaceably and petition our government for change. Such protests recall powerful moments in the civil rights movement, when energized groups of young people caught the nation\u2019s attention and successfully pushed for social and political change.Challenge students to return to the original questions for which they brainstormed answers and correct or add detail to anything they now understand better. How would they summarize their answers? What questions are they left with? Where can they find answers?As a final activity for this part of the unit, students might produce a piece for their school website or newspaper clarifying student rights and responsibilities in the context of student activism on gun violence. To do this, they might interview school or district administrators, teachers and students; consult written school policy; and learn more about their school or community\u2019s history of related student activism.Update, March 15:_________To report back to the class on their findings, they might answer a version of the same questions we asked about the current gun-violence activism:\u2022 What actions seemed to be most effective? Why? How were they unique to their time, place and circumstances?\u2022 Can we still feel the impact of these students\u2019 activism on this issue? How?\u2022 What barriers did they run into? Why?\u2022 What can student activists today learn from them?Raising Questions: Different Responses to Different Kinds of Activists?Parkland students themselves have credited Black Lives Matter as a model for their own movement:If your students choose this youth-led movement to research further, they might also address these questions:\u2022 Are there differences in how Black Lives Matter student activists have been received by the media and the public compared to the Stoneman Douglas students? If so, what do they think accounts for those differences? What evidence can they find to support their point of view?\u2022 What can, or should, be done \u2014 whether by the student activists themselves, by the media or by fellow citizens \u2014 to make sure all voices on an issue are heard?_________Though we have focused on gun violence in this lesson, there are, of course, many other issues young people are passionate about. What problems in our world might inspire the students you teach to start or join a movement for change?Though our lesson plan offers details for each step, below we\u2019ve added a few more resources that may be helpful. Identify Issues Invite your students to write individually, then brainstorm as a group, as many answers as they can to these questions:\u2022 What issues do you care about? Why?\u2022 What changes do you want to see happen in your school, community, state, the country or even the world?Students might write their answers on the board, on sticky notes or in a shared class document so that everyone can see the range of ideas. Next, invite them to group what they find into several broad categories. Finally, have students team up around related issues to decide what to do next.Consider a Range of ActionsNot everyone is comfortable speaking on camera, or walking out of school for a cause, yet everyone can find something to do to effect change.Which of the actions students identified when reading about the Parkland students or about youth-led movements in history could help them bring change on the issue they have chosen? How?Below, a few options, each linked to a Times or Learning Network article that offers an example, ideas or more information:Use social media.Create a petition.Run for office.Raise money.Engage the press.Advocate to those in power to change rules or legislation.Write an editorial.Educate others.Start programs that solve problems.Take legal action.Finally, Answer Ten Questions for Participatory Politics_________From The New York TimesGo Ahead, Millennials, Destroy Us50 Years Later, It Feels Familiar: How America Fractured in 1968The Snapchat Cohort Gets Into Politics, and Civics Is CoolInteractive Timeline | Black Activism on CampusA \u2018Mass Shooting Generation\u2019 Cries Out for ChangeWith Grief and Hope, Florida Students Take Gun Control Fight On the RoadDon\u2019t Let My Classmates\u2019 Deaths Be in VainMy Teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas Saved LivesEmma Gonz\u00e1lez Leads a Student Outcry on Guns: \u2018This Is the Way I Have to Grieve\u2019_________From The Learning NetworkIdeas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social UncertaintyResources for Talking and Teaching About the School Shooting in FloridaCivil Conversation Challenge for Teenagers | Issue 2: GunsFilm Club | \u2018Haunted by Columbine\u2019Watershed: Teaching About Gun Control After NewtownThe Death of Michael Brown: Teaching About Ferguson_________From Around the Web_________Michael Gonchar contributed ideas for this lesson plan.

{"Headline": "Shkreli vs. Holmes: 2 Frauds, 2 Divergent Outcomes. Were They Fair?", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBen Brafman, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s defense lawyer, told me this week that in his four decades of representing high-profile clients, he\u2019d never encountered so many potential jurors who asked to be excused because they didn\u2019t think they could give his client a fair hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve represented people charged with murder and dismemberment, and jurors didn\u2019t bat an eye,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Martin\u2019s case, they asked to be excused because they hated him.\u201dMr. Shkreli was convicted of fraud for his activities at two hedge funds he ran, not for anything related to drug pricing. Mr. Brafman argued that Mr. Shkreli eventually repaid all of his investors, and some realized large gains. Still, a jury ultimately found Mr. Shkreli guilty on three counts \u2014 acquitting him on five others \u2014 and this month he was sentenced to seven years in prison.She was the youngest recipient of the Horatio Alger award in recognition of \u201cremarkable achievements accomplished through honesty, hard work, self-reliance and perseverance over adversity.\u201dForbes put her on the cover of its 2015 survey of the 400 richest Americans and estimated her net worth at $4.5 billion.Among the more brazen falsehoods peddled to potential investors: that Theranos technology was used by the Defense Department in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters, and that the company\u2019s revenue in 2014 was $108 million and was \u201con track\u201d to generate $1 billion in 2015.In fact, Theranos technology was \u201cnever deployed\u201d on the battlefield in Afghanistan, \u201cor on medevac helicopters,\u201d the S.E.C. said. Theranos\u2019s revenue in 2014 was barely $100,000, \u201cnowhere near\u201d $100 million, the agency said, and the $1 billion projection was a fantasy that \u201chad no basis\u201d in reality.Ms. Holmes settled the S.E.C.\u2019s charges without admitting or denying them. She is barred from being an officer or director of any public company for 10 years and agreed to pay a fine of $500,000. Though she lost voting control of Theranos, a private company, she remains chairman and chief executive.Still, the relatively lenient treatment she\u2019s gotten so far, compared with Mr. Shkreli\u2019s seven-year prison term, provokes the question: Is this fair?\u201cI don\u2019t have any connection to the case, but from reading the S.E.C.\u2019s complaint, the allegations are of a nature that prosecutors would typically pursue to determine if criminal charges can be brought,\u201d said Antonia M. Apps, a former federal prosecutor and partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy who teaches a course on white-collar crime at Harvard Law School. \u201cIt\u2019s outright fraud.\u201dJohn C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who teaches classes on white-collar crime, agreed that \u201cit appears a lot of people were defrauded.\u201d But he said he would not be surprised to see a plea bargain or even a deferred prosecution agreement, in which Ms. Holmes could avoid a prison term, especially if she cooperates with prosecutors.\u201cTypically you get more sympathy from the criminal justice system if you\u2019re an attractive young woman than a brash, arrogant young male,\u201d he said.Mr. Coffee and other lawyers I spoke to cautioned that, because she settled the S.E.C.\u2019s charges, the public hasn\u2019t heard her defense. When more facts emerge, her case may be more complex than it now appears. But on the face of the S.E.C.\u2019s complaint, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s crimes pale in comparison.At the heart of both cases are lies: At Mr. Shkreli\u2019s sentencing, federal Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto referred to Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cegregious multitude of lies,\u201d and the same might be said of Ms. Holmes. But the financial consequences of her deceptions were in another league.Judge Matsumoto said it didn\u2019t matter that Mr. Shkreli later repaid the investors he defrauded, or that some of his investors made millions. Still, the magnitude of the fraud was just over $10 million.Theranos\u2019s was far greater. According to the S.E.C. complaint, from 2013 to 2015 Theranos used false claims to raise more than $700 million from investors. By late last year, Theranos was \u201con the verge of bankruptcy,\u201d the S.E.C. said.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s victims were mostly wealthy individuals, presumably sophisticated investors. Many of Ms. Holmes\u2019 victims were, too; they included the media magnate Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle. But she also attracted venture capital funds whose investors included pension funds and endowments, affecting thousands of ordinary Americans.In comparison to Mr. Shkreli\u2019s fraud, the Holmes allegations \u201care really a different order of magnitude,\u201d Ms. Apps said.But the reactions of Ms. Holmes and Mr. Shkreli to the charges are also wildly divergent \u2014 a factor that may ultimately determine whether Ms. Holmes is charged, and, if convicted, whether she ends up in prison.Both Ms. Holmes and Mr. Shkreli courted celebrity and seemed to revel in media attention. But in Mr. Shkreli\u2019s case, that impulse seemed only to intensify once he was charged.Mr. Shkreli repeatedly defied Mr. Brafman\u2019s admonitions to keep quiet and avoid the limelight. He smirked through his trial, taunted prosecutors as the \u201cjunior varsity,\u201d called the case a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and was suspended by Twitter after he threatened to have sex with a freelance journalist who covered him. His bail was revoked and he was imprisoned after he offered a $5,000 bounty in a Facebook post for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair \u2014 a \u201csolicitation to assault,\u201d Judge Matsumoto ruled.In theory, Mr. Shkreli\u2019s well-publicized bizarre antics, both in and out of court, should have had no bearing on his guilt or sentence. As Mr. Brafman put it in his opening statement, Mr. Shkreli shouldn\u2019t be found guilty for being \u201codd,\u201d \u201cweird,\u201d or having a \u201cdysfunctional personality.\u201d But prosecutors cited his behavior to assert in closing arguments that he \u201chad no respect for the law.\u201d At his sentencing, Judge Matsumoto suggested his actions called into question whether his purported remorse was genuine.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a client who did more to hurt his own standing with the court than Martin Shkreli,\u201d Mr. Brafman said. His behavior and comments \u201cprobably added several years to his sentence.\u201dSo far, Ms. Holmes has followed the traditional route of the contrite potential defendant: She has maintained a low profile and said nothing to provoke the government or prosecutors.After the S.E.C. settlement, Ms. Holmes made no comment. In keeping with that strategy, John Dwyer, the Palo Alto, Calif., lawyer representing her, declined to comment for this column. Theranos issued a statement stressing that she had \u201ccooperated with the S.E.C. throughout its investigation\u201d and said its independent directors were \u201cpleased to be bringing this matter to a close.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Ejen in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a Mother\u2019s Touch Infuses the Menu", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosSon-mat, in Korean, translates literally as the taste of your hands. It refers to the natural instinct a cook brings to the kitchen, the inner jazz of cooking not by measurements but by feel, and the distinct culinary fingerprint that makes one person\u2019s food taste like no other\u2019s.For Jenny Jiae Lee, a young Seoul-born, California-bred architect now living in New York, no Korean food in the city could make up for missing her mother\u2019s son-mat. So two years ago, she asked her parents, Don and Sue Lee, who were living happily in retirement in a suburb of Los Angeles, to move across the country and open a Korean food stand in her new hometown.They had never worked in a restaurant; her mother had never cooked outside the home. They said yes. (\u201cThey love me!\u201d the younger Ms. Lee said.)Last May, after a year of hustling at the Long Island City Flea and staging pop-ups at bars, the family secured a corner in the snaking hallways of the Industry City food hall in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their stand, Ejen \u2014 meaning \u201cnow\u201d in the sense of \u201cfrom this moment forward\u201d \u2014 is coolly modern in appearance, outfitted in Edison bulbs and sleek metal panels; but the food might as well have come from ancient, crusted pans in a fog of night-market smoke. It knows no time, and is all comfort.The meatballs alone made me jealous of Ms. Lee\u2019s childhood. Called dong-gue-rang-taeng, they\u2019re part of a beloved category of battered and fried foods often prepared for Korean holidays and jesa, the annual ceremony to honor one\u2019s ancestors. Here, they\u2019re a tender meld of ground pork flecked with carrots and green onion, slightly flattened into a kind of carnal currency.The breading \u2014 a dredge in flour, a dip in egg wash \u2014 is so light as to be barely noticeable, beyond the richness it brings. But note the high gloss, like a candy apple\u2019s: At the last moment, the meatballs are anointed with a glaze of salty and sweet held in perfect suspension, neither flavor dominating the other.What goes into the glaze the younger Ms. Lee would not say. \u201cMy mother is very secretive,\u201d she said. (Once she took a picture of a dish in progress and the elder Ms. Lee admonished her: \u201cDon\u2019t put that on Instagram!\u201d)Balance is a theme, notably in pork bulgogi, which unlike some versions in town doesn\u2019t capitulate to sugar. Dumplings, packed with lush pork and cabbage, are steamed before frying so the skin takes on a faint crackle while the meat says juicy within.There is a graceful economy to the small kitchen, with vegetables seasoned one by one and recurring as a steady motif. For japchae, chewy sweet-potato glass noodles the color of fading photographs are tangled with wood ear mushrooms, skinny strips of carrot, darkened spinach and cabbage still holding its crunch. Typically each ingredient is fried separately, but the elder Ms. Lee flings them together in the pan, on the theory that the brief skirmish draws out more flavor. She\u2019s right.In bibimbap, shiitakes, carrots, spinach and burdock are fanned out over rice and crowned by an egg with a still-quaking yolk. Pierce it and stir it in, and you have luxury; there\u2019s hardly a need for the accompanying house-made gochujang (the one taste I found too sweet).Fiercest of the dishes is soondubu jjigae, a long-simmered stew incarnadine from chile paste and chile oil, for which peppers are shipped from South Korea. (\u201cOrigin is important,\u201d the younger Ms. Lee said.) One version exploits the voluptuousness of pork stock and melted fat; another, with a base of seafood stock, offers a smack of brine. Slippery blocks of tofu, nearly as soft as custard, bob at the surface.Ms. Lee\u2019s parents seem to have settled into their surroundings. \u201cWelcome to my playground,\u201d Mr. Lee said on a recent afternoon, as he tended a pot of soup. He was trained as a chemical engineer in South Korea; his wife was a nurse. They went on to run a wholesale trimmings business in the Los Angeles fashion district for 20 years. This is only their latest life.With each order appears a small cup of kimchi. It varies by season; for winter, the elder Ms. Lee is making a gentler pickle of radish strands that can be eaten right away, without requiring prolonged fermentation. It\u2019s bracing, from a dose of vinegar, and bears telltale chile flakes. But what else is in there?Her daughter laughed. \u201cMy dad would say, \u2018You\u2019re asking way too many questions.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an Instagram Post Led to an N.F.L. Cheerleader\u2019s Discrimination Case", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike a lot of people in their 20s, Bailey Davis has an Instagram account. And as a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, Davis said, she followed team rules and made the page private so only people she approved could see what she posted.But when she posted a photo of herself in a one-piece outfit in January, Saints officials accused her, despite her protests, of breaking rules that prohibit cheerleaders from appearing nude, seminude or in lingerie. For this indiscretion, and amid an inquiry about her attending a party with Saints players \u2014 another regulation that she denies violating \u2014 Davis was fired after what she said were three largely trouble-free seasons.Now Davis has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces civil rights laws. The complaint accuses the Saints of having two sets of rules \u2014 one for the team\u2019s cheerleaders, who are all women, and another for its players.The complaint, which asserts that the rules in New Orleans reflect outdated views of women, follows a number of gender-related struggles in the N.F.L. over domestic violence and sexual harassment among players and league employees.According to the Saints\u2019 handbook for cheerleaders, as well as internal emails and text messages reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with Davis, the Saints have an anti-fraternization policy that requires cheerleaders to avoid contact with players, in person or online, even though players are not penalized for pursuing such engagement with cheerleaders. The cheerleaders must block players from following them on social media and cannot post photos of themselves in Saints gear, denying them the chance to market themselves. The players are not required to do any of these things.Cheerleaders are told not to dine in the same restaurant as players, or speak to them in any detail. If a Saints cheerleader enters a restaurant and a player is already there, she must leave. If a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player arrives afterward, she must leave. There are nearly 2,000 players in the N.F.L., and many of them use pseudonyms on social media. Cheerleaders must find a way to block each one, while players have no limits on who can follow them.The team says its rules are designed to protect cheerleaders from players preying on them. But it puts the onus on the women to fend off the men.\u201cIf the cheerleaders can\u2019t contact the players, then the players shouldn\u2019t be able to contact the cheerleaders,\u201d said Sara Blackwell, Davis\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe antiquated stereotype of women needing to hide for their own protection is not permitted in America and certainly not in the workplace.\u201dIt is not clear if the cheerleading squads of other N.F.L. teams have similar policies, though Blackwell said she had come across information suggesting the Saints were not alone.\u201cThe Saints organization strives to treat all employees fairly, including Ms. Davis,\u201d Leslie A. Lanusse, a lawyer who is representing the Saints, said in an email. \u201cAt the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum, the Saints will defend the organization\u2019s policies and workplace rules. For now, it is sufficient to say that Ms. Davis was not subjected to discrimination because of her gender.\u201dShe will have to deal with the E.E.O.C. complaint, as well as an arbitration hearing, which would precede a case filed in court.In past cases focusing on unfair pay for the cheerleaders, the league successfully asserted that cheerleaders were employees of the team rather than the league, so the N.F.L. was not culpable.The N.F.L. declined to comment about Davis\u2019s claims.The Davis case, though, centers on a fundamental league rule. The league\u2019s personal conduct policy, which applies to all N.F.L. personnel, prohibits \u201cany forms of unlawful discrimination in employment based on an individual\u2019s\u201d race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation, \u201cregardless of whether it occurs in the workplace or in other N.F.L.-sponsored settings.\u201dDavis argues that she qualifies as \u201cN.F.L. personnel\u201d and that the regulations that cheerleaders must follow violate that policy because they apply only to women. Legal experts say that she might prevail if the team cannot show why women need to be protected more than men.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for employers to discriminate against women and other groups protected by law,\u201d said Greg Simpson, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis who handles many E.E.O.C. cases. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if an employment policy or practice crosses the line if the policy doesn\u2019t single out women or minorities, but in practice has a harsher impact on them. These kinds of policies can still be legal if the employer shows it\u2019s necessary for the operation of their business.\u201dDavis is arguing that the restrictions go too far and that the Saints\u2019 enforcement of them is overly aggressive.\u201cThey\u2019ve been told that anything beyond \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018great game\u2019 is too personal,\u201d said Lora Davis, Bailey Davis\u2019s mother and a longtime choreographer for the squad, known as the Saintsations. \u201cIt\u2019s considered fraternization to say anything beyond that.\u201dNow 22, Davis was told by another cheerleader of rumors that she was seen at a party where a player was also present. Team officials called a meeting to discuss the rumors. She denied being at the party, and the team told her it had no evidence she was there.She told her supervisors that she was contacted by players on social media, but did not respond to them. The team reminded Davis and the other cheerleaders to block players from following them on social media, and to all change their social media presence from public to private even though the players are not required to block cheerleaders from their accounts.\u201cIt bothers me that they tell me the players know who you are because you\u2019re a pretty girl, you\u2019re on the field with them all the time, but then it\u2019s my fault because my Instagram was public,\u201d Davis said.Davis made her Instagram page private to prevent unauthorized people from viewing it. She later posted a photo of herself in a one-piece outfit. The team acquired a copy of the photo and told her that although the page was private, it still violated team rules regarding cheerleaders\u2019 attire.Davis was fired four days later.She does not expect to get her job back, and says she still likes football and the Saints. She has been a cheerleader since junior high school, and used to accompany her mother to Saintsations practices. She routinely drove two hours from her home in Hattiesburg, Miss., where she is going to college, to get to Saintsations practices, and to off-field appearances.Saintsations are allowed to work for the team for only four years. Davis will not be able to work her fourth year, when she would have received $10.25 an hour, or $3 above the minimum wage in Louisiana. But in filing her discrimination case, she said she wanted the team to help other cheerleaders by forcing the team to change its rules so all employees were treated equally.\u201cI\u2019m doing this for them so they can do what they love and feel protected and empowered, and be a female athlete and not be pushed to the side and feeling unimportant,\u201d Davis said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uncovering Instagram Bots With a New Kind of Detective Work", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a sunny office in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, Mike Schmidt spends his time ferreting out fake Instagram accounts.\u201cThe amount of bot activity that\u2019s happening on these platforms is pretty insane,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cJust the amount of new accounts and times these folks are liking and commenting with spam and positive comments and happy-face emojis.\u201dDovetale, a four-person software company Mr. Schmidt co-founded in 2016, has devised a range of tactics to identify large numbers of fake accounts that follow popular Instagram personalities. It then packages that information for marketers, who are increasingly skeptical of the audience numbers that often determine how much money social media stars can command from advertisers.\u201cWe knew this kind of day of reckoning would come,\u201d said Erick Schwab, the co-founder of Sylo, which vets influencers for fraud and aims to assign a numerical score to their content akin to a Nielsen rating. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten tons of brands, agencies, vendors emailing us, who we\u2019ve been having conversations with for a while, but now they\u2019re sort of like, this is being demanded.\u201dThe interest in such firms reflects how easy it is to fake popularity on platforms like Instagram, where bots seem to run unchecked even on accounts where people have not paid for them. While many advertisers have become aware of this, and tried to place more emphasis on content quality or favorable comments, follower numbers still tend to loom large.That means new kinds of detective work are needed for brands that still want the endorsements of the young and hip online. Dovetale said it uses more than 50 metrics to analyze the Instagram followers of popular accounts, including the language in the bios, the rate at which they hit \u201clike\u201d and \u201cfollow,\u201d and their country of origin. (An influencer with a high number of followers from Turkey, Brazil and China, for instance, can raise red flags for Dovetale, which has frequently seen fake followers come from those countries.)Dovetale acknowledged that its methods were not foolproof, but they are valuable enough in a murky landscape that the agency 360i said it was now unlikely to hire influencers for campaigns if Dovetale\u2019s database said more than 2 to 3 percent of their followers were bots. Dovetale said that, on average, 16.4 percent of the followers on Instagram\u2019s top 20 accounts were fraudulent.\u201cIn the absence of direct pressure on the platforms, it\u2019s a way for advertisers to take more control of their own spend and not be at the mercy of the platforms themselves,\u201d said Jeff Semones, head of social media at MediaCom, which has recommended Sylo to clients. While he said Instagram had removed many accounts that were flagrantly violating its terms and conditions, \u201ca lot of one-off activity goes unchecked.\u201dA spokeswoman for Instagram said that the platform\u2019s \u201cinternal estimates show that spam accounts make up a small fraction\u201d of Instagram\u2019s 800 million monthly users.Some believe that the new awareness around bots highlights the misguided expectations that marketers have for how many people they can reach through influencers.Tyler Stark, director of marketing at Traeger Grills, said that many influencers, particularly on Facebook, reach only 2 percent of their audience. That has made smaller influencers more appealing and put a focus on engagement, he said, with the thought that a post with a large number of likes and comments will end up in the feeds of more people.Still, Bob Gilbreath, chief executive of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said that he recently heard a major retailer recommend that brands work only with influencers who have at least 200,000 followers.\u201cMost brands would say that a follower is someone who\u2019s definitely going to see the post,\u201d Mr. Gilbreath said. \u201cNot only are most people not seeing the posts even if they\u2019re real people, but many of them are not real people.\u201dSoapbox Influencer Marketing, a company that connects brands with influencers, features a case study on its website for a new hummus from Bush\u2019s Beans. The site claims that the campaign, which featured 519 influencer posts, resulted in a whopping 891 million impressions \u2014 nearly triple the American population.When asked about the figure, Beth Stephens, the company\u2019s president, said it was \u201cincorrectly listed on our website and needs to be corrected.\u201d She added that Bush\u2019s Beans also worked with \u201ca number of other influence and social service providers,\u201d making it difficult for Soapbox to directly assess the figure. Bush\u2019s Beans didn\u2019t return requests for comment.Others tout the \u201ctotal reach\u201d of fashion and food influencers on their websites. In other types of media and Instagram\u2019s own business analytics, \u201creach\u201d refers to the number of different people who actually saw an ad. But in influencer marketing, it often refers to an aggregation of followers across platforms and can even include monthly unique visitors to blogs.Mr. Gilbreath is still a proponent of the work that comes out of social media mavens, but has instead focused on hiring creative \u201cmicro\u201d influencers with 10,000 or more followers. The firm pays to promote their recipes or tips and tracks subsequent visits to their websites, he said, adding that the data is otherwise too unreliable.Corey Martin, head of influencer marketing at 360i, said that the agency was increasingly paying Instagram to promote posts from influencers, which allows the agency to \u201ctrack and trace consumer behavior in a way we previously hadn\u2019t.\u201dSome hope for more action from Instagram, especially since it plans to restrict access to some of its data later this year, which may impede the work of bot-hunters like Dovetale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hi Hi Good Morning Hi I Love You It\u2019s Me", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 I remember exactly when the messages began in earnest.In January 2017, on a visit back to Guyana, the former British colony where I was born, I casually revealed to my distant cousins that I was on WhatsApp.I had spent years away, going to college and navigating adulthood in New York. We promised to stay in touch. We were family, bonded. No separations could break that.Soon after I returned home to New York, the first message landed with a \u201cPING!\u201d at full volume, a few hours after I had drifted off, exhausted from a hectic night in the newsroom.It read: \u201cGm.\u201dAt first I was startled. I was in a different time zone and worked weird hours. No one had contacted me from the 592 country code that late before via text. I snatched the glowing phone off a chair beside the bed and tapped out a reply.\u201cHiya. Everything good?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cOK!\u201dI stared at my phone almost cockeyed for a good long while, waiting for the true purpose of the message to reveal itself. But that was it: \u201cGm.\u201dThe messages came at odd times. They landed in someone\u2019s morning, but never in mine. At first, they set off a rush of anxiety. I had been primed to expect nothing good when the phone jangles, rings or pings.After I moved away from my mother\u2019s home in Brooklyn, picking up the phone meant being rocked by news of death, accidents, floods and other calamities. In Guyana, the sun is so hot it bites at your skin, the food is so good it puts you in a carb coma \u2014 and people can leave this earth in dramatic fashion.Sometimes while riding without a helmet on a moped or on the back of a donkey cart. Sometimes as a passenger in an S.U.V. facing an oncoming minibus crammed with people and careening madly down the wrong side of the road (the right lane) and trying to switch to the right side (the left) at the last minute.It makes for memorable funerals where men drink XM or El Dorado rum, slamming dominoes and sharing stories about what a bastard the deceased was. Where women wail and toss their bodies into the hole at the cemetery, or faint \u2014 with flair \u2014 on the coffin.But such losses are devastatingly final.I learned of my mother\u2019s death from a call to Miami that struck me dumb for five hours \u2014 trauma that was strangely similar to the time a sleeping dog bit me over the eye and I went blind for a day. I learned my maternal grandmother would never wake up again when my sister sobbed hysterically at me over the phone \u2014 she was alone with the body in Brooklyn.New technology doesn\u2019t dull the shocking thud of bad news; it just speeds it through a slick new medium. But now, I got:\u201cGm\u201d\u201cGday\u201d\u201cGood day\u201dFull stop.The only obvious solution to the tyranny of \u201cGm\u201d was to change the alert sound to a gentler \u201cswoosh.\u201dWhen I moved to London, I flagged the five-hour time difference to my cousins. Didn\u2019t matter. The messages popped up on Facebook.\u201cGm\u201dWe\u2019ve always had powerful stories to tell. My grandmother entranced the children with tales of Brer Anansi, the clever spider from African folklore. My grandfather read aloud newspaper stories rife with intrigue and horror. An opposition politician's head was found in a car trunk. A woman tried to pour hot oil down the ear of her cheating husband while he slept. The Rev. Jim Jones sent more than 900 souls to the Promised Land with poisoned Flavor Aid.But now, the family vine says:\u201cBeautiful woman of God!!\u201d\u201cEnjoy your day!!\u201dBy calling, I had raised the stakes. A flood of missed calls began appearing on my muted phone at work.\u201cYou called me?\u201d\u201cYes\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cNothing\u201d\u201cOh. I\u2019m at work.\u201d\u201cOk\u201d\u201cEverything ok?\u201d\u201cYes\u201dLate last year, I returned for a visit and reconnected with a cousin who had jousted on WhatsApp. I tried to talk cricket, Messi, Bae. But the smart aleck who had a riposte for every comment online plopped down on a sofa and disappeared into her phone.I peered at her sideways, and it dawned on me: We are different species.I\u2019m a former letter writer whose handwriting admittedly now looks as if someone had dipped a beetle into ink and let it loose on the page. She prefers texting someone in the same room. I left discombobulated.But soon after I returned home, the patter resumed and \u2014 lo \u2014 something approaching a conversation unfolded:\u201cGm\u201d\u201cHey\u201d\u201cAdopt me\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPeople adopt grown children\u201d\u201cBut aren\u2019t you \u2026 in university??\u201d\u201csooo?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re fighting with your mum, right\u201d\u201cMm-m\u201dAt some point, my number made its way to relatives so distant I would not recognize them if they passed me on the street.\u201cGm\u2019s\u201d piled up. So did Christmas and New Year\u2019s greetings. Epic GIFs and memes: shiny angels, naked, leering cherubs, dancing Goofys.Most important, after years of receiving shattering news by phone, should I not revel in the banal glory of a \u201cGm\u201d?Then, the chain messages landed.Most had a blessing and a curse: Send it to 20 others \u2014 or else.Blessings I\u2019m thankful for. But chain messages are the leeches of social media: They feed off loyalty, friendship and guilt.I lost it.Whole sentences were typed. Exclamation points were hurled. Threats were made. You can\u2019t choose your relatives, but surely you can block \u2019em.I call it deliverance.Advertisement"}

Ugly, but it could be a good entry point. It gives you time to try out some tough measures aimed at improving Deutsche Bank\u2019s performance. Even if those moves produce near-term losses, the stock may not dive, given how far it\u2019s already fallen.Then you look at the strength of Deutsche Bank\u2019s capital, as expressed by a regulatory measure called the common equity tier 1 capital ratio. That\u2019s at 14 percent, a solid-looking level, achieved in part by an \u20ac8 billion equity raise last year. In theory, you have something to spend on your chosen plans.But then you realize that Deutsche Bank\u2019s share price is now back at the level at which the bank sold those shares. Shareholders must be livid. Not only that, Deutsche Bank\u2019s stock market value is less than 40 percent of its net worth as stated on its balance sheet (its stock price is \u20ac11.30 and its book value per share is \u20ac30.16.) When a company trades at a hefty discount to its net worth, it either needs to raise a lot of new capital, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at Deutsche Bank, or investors have serious doubts about the company\u2019s business model.\u201cSo, I\u2019ll rejig the bank\u2019s business model,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthat\u2019s what new C.E.O.\u2019s do!\u201dYou look for ways and stumble upon an unavoidable obstacle. Deutsche Bank is heavily dependent on Wall Street revenue, which can be far more unpredictable than revenue from other businesses. Last year, revenue from Deutsche Bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank, which has struggled to keep up with its peers, accounted for 54 percent of the bank\u2019s overall revenue. Compare that with JPMorgan Chase, whose investment bank accounted for a third of its revenue last year. And you are stuck with the Wall Street operations; no one wants to buy an investment bank with \u20ac1.2 trillion in assets.Maybe you can cut costs, another go-to tactic of an incoming C.E.O. Indeed, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank employees seem better paid than their counterparts at other firms. Going by a back of the envelope calculation, the unit\u2019s compensation expense is equivalent to 44 percent of its revenue (excluding the interest the investment bank earns on its assets.) That\u2019s higher than the 39 percent ratio for JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank last year, and 41 percent for Goldman Sachs. Maybe you could slash the pay of bankers and traders.\u2014 Peter EavisThe roller coaster ride in tech continues.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 3 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 fell 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent.Tech companies in the S.&P. 500 tech sector slid 3.4 percent, the steepest decline among the index\u2019s 11 main sectors.Chip makers were among the hardest hit on the day.

Enthusiasm about the technology sector had long propelled stock markets to new heights. But the specter of intensifying regulation of the industry has taken the sheen off. Last week tech stocks dragged the broader markets to their worst week in more than two years. The selling took a break on Monday as the S.&P. 500\u2019s tech sector rose 4 percent pushing the index to its best day in almost three years.Contenders for the post should address one question: What will you do to clean up the culture at banks?William C. Dudley, the outgoing president of the New York Fed, had made improving the culture at the firms he oversaw a key initiative of his tenure of at the institution.Mr. Dudley had also pressed banks\u2019 boards of directors to focus on ethical culture. On Monday, he said the boards had set up separate committees to focus on culture and conduct. \u201cWe\u2019ve made part of the journey but I think more could be done,\u201d Mr. Dudley said. Whether it will, depends on who steps into his shoes.\u2014 Peter EavisThe yield curve is near its flattest level since the financial crisis. The difference between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes is at 0.52 percentage points, not far off its post-crisis low of 0.50 percentage points hit in January.That has some asking if the nine-year-old economic recovery is at risk.Since the end of World War II, no barometer has done a better job of predicting a recession than the yield curve. A flattening yield curve tends to indicate slowing economic growth in the near future. But what is more worrisome is if the yield curve goes beyond flattening and into outright inversion.The chances of a recession when the yield curve is flattening is just 20 percent, according to the calculations of Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. That jumps to 72 percent when the curve inverts.\u201cUnless the yield curve actually inverts, however, the probability of recession remains quite low. While a flatter curve may have implications for the pace of future economic growth, it does not materially raise recession risk.\u201dThere is another reason not to be too concerned about a flattening yield curve, and it has to do with the actions of central banks around the world. The unprecedented stimulus from the Fed, Bank of Japan and E.C.B. have brought down long-term rates. That means the yield curve might not be the predictor it once was.A week after a self-driving Uber vehicle hit and killed a woman in Arizona, the fallout continues to spread.\u201cUltimately A.V.s will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue.

Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\u201dNvidia is just the latest company to halt tests on self-driving cars in the wake of the accident in Arizona. Toyota, nuTonomy and Uber have all already done so.Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote:\u201cNvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being.

{"Headline": "Lamb Shanks, Sweetly Spiced and Ready for Spring", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenSturdy, earthy lamb shanks are worthy vehicles for any number of seasonal flavors and preparations, whether a dark mix of mushrooms and red wine, or lighter, brighter citrus notes.Personally, I like them boiled. Well, not boiled exactly, but simmered in a pot of water on the stove.You may have been taught that lamb shanks must first be browned, then slowly braised \u2014 a fine way to cook them. But you can also get wonderful results skipping that first step. For instance, I have seen some recipes that call for a single lamb shank added to a long-cooked vegetable soup, just as you would with a ham hock or a few chicken legs to add meatiness.But for something bigger \u2014 a hearty main course \u2014 I first season the shanks with salt and pepper, cover them with water in a large pot, toss in a few aromatics, and let it all simmer gently for an hour and a half or so, until the meat is tender. In the process, the water becomes a delicious broth, which is then used to make a sauce.However, a whole, bone-in shank on a dinner plate can look gargantuan, even intimidating. So, once the shanks are tender, I like to pull the cooked meat off. The finished dish, thus tamed, can seem more civilized, less Stone Age. You can do this several hours before completing the dish, up to a day or two in advance.Rather than a deep, wintry braise, I wanted something lighter for the beginning of spring. Opting for orange and honey, along with a few sweet spices, like clove, coriander and a touch of saffron, seemed right. The zest of one orange, peeled in wide strips, and a half-cup of orange juice proved to be plenty for an intense back note. A splash of white wine also supplied acidity.A shower of freshly snipped herbs \u2014 dill, mint, parsley, basil \u2014 brightens the dish just before serving. A bouquet of butter-steamed spring vegetables (carrots and turnips for now, peas and asparagus tips soon) is a welcome accompaniment.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption accompanying this article misstated the preparation method for the carrots and turnips. They are steamed with butter. They are not browned in it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deadly Storm Fells Trees, Causing Travel Woes and Power Outages", "Date": "2018-03-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe heavy, wet snow that piled up in a hurry on Wednesday toppled trees onto highways, railroad tracks and power lines, leaving thousands of homes in the New York metropolitan area without electricity and many commuters unable to get to work on Thursday.A New York woman and a New Jersey man also died in weather-related incidents, the authorities said.Fallen trees blocked some lines on New Jersey Transit and Metro-North Railroad, shutting them down for a full day after the storm passed. Other rail lines operated on reduced schedules while crews trudged through more than a foot of snow to repair signals and untangle overhead lines.Nearly 250,000 utility customers in New Jersey still lacked electricity on Thursday afternoon, according to the governor, Phil D. Murphy, who was clearly irritated by the rate of repairs. Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said state regulators would review the responses to the storm by the state\u2019s four biggest utilities, but he singled out Jersey Central Power & Light, which still had not restored power to 17,000 customers who lost electricity in a nor\u2019easter that hit nearly a week ago.The governor said that deep frustration with the company\u2019s performance had \u201cturned to anger on my part\u201d and he questioned JCP & L\u2019s \u201ccorporate preparedness.\u201d He noted that JCP & L had more than 120,000 customers without power at midday on Thursday, compared with about 80,000 for the state\u2019s largest utility, Newark-based Public Service Electric & Gas.On JCP & L\u2019s Facebook page, one customer complained that he was enduring the third weeklong loss of power since 2011 and he blamed the company for failing to invest enough in its network. A company spokesman responded that JCP & L, which is owned by Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corporation, spends millions of dollars annually and had recently announced a plan to invest $357 million in its infrastructure this year.In Putnam County, north of New York City, more than 13,000 customers \u2014 about one-third of New York State Electric and Gas\u2019s customers there \u2014 had no electricity on Thursday afternoon. Some of them had only recently regained power after losing it in Friday\u2019s storm.The last two snowstorms have fallen particularly hard on the suburbs north and northeast of the city, where overhead power lines are vulnerable to high winds, heavy, wet snow and toppled trees.After suspending all service on Wednesday night, Metro-North sent 146 workers out across its network to remove 69 fallen trees, using chain saws and muscle, said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. More than 31 of those trees were among the reasons that the Danbury and New Canaan branches of the railroad in Connecticut were shut down on Thursday, Mr. Donovan said.Along Metro-North\u2019s Harlem Line, 13 power poles were damaged on Wednesday between Brewster and Goldens Bridge. The poles held up the cables that carried electricity to the trains and the track-side signals.In contrast, the Long Island Rail Road, also operated by the transportation authority, never shut down and was running a nearly normal schedule on Thursday, he said.In New Jersey, the Morris & Essex and Montclair-Boonton rail lines of New Jersey Transit remained suspended all day on Thursday. The railroad gradually restored service on its Main-Bergen County line after the morning rush.\u201cThe worst things we are dealing with are the hundreds of trees that we are trying to get off our tracks and overhead wires,\u201d said Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit. Ms. Snyder said that in some places in the western and northern areas of the state, crews had to contend with snow nearly two feet deep. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to restore service as quickly and safely as we possibly can,\u201d she said.Mr. Murphy said he was pleased there had not been more fatalities, despite the power failures and the hundreds of cars that were stranded on highways. In Franklin Lakes, N.J., on Thursday morning, a man drove around barricades and across a live power line that sparked a fire that incinerated his car, killing him, the police said.In New York, Barbara Soleski, an 88-year-old resident of Suffern, N.Y., was killed when a tree fell on her in her yard at about 5 p.m. on Wednesday, the Suffern Police Department reported on its Facebook page.Col. Patrick Callahan, of the New Jersey State Police, said avoiding additional deaths or serious injuries was \u201ca pretty phenomenal feat.\u201d He said the State Police had deployed a strike team of 50 troopers and sent out helicopters and snowmobiles to rescue stranded drivers and passengers on interstate highways.\u201cIt was a phenomenal storm,\u201d Colonel Callahan said. \u201cWhen you have troopers on snowmobiles on an interstate highway, that\u2019s a phenomenal storm.\u201dStill, New Jersey officials said they would investigate whether utility companies had complied with rules laid down after Hurricane Sandy and other storms that passed through the state about five years ago. In their wake, regulators demanded that the companies improve their storm preparedness, including the pruning of trees near power lines to reduce the risk of failures.\u201cVegetation management is always a problem,\u201d said Joseph L.

{"Headline": "Using Digital Firm, Brexit Campaigners Skirted Spending Laws, Ex-Employee Says", "Date": "2018-03-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Two senior advisers to Prime Minister Theresa May might have conspired to bypass electoral spending laws when they were leading a campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, a former employee of their effort said this week, in an interview and in testimony he gave to the country\u2019s elections regulator.The allegations led to a heated exchange, conducted in the British news media, involving allegations of hard feelings over an old romance and of the deliberate outing by the prime minister\u2019s office, No. 10 Downing Street, of the former employee as gay.The former employee, Shahmir Sanni, said in the interview and in a witness statement submitted to the regulator, the Electoral Commission, that the two advisers had funneled more than $900,000 in campaign spending through a puppet organization that they had set up. They did so, he said, by paying the money to a digital advertising firm that was indirectly linked to the Trump campaign and also worked on the push to exit the European Union.The allegations are the latest of many raised on both sides of the referendum about the possible diversion of money through allied organizations to get around funding limits on each of them, and campaign finance experts said the multitude of such claims pointed to holes and ambiguities in the regulations that governed the referendum.In response, one of the two Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson, said that Vote Leave had adhered to all relevant laws. Mr. Parkinson also suggested that Mr. Sanni was lashing out because the two had \u201cdated for 18 months, before splitting up \u2014 I thought amicably \u2014 in September 2017.\u201dHe said he had not spoken to Mr. Sanni as a supervisor from the Vote Leave campaign, but as a friend. \u201cThat is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him,\u201d Mr. Parkinson said in the statement, \u201cbut I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups.\u201dThe other adviser, Cleo Watson, could not be reached for comment.Mr. Sanni said his relationship with Mr. Parkinson had been a short fling that started after the referendum. In a statement, he said the disclosure of his sexual orientation had endangered his family, who live in Pakistan, and he accused Mr. Parkinson of intimidation.\u201cI never imagined that he, with the help of No. 10, would choose to tell the world I am gay, in a last, desperate attempt to scare me,\u201d Mr. Sanni said.His lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said in a statement, \u201cWe believe this is the first time a Downing Street official statement has been used to out someone.\u201dBritish campaign finance experts said the allegations about Vote Leave underscored the porousness and ineffectiveness of rules on spending around referendums like the vote in 2016 to exit the European Union.\u201cThey were useless,\u201d said Justin Fisher, a professor of political science at Brunel University London who has studied the regulations for the Electoral Commission, which oversees elections and regulates political finance in Britain.Multiple organizations, each with its own spending limit, were allowed to campaign in parallel on either side of the referendum issue, and they were allowed to work together in ill-defined ways, allowing donors on either side many ways to sidestep spending limits, Mr. Fisher noted.The rules \u201chad never really been tested before because we never had a referendum of any consequence before,\u201d Mr. Fisher said, noting that in total the supporters of remaining in the European Union had outspent the advocates of leaving.Mr. Sanni\u2019s allegations have come to light because of a tangle of connections to an online consulting company with ties to the campaign that elected President Trump \u2014 Cambridge Analytica.The Vote Leave campaign relied heavily for online ad placement on a Canadian company called AggregateIQ, which according to documents and testimony submitted to the Electoral Commission by Mr. Wylie was a satellite business set up to support Cambridge Analytica.Public filings also show that Vote Leave provided virtually the entire $990,000 budget of BeLeave \u2014 625,000 pounds \u2014 which took the form of additional spending paid directly to AggregateIQ.As Mr. Wylie was coming forward with his disclosures about Cambridge Analytica, he encouraged his friend Mr. Sanni to come forward with his claims about Vote Leave and BeLeave as well.Testimony and documents provided by Mr. Wylie in his filing to the Electoral Commission show that AggregateIQ was founded in 2013 in discussion with executives at Cambridge Analytica\u2019s parent company, initially licensed all its software from that company, and for a time received virtually all its income from the company.In a statement this week, Jeff Silvester, one of the founders of AggregateIQ, said it was a \u201cdigital advertising, web and software development company\u201d and \u201chas never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.\u201dMr. Silvester did not address the company\u2019s work for Vote Leave and BeLeave. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request for comment.An initial investigation by the Electoral Commission found nothing improper in the relationship between the two organizations, but a court appeal last fall prompted the commission to reopen its inquiry. Mr. Sanni\u2019s testimony is additional information recently submitted to that ongoing inquiry.He and Mr. Wylie also gave the commission records showing that anyone at Vote Leave continued to have access to the Google Drive used for BeLeave\u2019s strategy, planning and internal discussion after the referendum, on June 23, 2016.Mr. Sanni graduated from the University of East Anglia at the end of 2015, and began volunteering the next March for the Vote Leave campaign. He worked with a small team of young volunteers in what was then a unit of Vote Leave called BeLeave that tried to craft messages to turn young and liberal people against the European Union by arguing, for example, that it closed doors to the non-European world.The small BeLeave team initially worked in the same office as Vote Leave and under the oversight of its senior staff, including Mr. Parkinson and Ms. Watson, as did two AggregateIQ employees managing the campaign\u2019s online advertising, Mr. Sanni testified to the commission.By mid-May, however, with the referendum little more than a month away, the Vote Leave campaign was nearing its spending cap.At about the same time, the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign instructed their lawyers to draw up a charter for BeLeave to become an independent group. Mr. Sanni was named its secretary and research director while another friend, Darren Grimes, was named its principal and campaign director.Mr. Sanni told the commission he was surprised to learn that the leaders of Vote Leave had also decided to direct $900,000 to BeLeave, given that it was overseen by two unpaid, inexperienced people: He and Mr. Grimes were then both 22. But then his friend Mr. Grimes explained that virtually all of that money would be paid directly to AggregateIQ for online advertising.In practice, Mr. Sanni said, nothing changed. The BeLeave staff continued to work inside the Vote Leave office. The senior officials of Vote Leave continued to approve their messages. And the same AggregateIQ workers continued to place BeLeave\u2019s online advertisements while providing the same service to Vote Leave.\u201cWe never saw ourselves as a separate organization from the get-go,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in an interview, echoing his testimony. \u201cWe were just volunteers.\u201dThe money paid to AggregateIQ for online advertising produced few results for BeLeave \u2014 1,164 email sign-ups and 1,005 mobile phone numbers for more than $900,000 \u2014 leading Mr. Sanni to suspect the money may have gone to promote the larger Vote Leave campaign instead.He insisted in the interview that the reason he provided testimony to the commission was not about any past feelings for Mr. Parkinson, now at No. 10.Instead, he said, it was out of concern for Mr. Grimes, the other young volunteer. By making Mr. Grimes the nominal owner of BeLeave, the leaders of Vote Leave had made him a target of critical news coverage and potential legal claims, Mr. Sanni argued. \u201cHe is getting thrown to the dogs,\u201d Mr. Sanni said. \u201cEverything I am doing is to protect Darren.\u201d\u201cI now feel sick about what happened,\u201d Mr. Sanni said in his testimony. The officials of Vote Leave \u201cused two 22-year-olds to cheat in the referendum.\u201dMr. Grimes did not respond to messages seeking comment.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 How foreign is Broadcom?\u2022 The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House.\u2022 The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs.\u2022 Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer.Beyond Broadcom\u2019s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let\u2019s take a look at a number of factors.SalesFirst, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it: \u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201dEmployeesCorporate governanceThe vast majority of Broadcom\u2019s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years.Hock Tan, the company\u2019s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990.Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore\u2019s corporate rules.OwnershipThe two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard.\u2014 Michael de la MercedMore on Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday:It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?Maybe not.The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.- Peter EavisFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201dWhat are those tailwinds?\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201dMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote: \u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201dBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote: \u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201dWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote: \u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201dBut he adds:\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201dTo some, that seemed like good timing.\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201dThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs eitherThe proposed combination is the latest in a series of mergers in the rapidly consolidating seed and agrochemical sector.\u2014 Chad BrayMr. Rosenberg had a long career in government: twice U.S. attorney, he\u2019s been a longtime senior official at the Justice Department (including as chief of staff to James Comey) and acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching today:\u2022 Is Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, planning on stepping down?\u2022 The list of those hoping Broadcom fails in its pursuit of Qualcomm keeps growing.\u2022 When will wage growth pick up?\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren has some questions for Apollo and Citi.\u2022 How much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\u2022 The Trump tariffs have many exceptions..But some important context is necessary: Neither Mr. Blankfein nor the board has set a timeline for him to step down, people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Blankfein has not discussed the possibility of leaving at the end of the year, these people said, though there is a general view that he likely would retire in the next couple of years. And it is very possible that this story may force Mr. Blankfein to move faster to explicitly lay out a timeline than he had originally planned.Is it possible that Mr. Blankfein would step down at the end of 2018?Sure. It is absolutely a possibility, these people said. But it is hardly a certainty. And it is also a possibility that he could step down as C.E.O. but remain chairman, the people said.Is it possible that he could still be at Goldman for part or all of 2019?Sure, these people said. But that\u2019s not a certainty either.Is it possible he is at Goldman in 2020? \u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinHere\u2019s Mr. Blankfein\u2019s response to the WSJ story:The order President Trump signed on Thursday imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum provided him with wiggle room to exempt countries down the road.Well, that seems like more of possibility now.The Wall Street Journal reports that Intel \u201cis considering a range of acquisition alternatives in reaction to Broadcom\u2019s hostile pursuit for Qualcomm.\u201dThose options include a possible bid for Broadcom, the WSJ reports citing anonymous sources.Shares of Broadcom jumped 5 percent after hours.Details from the WSJ\u2022 Intel is worried about the competitive threat a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would pose.\u2022 Intel has been weighing its options since late last year and has engaged advisers.\u2022 Intel might make a bid if Broadcom looks likely to succeed in its pursuit of Qualcomm.Caveats\u2022 Any move from Intel is far from certain and one of WSJ\u2019s sources said it is unlikely.ContextWashington isn\u2019t so sure a merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm is a good idea. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of QualcommThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy. In practice, reviews by Cfius often lead to the demise of deals.Here are the numbers:\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.ContextThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.Investors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.The 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.The economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.In theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.But investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\u2014 Peter EavisIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.Maybe we can shed some light.As Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.But the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.One way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.But our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.How did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?One easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.My calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201dWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?By my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.Can we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?Yes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.Let me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.If you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.ContextThe New York Times reported last week that: \u2022 Josh Harris, a founder of Apollo Global Management, was advising Trump administration on infrastructure policy last year and met with Mr. Kushner several times. Among other things, the two men discussed a possible White House job for Mr. Harris, which never materialized. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies. The loan was to refinance the mortgage on a Chicago skyscraper\u2022 Michael Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.Stephanie Clifford of the NYT reported:Prosecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.Ben Sisario of the NYT writes:There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso.But what is it worth?The answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them.

{"Headline": "Computer Chip Visionaries Win Turing Award", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 1980, Dave Patterson, a computer science professor, looked at the future of the world\u2019s digital machines and saw their limits.This counterintuitive idea spread across Silicon Valley, driven by the work of Mr. Patterson at the University of California in Berkeley and a second academic, John Hennessy, about 40 miles away at Stanford University. They called it RISC, short for \u201creduced instruction set computer.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the venerable computing society that represents industry professionals across the world, announced that Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy had won this year\u2019s Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing. They will share a $1 million cash prize.Today, more than 99 percent of all new chips use the RISC architecture, according to the association.\u201cThis is the one fundamental idea that has been sustained over the last several decades of chip design,\u201d said Dave Ditzel, a chip industry veteran who studied with Mr. Patterson at Berkeley. Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.\u201cComplexity is even more of an enemy than it was before,\u201d Mr. Ditzel said. \u201cWe have to design differently.\u201dMr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy are at the heart of this change. Their book is now in its sixth edition. Mr. Hennessy is on the board of directors of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, after serving as the president of Stanford for 16 years. And Mr. Patterson works in the Google research lab that is designing low-powered chips specifically for artificial intelligence.As time goes on, the world could move even more toward the RISC way of doing things, thanks to an organization called the RISC-V Foundation, which has published a chip architecture that anyone can use for free, said industry veteran Dennis Allison. The organization was founded by Dave Patterson and others from Berkeley.\u201cI expect this to play a vital role in the future,\u201d Mr. Patterson said. \u201cAnd the architecture is not that different from what John and I described back in 1980.\u201dFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetzAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Planned Digital Tax Heightens Tensions With U.S.", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions \u2014 and the dueling tax efforts \u2014 stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.\u201cTax and trade have basically merged\u201d as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.\u201cWe think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. \u201cIt is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.\u201d\u201cThere are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,\u201d Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that \u201cthese countries don\u2019t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.\u201dThe European Union\u2019s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.The European Commission\u2019s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top \u20ac50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc\u2019s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.\u201cThe taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,\u201d said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. \u201cSome member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.\u201dAs the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president\u2019s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington\u2019s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "A Crisp Cool-Weather Twist for a Classic Summer Salad", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenA satisfying salad of tuna and beans is a Mediterranean favorite, often served as a meal in warm weather. In my favorite version, the main ingredients \u2014 rich tuna and creamy beans \u2014 are accented with red wine vinegar, tomato and onion, finished with a flourish of extra-virgin olive oil.At the moment, with no ripe tomatoes on the horizon, I offer this cool-weather variation, which features thinly sliced raw fennel, and fresh tuna seared in a cast-iron skillet. Using best-quality canned tuna is certainly an option, but the texture and flavor are quite different. While fresh tuna may be a bit of a splurge and take longer to prepare, the divine results are worth the cost.Tuna is expensive, but you don\u2019t need much: 2 to 4 ounces per serving is plenty. So your salad can be bean heavy or tuna heavy, depending upon how flush you\u2019re feeling; it will be delicious either way. The main thing is to get the seasoning right. After salting it, I like to coat the fish with a generous amount of crushed fennel seed and black pepper. If I have it on hand, I\u2019ll amp up the floral flavor with a little dried fennel pollen.To sear the tuna, get a cast-iron pan scorching hot. The cooking takes only about two minutes per side. I want the tuna to be quite rare, nearly raw at the center, but feel free to cook it more if you like. Or follow the New York chef Jody Williams, who serves a tuna and bean salad I admire at her restaurant Via Carota; it is made with diced raw tuna.For the fennel, look for smooth, pale green bulbs that are not too big, with the feathery fronds still attached. Trim the fennel, removing the outer layer if it seems tough. Slice the fennel very thinly, with a sharp knife or mandoline, just before serving the salad. Dress it at the last minute with a lemony-garlicky vinaigrette, and arrange it over the room-temperature beans and tuna.Of course, you can make this salad year-round. In the summer, the tuna can be grilled over coals, and you can add tomatoes, roasted peppers and small green beans if you wish.But just now, the sweetness of crisp fennel is more than enough to welcome spring.And to drink ...Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office unsealed an indictment against the man, Kenneth Moore, charging him with crimes that included larceny, fraud, forgery and the unauthorized practice of a profession.Working from an office in Bushwick, prosecutors said, Mr. Moore, 53, of Queens, targeted inmates serving long sentences, sending them certified letters in which he offered to file post-conviction motions on their behalf. His victims included prisoners in New York, North Carolina, Kansas and Virginia and his pitch was simple, according to the indictment: Mr. Moore would ask the inmates\u2019 relatives to sign contracts with him and pay him 80 percent of his standard fee of $5,000 to $10,000 in advance of any work. But in 16 instances, prosecutors said, he never filed a motion. In two others, they added, Mr. Moore submitted fraudulent briefs, using the forged signature of a real attorney who had no idea the papers had been filed.In a \u201cparticularly egregious case,\u201d prosecutors said, Mr. Moore persuaded a defendant to hire him instead of using the Innocence Project, the well-regarded New York organization that was founded in 1992 to reverse wrongful convictions. Eric Gonzalez, the Brooklyn district attorney, said he took the conduct personally because his office has a special team devoted to wrongful convictions, the Conviction Review Unit, that has become a national model.\u201cThis case is especially reprehensible to me because in Brooklyn we have a robust Conviction Review Unit that takes wrongful conviction claims seriously,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement. \u201cThis defendant allegedly took advantage of that exemplary work by targeting vulnerable victims and exploiting the hope of inmates and their families that they might be released from custody.\u201dAt his arraignment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Tuesday, Mr. Moore pleaded not guilty and was ordered held on bond of $300,000 or $150,000 in cash.His case was brought at a moment when wrongful convictions have achieved a heightened cultural significance. After years of courtroom labor, documentaries like \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d and television shows like \u201cThe Night Of\u201d have made the issue a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the criminal-justice world, attracting the attention of a broad national audience.But as word of the problem has spread, so, too, have opportunities for people to use it for their own unscrupulous ends, said Paul Cates, a spokesman for the Innocence Project. Mr. Cates said that Mr. Moore\u2019s case was not the first time officials at the Innocence Project had heard of something similar, including instances when firms or individuals had used variations of their organization\u2019s name to boost their own credibility.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a widespread problem,\u201d Mr. Cates added, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely concerning.\u201dIn Mr. Moore\u2019s case, there seem to have been early hints that something wasn\u2019t right. On three occasions in 2016, people who said they hired him to help them or their loved ones posted messages on Yelp, claiming he had cheated them.In June that year, a woman from Highland, N.Y., who gave her name as Shanelle R., wrote on the site that she had \u201cmade about 6 payments\u201d to Mr. Moore, but never met him in person. \u201cWhen I confronted him about showing up to his office and they said he not there anymore, I lost contact with him,\u201d she wrote.Two months later, someone named Katrina M. from Garland, Tex., posted a similar message, warning others not to work with Mr. Moore.\u201cKenneth Moore pretends to be a lawyer that specializes in post conviction,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut he is not even licensed to practice law. He took over $6k from my family and in hopes of getting a loved one released.\u201dFollow Alan Feuer on Twitter: @alanfeuer Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Tomorrow Will Be Different\u2019 for the Transgender Community", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The most stirring moments in the memoir \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d are not those in which Sarah McBride is making public history, whether as American University\u2019s first transgender student body president or the first openly trans person to speak before a major party convention. They are the private moments: when her mother tells her that she feels as if her son is dying; when she unexpectedly falls in love; when she realizes that this transgender man she plans to spend the rest of her life with will die. It is when McBride \u2014 having lived her entire adult life in public as a trans advocate and budding political figure \u2014 is finally able to shed her public persona that her narrative is most resonant. By becoming a nuanced character in her own book, she humanizes the impossibly competent, morally unsullied ideal she seems on the surface.McBride acknowledges the difficulty of letting her guard down when she describes her advocacy of a Delaware trans rights bill before the State Senate in 2013: \u201cA few months before, displaying such vulnerability before that body seemed impossible, but through the last several months I had found my voice.\u201d There is a constant tension in the book between McBride\u2019s ingrained reliance on logic over emotions, and her efforts to break through these intellectual barriers to fully reveal herself, in her book and in the outside world.The memoir starts off with a moving history of McBride\u2019s profound inner conflict as a child: \u201cWhen the boys and girls would line up separately in kindergarten, I\u2019d find myself longing to be in the other line\u201d; \u201cas I\u2019d play in the Cinderella dress, the proverbial stroke of midnight would arrive. I\u2019d have to take it off and return to playing the part that I\u2019d already learned was more than just expected of me \u2014 it was \u2018me\u2019 to everyone else in my life.\u201d Her account of the day she comes out to her college community, in contrast, is more tentative. If the language feels timeworn (\u201cI couldn\u2019t hide anymore\u201d; and, once she posts her letter on Facebook, \u201cit didn\u2019t take long for the news to spread like wildfire\u201d), it evokes a narrative insecurity that mirrors the nervous self-doubt she experiences while actually living through her gender transition.By the time she finds herself arguing before the Delaware legislature, though, both McBride the character and the book\u2019s narrative voice have gained enough confidence to passionately convince their audiences of her lifelong cause. The debate scene comes alive through the specificity of McBride\u2019s prose. She recalls how some Republican lawmakers at first cast trans people as restroom predators, before becoming \u201cmore muted\u201d and \u201calmost sheepish\u201d in their opposition after her testimony, unable to fully vilify trans people after interacting with one. As McBride sits in tears on the Senate floor, State Senator Karen Peterson is the only one to comfort her \u2014 for Peterson, who is lesbian, recognizes \u201cthe indignity of having to plead for your most basic rights,\u201d McBride writes. The scene\u2019s pathos underlines the absurdity of having to debate anyone\u2019s right to a life free from discrimination.At the same time, these extended chapters on trans advocacy, teeming with data and policy details, feel shallower than those that develop the star-crossed romance between McBride and the young transgender rights advocate Andrew Cray. From his first appearance in the book, at President Obama\u2019s White House L.G.B.T. reception in 2012, the narrative intermingles the excitement of new love with the anticipation of its loss. \u201cI think we\u2019d get along pretty swimmingly,\u201d Cray messages McBride on Facebook two months after that encounter, his significance in her life already promising to be as noteworthy as his charming use of an adverb.Cray takes a central role in \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d only when a sore on his tongue turns out to be cancer, which later progresses to his lungs. As McBride cares for Cray, his illness seems to dismantle her walls of pragmatism and perfectionism. At one point she breaks down over a malfunctioning suction machine, falling to the floor in tears and shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d At another, she decides to spend Christmas with her parents instead of Cray, as much as she knows it will hurt him. These flaws \u2014 these moments where she appears least noble \u2014 are evidence of this exemplary woman\u2019s humanity.Cray himself also buoys these scenes with his particular blend of stubbornness and charm. He insists on remaining independent from his family through his illness, only to rely on McBride as his caregiver instead. And yet, as the 27-year-old man sits in the tub and asks, \u201cCan you wash my tush?\u201d in a playful acknowledgment of the infantilizing force of his disease, we understand his irreverence, and how McBride fell so deeply in love. This anxiety over death\u2019s cruel interruption of true love permeates her narrative of Cray\u2019s cancer, their wedding and his passing, which McBride narrates vividly and without the self-consciousness that is at times distancing elsewhere in the book.Meanwhile, trans identity in McBride and Cray\u2019s love story never becomes abstracted from experience. McBride\u2019s identity enables her specific life circumstances, but it cannot be reduced, codified or turned into a statistic like the one that says 41 percent of trans men and women have attempted suicide (a number the book cites more than once). Even if McBride and Cray\u2019s were the only trans relationship ever in which one person ended up a widow because of the other\u2019s cancer, their immediate connection \u2014 the authenticity and specificity of their love \u2014 is what inspires the greatest compassion for the universal trans experience, in all its nuance and diversity. The book\u2019s strength lies in its portrayal of McBride and Cray as fully realized individuals beyond their transgender identities.After Cray\u2019s death, however, McBride\u2019s narrative pivots swiftly back to politics without leaving either her or her readers sufficient space to grieve. This is a young woman who has just lost the love of her life at 24. It doesn\u2019t seem quite enough for her to merely add his name, as tribute, to the list of her accomplishments to date, or to merely participate in policies that Cray helped develop. It feels as though the compromises that become routine in McBride\u2019s advocacy \u2014 from her willingness to plead with outright bigots for her basic dignity, to her position at the Human Rights Campaign, a mainstream L.G.B.T. organization that has been criticized by the trans community for prioritizing gay marriage over trans rights \u2014 equally compromise her ability to give the reader an accurate picture of her own grief, which could have imbued \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d with the enduring quality of other memoirs of loss. With a foreword by former Vice President Joe Biden that frames the book as an instructive tome for trans people, parents and the general public, the book is perhaps positioned less as a lasting literary contribution and more as a manual for tolerance that puts its writer in a good position to run for office.The inconsistencies and contradictions in McBride\u2019s book reflect the difficulty of trying to explain the transgender experience to a predominantly cisgender public. Some trans readers (myself included) may find themselves growing impatient with the author\u2019s frequent quoting of dire statistics, or her Trans-101-style arguments for bathroom equality. Her case is too often predicated on the idea that the value of trans lives is even up for debate.I gravitate to the parts of McBride\u2019s memoir in which she relies instead on her sincere and singular identity \u2014 as a young widow who was raised as a boy surrounded by an environment of relative privilege despite inner turmoil \u2014 to continue her fight for justice. I want to believe that readers across the gender spectrum will be moved by the improbable commingling of two trans lives, and for the cruelty of having one of these lives taken away.And yet, I confess, I\u2019m not so sure. Perhaps a non-trans reader would appreciate McBride\u2019s appeals to sympathy, like her concluding anecdotes about trans kids she\u2019s encountered (when asked what she wants to be when she grows up, 12-year-old Stella declares, \u201cThe first trans president!\u201d). But these episodes feel reminiscent of the politician\u2019s well-worn strategy of using other people\u2019s \u2014 especially children\u2019s \u2014 stories to humanize contentious political and social issues, when McBride\u2019s own life is testament enough to the validity and intensity of these obstacles.If \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d provides a vision for a future of trans equality, I hope it will be one in which the dignity of transgender individuals is not up to cisgender arbiters for approval. Such a future of true equality would breed not only full respect for the trans community, but also more deeply felt memoirs that are uncompromised by the burden of justification.Meredith Talusan is the executive editor of them, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s L.G.B.T.Q. digital platform, and the author of the forthcoming memoir \u201cFairest.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Team Indigenous Takes Up the Challenge", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurfacingMeet the roller derby athletes who are \u2018reclaiming\u2019 their space, promoting female empowerment and standing up for indigenous people.One by one, they pass around a shell filled with burning sage wafting fragrant curls of smoke toward their faces, chests and over their heads. Some cry silently and others smile, catching the eye of every member in their round. They hold one another like sisters, though they met in person just days ago.For more Surfacing pieces, like one on a Jamaican synchronized swimming team, click here.The idea for a universal indigenous team got its start when Melissa Waggoner, 38, a roller derby professional who has skated on Team U.S.A. and is part of the Din\u00e9 indigenous community in North America (which is known to her as Turtle Island) began receiving Facebook messages and emails urging her to start an indigenous team.One of the emails Ms. Waggoner received finally persuaded her to do something. April Fournier, a 37-year-old mother of four who also has Din\u00e9 heritage, didn\u2019t have a strong sense of her indigenous identity. She grew up in Maine, which has a white population of 94.8 percent, according to the 2016 census; her mother was adopted by a white family from the Navajo reservation when she was 4, erasing the family\u2019s linguistic and cultural link to the Din\u00e9. When she saw Ms. Waggoner competing in a roller derby competition, she reached out and helped start the team. \u201cTeam Indigenous can show the world there is a different role model for indigenous women out there,\u201d she said.And Sasheen Wesley, 33, found fellowship in the team. \u201cTeam Indigenous is a team of equals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just get me. I don\u2019t have to explain myself.\u201d Other team members proudly showed off photos of their children or shared how to pronounce words in their traditional languages, like \u2018Hleh-pai N\u2019de,\u2019 which means \u2018Lipan Apache tribe\u2019 in the eastern dialect of the Apache language. A whistle-blow later, they were on the skate track. They took turns skimming around their opposition, picking up speed to the euphoric calls of the crowd. In the mayhem of pushing, blocking and speeding past one another, one woman was elbowed in the mouth, returning to the bench with a bloody smile. The clock signaled halftime and the athletes returned to their circle for a huddle to talk tactics.\u201cWe\u2019re going to take all the power that we have, we\u2019re going to combine it and we\u2019re going to be frickin\u2019 super Indians! Ready?\u201d Ms. Waggoner yelled.The buzzer rang.A fast-paced whirl of slamming, crushing and speeding by ensued. Team Indigenous finished 27th out of 38 teams. Team Australia, which was a finalist, gave up its national anthem slot so the indigenous athletes could make a statement.Her speech was followed by the American national anthem. Members of Team Indigenous knelt in protest.For some players, the team is the first step in learning about their family heritage. Christine Phillips-Ryburn, 48, wearing a shiny bomber jacket adorned with roller derby badges, will retire from the sport this year to learn more about her family\u2019s tribe, the Tawanaki Iwi people of New Zealand, known to them as Aotearoa. \u201cAfter nine years, I plan on taking up my spiritual journey: a three-year diploma learning the Maori language,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.\u201cWe have a long history of working behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analytica.The firm\u2019s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, have done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell \u2014 it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.\u201cMany of our clients don\u2019t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,\u201d he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. \u201cWe can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There\u2019s so many options we can look at.\u201dThe Channel 4 reporter posed as a \u201cfixer\u201d for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put \u201cinto the bloodstream to the internet,\u201d said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.\u201cThen watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has to happen without anyone thinking, \u2018That\u2019s propaganda.\u2019 Because the moment you think \u2018that\u2019s propaganda,\u2019 the next question is, \u2018Who\u2019s put that out?\u2019\u201dThe most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix\u2019s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.\u201cI mean, deep digging is interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that\u2019s too good to be true, and make sure that that\u2019s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.\u201dMr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. \u201cThey will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.\u201dOr, Mr. Nix said, they could \u201csend some girls around to the candidate\u2019s house \u2014 we have lots of history of things.\u201dThe reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,\u201d Mr. Nix replied. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\u201cThey are very beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cI find that works very well.\u201dTo be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. \u201cPlease don\u2019t pay too much attention to what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,\u201d he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was \u201cedited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.\u201dThe company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbull \u201chumored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,\u201d it said.\u201cThey left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,\u201d the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain\u2019s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.\u201cIt seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.\u201cWe need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,\u201d she said.But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. \u201cAre they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.\u201dMr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company\u2019s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.Stephen Castle contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

(A bit nervous, too.)Pretty depressing, right?Well, so it goes in the world today.And yet, our public discussion (which followed a chat, a day earlier, with Clive Hamilton about China\u2019s influence in Australia) ranged widely from the causes to possible solutions to signs of both despair and hope.A few of the highlights and themes worthy of further examination:\u2022 The Talent Deficit: Both Professor Grayling and Mr. Megalogenis lamented the way that politics now struggles to draw in the best and brightest minds. For those who are ambitious and want to change the world, I also noted, there\u2019s more interest in tech start-ups than in government.What can or should our leaders do to make representative democracy feel more dynamic and relevant?Professor Grayling suggested that strict term limits would be one way to help, by making politics a temporary service rather than a career. Another idea that came up: recruiting a more diverse pool of candidates, tapping into the optimism of immigrant communities and their children, who tend not to be underrepresented in Australian politics.\u2022 Tech, Foe and Friend: Social media and big data: Good or bad? How about both.They allow for niche targeting of voters, which usually means the undecided, but in the case of Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, Professor Grayling noted, it also meant encouraging complacency with social media posts telling anti-Brexit voters that there was no way they\u2019d lose, making them less likely to turn out to vote.\u2022 Transparency vs. Secrecy:I\u2019m zealot for transparency, as some of you know, so I paraphrased the inquiry.Mr. Megalogenis agreed that it was a problem, noting that Australian politicians were continually trying to to avoid transparency and questions \u2014 except from friendly journalists.What he and Professor Grayling concluded was that most of today\u2019s leaders have simply not come to grips with the current moment of existential challenge for democracies: Politicians are still waltzing in a world where the stakes are small and intimately tied to their own party loyalty, their donors and re-election.What might it take for them to wake up, mature and reinvigorate government?What needs to happen for the public to be better informed and to demand more from their elected representatives?I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s as satisfying as one would hope. We seem to be in a moment where much of the world is just trying to keep up with the volatility of shifting politics \u2014 very little feels settled, and our discussion did little to banish that uncertainty.But perhaps it was a start.

The country is peppered with small distilleries and beer breweries, but Brooklyn Kura is the first sake brewery in New York State and one of only about 15 in the nation, and that\u2019s if you count the four large-scale Japanese producers on the West Coast.Like many of her peers, Ms. Niikawa-Helton takes the diplomatic stance that most small-batch American-made craft sakes are \u201cdefinitely O.K.,\u201d if not as astounding as those made with the benefit of 1,000 years of experience.

They toured a traditional small mountaintop operation using one yeast strain, local water, specially grown rice and its own koji, a rice mold that is a key ingredient for brewing sake.\u201cWe were like, \u2018This is the definition of craft, why aren\u2019t people doing this in the U.S.?\u2019\u201d Mr. Polen said.Alcohol-fueled dreams tend to evaporate with the sunrise, but this one stuck. The two kept in touch even after Mr. Polen returned to New York, where he worked in analytics and technology for American Express, and Mr. Doughan went back to Portland, where he was a biochemist for the Knight Cardiovascular Institute at Oregon Health and Science University.The first step was making sake at home, said Mr. Polen, and \u201cit was better than we expected it to be,\u201d especially the sakes made by Mr. Doughan. He had both a rigorous science background and 20 years of home-brewing experience, including experimentation with soy sauce, which is also made with a type of koji.Though it has the alcohol content of wine, sake is brewed more like a beer: Rice implanted with koji mold is slowly mixed with yeast, water and more steamed rice, then fermented for several weeks. It\u2019s usually pressed to remove most but not all of the solids, after which it can be aged or filtered further.The heart of the monthlong process is culturing the koji, Mr. Doughan said. It\u2019s a multiday, labor-intensive undertaking that begins when he shakes flakes of mold over mini-mountains of washed and steamed rice grown specifically for sake-making.John Gauntner, the Tokyo sake educator who is considered one of the foremost English-language experts on the drink, appreciates their initial focus on the basics. Brooklyn Kura\u2019s sake was \u201cvery, very good,\u201d he wrote in an email, but he was \u201cmost impressed that the brewer there wants to get his process down first, reproducibility, and then work on tweaking it to make it better.\u201dStronger connections are good news for Mr. Doughan. \u201cThe first thing I learned about sake brewing,\u201d he said, \u201cis I\u2019ll be learning about it for the rest of my life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the green, purple or orange varieties work, too, and will add a touch of festivity to the usual midwinter dinner table doldrums.While the vegetables are in the oven getting golden and tender, cook up your pasta, then drain, saving some of the pasta water. This starchy liquid is what transforms the Gorgonzola into a luscious sauce, melting and binding it.Then the whole shebang meets up in the bowl.There\u2019s the perfectly al dente pasta. (Don\u2019t overcook it because the pasta is what provides the texture here.) There are the burnished, sweet vegetables: cauliflower, leeks and garlic. (Did I mention the garlic? It gets mixed with the roasting leeks.)There are the crumbles of funky, earthy Gorgonzola dolce (or whatever good blue cheese you can get; the creamier, the better). Finally, mix in some thyme and chives for herbal depth and a big squeeze of fresh lemon juice for verve.The result is nothing like macaroni and cheese, or like cheesy cauliflower. It\u2019s complex and richly flavorful, with a bite. But it\u2019s still got the luscious creamy factor, which in this last gasp of winter, may be exactly what you need.cookingAdvertisement"}

Ian Austen, a correspondent who is based in Ottawa, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.How do Canadians differ from Americans in the ways they use tech, and what are the most popular homegrown apps there?Many of the apps on Canadians\u2019 phones would be familiar to any American \u2014 they generally include Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter. I\u2019m leery of cross-country comparisons because they often mix survey samples and methods. But they suggest that Canadians spend somewhat more time online, and on Facebook, than Americans.That would follow. In the pre-internet age, Canadians were often world champions when it came to long-distance telephone use, something that could be accurately measured. It\u2019s a big and sparsely settled country.What are your favorite tech tools for doing your job? My two main tools also seem to be with nearly every other reporter surrounding me in media rooms at events: a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 7. Whatever harms they\u2019ve brought to society and general human interaction, few things have made my job easier than smartphones.Right now, I\u2019m also experimenting with Trint, an app that shows promise at taking over the transcribing of interviews, the most dispiriting part of an otherwise great job. It\u2019s a bit expensive, and, right now at least, its accuracy swings wildly from being very impressive to producing something that resembles experimental prose-poetry. But there aren\u2019t any obvious factors behind its hits or misses, like the quality of the recording or the subjects\u2019 accents.Like the three other Times reporters who cover Canada, I work throughout the country. So in my (untidy) office in Ottawa I keep a work backpack ready for leaving town. My one tip for anyone who travels frequently on short notice is to buy a second laptop charging brick and keep it in your travel pack. Yes, I came to that solution the hard way.A lot of people use a smartphone for photography. Why bother carrying a dedicated camera?The adage that the best camera in the world is the one you have with you is completely true. Most smartphones can produce very nice images, and I certainly use my phone\u2019s camera. But squeezing a camera into a phone brings many compromises.Their incredibly small image sensors don\u2019t match up to those in dedicated cameras, especially when the light is low. The tiny sensors also mean that you can\u2019t really take advantage of the different perspectives that different focal lengths of lenses offer on dedicated cameras. Composing on a screen held away from your face is far from ideal, and if you learn about photography, controlling the exposure and focus of the camera become a big part of it.Film still has a few tricks that digital can\u2019t match, and I often also take an old Leica or another film camera along on trips.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?I drink far too much tea, so the Breville One-Touch tea maker keeps me supplied and maintains productivity at the bureau, which is the fancy term for a space in the basement of my house in Ottawa.Cycling is a big part of my life. Last year, I became the last person in my branch of the cycling world to get a GPS computer for my bikes that also measures, among other things, my heart rate. It was joined by a similar watch I use while running and cross-country skiing, the winter activity for cyclists around here.There isn\u2019t even a plan yet. Sidewalk is spending the next year doing consultations and coming up with a final design that will need government approval. But it has already put out an ambitious list of what it hopes to build. As now proposed, the plan involves a perhaps unprecedented level of data collection from people going about their daily lives. Dealing with the obvious privacy concerns that flow from that may prove to be its greatest challenge.What is Canada\u2019s high-tech scene like now? BlackBerry has foundered, but Canada has a lot of well-known artificial intelligence researchers, especially in Toronto.It\u2019s now bigger and expanding more quickly than it was at any point during BlackBerry\u2019s glory years.

I\u2019m not just there trying to illustrate a posture or pose. I\u2019m trying to tune into what\u2019s going on before me, and really transmit this inner experience that the yogi in front of me is having.\u201dHe spent time in India, where yoga originated, but also photographed in places like Denver, Colo.; Encinitas, Calif.; and a longtime Sikh community in northern New Mexico. Together, the photographs present a diverse look at an ancient practice that has been adapted to our contemporary times. It is also a personal perspective.\"These pictures represent my own walk through yoga,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not all-encompassing, or representing yoga all around the world in all of its forms. It\u2019s my own exploration, my own contemplation, and where I\u2019ve been led to. I feel grateful for opportunity to have been in the presence of all of these amazing people.\u201dThe book is rendered in warm, glowing colors: yellows, tangerines and ochres. Whether they show richly-hued cotton robes, vibrant flower petals or light reflecting off the Ganges, the series of photographs is stunning.While yoga has been associated with wisdom for more than 5,000 years, in American society, it has often been co-opted and commodified. But Mr. Richter thinks its greatest benefit is priceless, in more ways than one. \u201cNone of this is bought or sold, what we\u2019re talking about here,\u201d he said. \u201cNone is even available for any cost. It requires us to slow down, to still our minds, and to find a way to get our senses under control.\u201dHe is trying to veer away from this commercial view, which often is a humorously-expected-vision of yoga.\"Often in photographs, it is a beautiful woman in soft light, in a studio context, with certain branded attire on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not representing anything, in terms of what depth of what yoga is.\u201dOne image in the series depicts almost the exact opposite of that stereotype. In 2016, during one of his many trips to India, Mr. Richter found himself in a situation that sounds like something out of a storybook. He was in a cave, photographing a silent hermit who lived there, isolated from the world. They\u2019d known each other for years, so he made sure to bring tobacco, fruit, and milk, along with his tripod and cable release.\"It was pretty incredible to be sitting there with this silent yogi, who basically wears a loin cloth, and lives in the forest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re listening to music from all over world on my phone. I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time for anything like this to happen. He\u2019d never done yoga for me. He\u2019d never meditated. It was amazing, and it happened very fast.\u201dFittingly, given the almost postmodern nature of this tale, despite yoga\u2019s health benefits, after 15 minutes of practice, the silent yogi was pooped.\"He did all these yoga poses, these headstands, and more dramatic asana, and then he was huffing and puffing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo he lay down, and lit up a cigarette, and was like, that\u2019s it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Italy\u2019s Insular Election Is More Important Than It Looks", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 The campaign before Italy\u2019s national elections on Sunday has been self-obsessed and often petty and unedifying. But it has been instructive about one thing: The political forces that have torn at the global order and the European Union have settled into the mainstream.Fascists rallied in large numbers in Italian piazzas. The country experienced its worst political violence in years. Formerly unthinkable suggestions, like the mass deportation of migrants, became virtually routine.The reanimation of Italy\u2019s political ghosts is a worrying harbinger for a European Union already weakened by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the bloc, the electoral setbacks of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the long shadow of Russia and the rise of an illiberal bloc of nations in the eastern part of the Continent.In elections in the United States and elsewhere in Europe, the far right had shifted the debate within the political establishment. But in Italy, the birthplace of fascism, they are a full partner in it.Italy\u2019s election \u201cepitomizes everything, it is pure populism,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, an architect of President Trump\u2019s populist message who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist until he was forced out in August.Mr. Bannon is in Italy as part of a European tour to help build a broader populist movement throughout Europe, the subject of a speech he will deliver on Tuesday in Switzerland. He said he was busy learning from the country\u2019s populists leaders. \u201cThe Italian people have gone farther, in a shorter period of time, than the British did for Brexit and the Americans did for Trump,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday. \u201cItaly is the leader.\u201dItaly\u2019s center-left prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has sought to sound the alarm, telling the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Friday that the election was the most important in a quarter-century, a \u201ccontest against populism\u201d with the system of free markets and an open society at stake.Mr. Gentiloni and others have bemoaned the anemic resistance of the country\u2019s political, business and intellectual leaders. The elites seem cowed. The capacity for outrage seems exhausted. This is the nuovo normal, and many analysts fear that Italy will become a bellwether for an anti-European season.\u201cBrussels and the European capitals are worried because this election could bring the least pro-Europe government Italy has ever had,\u201d said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador to NATO who is a Brussels-based consultant for Project Associates.But that may be just what it gets.And Mr. Berlusconi is considered a nominal moderate.His prospective partners spent the last days of the campaign blaming newly arrived migrants for Italy\u2019s long-established structural woes and fawning over Viktor Orban, the autocratic prime minister of Hungary, on a visit there.But among the wide variety of outcomes the election might yield, a victory for the coalition led by Mr. Berlusconi, certainly a well-known quantity by now, is considered relatively good news for the European Union.For European Union leaders and global investors, it is a nightmare possibility that could rattle Italy\u2019s economy, already buckling under enormous public debt, and send Europe, now at the threshold of recovery, back into crisis.In 2014, the party won 40 percent of the vote for the European Parliament. In the current election, the left is in such shambles, and Mr. Renzi has proved so polarizing, that his party has decided it was better off not to name a nominee for prime minister.Mr. Berlusconi, who is barred from holding office until 2019 because of a tax fraud conviction, waited until late Thursday evening before he named a longtime ally, Antonio Tajani, the current president of the European Parliament, as his nominee. Mr. Tajani gave a pro-Europe patina to what is an increasingly an anti-Europe coalition.Hours earlier, Mr. Berlusconi held a unity rally in an ancient Roman temple with his coalition partners, Mr. Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, a post-fascist candidate fresh off a trip to Hungary to visit Mr. Orban.Ms. Meloni argued that only their right-wing grouping had enough votes to secure a government and that a vote for any other coalition would bring \u201cchaos.\u201dMr. Salvini talked about putting Italy before Europe and how tired he was after toiling for forgotten Italians. Mr. Berlusconi then wiped his partner\u2019s brow with a handkerchief.Mr. Berlusconi, seated between his allies, made a show of holding their arms as he insisted that he would keep his promise and \u201cabsolutely\u201d stick with them after the vote.But it is not clear that he will.\u201cThese elections are not elections but polls since nobody will win,\u201d said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes.The election itself is expected to result in an inconclusive muddle, as it is unlikely that any party or coalition will reach the 40 percent threshold necessary to form a government, which could take weeks of haggling.While some politicians think the usual Italian muddle is not such a terrible idea in such unpredictable times, there remains the danger that no governing coalition can be put together. In that case, the president could either appoint an unelected government without influence in Europe or call for another election.\u201cIt is the total collapse of the party system,\u201d said Gianfranco Pasquino, a senior adjunct professor at the Bologna Center of the Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies.\u201cNo stable government or reliable party leaders creates an unstable Italian situation, no government for several months creates a bad situation for Europe,\u201d he added.Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, a political scientist at the Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, agreed.\u201cThat is the worst scenario for Italy and for Europe,\u201d he said.One of the greatest dangers for Europe is that such a result could enable populist forces, especially the Five Star Movement, to gain even more steam from Italian frustration.Mr. Bannon said that if that were to happen, or if Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Renzi formed a coalition, Italian conservative populists should hold firm because it would result in \u201cthe ultimate dream\u201d of the Five Star and the League joining forces.\u201cThis time we win!\u201d supporters of the Five Star Movement shouted at the party\u2019s closing campaign rally on Friday night in Rome.But not everyone was convinced.\u201cThe powers that be are too strong, it will be very hard,\u201d said Tilio Figus, 55, a businessman who attended. \u201cIf they keep us out, it will be a great problem for the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Foils for the Right: Google and Facebook", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled \u201cThe Creepy Line,\u201d Mr. Schweizer\u2019s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France \u2014 during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book \u201cClinton Cash\u201d that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.\u201cThe Creepy Line\u201d alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company\u2019s policy was \u201cto get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.\u201dThe documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media \u2014 a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.\u201cThis could end up being the free speech issue of our time,\u201d said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. \u201cThe Silicon Valley elites are saying: \u2018We don\u2019t care what you want to see \u2014 we know what you should see. We know better.\u2019\u201dBig Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect foil,\u201d said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble,\u201d a book about how consumers find information online. \u201cThere\u2019s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what\u2019s happening on Facebook, because it\u2019s closed.\u201dGoogle, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAmong the panelists were James O\u2019Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore \u2014 a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies\u201d \u2014 described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.\u201cThere are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.\u201dBefore Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter\u2019s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer\u2019s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new \u2014 and potentially larger \u2014 audience.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film\u2019s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.In the right\u2019s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular \u2014 and fruitful \u2014 subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, \u201cFacebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming \u201ca full-on catastrophic update\u201d to Facebook\u2019s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president\u2019s Facebook page with the headline \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.\u201d The drop, the article insinuated, occurred \u201cfollowing a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for \u2018allowing\u2019 the president to win the 2016 general election.\u201dStill, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year\u2019s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google\u2019s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.\u201cThe least they can do,\u201d Mr. Marlow said, \u201cis buy us a drink.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Attempts to scream into this U-shaped neck cushion are not entirely failed, but the experience remains ineffective at best, and at worst disruptive to your housemates because of the hole in the middle of the pillow. Though a puffy cylinder may act as a decent muffler for your cries of despair, it does not cover your whole face. You want a pillow you can sink the entirety of the front head quadrant into to better disappear \u2014 a pillow that makes you think: \u201cI have not wedged my face into a pillow. I have wedged my face into a chaise longue in a remote British manor full of topiaries, exquisite food and calm. Tomorrow I will venture to the stable and lead the hounds for a run through my many acres.\u201d This pillow activates allergies and leaves you congested, as do your tears, which lately have been plentiful. This is not a pillow. Please do not scream into your dog unless necessary. If you must scream into your dog, do so into the fleshy middle area, not the front or back. You may find screaming into your dog less isolating than screaming into an inanimate object, since your dog is familiar and loves you. If it does not bite you out of fear, the dog may detect your pain and lick your forehead after it resituates to move away from your screaming face. Dogs are an anomaly of goodness in an otherwise blighted universe. Getting a dog was an excellent idea \u2014 good for you. Since foam is sufficiently sound-absorbent, your roommates won\u2019t detect you retching bottomless rage until your vocal cords wear out. A wonderful deposit for the sudden fury that occasionally burns through your numbness. The one drawback is that foam compresses when you apply force, so it may exacerbate the feeling that everything solid and dependable is slipping away. While generous in surface area, the armrest pillow is cumbersome and not the ideal pillow to hold to your face while shrieking expletives. No, don\u2019t scream into your grandma. Though an excellent source of comfort and support, your grandmother is a human being, not a pillow. However, feel free to hug Grandma and call her. She likes to hear from you. Truly the ideal in scream-purpose pillows! It provides just the right amount of muffling to contain your wrath, and its presence hints at a mattress nearby for you to punch during a fit of catharsis. Best of all, if the horrors of the day visit you in your sleep, this pillow is conveniently located under your head to un-blood-curdle your screams. Advertisement"}

Elegant like flowering dogwood. Larger than life like tulip tree.\u201dBut when pressed to pick just one, Mr. Forrest chose the marsh mallow. \u201cThis native beauty grows in wetlands and has the most exuberant flower of any native plant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is brassy, adaptable and stands out in a crowd.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:April showers are coming a few days ahead of schedule.But New York, never one to be outshined, has its own seasonal tradition.For the third year, Gov.

{"Headline": "How Democracy Can Survive Big Data", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe StoneOnly a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions \u2014 the election of its leaders \u2014 would have seemed even more absurd.Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it.\u201cData drives all that we do.\u201d That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook\u2019s user data. \u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\u201d he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America\u2019s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth\u2019s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \u2014 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \u2014 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.Colin Koopman is an associate professor of philosophy and director of new media and culture at the University of Oregon.Advertisement"}

Last year, a study in Germany found that kitchen sponges were a hotbed for germs. More than 350 different species of bacteria were found in 14 dirty kitchen sponges taken from private households.\u201cThat\u2019s the same density of bacteria you can find in human stool samples,\u201d Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Germany, said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThere are probably no other places on earth with such high bacterial densities.\u201dProfessor Gerba said, however, that there were far dirtier places in a home than the toilet seat.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, Mrs. Trump invited representatives from Facebook, Snap, Google, Amazon and Twitter to the White House for a round-table discussion on the topic. In a speech, she said that she had received letters from children who have been bullied or feel threatened on social media.\u201cI am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\u201d Mrs. Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. I am here with one goal: helping children and our next generation.\u201d So far, Mrs. Trump is working on this initiative independently of her husband. On Tuesday, President Trump had already attacked Democrats. Here are other times his behavior on Twitter has clashed with her public remarks on the importance of curbing bullying. \u201cBefore you leave to go back to your wonderful states and territories, I\u2019m asking you all to join me today and commit to promoting values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in our children,\u201d Mrs. Trump said to the group. \u201cWith those values as a solid foundation, our kids will be better equipped to deal with many of the evils in our world today, such as drug abuse and addiction and negative social media interactions.\u201d That week, Mr. Trump singled out Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, the investigation led by the special counsel and the state of California. \u201cThe president said, \u2018He knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway,\u2019\u201d Ms. Johnson said during an interview with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cIt made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it.\u201d Mr. Trump used his preferred platform to hit back. In a speech at a United Nations luncheon, Mrs. Trump warned about the dangers to children posed by cyberbullying and drugs.That week, Mr. Trump criticized several targets, including the leader of North Korea, the Emmys and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. During the president\u2019s first trip abroad, Mrs. Trump met with Queen Mathilde of Belgium and watched a presentation about a program that advocates for missing and exploited children. Mrs. Trump emphasized the need for digital safety after the meeting. That week, the president was on his best Twitter behavior. He praised European leaders, called his meeting with Pope Francis \u201cthe honor of a lifetime\u201d and discussed his poll numbers. For the first time, Mrs. Trump said publicly that she wanted to help combat cyberbullying during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other. We must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cIt will be one of the main focuses of my work if I\u2019m privileged enough to become your first lady.\u201d Needless to say, her critics pounced. For his part, Mr. Trump spent the week railing against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Carlos Monje, a representative from Twitter, the president\u2019s preferred digital soapbox, said the platform worked hard to \u201ccreate a safe environment\u201d for people 13 and older.\u201cYoung people do come to Twitter to find community,\u201d he said. Adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty inspirational things.\u201d Over a year in the Trump presidency, the East Wing has not unveiled a formal policy initiative. On Tuesday, the East Wing did not give a timeline for a formal rollout. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an email that it was common for the East Wing to work independently of the West Wing on \u201csome issues.\u201d \u201cIt is, in fact, a huge part of life for children today and Mrs. Trump wants to use her platform to talk openly about how to use it in a positive way,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cOf course she knows there is going to be criticism, but she is an independent woman who is doing what she feels is right for children.

Laqueur takes up an ancient question: Why do we care for the bodies of the dead when we know that after our loved ones have left them they are empty shells? He begins his query with Diogenes, the eccentric fourth century B.C. philosopher who requested that his dead body be thrown over the city walls to be devoured by beasts. The corpse may be waste, \u201cmeat gone mad,\u201d James Joyce wrote in \u201cUlysses,\u201d but since our beginnings we have endowed corpses with cultural and symbolic significance. \u201cWhatever our religious beliefs, or lack of belief, we share the very deep human desire to live with our ancestors and with their bodies. We mobilize their power,\u201d Laqueur wrote.The journalist Kevin Toolis does not doubt that corpses have particular superpowers. In his new book, \u201cMy Father\u2019s Wake,\u201d the bodies of our dead are life lessons, moral instructors of how to have satisfying lives and peaceful deaths. The tradition of the Irish wake, with rituals that predate Christianity, is our legend, \u201cthe best guide to life you could ever have,\u201d he writes.\u201cMy Father\u2019s Wake\u201d is at heart a memoir, chronicling a childhood spent between Edinburgh and remote Achill Island off the western coast of Ireland\u2019s County Mayo, where his parents were born. When Toolis is 19, his brother Bernard dies of leukemia. He is his brother\u2019s keeper, a bone marrow donor, but the transplant fails. The trauma sends Toolis as a young reporter out into the world, from Somalia to Afghanistan, in search of death, disease, famine and war. \u201cI was grieving,\u201d Toolis writes. \u201cNot for my dead brother but for the young man who died with him and lost his mortal innocence. Me.\u201dThe contrast between young Bernard\u2019s death (in the city, in the care of what Toolis calls the \u201cWestern Death Machine\u201d) and his father Sonny\u2019s death (at home in old age on Achill) sets up Toolis\u2019s castigation of modern medicine and death rites. But it is Toolis\u2019s fine skill at showing the means and aftermath of death rather than his prescription for how to improve dying that most animates \u201cMy Father\u2019s Wake.\u201dEarly in the book, Toolis implores us to face our mortality by calculating the date of our death, \u201cthe end point for you.\u201d In the book\u2019s final chapter, \u201cHow to Love, Live and Die,\u201d he offers this advice: \u201cIf you can find yourself a decent Irish wake to go to, just turn up and copy what everyone else is doing,\u201d and \u201ctake your kids along too if you can.\u201dThese bookends undermine Toolis\u2019s manifest intellectual curiosity about contemporary medical and funerary practices. Studies indeed show that when dying patients plan for and accept their impending death, their family members more ably manage grief, but Toolis never sheds light on why that is. Nor does he identify where or how the funeral industry \u2014 \u201cthe dismal trade,\u201d as Jessica Mitford called it in 1963 \u2014 has gone wrong. Grievers in funeral homes touch their corpses too.I can\u2019t help wishing that Toolis had kept the beautiful memoir of his life-and-death experiences and thrown the self-help curriculum over the city walls to be devoured by beasts.

{"Headline": "Facebook Faces Growing Pressure Over Data and Privacy Inquiries", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal regulators and state prosecutors are opening investigations into Facebook. Politicians in the United States and Europe are calling for its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before them. Investors have cut the value of the social networking giant by about $50 billion in the past two days.They are all focused on the same thing: whether Facebook mishandled users\u2019 data.Facebook has built its highly profitable social network off its users, selling advertisements based on their ages, interests and other details. But the scrutiny over the company\u2019s vast trove of personal data \u2014 following a report that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained information of 50 million users \u2014 is taking direct aim at that lucrative formula.\u201cInvestors are reacting to fears of regulation and the consequences of regulation,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cThe scale of errors can only lead one to conclude these are systemic problems.\u201dSo far, most of the social network\u2019s top executives have been silent. Mr. Zuckerberg, its founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, his top deputy, have not made any public statements in recent days. The pair did not appear at an employee meeting on Tuesday in Menlo Park, Calif., where the company is based.At the meeting, employees asked questions about the continuing internal investigation into the use of Facebook data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The firm, which was tied to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, used the data to target messages to voters.The meeting, which included Facebook\u2019s deputy counsel, Paul Grewal, largely focused on the steps that Facebook was taking to ensure its data could no longer be misused by independent researchers, according to Facebook employees in attendance. Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting.The pressure on Facebook has been building for years.It started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region\u2019s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.After the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company\u2019s role in Russia\u2019s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company\u2019s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.The Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.The social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.The F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.The current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time.Then, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook\u2019s policies, the company said last week.\u201cThere are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,\u201d said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C.The company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement.\u201cWe are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,\u201d an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.\u201dFacebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. \u201cWe remain strongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information,\u201d Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.\u201dThe F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey\u2019s attorney general announced a similar investigation.Mr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica.\u201cConsumers have a right to know how their information is used \u2014 and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users\u2019 personal information,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said. \u201cToday\u2019s demand letter is the first step in our joint investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.\u201dThere have also been growing calls for the top leadership at Facebook to appear before American and British lawmakers to testify about the company and Cambridge Analytica.Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, have asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.\u201dFacebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week.\u201cThe possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,\u201d Mr. Thune said in his letter.On Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company\u2019s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg.\u201cThe committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,\u201d wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. \u201cYour officials\u2019 answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.\u201dMatthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

Built in 1917 as a theater and refurbished several years ago as a tech co-working space, the Madison checks all of the aesthetic boxes of hipsterdom: reclaimed wood, exposed brick walls, pour-over coffee served by tattooed baristas.\u201cThis is nicer than San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Li concluded.Last month, I accompanied Ms. Li and roughly a dozen other venture capitalists on a three-day bus trip through the Midwest, with stops in Youngstown and Akron, Ohio; Detroit and Flint, Mich.; and South Bend, Ind. The trip, which took place on a luxury bus outfitted with a supply of vegan doughnuts and coal-infused kombucha, was known as the \u201cComeback Cities Tour.\u201dIt was pitched as a kind of Rust Belt safari \u2014 a chance for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start-ups in overlooked areas of the country.But a funny thing happened: By the end of the tour, the coastal elites had caught the heartland bug. Several used Zillow, the real estate app, to gawk at the availability of cheap homes in cities like Detroit and South Bend and fantasize about relocating there. They marveled at how even old-line manufacturing cities now offer a convincing simulacrum of coastal life, complete with artisanal soap stores and farm-to-table restaurants.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my kids, I\u2019d totally move,\u201d said Cyan Banister, a partner at Founders Fund. \u201cThis could be a really powerful ecosystem.\u201dThese investors aren\u2019t alone. In recent months, a growing number of tech leaders have been flirting with the idea of leaving Silicon Valley. Some cite the exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and its suburbs, where even a million-dollar salary can feel middle class. Others complain about local criticism of the tech industry and a left-wing echo chamber that stifles opposing views. And yet others feel that better innovation is happening elsewhere.\u201cI\u2019m a little over San Francisco,\u201d said Patrick McKenna, the founder of High Ridge Venture Partners who was also on the bus tour. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, it\u2019s so congested, and frankly, you also see opportunities in other places.\u201dMr. McKenna, who owns a house in Miami in addition to his home in San Francisco, told me that his travels outside the Bay Area had opened his eyes to a world beyond the tech bubble.\u201cEvery single person in San Francisco is talking about the same things, whether it\u2019s \u2018I hate Trump\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to do blockchain and Bitcoin,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst part of the social network.\u201dThe tour through the Midwest was organized by Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat who represents northeastern Ohio. Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, came along for the ride, as did J. D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d (Mr. Vance, a venture capitalist who now seems to magically appear every time the words \u201cMidwest\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing\u201d are spoken aloud, has also been leading his own whistle-stop tours of the region.)[Read more here about Mr. Vance scouring the Midwest.]But even among those who enjoy living in the Bay Area, and can afford to do so comfortably, there\u2019s a feeling that success has gone to the tech industry\u2019s head.\u201cSome of the engineers in the Valley have the biggest egos known to humankind,\u201d Mr. Khanna, the Silicon Valley congressman, said during a round-table discussion with officials in Youngstown. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have their coffee and breakfast and dry cleaning, they want to go somewhere else. Whereas here, people are hungry.\u201dFor both investors and rank-and-file workers, one appeal of noncoastal cities is the obvious cost savings. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to justify doling out steep salaries and lavish perks demanded by engineers in the Bay Area, when programmers in other cities can be had for as little as $50,000 a year. (An entry-level engineer at Facebook or Google might command triple or quadruple that amount.)When you invest in a San Francisco start-up, \u201cyou\u2019re basically paying landlords, Twilio, and Amazon Web Services,\u201d said Ms. Bannister of Founders Fund, referring to the companies that provide start-ups with messaging services and data hosting.Granted, California still has its perks. Venture capital investment is still largely concentrated on the West Coast, as are the clusters of talented computer scientists who emerge from prestigious schools like Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley. Despite the existence of tools like Slack, which make remote work easier, many tech workers feel it\u2019s still an advantage to be close to the center of the action.Venture capitalists, who recognize a bargain when they see one, have already begun scouring the Midwest. Mr. Case and Mr. Vance recently amassed a $150 million fund called \u201cRise of the Rest.\u201d The fund, which was backed by tech luminaries including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Eric Schmidt, the former executive chairman of Alphabet, will invest in start-ups throughout the region.[Read Andrew Ross Sorkin on the Rise of the Rest fund.]During the Akron stop of the bus trip, while the Silicon Valley investors mingled with local officials over a dinner spread of vegan polenta pizza and barbecue sliders, Mr. McKenna, the San Francisco venture capitalist, told me that he felt a difference in people\u2019s attitudes in cities like these, where the tech industry\u2019s success is still seen as something to celebrate.\u201cPeople want to be in places where they\u2019re the hero,\u201d he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the mayors of two cities in Ohio. Mayor Jamael Tito Brown of Youngstown was on the left and Mayor William Franklin of Warren was on the right.An earlier version of this article misstated J.D.

But there was no reason to return, because especially in this day and age, so many other things beckon: your phone, your activities, your friends, your life.\u201dWhen Ms. Trainer Thompson took over as president and chief executive of Hancock Shaker Village in January 2017, she wanted to compel visitors to return. She saw the potential to expand the allure of the living history museum where the Shakers, a small Christian sect best known for its celibacy and simplicity, had settled in 1790. It remains a working farm with painstakingly preserved architecture.Since she started the job, she has begun farm-to-table dinners featuring prominent speakers, and a roots-music series sponsored by a local microbrewery. The village hosted goat yoga classes through the summer and an exhibition of contemporary art inspired by Shaker ideals.The closing date of the season was extended from mid-November to the week before Christmas to add holiday events. It will open for this season on April 14.Village attendance in 2017 reached 56,000, the highest level in a dozen years and an almost 10 percent jump from the prior year. Membership climbed 25 percent.\u201cTo survive, you want more visitors, and there needed to be more ways to experience it, and to show the beauty and value of the place,\u201d Ms. Trainer Thompson, 61, said from her office overlooking the grounds.At Hancock Shaker Village, attendance had stagnated for the past decade at around 49,000 a year. The museum lost money in 2007 but was breaking even by the time Ms. Trainer Thompson arrived, she said.The new activities brought in $83,000 last year \u2014 a small fraction of the museum\u2019s annual $1.8 million budget. Nine sessions of goat yoga, which allows animals to roam among posing participants, produced $9,000.More important than the revenue, Ms. Trainer Thompson said, yoga attendees\u2019 Facebook posts generated about 37,000 views and prompted their friends, many in their 30s, to discover or return to the village. A few yoga participants bought memberships.Food seemed an ideal opportunity to Ms. Trainer Thompson, who has written cookbooks and raised chickens. She brought in Brian Alberg, vice president of culinary development for the renowned Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, Mass., and a champion of the regional food scene, to overhaul the museum cafe menu. He scrapped several of the salads and sandwiches for Shaker staples like brown bread and locally raised lamb.\u201cMy idea was to bring the village into the kitchen and the kitchen into the village,\u201d Mr. Alberg said.He also designed the menus for occasional field dinners and for the speaker series called Food for Thought. Presenters scheduled for this year include the writer Roy Blount Jr. and Francis J. Greenburger, the real estate mogul and philanthropist.Ms. Trainer Thompson, who spent 28 years at Mass MoCA, the contemporary art museum in nearby North Adams, turned the Shaker Village\u2019s 1910 wooden barn \u2014 previously used to store hay and the remnants of a dismantled sawmill \u2014 into a venue for the Shaker Barn Music concerts, which will continue this year.The singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant has committed to a separate benefit concert in September. This year the village also will host the Northeast Fiddlers\u2019 Convention, the world premiere of a Shaker-themed play and a food industry retreat called Emerging Tastes.And even a historic village needs modern technology. On her second day, Ms. Trainer Thompson realized her smartphone calendar would not sync and ordered an update of the museum\u2019s network, installing Wi-Fi throughout the property. \u201cI felt it was critical for social media, for people \u2014 if they\u2019re having fun at a concert in our barn \u2014 to be able to post it on Instagram.\u201dOn a beautiful evening in July, during intermission for a Sarah Lee Guthrie concert, audience members strolled outside the barn and sipped craft beer. Down the hill, they could see the chicken coop and its residents pecking at the grass.Suddenly, a fox appeared, snatched a hen and ate it. A few concertgoers looked aghast, Ms. Trainer Thompson said, but she recounted the incident with a degree of delight.It was a truly authentic experience at Hancock Shaker Village.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s just that, like the Wild West preacher who keeps accidentally wandering into Fannie Porter\u2019s house of ill repute, Corbyn has an odd knack for stumbling into the arms of the Hebraically disinclined.Corbyn also met in 2009 with Dyab Abou Jahjah, a Belgian-Lebanese activist whose Arab European League had previously published a cartoon denying the Holocaust. Corbyn initially denied ever meeting the activist, then was \u201creminded\u201d by a photograph of the two of them together. \u201cWe had, I think two times, lunch or breakfast together,\u201d Abou Jahjah noted, \u201cso I cannot say that Mr. Corbyn is a personal friend, but he is absolutely a political friend.\u201d Abou Jahjah was later banned from entering Britain.Does all of this make Corbyn an anti-Semite? Not necessarily. He vehemently denies it. You can never know with certainty what\u2019s in a person\u2019s mind or heart unless he tells it to you straight. Motives can be complex. Self-delusion plays its role.Then again, what does that matter? Corbyn is 68 and has been a Member of Parliament for 35 years. He has risen to the pinnacle of British politics. Until he became leader of the Labour Party nearly three years ago, he proudly and defiantly flaunted his association with people whose anti-Semitism is not remotely in doubt. You can stumble upon Fannie Porter\u2019s house once and call it an honest mistake. Corbyn tripped into it a half-dozen times. Inadvertance long ago ceased to be an excuse.The election of Donald Trump has caused waves of justified fear about the unique threat he poses to civil liberties in the free world. Yet Jeremy Corbyn may be the next prime minister of Britain, much to the delight of progressives on both sides of the Atlantic. What happens now will be a test for the global left: If it is willing to let Corbyn off the hook, it can have no honest case against Trump. No claim to moral respect, either.Advertisement"}

It includes a fine of about $1,400 and a three-year suspended sentence.On Dec. 15, a few hours after a cousin of Ms. Tamimi\u2019s was shot in the face with a rubber bullet during a clash between villagers of Nabi Saleh and Israeli forces, Ms. Tamimi erupted at a pair of heavily armed soldiers as they took up a position in the front yard of her home.The officer faced her impassively, absorbing some blows, evading others, but never striking back at her, then finally turned and, with his comrade, walked away. A few days later, a clip of the scuffle was broadcast on Israeli television, setting off a debate on both sides of the conflict and turning the blonde, blue-eyed and seemingly fearless teenager into a hero for supporters of the Palestinian cause.Israelis argued over whether the soldiers had demonstrated admirable forbearance and fortitude or a kind of weakness and vulnerability that could send dangerous signals to the country\u2019s enemies. Palestinians, while showering Ms. Tamimi with praise, asked whether publicizing the video might have been counterproductive, by showing the soldiers behaving with restraint, or helpful, by showing that even unarmed resistance can be effective.But Ms. Tamimi, whose family is well known for its protests against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, also quickly became a symbol of how harshly the military justice system can treat young Palestinians. She was arrested in the middle of the night after the video\u2019s broadcast on television. Her mother and a 20-year-old cousin, Nour Tamimi, were also charged. And their trial in a military prison was closed to the news media to protect Ms. Tamimi\u2019s privacy, according to Israeli officials, though her defense lawyer, Gabi Lasky, asked to waive that, insisting that publicity would provide far better protection.All three women agreed to plea bargains on Wednesday. Ahed Tamimi pleaded guilty to attacking the soldier and to two other counts of disrupting a soldier and incitement, the Israeli military said. Other charges, including stone-throwing, were dropped.Nour Tamimi was sentenced to the time she had spent behind bars before being released on bail, about two weeks. Ahed\u2019s mother, Nariman Tamimi, who was charged with incitement for showing the altercation live on Facebook, was sentenced to eight months in prison, a suspended sentence and a fine of about $1,700.

Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fund-Raiser Held Out Access to Trump as a Prize for Prospective Clients", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For Elliott Broidy, Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign represented an unparalleled political and business opportunity.After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Broidy quickly capitalized, marketing his Trump connections to politicians and governments around the world, including some with unsavory records, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Broidy suggested to clients and prospective customers of his Virginia-based defense contracting company, Circinus, that he could broker meetings with Mr. Trump, his administration and congressional allies.Mr. Broidy was open about his business interests, but the administration made no effort to curtail his offers of access to clients or prospective clients.Yet Mr. Broidy was so aggressive, some associates said, that they warned him to tone down his approach for fear that he might run afoul of the president, clients or American lobbying and anti-corruption laws.As with so many other political conventions, Mr. Trump has upended the traditional system of access to the president, among the most prized chits in Washington. That is partly because of lax vetting that has allowed largely unfettered access to Mr. Trump and his White House by loyalists, friends and hangers-on with their own policy agendas or business interests.But it is also because few of Washington\u2019s established lobbyists have close connections to the president. In their place, a new class of insider has emerged, able to lobby the president directly on behalf of clients or business partners, an uncommon opportunity in prior administrations, when lobbyists focused on winning support from lawmakers or regulators.In a statement, Mr. Broidy said the success of his company reflected his recruitment of \u201cthe best people, including a number of former flag officers,\u201d not his political connections. \u201cThe idea that our success derives from activities around last year\u2019s presidential inauguration is not only misplaced but insulting to the careers and capabilities of our highly trained and decorated veterans,\u201d he said.Mr. Broidy, 60, in some ways personifies this new breed of Trump insider. A lifelong Los Angeles resident who worked as an accountant before making a fortune as an investor, Mr. Broidy grew more interested in politics after the Sept. 11 attacks, which shaped his hawkish approach to foreign policy and concern for the defense of Israel. In 2005, he was appointed to a federal homeland security advisory panel.Mr. Broidy pleaded guilty in 2009 to giving nearly $1 million in illegal gifts to New York state officials to help his company land a $250 million contract with the state\u2019s public pension fund. He paid $18 million in restitution and avoided jail time.As he worked to rebuild his bank account and reputation, he expanded his business interests in the defense and security industry, starting a company called Threat Deterrence in 2013 and purchasing Circinus in July 2015.His business took off after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Circinus has won lucrative work from around the world, including contracts worth more than $200 million to do defense work for the United Arab Emirates. And Mr. Broidy openly promoted Circinus\u2019s work in meetings with Mr. Trump and other Republican officials, according to documents and interviews.But Mr. Broidy faces a sudden backlash.The documents reveal that Mr. Broidy, a vice chairman of the finance committee for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, arranged invitations to parties celebrating the event for foreign leaders with whom Circinus worked to sign contracts that could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Broidy in some cases presented the invitations in a manner that suggested they were linked to their countries\u2019 willingness to do business with Circinus.For instance, Mr. Broidy invited Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime president of the Republic of Congo, to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight dinner featuring Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their wives. \u201cYour name has been submitted and approved,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso in a note on Broidy Capital Management letterhead. Mr. Broidy stressed that the invitation was from Mr. Broidy and \u201cis not coming from the Joint Congressional Committee\u201d on Inaugural Ceremonies, which oversees the swearing-in and a luncheon at the Capitol.The day after the letter was dated, Mr. Broidy asked his team at Circinus to prepare an invoice for $2 million to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso\u2019s office for \u201cmilitary capabilities assessment and review/services,\u201d according to emails and documents.People close to Mr. Broidy said no invoice was sent and Circinus never worked for the Congolese government. Mr. Sassou-Nguesso declined the invitation to the inauguration festivities, they said.Donors to previous inaugurations were also able to invite foreign heads of state to events as their guests, a spokesman for Mr. Broidy noted.Circinus has yet to receive contracts from Romania, people close to Mr. Broidy said. The company entered into an agreement last month with a Romanian government-owned defense company that appears to give it the inside track for contracts valued at more than $200 million, according to Romanian news media and people familiar with the contracting process.Similarly, in a letter dated Jan. 3, 2017, and emailed to top Angolan government officials, Mr. Broidy indicated that he was also sending both an invitation to the inauguration festivities and a proposal for Circinus to provide security services for Angola. In one version of the proposal, the company sought nearly $64 million over five years. \u201cWith numerous preparations ahead, we request that you kindly return the executed document no later than January 9, 2017,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote in the letter to Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, then the Angolan defense minister, and another Angolan official.Three days before inauguration, the Angolans submitted a $6 million payment to Circinus, which people close to Mr. Broidy say was $2 million less than the Angolans had agreed to pay. That same day, the Angolans and Mr. Broidy met on Capitol Hill with senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, both Republicans, encounters arranged by Mr. Broidy and his team.About one month later, Mr. Broidy again wrote to Mr. Louren\u00e7o, discussing plans for him \u201cto be joining us at Mira Largo\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Broidy is a member and has been spotted introducing guests to the president \u2014 \u201cthis coming weekend.\u201d\u201cMany preparations have been made in advance of your visit, including additional meetings at the Capitol and the Department of Treasury,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote.He went on to remind Mr. Louren\u00e7o that Angola was past due on \u201cthe balance of the payment\u201d for Circinus\u2019s services. \u201cPlease make this payment immediately,\u201d he wrote.Not long after Mr. Louren\u00e7o was inaugurated as president of Angola in September, Mr. Broidy wrote again to congratulate him and offer to help set up meetings with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. \u201cBefore the formalities which would naturally be in order between our governments, I am able to assess and advise in this matter, and would be delighted to help foster such closer relation between Luanda and Washington,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote, referring to the Angolan capital.Mr. Louren\u00e7o did not come to Mar-a-Lago and never responded to the letters, according to people close to Mr. Broidy. Circinus never collected any additional funds from Angola beyond the initial $6 million payment, they said.Mr. Broidy emphasizes to potential clients how his connections to Mr. Trump could benefit them, according to several people who have worked with him or heard his pitches.\u201cHe was mentioning that he has political connections, and it could be helpful,\u201d said Eymen Errais, a counselor to the Tunisian Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation.Mr. Errais and the department\u2019s minister, Fadhel Abdelkefi, met with Mr. Broidy and Circinus executives in Tunisia a few weeks after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Circinus sought a contract to build an open-source intelligence center for the Tunisian government, a person familiar with the meeting said, but Mr. Abdelkefi\u2019s ministry instead sought to persuade Mr. Broidy to invest in the Tunisian hospitality industry.Nonetheless, in an email to Mr. Abdelkefi just after the meeting, Mr. Broidy vowed that the center \u201cwould be an extremely useful and effective tool for your government\u201d and again emphasized his connection to Mr. Trump. He characterized the incoming administration as \u201can unprecedented opportunity, in that the House, Senate and executive branch of our government are all under Republican control for the first time in 10 years.\u201dCircinus prepared a proposal for a five-year contract totaling $80 million for the Tunisian work. But Mr. Errais said the Tunisians decided not to do business with Circinus. \u201cA connection with Trump \u2014 how would that help us for security?\u201d he said.A person close to Mr. Broidy said he discussed the Republicans\u2019 control of Congress and the White House to suggest that the American government might increase spending on counterterrorism.Mr. Broidy\u2019s allies say he has never hidden the overlap between his business interests and his political activity. In a memorandum about an October Oval Office meeting, for example, Mr. Broidy wrote that he had volunteered to Mr. Trump that his company was seeking a contract from the United Arab Emirates and had tried to arrange a private meeting for the president to discuss the matter with their leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.The dinner and round-table with the president proceeded without him.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Gun Control Marches, Students Led but Adults Provided Key Resources", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey were rallies that would not have happened without the fervor of the students: teenage survivors of last month\u2019s massacre in Parkland, Fla., frightened high schoolers in the Midwest, unnerved university students in the Northeast.But the March for Our Lives demonstrations that unfolded on Saturday, from Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington to the streets of Salt Lake City to a small town in north Georgia, ultimately represented twin triumphs: of organic, youthful grass-roots energy, and of sophisticated, experienced organizational muscle.Although the events, which together drew hundreds of thousands of demonstrators across the country, were inspired and often led by students, many protests simultaneously benefited from groups with more financial resources and organizational skills than the teenagers had on their own.\u201cWe definitely teamed up,\u201d said Madison Knoop, 18, who organized a rally of 2,500 in Montpelier, Vt., with the support of groups dominated by adults. \u201cThey were so helpful for the entire process.\u201dSkeptics of the marches seized on the roles of major interest groups, suggesting that the students were unwitting participants in political warfare that should be reserved for adults. But organizers and supporters of Saturday\u2019s events have done little to disguise that millions of dollars and thousands of hours were directed toward the weekend\u2019s protests.Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded and financed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York mayor, proudly declared that it had doled out more than $1 million in grants to local organizers. A nonprofit led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, arranged for more than 200 people from the Parkland area to attend Saturday\u2019s march in Washington, and said it had worked with the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, to use the N.F.L. franchise\u2019s plane to bring some people to the capital.In Washington, volunteers staffed medical tents, the restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s used one of his kitchens to prepare thousands of ham-and-cheese sandwiches, and a popular chain handed out personal-size pizzas to children.\u201cOur mission was to give them the biggest megaphone possible,\u201d Shannon Watts, the founder of an Everytown-affiliated group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said on Sunday. \u201cI think what yesterday showed was every generation wants to get involved in this effort, and they want to get off the sidelines.\u201dEstablished groups and high-profile supporters were not the exclusive sources of money and organizing strength nationwide. As of Sunday, a GoFundMe page affiliated with the march in Washington had raised nearly $3.5 million. Half of the crowdsourced money was expected to help pay for Saturday\u2019s protest, with the balance going to people directly affected by the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.Yet the role of leading gun control groups and advocates, and even local organizers, has plainly aggravated and frustrated critics of Saturday\u2019s marches. Breitbart, the conservative website, said the events were \u201cdirected, promoted and funded by left-wing adults and adult-led organizations.\u201dAlthough adults were involved in some planning \u2014 an organizer listed on the National Park Service permit for the march in Washington, for example, is a prominent activist from California \u2014 there is little doubt that students were crucial to orchestrating Saturday\u2019s events. In Washington, the area seemed to influence the program, which included Parkland students and celebrity guests but also a choir from Baltimore and remarks from a local 11-year-old girl.\u201cThe kids did everything,\u201d said Jenn Hoadley, 36, who helped students organize a march in Anchorage. \u201cAll I did was say, \u2018You want a stage? Cool. I\u2019ll find one for you. You need a sound system? Cool. I\u2019ll find one for you. You want to march in the park? I do paperwork to help you get that done.\u2019 They planned it all, and they should be given credit for that.\u201dIn New York, a Facebook group, envisioned to coordinate the efforts of about 30 friends and classmates to attend a march, swelled into the planning apparatus for the city\u2019s major event. The group\u2019s creator, Alex Clavering, a Columbia Law School student, was quickly regarded as the official organizer.So that was what he became. He convened meetings and established a fund-raising effort. He applied for a city parade permit \u2014 at first, he recalled, for a turnout of 3,000 to 5,000 people. By the end of the first week, he had changed it to 30,000 people. (The mayor\u2019s office ultimately estimated that nearly 200,000 people marched on Saturday.)The early days, Mr. Clavering, 26, said, were \u201cdecentralized, figuring it out, being scrappy.\u201d But more established gun control groups soon got in touch, offering to connect him to others and, eventually, to pick up expenses that included lighting, sound equipment and stages.Mr. Clavering\u2019s GoFundMe campaign raised more than $25,000, but he said the cost for the entire event was likely around $100,000.And although groups like Everytown provided the infrastructure and expertise, Mr. Clavering, who had never before planned an event of such scale, said they always remained hands-off. They left the decision-making to a core group of about 20 student organizers.In Vermont, Ms. Knoop, a freshman at Johnson State College, recalled how she popped into a few Vermont-centric Facebook groups in February to see if anyone was planning an event in her state. She was quickly advised to check in with the people who would know: Women\u2019s March Vermont.\u201cI just messaged them and I was like, \u2018Do you know if anything is happening yet?\u2019 and they were like, \u2018No, we were waiting for a youth to come forward who wanted to lead the event.\u2019\u201dMs. Knoop said Women\u2019s March officials shared their organizing skills and spreadsheets with contact information for politicians, media outlets and other organizations that might want to help out. Ms. Knoop applied for a permit to hold a rally on the steps of the gold-topped, Greek Revival State House in Montpelier and said a group called the Peace & Justice Center handled the liability insurance. And Ms. Knoop worked with Gun Sense Vermont, which advocates tighter gun laws in the state. The group also helped with planning and managed the event\u2019s finances, including one of the grants Everytown issued.\u201cThey handled the finances, any donations we got, they were paying for everything, which was really, really helpful,\u201d Ms. Knoop said.And there were business contributions. Ben & Jerry\u2019s, the ice cream maker, paid for buses to shuttle demonstrators to Montpelier.That left Ms. Knoop to attend long weekly planning meetings in Burlington, about an hour away from her school.She used the time she had between classes to send emails and make phone calls to hammer out logistics for the rally.\u201cI definitely fell back in school a bit for it,\u201d Ms. Knoop said, \u201cbut to me, that was worth it.\u201dReporting was contributed by Jill Burke, Jose A. Del Real, Julie Turkewitz and Noah Weiland.videoAdvertisement"}

But the effort has been slowed by what critics call a series of government missteps and the spread of false rumors about the vaccine.\u201cWhen they stopped coming to us, we started going to them,\u201d said Nancy Mar\u00e7al Bastos, health and sanitation director for northern S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cPeople have a lot of excuses for why they haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine yet, but when we show up, it\u2019s usually easy to convince them.\u201dToting coolers full of vaccines, health workers stop in the corner bar and the local gym, demanding: \u201cWho hasn\u2019t been vaccinated yet? Line up!\u201d The workers jab extended arms and fill out forms with surprising speed, then start moving house to house.The challenges are daunting.But that didn\u2019t happen, said Dr. Sylvain Aldighieri, chief of epidemic response for the Pan American Health Organization.\u201cThere was lab-confirmed transmission during the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the amount of virus around at the beginning of the summer was already huge.\u201dThe resurgent virus is now lunging forward more than a mile a day, he said, and efforts to stop an epidemic have become a race between the virus and the vaccinators.This year\u2019s caseload is 26 percent higher than at this time last year, and with more hot, rainy months ahead, the figure is destined to increase.\u201cBrazil\u2019s public health response was very delayed,\u201d said Dr. Karin A. Nielsen, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, who does research in Brazil. \u201cMonkeys were dying in the wild two to three years ago.\u201dDr. Jess\u00e9 Reis Alves, a travel medicine specialist here, said the vaccination campaign should have been launched \u201cin a calm moment between outbreaks.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cthey waited for a new outbreak.\u201dIn September, vaccinations were given to people living around forests near S\u00e3o Paulo where dead monkeys were found; the suburbs were targeted only in November.\u201cSome people began trashing the vaccine, saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to kill you\u2019,\u201d said Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques Jr., an expert in mosquito-borne diseases at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt was picked up in the media.\u201dThe vaccine, invented in the 1930s, is highly effective \u2014 one dose normally provides lifetime protection. But it is not harmless. It cannot be given to newborns or anyone with a compromised immune system. It is given to people older than 60, pregnant women, or children younger than 8 months only when the risk of infection is high.About one recipient in 100,000 suffers a dangerous reaction like jaundice, hepatitis or encephalitis, Dr. Marques said, and about one in a million dies. \u201cIf you vaccinate 30 million people, you\u2019ll get about 30 deaths,\u201d he said.But if yellow fever infected 30 million people, two million could die.So, with the disease moving rapidly forward, health authorities announced that they hoped to inoculate 95 percent of the population in 77 cities and towns in the virus\u2019s path \u2014 a total of 23 million people, including 12 million in this city alone.But \u201cthey didn\u2019t have 12 million shots to give us,\u201d said Dr. Wilson M. Pollara, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s health secretary. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing it in phases \u2014 two million at a time.\u201dThe global vaccine stockpile, overseen by the World Health Organization, normally contains only six million doses, made by only four manufacturers, including the Cruz foundation.But Brazil has scaled up its production to about 5 million doses per month and will soon be able to double that, said Dr. William Perea, the W.H.O.\u2019s epidemic control coordinator.That should easily cover Brazil\u2019s needs for now, he said, so the global stockpile will not be drawn down. If necessary, it can be replenished; the four makers together can turn out 100 million doses a year in an emergency, he said.Thus far, however, only 5.5 million people have been vaccinated. Despite those low numbers, the Health Ministry has pushed back against critics, insisting it followed international procedures.\u201cI don\u2019t think there were mistakes or delays,\u201d said Dr. Renato Vieira Alves, the ministry\u2019s communicable disease coordinator. \u201cYou can\u2019t launch new vaccination campaigns in an instant.\u201dWhile the caseload is higher than last year\u2019s, it is only a fraction of the population at risk, he argued.\u201cMost of these new cases are occurring in areas where, until now, we didn\u2019t recommend immunization,\u201d he said.To overcome suspicion of the vaccine and frustration with long lines at clinics, vaccinators have begun going door-to-door or using tents shifted from one neighborhood to another. There, they hope face-to-face chats will succeed where other efforts have failed.Lucia Elena de Paula, 36, explained her fears to a nurse, saying, \u201cI saw a video on WhatsApp with a girl who said she was paralyzed after taking the vaccine.\u201dBut after a few soothing words from a staff member, she agreed to get the shot.After dragging her 10-year-old grandson into a gym where the vaccines sat on an exercise bench, Aparecida Caldeira, 61, explained why she had hesitated.\u201cWhen we went to the clinic in January, the lines were just too long,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful they came here. But that\u2019s just typical in Brazil \u2014 waiting to do everything at the last minute.\u201dShasta Darlington reported from S\u00e3o Paulo, and Donald G. McNeil Jr. from New York.Advertisement"}

But it also made him a nuisance in Silicon Valley, where tech executives publicly praise a spirit of openness even as many of them become more opaque.Mr. Stamos, a California native and a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, previously worked at start-ups and founded a security consulting firm in San Francisco before joining Yahoo as its chief security officer in mid-2014.He became somewhat of a legend in 2015 when he pushed back on government efforts to weaken security. At the time, after surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, Silicon Valley companies were adding anti-surveillance protections including encryption to their data centers and messaging tools. Washington accused tech companies of going too far, and the F.B.I. pressed companies like Apple to weaken their encryption or build in a government back door.Within Yahoo\u2019s security team, known as the \u201cParanoids,\u201d Mr. Stamos was considered an inspiration by many of its young engineers. But his vocal \u2014 at times abrasive \u2014 advocacy for privacy and anti-surveillance measures often put him at odds with Yahoo\u2019s leadership, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer.Mr. Stamos had successfully campaigned for Yahoo to encrypt the data flowing through its data centers. But when he pushed for end-to-end encryption \u2014 which ensures that only the parties in a conversation can see what is being said, leaving even Yahoo unable to read it \u2014 Ms. Mayer and other executives scoffed.Some of Mr. Stamos\u2019s other security proposals at Yahoo, such as resetting customers\u2019 passwords after a breach, were rejected because the added inconvenience might encourage Yahoo customers to leave.By then, Mr. Stamos had drawn the notice of Facebook executives. Some at the social network worried aloud whether he was too much of a firebrand to join the social network, according to three current and former Facebook employees who declined to be named because of nondisclosure agreements. But others argued that his activism was a benefit for the company.In a statement on Monday, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was \u201cproductive.\u201dAfter a breach of the Democratic National Committee in June 2016, Mr. Stamos pulled together a team to investigate Russian interference on Facebook. The findings pit him against executives in the company\u2019s legal and communications groups. While Mr. Stamos argued to disclose more, others said that by proactively disclosing what they had found, Facebook had become a target of further public ire, according to seven current and former Facebook employees.Internally, Mr. Stamos repeatedly argued that Facebook needed to act more like a defense contractor in dealing with security, given that the social network was becoming a similar target for nation states.The tape infuriated Mr. Stamos\u2019s bosses, according to the current and former employees. A leak investigation is continuing, two of the people said. They said some executives believed Mr. Stamos had leaked the audio himself to get Facebook to take his entreaties more seriously.By October, the relationship between Mr. Stamos and Ms. Sandberg had deteriorated over how to handle Russian interference on Facebook and how best to reorganize Facebook\u2019s security team before the midterm elections, according to more than half a dozen people who work or formerly worked at the company. Mr. Stamos proposed that instead of reporting to Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, he report directly to Facebook\u2019s higher-ups.Instead, executives released Mr. Stamos from much of his day-to-day responsibility, employees said.Mr. Stamos has said his remaining days at Facebook will be spent \u201cexploring emerging risks and working on election security.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jump-Starting the Aquavit Renaissance", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut over at the bar, one Nordic staple remains largely undiscovered: aquavit, the traditional Scandinavian spirit flavored with caraway or dill. There is only one aquavit cocktail on the menu, and only two at Agern, Mr. Meyer\u2019s upscale New Nordic restaurant next to the food hall. Though aquavits are available neat at both places, they are mostly an afterthought.\u201cFor Americans, traditional aquavit can be a little too heavy on the caraway,\u201d said Jonas Andersen, the food hall\u2019s beverage manager, referring to the seed that typically gives the drink its signature spicy bite. \u201cBut mezcal was an acquired taste, too. Now we love mezcal, and it\u2019s one of our friends.\u201dThe relative lack of interest in aquavit in the United States is not surprising. In Scandinavia, the spirit has struggled to find popularity among a younger generation that has embraced American-style cocktails.\u201cYounger bartenders and connoisseurs are rediscovering aquavit,\u201d said Thomas Klem Andersen, whose blog Cocktails of Copenhagen covers the city\u2019s bar scene. \u201cAfter years of hype about whiskey, rum and gin, many of us are exploring what\u2019s in our own backyard.\u201dAquavit, or akvavit (literally \u201cwater of life\u201d), is produced from a distilled grain or potato spirit and must be flavored predominantly with caraway or dill. There are usually other ingredients in the mix \u2014 like anise, fennel seed, cumin, cardamom and citrus peels \u2014 but the caraway or dill must be the lead botanical. (Aquavit is often referred to casually as \u201csnaps,\u201d but not all snaps can legally be aquavit; snaps is a more general term that includes spirits with flavors like berries, nuts, peppers or horseradish.)In essence, aquavit is like a gin flavored with caraway or dill rather than juniper. Given the current popularity of craft gins, it\u2019s surprising that aquavit has not quite found a wider audience. In Denmark, a number of smaller, craft distillers are experimenting with aquavits that ratchet up the juniper flavor, while keeping the necessary caraway character.Still, aquavit is the best-selling spirit in Denmark and Norway, by a long stretch. In Norway, where the domestic market is robust, aquavits are a premium liquor, traditionally aged in sherry casks and enjoyed after dinner like a Cognac or Scotch.Linie is just one of more than 40 aquavits available in Norway. Arcus expects to introduce one of its top labels, Opland, aged two years, to the United States in the near future.But in Denmark, many fear that as an older generation passes on, their love of aquavit will not be inherited by the next.\u201cWe have this stigmatized relationship with aquavit, from when we all drank so many shots at Christmas lunch and then threw up,\u201d said Rasmus Poulsgaard, a Copenhagen drinks consultant and co-author of \u201cAkvavit \u2014 Rediscovering a Nordic Spirit.\u201d \u201cMost older drinkers are super users. You\u2019d need to recruit 18 new young drinkers when you lose one super user.\u201dSome of aquavit\u2019s stagnation can be blamed on corporate neglect. From 1999 to 2008, Aalborg \u2014 Denmark\u2019s best-selling aquavit \u2014 was owned by V&S, the Swedish state-owned monopoly, which was then bought by Pernod Ricard, ostensibly to acquire Absolut vodka. The aquavit brand languished under Pernod Ricard\u2019s watch. Arcus bought the brand in 2013.As a result, Aalborg aquavit largely sat out the cocktail renaissance that began a decade ago, when bartenders and drinkers discovered all sorts of new spirits. Because of this missed opportunity, aquavit innovation was first driven by small craft producers in Denmark.Arcus, as the biggest player, has embraced craft aquavit. The company now promotes its dill aquavit, Dild, which is popular among Copenhagen bartenders. In Norway, at its Atlungstad distillery, Arcus has a young team distilling small batches of juniper-forward aquavit and one infused with butter.In August, Arcus sponsored Spirikum, a snaps and aquavit festival where two dozen craft producers from Nordic countries, and a few from the United States, gathered at Copenhagen Distillery. This type of cooperation between large and small companies rarely happens with spirits like whiskey or vodka. \u201cWe have to have an open-door policy with the smaller producers,\u201d said Lars Kragelund, Arcus\u2019s technical brand director for Aalborg. \u201cWe have to unite our forces.\u201dIn the United States, interest in aquavit may take a while to grow.\u201cIt\u2019s very tempting for aquavit producers to jump on the New York train right way,\u201d said Jonas Andersen, of the food hall in Grand Central. \u201cWe need a young generation in Scandinavia to get excited about aquavit before it gets popular in New York.\u201dAquavit is harder to find in the United States than in Nordic countries, but here are five varieties that are more widely available.

You Can Try", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixKeep in mind that Facebook isn\u2019t the only company capable of collecting your information. One big culprit: Web trackers, like cookies embedded into websites and their ads. They are everywhere, and they follow your activities from site to site.Here are some answers to questions that many people are posing to The New York Times via social media.What are the alternatives to using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp?There are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp. But they have drawbacks and aren\u2019t as far-reaching as WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion monthly users.Instagram, which has more than 800 million monthly users, is also a tough one, giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing. The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself, which has its own photo-sharing features. Remember Flickr? The Yahoo-owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor, and it\u2019s like a graveyard of people\u2019s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram.How else do you keep in touch with friends and family? How do you create and discover events? How do you market and manage customer service for your small business? How do you spark and build grass-roots movements?Facebook is the one-stop shop to accomplish all those tasks. But if you have the patience, you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience.As for customer service, many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints. Yelp, the reviews site for local businesses, is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences, and business owners often engage with people there.What does it mean to delete Facebook? How can you actually delete your account?After you delete your account, it won\u2019t be recoverable. But there are caveats.Shadows of your digital self would remain on the site. For example, if people uploaded photos of you, those photos will still be there. The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won\u2019t disappear, either.When you delete your account, you are only deleting the media you posted, like your status updates and photos that you uploaded. That\u2019s not going to do much for your privacy, considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people. All of your friends (and their friends, too) would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect.What other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook? Why do so many apps require a Facebook login?One painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third-party apps and websites that are tied to your account. Over the past decade, many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company\u2019s login tool, Facebook Login.If you were to delete Facebook, you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login. But fortunately, many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them, and many also let you log in through your Google account.It\u2019s not impossible to delete Facebook. But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use.Where does Facebook really equal the internet?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fighting Poverty, Drugs and Even Violence, All on a Teacher\u2019s Salary", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWho made history?\u201d chanted the throng of red-clad teachers, who had defied state officials and, at times, even their own union leaders, by staging a nearly two-week walkout. \u201cWe made history!\u201dThe strike indeed takes a place in history, and not just for the result.Since the earliest days of teacher organizing more than a century ago, almost every moment of teacher activism has come during times of social upheaval. In 1897, the modern teachers\u2019 union movement was born in Chicago, where teachers presided over classrooms of up to 60 children, many of whom could not speak English, in a city surging with immigrants and struggling to control rampant child labor and typhoid in the water. All for the equivalent of $13,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars.\u201cThe work is all-encompassing,\u201d said Karla Hilliard, a high school English teacher in Martinsburg, W.Va., and one of roughly 20,000 teachers who participated in the statewide strike.\u201cIn West Virginia we deal with high levels of poverty and the opioid epidemic,\u201d she said, \u201cbut then there are the smaller things, like kids who come in and they don\u2019t have support at home and they just need someone to care about them and love them.\u201dThe strike began in protest of a plan to give teachers a 2 percent raise this July and 1 percent in each of the next two years, after years of stagnating pay and rising health insurance costs. Last week, after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, announced a plan to increase pay by 5 percent, union leaders said classes would resume. But teachers refused, demanding that the Legislature vote to make the raise official. That finally happened on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear where the money would come from, but the governor promised there would not be cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many students we have being raised by grandparents because of parents\u2019 drug addictions,\u201d said Jay O\u2019Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher and a leader of the strike. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of a broader problem teaching here, dealing with the effects of poverty.\u201dAt Mr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s school, Stonewall Jackson Middle School in Charleston, teachers use their own money to stock a closet for students whose clothes are dirty or do not fit, or who come in wearing shorts when it is freezing outside. At faculty meetings each year, they draw some children\u2019s names off an \u201cangel tree\u201d and provide them with Christmas gifts, because otherwise they would not get any.Recently, Mr. O\u2019Neal said, teachers have noticed that some students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., have been coming to school unmedicated and disrupting an entire class; the teachers suspect parents are selling their children\u2019s medications.Since the mid-19th century, it has generally been the women who have been expected to do this kind of difficult, nurturing work. That gender divide played a big role in early teacher activism.Today, about 75 percent of teachers in West Virginia and across the United States are female. When teachers first unionized in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, 97 percent were women, and they were paid little more than maids.Policymakers did not see that as a problem. Instead, they wanted to devote their extra funds to recruiting male teachers, who they thought would be tougher, and thus better able to control those huge, 60-student classes.The female teachers got angry, launched their federation, and within several years had secured a raise. They shocked the nation\u2019s elite by marching, in petticoats, alongside Teamsters and other male unionists.But the striking teachers asked that the State Legislature first consider the basics: the salaries and benefits that they say would keep them from fleeing the state. Terry Moe, a Stanford political scientist and often a critic of teachers\u2019 unions, said on Monday that West Virginia teachers were not asking for anything radical.\u201cA 5 percent raise is not much,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made that West Virginia ought to put more priority on education, and they\u2019re not.\u201dMs. Hilliard\u2019s school, Spring Mills High School, has had drills and lockdowns to prepare faculty and students for threats such as a potential school gunman. Recently the school ran a \u201ccode red\u201d drill that she thought was real, because teachers were not warned in advance. \u201cIt was nothing short of terrifying,\u201d she said.\u201cOur job descriptions are expanding,\u201d said Ms. Hilliard, who opposes the idea of arming teachers, which West Virginia currently does not allow.\u201cIt becomes \u2018Lay down your life if you have to.\u2019\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Filipino Food Finds a Place in the American Mainstream", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday, bagoong and other Filipino foods are finally entering the American mainstream, more than a century after the United States Navy sailed into Manila Bay, sank the Spanish Armada and took control of the archipelago, a restive colony of around 7,100 islands and 180 languages. Americans of Filipino heritage now make up one in five of all Asian-Americans, second only to Chinese in number, and the largest percentage of immigrants serving in the United States military were born in the Philippines.The flavors of Filipino cooking, like Rizal\u2019s broken jar of bagoong, still have the power to startle those unfamiliar with them.Although Filipino food draws on early encounters with Malay, Chinese and Arab traders as well as centuries of Spanish occupation, its profile is distinct: salty and sour above all, with less of the mitigating sweetness and chile-stoked fire found in the cooking of its Southeast Asian neighbors.Bagoong \u2014 ranging from muddy brown to plumeria pink in color, commonly made of tiny krill, anchovies or bonnetmouths \u2014 brings to soups and stews a depth of flavor that evokes cheese interred in caves and aged steak, with an extra dimension of ocean floor.It also may be eaten straight, daubed on rice or anointing slices of green mango. Along with its byproduct, patis (fish sauce), it\u2019s an essential seasoning that claims a place on the table next to suka (vinegar) and banana ketchup (bananas cooked down in vinegar and tomato paste), as much a condiment as an ingredient.How to take the bounty of fish from the surrounding seas and make it last? Cure it in suka and it becomes kinilaw, an ancient recipe that may have been one of the earliest forms of ceviche. To this might be added the bite of ginger, the silkiness of coconut milk, or a sunny kiss of calamansi, which has a sharper sting than lime.For another staple, daing na bangus, milkfish is relieved of its bones, splayed and soaked in vinegar overnight for tenderness, then crisped in a pan. You can eat the flesh with a spoon.Lumpia, cousins to Chinese spring rolls, are dunked in sawsawan (dipping sauce), which may be as straightforward as vinegar with a stutter of raw garlic. The rolls come fried to a crackle or \u201cfresh,\u201d with uncooked, doughy skins that suggest crepes, and filled with anything from ground meat to hearts of palm to whole green finger chiles, a variation called, rightly, dynamite.The souring agent in sinigang changes by the map: It might be tamarind, guava, alibangbang leaves, kamias (the fruit of the sorrel tree), batuan (kin to mangosteen) or unripe pineapple \u2014 whatever is on hand in the region. Place matters to Filipinos, who often have tangled roots as a result of internal migration and speak multiple languages.At Lasa, the chef Chad Valencia uses rhubarb for sinigang when it\u2019s in season. \u201cOur region is Los Angeles,\u201d he said.To balance the sourness of adobo and sinigang, she suggests kare-kare, a nutty-sweet stew of oxtail, bok choy, string beans and eggplant, traditionally simmered with ground peanuts and achuete oil; peanut butter, a modern substitute, lends voluptuousness.The history of kare-kare is often traced to a 20-month interregnum in the 18th century when the British wrested Manila from the Spanish. Indian cooks attending the Royal Navy brought the name and notion of curry to the islands, and had to make do with local spices.Kare-kare, sinigang and adobo are likely to appear on most Filipino menus in the United States, from turo-turo (point-point) steam-table joints to sophisticated restaurants. So, too, is dinuguan, a pork-blood stew that can pose a challenge even for Filipinos.\u201cWhen I was growing up, dinuguan was a kind of culinary boogeyman, a dish that adults would tell gory stories about to scare children,\u201d said Genevieve Villamora, one of the owners of Bad Saint.But the mineral-rich blood is what gives the stew its ballast and faintly metallic hint of a licked knife. It must be cooked carefully so that the blood doesn\u2019t congeal; done right, it turns to velvet. At Bad Saint, dinuguan has become one of the best-selling dishes, without the veil of euphemism.It\u2019s considered particularly lucky to eat pancit (noodles) on birthdays, their uncut strands promising long life. The name of the noodles is derived from a Hokkien phrase for \u201cfast food.\u201d Like their Chinese antecedents, they come in different shapes and textures: miki (made with egg), bihon (rice), sotanghon (mung bean) and canton (wheat). Recipes might include sluices of soy sauce and calamansi and toppings of shrimp heads, quail eggs, shucked oysters or chicharron.For the highest occasion \u2014 like Ms. Dimayuga\u2019s grandmother\u2019s 99th birthday last year \u2014 there can be only one centerpiece: lechon, whole roasted pig, its shining, lacquer-thin skin primed to shatter.\u201cIt\u2019s trendy here to go head to tail, but there it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d Mr. Phojanakong said. After a party, the lechon is broken down: \u201cYou use the head for sisig\u201d \u2014 a sizzle of jowl and ears \u2014 \u201ctrotters for adobo, make dinuguan with blood and innards and turn leftovers into paksiw,\u201d a vinegary stew contoured with a p\u00e2t\u00e9-like liver spread.The backdrop to these dishes is always rice. Its earthy scent is the constant when you walk into a Filipino home, almost a ripening in the air. To Ms. Fernandez, rice was \u201cthe shaper of other foods,\u201d its soothing blandness allowing other dishes to be stronger in contrast.Beyond these greatest hits are regional specialties, which Mr. Dorotan, a native of Bicol in southeastern Luzon, wishes would get more attention. At Purple Yam, he makes laing, taro leaves simmered in coconut milk (the trademark of Bicolano cooking) until lush.But which regional specialties does he want to see more of? He laughed. There are so many islands.\u201cEven I do not know,\u201d he said.A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the kind of dried fish shown. It is danggit (rabbitfish), not bangus (milkfish).cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Next Lesson: Rosso di Montalcino", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolRosso di Montalcino is the younger sibling of Brunello di Montalcino. Brunello must be aged for at least four years after the vintage before it can be released. That\u2019s quite an investment of time and money, and if things do not go smoothly in certain vintages, producers may end up with little wine to sell.That\u2019s where Rosso di Montalcino comes in. It requires only one year of aging before it can be released, which gives producers something to sell as they await the Brunello.Rosso is also a way of improving the Brunello. Instead of using younger vines or vines from lesser sites in the more expensive, prestigious Brunello, which might compromise its quality, they can go into the Rosso.Does this mean Rosso di Montalcino is an inferior wine? It depends what you mean by that. No, Rosso will not have Brunello\u2019s potential to achieve complexity and evolve over time. It most likely will be less tannic, lighter and less concentrated.At the same time, Rossos will be easier to drink and more pleasurable on release than Brunellos, which generally requires some aging. They will be cheaper. They will not have the depth of Brunello, but they can be delicious everyday reds.Like Brunello, Rosso di Montalcino is required to be 100 percent sangiovese. This sets the Montalcino wines apart from other Tuscan sangiovese-based wines like Chianti and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, in which blending with other grapes is permitted.The three Rossos I recommend are:If you cannot find these bottles, many others will do, particularly if the producer makes a good Brunello. Among other producers to look for, I suggest Conti Costanti, Fattoria dei Barbei, Caparzo, Poggio Antico, Il Paradiso di Manfredi, Uccelliera, Il Poggione and Altesino. If money is no object, I highly recommend the Rossos from Poggio di Soto and Biondi-Santi, which can run roughly from $75 to $100.Sangiovese is versatile with food. It will go with many Italian dishes, naturally, especially with cooked tomato sauce, as well as cooked meats like sausages, beef and roast chicken. Serve just a bit cool, though not chilled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Readers React: What Is the Healthiest Way to Feed a Baby?", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of our readers suggested that the benefits of baby-led weaning may lie in what, instead of how, babies are fed, a conclusion also reached by several medical professionals who commented on the article. Below is a selection of comments on the article.Putting out, say, some scrambled eggs, cooked carrot chunks, banana chunks, cooked squash, etc. for my toddlers resulted in extremely healthy, normal weight kids, who continue to be extremely healthy to this day. Oh, and I made my own baby food \u2014 did big batches on the weekend and froze little baby servings. I never used that stuff in jars. That might have made a difference too.We need to trust our babies. They can\u2019t get fat on breastmilk or healthy, natural finger foods.Did anyone consider that what you eat may be more important than how you eat?I nursed my son for a year and a half. When he was about 7 months old, I put some peas on his highchair tray, and he ate them. A few days later I gave him something else we were eating. As time went on, he was eating a wide variety of foods. I never made baby food, never bought baby food and never spoon fed him.Three children and I can count on my two hands the total number of times I spoon fed. Their skill in getting food in their mouths corresponded perfectly with their increased need for that food. A beautifully elegant transition. You just have to be willing to put up with some messes for a little bit.We did not have to feed him while we were eating our dinner! We relaxed and ate and talked to each other and kept a close eye on him. He played with the food on his plate and tasted it, and derived some nutrition from it. He developed his fine motor skills, so that he could pick up the foods. He tried a wide variety of foods and is not a picky eater.The doctor told my wife, \u201cthe baby will tell you when he\u2019s done eating,\u201d so she took her at her word. He loved his bottle and by the age of 6 months looked like a very well-fed, miniature Henry VIII, complete with double chin.We basically tried the baby-led weaning thing and, for whatever reason, he now eats anything and everything. So much so that we now have to worry about his weight.Parents\u2019 own food habits have a large impact on their children, and eating a well-balanced diet in front of your children \u2014 even as babies \u2014 has a big impact on their future.The goal is not to be authoritarian any more than it is to be indulgent, but instead to authoritatively provide the structure that allows for only healthy food selection and helps children learn how to pay attention to their internal cues.By all means, do whatever you can to provide a healthy diet to your kids. Just don\u2019t expect that you\u2019re necessarily going to prevent future weight problems by doing so.We\u2019ve created a problem where there never was one. Some people\u2019s bodies are just going to be fat and we need to stop pathologizing them. And doing this to babies is even more messed up.It seems to be clearer now that avoiding processed foods and refined sugars gives people of all ages a fighting chance to achieve a non-obese B.M.I., but it\u2019s a hard fight for those genetically programmed to be fat.As a pediatrician, I find the whole concept of baby-led feeding practices a scam. Babies don\u2019t get their food, nor control how they eat; their parents interpret their desires. All feeding, therefore, is parent determined.As babies turn to solids, parents must be aware that the most nutritious foods don\u2019t come from a box or bag.Dietary caution against obesity from the very beginning is appropriate. And we need to monitor not only how our children eat, but what they eat, starting with our industrial food chain.Now we\u2019d like to hear from you: Do you have experience feeding babies? Did you try baby-led weaning? If so, what was your experience? Or did you try a different approach? Tell us about it in the comments section of this article.A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Russian Ex-Spy, U.K. Sees Cold War Echoes", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALISBURY, England \u2014 The gentle stroll from Zizzi\u2019s, a restaurant in the center of this sleepy cathedral town, to Sainsbury\u2019s, a popular nearby supermarket, could scarcely be less remarkable. Turn right past the town library, through a covered alleyway, past the gym on the left, over a bubbling mill stream and \u2014 90 seconds later \u2014 you have arrived.Yet, on Sunday afternoon, this most brief and benign of walks may have been the setting for an attempted assassination reminiscent of the most far-fetched Cold War skulduggery.It was the route that Sergei V. Skripal, a former intelligence official freed from a Russian prison as part of a celebrated 2010 spy exchange, is believed to have taken with his daughter before both were found in a catatonic state on a bench outside Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201cShould evidence emerge that implies state responsibility, then Her Majesty\u2019s government will respond appropriately and robustly,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who confirmed the identities of the victims. \u201cThough I am not now pointing fingers, I say to governments around the world that no attempt to take innocent life on U.K. soil will go unsanctioned and unpunished.\u201dThe comment drew a rebuke from the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova. \u201cThis is simply ignorance,\u201d she said, the Interfax news agency reported.Ms. Zakharova said she was bewildered that \u201cthe man, who works in foreign policy and has nothing to do with law enforcement, was making such claims.\u201d She said, \u201cWe presume that law enforcement and security agencies first will get at least some real evidence and then share it.\u201dMr. Skripal and his daughter remained in critical condition on Tuesday at Salisbury District Hospital, about 85 miles southwest of London. The police said they had suffered \u201cexposure to an unknown substance.\u201d\u201cThis is a form of soft war that Russia is now waging against the West,\u201d said Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the British Parliament.In Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s case, the weapon is believed to have been a poisoned teapot later found to contain polonium 210, a radioactive isotope; his death was slow and agonizing. In 1978, when Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident, was killed on Waterloo Bridge in London, the weapon was an umbrella tipped with a pellet of ricin.The Skripal family has had its own suspicions about the Russian government, the BBC reported. Mr. Skripal\u2019s brother died two years ago, and just last year, the family said, his son succumbed to liver failure while on vacation in St. Petersburg, Russia. Mr. Skripal\u2019s wife, Lyudmila, died of cancer in 2012.Mr. Tugendhat said that Britain should consider revoking the broadcast license of RT, the Kremlin-funded channel formerly called Russia Today. \u201cI see absolutely no reason why we should allow information warfare to be carried out on U.K. soil by hostile agents,\u201d he said.Citing the unusual circumstances, the Metropolitan Police Service put Britain\u2019s counterterrorism police in charge of the case on Tuesday, though it has not yet been determined whether terrorism was involved.The idyllic setting of the episode, deep in the English countryside, a few hundred meters from one of Britain\u2019s oldest cathedrals, struck many as bizarre. In a town best known for its quaint streets and postcard-perfect cottages, as well as its proximity to Stonehenge, the world-renowned neolithic monument beyond the hills nearby, residents were stunned by their sudden proximity to international intrigue.\u201cWe\u2019re as surprised as anybody at our elevation to the national stage,\u201d said John Walsh, a member of Mr. Skripal\u2019s neighborhood council. He said he had visited residents near Mr. Skripal\u2019s home a few days ago, \u201csorting out a problem with a hedge \u2014 which is more my level of activity, rather than high espionage.\u201dPolice specialists wearing hazardous material suits cordoned off part of the shopping district where the Skripals were found, while officers from multiple law enforcement agencies combed the area for evidence.\u201cIt\u2019s the talk of the town,\u201d said Frogg Moody, another councilor from Mr. Skripal\u2019s district. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely taken Salisbury by storm.\u201dOn Mr. Skripal\u2019s quiet street in the west of the town, his neighbors seemed shocked by both the sudden carousel of journalists and by the news that they had been living next to a former Russian spy.\u201cHe was just an ordinary person,\u201d said James Puttock, a 47-year-old scaffolder who lives four doors down from Mr. Skripal. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was a Russian spy.\u201d\u201cHow do you even know?\u201d he mused. \u201cDo I look like a Russian spy?\u201dMarina Litvinenko, the wife of the Russian spy killed in London in 2006, told the BBC that the plight of Mr. Skripal was \u201clike d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d and suggested that Russia was behind his apparent poisoning.The Russian government said it had no information about the incident, and Dmitri S. Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said accusations of Kremlin involvement \u201cweren\u2019t long in coming.\u201d\u201cYou know how he ended up in the West, what actions and decisions led him there,\u201d Mr. Peskov said.Mr. Rowley, the British counterterrorism official, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. \u201cI think we have to remember that Russian exiles aren\u2019t immortal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do all die, and there can be a tendency for some conspiracy theories. But likewise, we have to be alive to the fact of state threats, as illustrated by the Litvinenko case.\u201dOn Tuesday afternoon, amid reports that some of the first emergency workers to tend to Mr. Skripal and his daughter were later treated for wheezing and eye problems, the bench where the pair was found was still cordoned off. It was obscured by a white-and-yellow evidence tent.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when a Russian intelligence officer and his daughter were found unconscious. It was Sunday, not Monday.Patrick Kingsley reported from Salisbury, England, and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London.

{"Headline": "Donald Glover Publishes Spoof \u2018Deadpool\u2019 Script After Exiting Series", "Date": "2018-03-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil last week, the comedian and television creator Donald Glover was working on an animated series for FX about the Marvel superhero Deadpool, a violent mercenary character known for his wisecracks and toilet humor.By this week, the project had been canceled and Mr. Glover was on Twitter publicly raising more questions about what led to his departure from the show.The project, planned as a 10-episode run for the FXX channel and announced in May, was to have been a collaboration with Mr. Glover\u2019s brother Stephen, another pairing of the siblings behind the show \u201cAtlanta,\u201d which airs on FX. (FXX is FX\u2019s sister channel, and both are owned by 21st Century Fox.)But on Saturday, FX, citing \u201ccreative differences,\u201d announced that the project had been canceled. Its statement said the Glovers had agreed to part ways with the network and with Marvel television.Mr. Glover, who also releases music under the name Childish Gambino, disputed that characterization in a tweet thread on Wednesday: \u201cFor the record: I wasn\u2019t too busy to work on \u2018Deadpool,\u2019\u201d he said.He then posted pages of a script that used the Deadpool character \u2014 who is known for speaking to readers or moviegoers directly \u2014 to think through the cancellation.In the script, which is filled with pop culture references, including several that allude to events from the last few days, Deadpool considers whether racism was a factor in the cancellation and remarks upon specific scripts that may have alienated the Glovers\u2019 collaborators.Mr. Glover\u2019s tweet thread was a remarkable way to shed a light upon industry drama that does not often reach social media, a public statement in the form of a puzzle in the form of a script that both confounded and intrigued his fans.But John Solberg, a network spokesman for FX, said that no one at the network had taken issue with those comments and that the unraveling of the Deadpool project had nothing to do with the interview. He said that the network had supported the brothers\u2019\u2019s vision for the show but that Marvel owned the intellectual property rights to the Deadpool character and had decided to go a different way. He also emphasized that there was no acrimony between FX and Marvel, and said that creative differences often led to projects falling apart.The 14-page script Mr. Glover posted to Twitter was labeled if it were the series finale of the canceled show. Halfway through the story, Deadpool, who seems throughout as if he may be speaking for Mr. Glover, addresses the show\u2019s cancellation directly.\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not mad about this whole \u2018canceled thing,\u2019\u201d the script reads. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s a good thing. I mean, is it even a good time to have a violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV?\u201dThere is a brief pause, and the script continues: \u201cOther than the PRESIDENT!\u201dMarvel declined to comment. Mr. Glover did not respond to emails.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of Donald Glover\u2019s brother and collaborator.

{"Headline": "A Quiet Drug Problem Among the Elderly", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": " The New Old AgeDespite warnings from experts, older people are using more anti-anxiety and sleep medications, putting them at risk of serious side effects and even overdoses.Supported byAt first, the pills helped her feel so much better.Jessica Falstein, an artist living in the East Village in Manhattan, learned she had an anxiety disorder in 1992. It led to panic attacks, a racing pulse, sleeplessness. \u201cWhenever there was too much stress, the anxiety would become almost intolerable, like acid in the veins,\u201d she recalled.When a psychopharmacologist prescribed the drug Klonopin, everything brightened. \u201cIt just leveled me out,\u201d Ms. Falstein said. \u201cI had more energy. And it helped me sleep, which I was desperate for.\u201dAfter several months, however, the horrible symptoms returned. \u201cMy body became accustomed to half a milligram, and the drug stopped working,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then I was up to one milligram. And then two.\u201d Her doctor kept increasing the dosage and added Ativan to the mix.Now 67, with her health and stamina in decline, Ms. Falstein has been diligently working to wean herself from both medications, part of the class called benzodiazepines that is widely prescribed for insomnia and anxiety. \u201cThey turn on you,\u201d she said.Even patients taking the drugs exactly as prescribed can unwittingly wind up in this situation, since both sleep problems and chronic pain occur more frequently at older ages. \u201cA psychiatrist puts a woman on Xanax,\u201d Dr. Humphreys said. \u201cThen she hurts her hip, so her primary care physician prescribes Vicodin.\u201dBut fatal overdoses \u2014 which are a comparatively tiny number given the size of the older population \u2014 represent just one of many longtime concerns about these medications.\u201cSet aside the opioid issue,\u201d said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist at the National Institutes for Health. \u201cWay too many older Americans are getting benzos. And of those, many \u2014 more than half \u2014 are getting them for prolonged periods. That\u2019s just bad practice. They have serious consequences.\u201dProbably the most serious: falls and fractures, already a common danger for older people, because benzos can cause dizziness. They\u2019re also associated with auto accidents, given that they cause drowsiness and fatigue.In both studies, women used the drugs more than men.Persuading older people that benzos can hurt them \u2014 and that alternative treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and improved sleep hygiene can be as effective for insomnia, though they take longer \u2014 has proved an uphill fight.Some people take benzos for years without increasing the dose, so describing them as \u201cdependent\u201d or \u201chabituated\u201d \u2014 let alone \u201caddicted\u201d \u2014 often causes angry reactions.\u201cDrug problems are deeply stigmatized,\u201d Dr. Humphreys said. \u201cPeople feel it\u2019s insulting to say they might have a problem with a drug.\u201dNevertheless, even people who have taken benzos for extended periods without noticing any problem face potential harms at older ages, Dr. Humphreys noted.\u201cThere\u2019s a parallel with alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you had a double Scotch before dinner without problems through your 50s. In your 60s, you get lightheaded\u201d from the same amount, because older bodies metabolize drugs differently. (Alcohol, by the way, is another substance you don\u2019t want to combine with benzodiazepines.)Persuading users that they should stop is only the first step, however. \u201cWeaning someone off these things when they\u2019ve become habituated is incredibly difficult,\u201d Dr. Schoenbaum said.But it\u2019s not easy.\u201cYou never, ever recommend that someone stop cold turkey,\u201d Dr. Maust said. That can bring withdrawal symptoms that include nausea, chills, anxiety, even delirium. \u201cYou taper down very gradually.\u201dBut some find it takes much longer, with rebound effects unlike those of other habituating drugs.When Ms. Falstein began experiencing \u201cjelly legs\u201d that left her too weak to stand for long, increased panic attacks, extreme fatigue and other health problems, she and her psychopharmacologist agreed that she should begin tapering off her benzos.\u201cI thought I\u2019d be off them in a year, maybe two,\u201d Ms. Falstein said. But it has taken five so far, with the support of a Facebook group and a \u201ctaper friend\u201d she speaks to almost daily. Using a method called liquid titration, she has been able to discontinue Ativan and cut back to less than a daily milligram of Klonopin.Though she suffered a variety of debilitating symptoms, \u201cI was determined,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going as quickly but as safely as I can.\u201dShe figures she has two years to go.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the federal agency overseeing veterans\u2019 health care.

{"Headline": "Russia Credits the West for Putin\u2019s Big Victory", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The Kremlin gave credit to a surprising source for the outpouring of support for Vladimir V. Putin in Sunday\u2019s presidential election \u2014 the West.\u201cOur people always unite when the chips are down,\u201d Ms. Pamfilova said on live television, in what appeared to be a reference to what Britain has said was a Russian nerve agent attack on one of its former spies, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter in Salisbury, England.\u201cThat\u2019s why a big thanks to certain leaders, I won\u2019t name them, of Western states, who also made their positive contribution, which contributed to the consolidation and unification of our people,\u201d she added.Mr. Putin\u2019s campaign spokesman, Andrei Kondrashov, was more explicit, saying, \u201cThanks to Britain, they\u2019ve ensured a level of turnout we weren\u2019t hoping to achieve by ourselves.\u201dThe Kremlin propaganda machine swung into action spreading that same message, that the results of the vote on Sunday were a rebuke to the West and a sign that Russia cannot be intimidated and should not be threatened.Vozhd is an old Russian word for chieftain, most commonly applied to Soviet rulers like Lenin and Stalin.Indeed, some commentators found parallels between the vote on Sunday and its Soviet-era antecedents. There was no real competition and no concrete discussion of issues. The front-runner neither participated in any debates nor laid out a campaign platform. As a result, there is now no real sense of what, if anything, the vozhd will do with his mandate.\u201cThe election results should be compared not with democracies, but with the Soviet Union,\u201d wrote Ivan Kurilla, a historian, on Facebook. \u201cBack then it was 99.9%, and now it\u2019s 75%. It\u2019s precisely by that 24% that today\u2019s elections are freer than Soviet ones.\u201dThere were also some complaints about irregularities. A few videos of ballot stuffing appeared, although the results from a couple such polling stations were quickly nullified. But critics worried about more sophisticated techniques.One of those was the new \u201cabsentee voting\u201d system that allowed people to vote where they were physically rather than where they were registered. One opposition organizer who said he managed to vote twice using the system was immediately charged with a misdemeanor. But that left open the question of how many people might have been able to abuse the system.The \u201celectoral sultanates\u201d that previously produced whopping numbers for Mr. Putin also seemed to have curbed their enthusiasm. In previous years the Republic of Chechnya, for example, habitually awarded Mr. Putin more than 99 percent of the vote with more than 99 percent turnout. This year it was a slightly more temperate 91.5 percent on both scales.Over all, Mr. Putin received some 56.4 million votes out of more than 110 million eligible voters, the most ever cast for a Russian president. Turnout was 67.5 percent. The closest candidate to him was Pavel N. Grudinin from the Communist Party with 11.78 percent, followed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a right-wing nationalist, with 5.65 percent. Ksenia A. Sobchak, the only woman, attracted just 1.68 percent.What effort Mr. Putin did make toward defining the next six years and his fourth term as president came in a March 1 state of the nation address, in which he promised to sharply increase social spending and to develop a whole new generation of nuclear weapons unlike any the world has ever seen. (Some were already operational, he claimed.)Critics worried that it was all part of a set piece of continued confrontation that started with the annexation of Crimea and the uprising in eastern Ukraine, and continued with the Skripal case.There was also no clear explanation of how Russia, with its stagnant economy, would pay for it all, but it certainly would mean abandoning the previous plan of turning Russia into a center of high-tech industries integrated into the global financial system, said Konstantin Gaaze, an analyst who writes frequently for the Carnegie Moscow Center.\u201cIt is the Soviet model,\u201d Mr. Gaaze said. \u201cSell more oil and send more money to research and development. Both schemes were tested in the late Soviet economy and both failed.\u201dSome experts dismissed the guns and butter speech as just so much campaign rhetoric that would go the way of other such promises and decrees, like the assurances of economic and social welfare improvements that Mr. Putin made the time of his last inauguration in May 2012.From the point of view of these experts, the overwhelming choice of Mr. Putin was rooted in his establishment of stability and rising living standards, especially after the chaotic 1990s, and pride in the rebuilt military and the country\u2019s higher standing in the world.The mood, said Evgeny Gontmakher, a prominent economist, was that \u201conly Putin can provide for us.\u201d The current federal budget projects a growth of 2 percent for each of the next three years, he noted, modest but enough to underwrite basic needs without pronounced change.Indeed, no voters interviewed at random in polling stations around Moscow mentioned \u201cnational consolidation\u201d in confrontation with the West as the reason they chose Mr. Putin, but plenty mentioned the economy.\u201cWe need to improve the economy now,\u201d said Irina I. Kuzmenko, who teaches the tenets of the Russian Orthodox faith to children, speaking after voting for Mr. Putin. \u201cLots of factories are lying in tatters.\u201dLater Sunday, as Mr. Putin moved between victory celebrations near the Kremlin, one man was shown on television telling him he needed to focus on the economy. \u201cThe people are asking that you do the same with the economy that you did with the army,\u201d the man said.Mr. Putin did not respond directly, saying that it was important for all political forces to act according to \u201ctheir common interests.\u201d\u201cThis is a very Soviet slogan,\u201d said Natalya V. Zubarevich, an expert in social and political geography at Moscow State University, noting that the mandate made it easier for Mr. Putin to do whatever he wanted. \u201cIt means gathering around the flag and maintaining patience when things are not so good.\u201dThey will need that patience, say many Western economists, who have attributed Russia\u2019s poor economic performance to the corruption and cronyism of the system Mr. Putin created and doubt it will much improve until that changes.The steady parade of Soviet memes fed speculation that the next piece of Soviet heritage that Mr. Putin might try to resurrect was erasing the term limits in the Constitution and returning to the leader-for-life Politburo system.Mr. Putin scoffed when asked about the idea on Sunday night, but others are not so sure, saying he may find it easier to change the Constitution and become president for life than to try to manage the succession struggle that would ensue when he steps down.If Mr. Putin\u2019s acolytes and supporters exulted at his victory, it left his critics with the uneasy sense that the leader would use his mandate to continue his campaign to muzzle the news media and restrict other civil liberties.Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquharIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "YouTube Cracks Down on Far-Right Videos as Conspiracy Theories Spread", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYouTube this week cracked down on the videos of some prominent far-right actors and conspiracy theorists, continuing an effort that has become more visible since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., last month caused a torrent of misinformation to be featured prominently on the site.The company\u2019s guidelines prohibit \u201cvideos that contain nudity or sexual content, violent or graphic content, harmful or dangerous content, hateful content, threats, spam, misleading metadata, or scams.\u201dYouTube denied that the deletions and other actions were ideologically driven. It said accounts that had been disciplined or banned were only the most prominent, and vocal, of many across the ideological spectrum who had seen their videos taken down for violating the site\u2019s rules.But critics said YouTube was reacting haphazardly in an attempt to purge actors who have garnered it negative attention. They questioned whether the site was prepared to substantively address the problem of the conspiracy theories that flourish on its platform.A YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that its \u201creviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology, and we use quality control measures to ensure they are applying our policies without bias.\u201d\u201cWith the volume of videos on our platform, sometimes we make mistakes and when this is brought to our attention we reinstate videos or channels that were incorrectly removed,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.The company is in the process of hiring many of those people. A spokeswoman said that applying the company\u2019s standards to any given video required training, and that new moderators were bound to make some mistakes. It said that some of the strikes that had been handed out since the Parkland shooting had been mistaken, though it did not specify which.\u201cIf these accounts are getting deleted at the last minute because people are angry and news organizations are digging into this, should these accounts have existed in the first place?\u201d he asked.Negative news media attention results in more users flagging videos of right-wing conspiracy theorists, leading to a feedback loop in which channels promoting those views are disciplined. The effect is that its disciplinary process is reactive, and relies on users to flag content they find troublesome.A YouTube spokeswoman said the company planned to release a transparency report in the spring that it says will show the full range of videos that have been taken down.\u201cThe extreme right loves being censored,\u201d he said. \u201cThey become heroes and raise tons of money every time YouTube removes or demonetizes their videos.\u201dYouTube does not police misinformation, which, on its own, does not violate the site\u2019s guidelines. But the company says it is confident that, with its steep increase in moderators and progress in machine learning, it will be capable of enforcing its rules effectively, which will help stem the tide of objectionable videos.Mr. Albright said that hiring many more people would help. But he said that those people would have to be trained to address difficult situations, applying the platform\u2019s rules to nuanced videos in which the right decision was not always clear.\u201cIt would take a group of people specifically trained in this kind of situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of scale.

{"Headline": "An Invisible Artwork Reminds Austria of Its Nazi Past", "Date": "2018-03-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cIt\u2019s so interesting in this busy square, so subtle,\u201d said Peter Larndorfer, 34, a passer-by, shortly after the work was unveiled on Monday. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s just what we need on such fraught ground.\u201dThe Nazis\u2019 propaganda footage of Hitler\u2019s triumphant speech to jubilant Austrians is infamous, and today is accepted as a realistic portrayal of the public mood at the time. But it took the country until the early 1990s to officially concede that Austrians had been willing perpetrators of Nazi crimes; after the war, the country was often spoken of as Hitler\u2019s \u201cfirst victim.\u201d For many \u201cthe Anschluss,\u201d as the incorporation of Austria into the Third Reich is known, remains a tricky subject.\u201cThe first transport to Dachau took place two weeks after the speech,\u201d said Ms. Philipsz, who won the Turner Prize in 2010, on her way to a final sound check last Friday. \u201cI wanted to remember all those who had disappeared, to give them a voice,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThey say the sound of glass is most like the sound of the human voice.\u201dMonika Sommer, the museum\u2019s director, said the \u201csubtlety and fragility\u201d of \u201cThe Voices\u201d matched how her museum wanted to help the country look at the past: \u201cWe don\u2019t want any finger-pointing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to take a sober look at Austrian history.\u201dBut she added the task of doing that was getting harder. \u201cWe are seeing anti-Semitism, and xenophobia more generally, becoming more widespread again.\u201dIn December, the conservative People\u2019s Party and the far-right Freedom Party formed a government in Austria. They were elected on an anti-immigration agenda in reaction to Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. The parties\u2019 coalition agreement officially states that Austria was a perpetrator of Nazi crimes, and decries anti-Semitism. But a Freedom Party politician quit in February in a scandal over an anti-Semitic songbook used by his old university fraternity, and Facebook followers of the party\u2019s leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, recently criticized him for speaking about Austria\u2019s complicity in Nazi rule.Pointedly, the government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has reserved judgment about whether it will keep financing the House of History \u2014 initiated by the left-leaning Social Democratic Party after decades of debate \u2014 when the museum\u2019s current budget runs out in December 2019. \u201cThe ongoing discussion about the future of the museum shows it\u2019s still difficult to talk about and reappraise the country\u2019s history,\u201d said Ms. Sommer.\u201cSusan\u2019s art isn\u2019t overtly political, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unpolitical,\u201d said Kasper K\u00f6nig, a German museum director and curator who advised the museum about the installation. Ms. Philipsz said she never expressly set out to be a public artist. Having sung in a choir as a child and trained as a sculptor, she said she was interested \u201cin what happens when you project sound into a space\u201d \u2014 what happens to the person projecting, the space, and the listener.Some of her most notable works \u2014 like \u201cLowlands,\u201d placed under bridges in Glasgow in 2010; \u201cStudy for Strings\u201d at the main railway station in Kassel, Germany, as part of the 2012 Documenta art exhibition; and \u201cWar Damaged Musical Instruments\u201d at London\u2019s Tate Britain in 2015-2016 \u2014 have used voices or instruments to evoke a sense of loss and separation in public spaces.\u201cYour feelings of longing or melancholy are often battling ambient sounds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exactly through these ambient sounds that you become very aware of where you are and who you\u2019re beside.\u201dMs. Philipsz praised the museum for dealing with the behind-the-scenes politics and letting her get on with her work. She first visited the site last October and quickly struck upon the lead crystal motif, in part thanks to some imposing chandeliers in the palace.The museum wanted a work of art to make the public reflect on Hitler\u2019s speech from the balcony, but was wary of putting a sculpture there. Commissioning a sound artist solved the problem, but the museum\u2019s original idea of placing all of the speakers where Hitler spoke did not work for Ms. Philipsz, as it kept too much attention on the balcony.\u201cThat felt wrong \u2014 I didn\u2019t want this to be about Hitler, but about the voices of all the people who had gathered there over the decades.\u201d So she also had speakers placed on the other side of the square. This, however, meant \u201cThe Voices\u201d could be heard only for 10 minutes twice a day, at 12:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m, in deference to the neighbors.\u201cI personally find the work a bit underwhelming, but it would have been unimaginable in Austria until the 1990s,\u201d said G. Daniel Cohen, a historian from Rice University in Houston currently in Vienna to write a book about attitudes toward Jews in postwar Europe. \u201cSuch attempts at national reflection have at the very least forced the far right to accept the existence of a taboo against anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption misstated Wolfgang Sobotka\u2019s title. He is the president of the lower chamber of the Austrian parliament; he is no longer the interior minister.Advertisement"}

In Rhode Island, the winds were so severe that officials shut down the Newport Bridge. In New York City, most flights were grounded for a time on Friday afternoon. And in the Washington suburbs, downed trees were strewn across the streets.Here\u2019s the latest:A similar thing happened to a child in Chesterfield County, Va. The fire chief there said the child was in a bed when a tree limb struck the trailer the bed was in, fatally injuring him.A deputy police chief in James City County, Va., said that a 44-year-old man, who had been a passenger in a truck, died after the wind toppled a large oak tree onto the truck.In Baltimore County, Md., fire and police officials said that a 77-year-old woman had been fatally struck by a large tree branch.And a police sergeant in Newport, R.I., said that a man in his 70s was struck by a tree that fell in his yard.Meteorologists confirmed Friday that the storm had become the second \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d in two months.The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.)Dan Kottlowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, said that the rapid pressure drop of the East Coast storm on Friday met the threshold for the bomb-cyclone classification.\u201cWhat makes this storm unique is that it\u2019s intensifying very quickly,\u201d Mr. Kottlowski said. \u201cIt will be in a position to stay strong for several days.\u201dThe pressure drop, he said, had contributed to the especially strong winds felt Friday along much of the East Coast.Anna Moyer, a graduate student at Columbia University, had planned to spend her weekend at a friend\u2019s bachelorette party in New Orleans. Instead, she was spending Friday afternoon on hold with Delta Air Lines, which canceled her flight out of New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport.After three hours on the phone with Delta, she said she still had not spoken with an employee.\u201cI\u2019ve angry-tweeted at them, Facebook messaged them, and I\u2019ve been obsessively refreshing their site,\u201d said Ms. Moyer, 30, a bridesmaid for the friend having the party.Ms. Moyer said she had been rebooked on a Saturday flight, but was still hoping to find a way to leave on Friday night. She said she had been helping to plan the party for months.When she finally did reach a Delta employee later Friday, Ms. Moyer said she was given no earlier flight option.At Penn Station in New York, Kate Willsky, 32, who lives in Brooklyn, spent more than an hour on an unmoving Amtrak train before she realized that she was not going to make it to her father\u2019s 70th birthday celebration this weekend in Gloucester, Mass.On the stalled train, she said, passengers bided their time \u2014 buying drinks and snacks from the dining car and sharing whatever updates they could find online \u2014 until the conductors announced that they were unlikely to move anytime soon.\u201cOut in Penn Station, everyone just looked like they wanted to die,\u201d Ms. Willsky said. \u201cEveryone was waiting in long lines. Everyone\u2019s weekend plans had been ruined.\u201dOn Friday afternoon, it was announced at the station that \u201cdue to extreme-weather-related issues,\u201d all trains between New York and Boston, and between Philadelphia and Washington, had been suspended indefinitely.At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach.\u201cThe water is bad, really bad,\u201d said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia\u2019s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach.In Watertown, in suburban Boston, several power lines had collapsed, creating a massive tangle of wires in the middle of the street.On Cape Cod and the islands of Nantucket and Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the ocean was pounding so hard that forecasters warned of visible topographic changes taking place in the shoreline.But so far, many residents were taking the storm in stride.May Ruth Seidel, 93, a part-time resident of Wellfleet for more than three decades \u2014 who is spending her first winter on the Cape as a full-time resident \u2014 attended her exercise class as usual on Friday. She said about 10 others also showed up, down from the typical 16.\u201cIt\u2019s windy, and the ocean looked fearsome,\u201d Ms. Seidel said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not worried.\u201d\u201cThe biggest problem is the puddles in the road,\u201d she added. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar, they may be deeper than they look.\u201dOn Nantucket, Catherine Flanagan Stover, the town clerk, said that some streets were starting to flood and winds were hitting 65 miles per hour.The first ferry left the island at 6:30 Friday morning, she said, but subsequent ferries have been canceled.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel isolated,\u201d she said of longtime residents, \u201cbut some of the newcomers panic. They worry that there aren\u2019t enough eggs and milk and loaves of bread for their French toast cook-offs. But the rest of us take it in stride.\u201dStill, in many coastal communities, residents were being urged to evacuate their homes as forecasters predicted that the next high tide, at midnight, could do severe damage and leave people trapped.The storm lived up to its name. Within hours, firefighters were responding to stuck elevators in buildings that lost power. Downed power lines and fallen trees blocked residential streets.Conditions were not much better across the Potomac River in Washington, where many government workers were given the day off and parent-teacher conferences at public schools were canceled.A meteorologist at the Weather Service\u2019s Albany office said late Friday that Richmondville, N.Y., had gotten 37.5 inches of snow \u2014 and counting.In New York City, James Long, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the weather conspired to make things very busy. In Queens, he said, a pedestrian was stuck by a fallen tree and taken to Jamaica Hospital Center with injuries that were believed to be serious.In addition, Mr. Long said that Fire Department rescuers had to manage two episodes in which high winds tipped over a pair of tractor-trailers on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.As of late Friday, the department was even investigating reports that a barge had gotten loose on the Hudson River near the Tappan Zee Bridge, Mr. Long said. A Fire Department rescue boat had been dispatched, he added.Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q.

{"Headline": "Dropbox, Valued Privately at $10 Billion, Could Droop by 25% in I.P.O.", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDropbox, the online file storage company, is poised to hold one of the year\u2019s most highly awaited stock market debuts. But whether investors think the technology darling is more valuable as a publicly traded company or as a privately held start-up is debatable.Dropbox attained its $10 billion valuation as a privately held company more than four years ago, in a different age for Silicon Valley, when many start-ups raced to collect as high a valuation as they could. Since then, companies have been more reserved. Many learned that stretching for every last dollar of valuation could make it more difficult to raise additional capital in the future, or to attract and keep employees with stock grants.\u201cIt\u2019s a high-quality asset that was overpriced,\u201d Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures, said of Dropbox. His firm does not have ties to the company.Dropbox appears set to join a relatively small group of \u201cdown round\u201d initial public offerings, in which a firm\u2019s value is lower than it was when the firm raised money privately. That group includes the meal kit delivery service Hello Fresh and the database software provider MongoDB, according to the research firm CB Insights.Dropbox could still hit that $10 billion valuation over time, assuming its stock price rises after it goes public. A spokeswoman for Dropbox declined to comment.Many investors are nonetheless expected to flock to Dropbox, in a year that is likely to be busy for stock market debuts. Dropbox and Spotify, the music-streaming giant, which is planning its own listing, could presage a series that eventually includes the likes of Uber and Airbnb.The market for initial offerings this year is already proving robust, with 29 so far, up 61 percent from a year ago, according to the advisory firm Renaissance Capital.Monday\u2019s filing preceded Dropbox\u2019s road show to pitch its offering to potential investors. As the company\u2019s executives and their advisers begin to crisscross the country in a series of meetings, their goal is to convince would-be buyers that its stock will perform more like Facebook\u2019s, which has risen enormously in recent years, and less like Snap\u2019s, whose stock is down 34 percent since its debut last year.Dropbox is likely to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market \u2014 under the ticker symbol DBX \u2014 by the end of next week.Though analysts have long worried about the prospects of independent file-storage providers like Dropbox and Box, a competitor that went public three years ago, the companies have shown that they can survive.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve really honed your focus and how to differentiate yourself, you can do well,\u201d Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview.Dropbox\u2019s business has grown rapidly over the past three years, reaching $1.1 billion in sales last year. Though the company continues to lose money, it has reduced the red ink on its books, losing $111.7 million last year.Though Dropbox may have fallen short of its last fund-raising valuation in the initial offering process thus far, some in Silicon Valley said the company\u2019s future looked bright.\u201cThe Dropbox business is way better than anyone expected,\u201d Mr. Ganesan said. \u201cMy feeling is that no one should be focused on what the short-term valuation of the company is.\u201dEven Mr. Levie of Box \u2014 whose company also went public at a lower valuation than its last private fund-raising round, only to eventually trade above that level \u2014 said investors should not worry too much about at what level Dropbox goes public.\u201cI\u2019ve learned not to put too much stock in the pre-I.P.O. pricing dynamic,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States \u2014 and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters\u2019 behavior.Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what \u2014 or which client \u2014 prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity to Russian expansionism.On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm\u2019s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done \u201ccommercial work\u201d about 25 years ago \u201cfor a private company in Russia.\u201dAsked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm\u2019s commercial division \u201cdiscussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.\u201d The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.\u201cWe needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,\u201d he wrote in response to a question from The Times. \u201cEven though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.\u201dBut Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company\u2019s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.\u201cI remember being super confused,\u201d said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.\u201cI kept asking Alexander, \u2018Can you explain to me what they want?\u2019\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Nix. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re sending them stuff about political targeting \u2014 they then come and ask more about political targeting,\u201d Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil \u201cjust didn\u2019t seem to be interested\u201d in how the techniques could be used commercially.Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie\u2019s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Single? No Kids? Don\u2019t Fret: How to Plan Care in Your Later Years", "Date": "2018-03-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringSarah Peveler lacks a support system that many older people count on: their adult children.But Ms. Peveler, 71, who is divorced and childless, said she was determined not to let fear of an uncertain future get the best of her.To help avoid the potential perils of a solitary old age, Ms. Peveler is carrying out a multipronged, go-it-alone plan. A key part of it was to find a small community where she could make friends and walk nearly everywhere, without worrying about the hazards of ice and snow.\u201cAt some point, I am not going to be able to drive,\u201d she said. From her downtown home, \u201cI can walk to Main Street, the library, the church, the drugstore and the Piggly Wiggly.\u201dMs. Peveler paid $135,000 cash for a one-story house with longevity in mind. One of the three bedrooms, she said, can be converted into an apartment if she needs a caretaker to move in. She is thinking of checking out assisted-living facilities in case she ever needs more than home care. (There is a family history of dementia, she said.) Several mini-strokes caused some cognitive impairment, so her doctor monitors her regularly.\u201cOnce, I didn\u2019t respond, and everyone called me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.\u201dAlthough no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. \u201cI know people would have my back,\u201d she said.Adult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.\u201cPeople who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.\u201d Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.One of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank\u2019s trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank\u2019s decisions.Christina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a \u201cmicro board,\u201d which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. \u201cThe board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,\u201d Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.As for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly \u201ccongregate living\u201d arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.One housing option with a built-in support system is a continuing care retirement community. Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.In Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.\u201cMore and more people were coming to us and saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K. now, but I\u2019m realistic enough to know my health status could change,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.Entrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.\u201cThe on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,\u201d said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.In-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.\u201cIf I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,\u201d said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa \u201cto make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.\u201d\u201cI wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,\u201d said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.Ms. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being \u201cisolated and disconnected from the community.\u201d She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.Determined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. \u201cI need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

(The shareholder vote is scheduled for Tuesday.)\u2022 Whether foreign companies like Singapore\u2019s Broadcom can gain control of American counterparts through proxy fights\u2022 Concern that Broadcom would sell off parts of Qualcomm to win regulatory approval, disrupting the work of the main American developer of 5G wireless technology \u2014 and therefore ceding the race for a superfast internet to ChinaBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201dBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\u2014 Peter EavisAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:We both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes.But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.And Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:But in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.The big questions:Will the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?What would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\u2014 Peter EavisThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.The tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.But if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\u2014 Michael de la MercedGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201dOn Nafta:\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201dOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201dNot everyone agrees with that view:\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201dBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:The 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.A Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\u2014 Michael de la Merced\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\u2022 Charles Elson of the University of Delaware said, \u201cHe isn\u2019t bound by any traditional norms of management.\u201d\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, rose 0.4 percent, the biggest increase since September.\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in January.More from Sapna Maheshwari and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT:The company has flagged a photo of a woman in a T-shirt reading in dim lighting, for example, while allowing a provocative image of a man\u2019s bare stomach for an ad from a Facebook group dedicated to \u201csteamy romance novels\u201d called Beyond 50 Shades.

{"Headline": "Will the Market\u2019s Gains Follow Cohn Out the Door?: DealBook Briefing", "Date": "2018-03-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Gary Cohn is exiting the White House.\u2022 Why Cfius thinks Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm is a national security matter\u2022 A top aluminum lobbying group argues against tariffs\u2022 Should mutual funds become activists on guns?\u2022 Could the Trump tariffs be weakened?Will the gains investors have made under President Trump now walk out the door, too?Mr. Cohn was an influential figure in the White House. As the president\u2019s top economic adviser, he opposed policies, like the tariffs announced last week, that go against the prevailing global economic order. Now that Mr. Cohn is leaving, investors may fear that Mr. Trump and others in his administration will step up their assault on globalism, stoking the chances of a trade war and other tensions that damage the real economy.Mr. Cohn has telegraphed his unhappiness with some of President Trump\u2019s policies, so his departure may not come as a surprise to investors. They also may believe that the chaos in the White House will limit the administration\u2019s ability to deliver on policies investors don\u2019t like. And of course, investors may hope that Mr. Trump, unwilling to see the stock market\u2019s gains unwind, stays his hand. It\u2019s even possible that Mr. Trump will keep talking to Mr. Cohn after he leaves, or that he will replace Mr. Cohn with someone with similar views, like Larry Kudlow.Still, the Dow Jones industrial average may open sharply down on Wednesday morning. The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.But even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.For two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.But investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.What could change now?With Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.But there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.But who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\u2014 Peter EavisDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.The letter goes on to say:Cfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.The move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.Cfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.A spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201dMichael\u2019s takeThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.What Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.To the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201dCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201dAnother take from a friend of DealBookHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\u2014 Michael de la MercedPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.We fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.In the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\u2014 Michael de la MercedPolicy flyaroundBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201dFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.Greg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes. He will oversee the company\u2019s core business, including its newly launched Airbnb Plus and Airbnb Collections programs.\u201cWords can\u2019t express how excited I am to join the Airbnb team,\u201d Mr. Greeley said. \u201cI\u2019ve used Airbnb for years, and the chance to work here and expand the positive impact its community is having around the world is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201dMr. Greeley has spent the past 18 years at Amazon. Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.ContextAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.With the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.The deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.BlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.The rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI.\u2022 He left open the possibility that Canada and Mexico could be exempt if they signed a new Nafta pact.What is The Infatuation?

{"Headline": "\u2018All-In or Nothing\u2019: West Virginia\u2019s Teacher Strike Was Months in the Making", "Date": "2018-03-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGILBERT, W.Va. \u2014 Home from a long day teaching English last month at Mingo Central High School, Robin Ellis told her husband the latest talk among the teachers. They were tired of low pay and costly health benefits \u2014 and they were mulling a \u201crolling strike,\u201d in which teachers in a few counties would walk out each day.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Donnie Ellis, her husband, said. As a veteran of strip mines and the intense labor conflicts that often came with them, he knew what made some strikes succeed and others crumble.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be all-in or nothing,\u201d he said.It has definitely been all-in in West Virginia. For seven days now, teachers have refused to work in all 55 counties, shutting down every school in the state.Every school day since last Thursday, thousands of red- and black-clad teachers, bus drivers and cooks have descended on Charleston to fill the halls of the State Capitol, chanting and singing defiantly in one of the few statewide teachers\u2019 strikes in American history.On Saturday evening, teachers\u2019 frustration flared again as the Senate passed a bill granting a 4 percent raise, rather than the 5 percent raise that had been part of the deal to get the teachers back to work.In a statement shortly after the vote, the three unions representing school employees in West Virginia announced that all public schools would be closed on Monday and would \u201cremain closed until the Senate honors the agreement that was made.\u201dThe 5 percent raise was initially announced by Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, and union leaders said that would be enough to get teachers back to class. But rank-and-file educators have since said they will not return until the full pay raise is guaranteed by legislation. The Republican-controlled House passed it overwhelmingly this week, but Saturday\u2019s amended version of the bill meant educators\u2019 thunderous showdown with the state\u2019s conservative Senate would continue.For a brief and extraordinarily confusing period late Saturday, it almost seemed as if the strike would come to an end because of a mix-up in the Senate, which initially \u2014 and accidentally \u2014 passed the bill with the 5 percent raise. Procedural wrangling followed for the next hour before the Senate voted to pass the 4 percent raise.The bill then went back to the House, which voted not to concur with the Senate\u2019s version. The two versions will now go to a committee tasked to work out a compromise. In a statement issued Saturday night, Mr. Justice reiterated his support for the 5 percent raise and urged a quick end to the standoff.\u201cThis wrangling needs to stop right now,\u201d he said. \u201cFor crying out loud, we are putting our children at risk.\u201dFrustration at the state of pay and health insurance \u2014 in addition to proposed changes to rules governing hiring, firing and the payment of union dues \u2014 had been building for a while.Smaller walkouts began in early February, organized by the sons and daughters of coal miners who had stood on the picket lines themselves.\u201cWhen I was in diapers, he was involved in a mine strike,\u201d Justin Endicott, 34, a fourth-grade teacher in Mingo County, said of his father.\u201cSouthern West Virginia\u2019s often forgotten, and if we were not loud, we would be completely forgotten,\u201d said Mr. Endicott, who traveled to Charleston on Feb. 2 with teachers from neighboring counties to take part in the first of the school walkouts.It is not a surprise to anyone here that the first teacher strikes came out of coal country. This was the battlefield of the mine wars, a series of deadly battles in the early 20th century between coal miners and armies of law enforcement and company-hired soldiers. Among the people who fought in these wars was the great-grandfather of Brandon Wolford, a major organizer of the strikers in Mingo County.In 1920, thousands of miners faced off in the five-day Battle of Blair Mountain against armed strikebreakers and government forces in one of the largest labor uprisings in American history.\u201cI think it\u2019s part of the culture,\u201d said David Haney, the executive director of the West Virginia Education Association. \u201cThey grew up in a culture of understanding people standing up to their employers to some degree when things go wrong.\u201dThough the southern counties were first to walk out, talk of action had been percolating across West Virginia, ever since the state proposed in November new rules for the state employees\u2019 health plan.Among the new rules was a plan to consider the income of both spouses in the house if both were covered by the insurance plan, as opposed to just the employee, in setting deductibles and premiums. For families with both spouses working, or teachers supplementing their income with second or even third jobs, the change would mean cost increases.In a Facebook group for public employees, which was set up in the fall by Jay O\u2019Neal, a seventh-grade English teacher in Charleston, frustration steadily grew.People were rankled also to learn about Go365, an app they were supposed to use to monitor their health, which many found punitive and invasive. They were particularly incensed when Mr. Justice announced in his state of the state address that he was proposing a long-awaited pay raise for state employees: 1 percent a year.In early January, Mr. O\u2019Neal said, someone in the Facebook group prompted a frenzy by asking when everyone was going to strike.Then, State Senator Richard Ojeda, a Democrat, seemed to take up the cause.\u201cWe are sitting on a powder keg,\u201d said Mr. Ojeda, who has since become such a hero among striking school employees that his image appears on posters and T-shirts. \u201cIf you think teachers across this state are not saying the s-word, you are wrong.\u201dIn late January, hundreds of Mingo County school employees held a meeting in an event hall in the tiny town of Delbarton, one of the first of similar meetings that would take place across the state.Teachers who had walked out in the teachers\u2019 strike of 1990 said the time had come again. In the next few days, school employees voted, overwhelmingly, to walk out.On Feb. 2, a day the protesting teachers now call \u201cFed-Up Friday,\u201d the staff members of schools in several southern West Virginia counties stayed out of work.\u201cThey live-streamed when they were in the Capitol that day and everybody was watching it when they were on their planning periods,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neal, whose Facebook group, though set to be private, now has some 24,000 members. \u201cIf they had not walked out that day I don\u2019t think any of this would have happened.\u201dThe turning point in the strike came on Tuesday of this week, when Mr. Justice, desperate to get teachers back to school, announced he could find the money to give teachers a 5 percent raise. Union leaders said the deal was enough to get teachers back to class. Immediately they were proven wrong.Teachers said a promise was not enough, and poured back into the Capitol, crying, \u201cWe got sold out.\u201d\u201cIt was like we couldn\u2019t trust what was going on,\u201d said Brandy Conrad, a teacher from Boone County. \u201cWe want the promises that we were issued to be fulfilled.\u201dBy Friday, a task force to address health insurance was partially appointed by the governor.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re watching:\u2022 Best day for stocks in nearly three years.\u2022 A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics.\u2022 Tim Cook and other C.E.O.s took shots at Facebook.\u2022 Eddie Lampert finally speaks about Sears.\u2022 Washington and Beijing hold trade talks.Stocks on Wall Street surged on signs of easing trade tensions.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 669 points, or 2.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 surged 2.7 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.3 percent.Worries that the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist policies could ignite a trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies punished equities last week. American stocks endured their worst week in two years as the Dow lost 1,400 points, or 5.7 percent.Shares jumped at the open and the momentum gained through the day as last week\u2019s hardest hit sectors led the way.\u2022 The S.&P. 500 technology sector rose 4 percent. Microsoft and Apple gained 7.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\u2022 The KBW Bank Index climbed 3 percent on Monday, after tumbling 8 percent last week. Bank of America finished up 4.4 percent, while Morgan Stanley gained 4.3 percent. The two stocks had fallen nearly 5 percent on Friday.\u2022 Even Facebook, which was down 6.5 percent earlier in the day from the continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was able to eek out gains. The stock finished up 0.4 percent higher.\u2022 Gun stocks were the exception. Shares of publicly traded firearms companies fell in the wake Remington Outdoor bankruptcy filing and this weekend rallies for gun control. American Outdoor Brands fell 2.3 percent, Vista Outdoor dropped 3.8 percent and Sturm, Ruger & Co. slipped less than 1 percent.Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.\u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201dMr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.\u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d(Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.\u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201dAndrew\u2019s takeMr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.As for Facebook\u2019s ad, take note of this: \u201cWe expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\u201d Settle in for more episodes before this soap opera ends.Context \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201dShares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt.The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.The money quote, from Mr. Lampert:\u201cPut it this way, if I consider all the other alternatives, they\u2019re not great for a lot of people and I just want to be responsible. If I didn\u2019t believe that this company could be transformed still \u2014 the window is definitely shrinking \u2014 but if I didn\u2019t believe that, I would try to take a different path. But I don\u2019t know what that path exactly would be. It\u2019s not a question of giving up or not giving up.\u201d\u201c[With] all of Trump\u2019s focus on jobs, job preservation, job creation, somebody ought to ask his secretary of the Treasury what his involvement has been for 11 years in the destruction of well over 100,000 jobs at Sears.\u201dAmong Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.\u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\u201dBut he also added, \u201cOther than psychopaths, I think all of this bad behavior is finished.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ideal Ripeness Varies by Opinion, Not by the Moment", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolTo hear the wine marketers tell it, every estate picks its grapes at the point of perfect ripeness. But does such a moment really exist?As with so much in wine, what is in fact subjective is often presented as objective. Just as no perfect moment exists to open a bottle, and no optimum length exists for aging a wine, no particular set of conditions defines perfect ripeness. It all depends on the intent and taste of the grower and producer, along with vintage conditions, the site and perhaps a bit of luck.The motives of the marketer and the desires of the consumer inevitably clash. Here at Wine School, we love wine, but are inherently skeptical about anybody in the trade who claims to have done anything at the one right moment. Just as in journalism, in which generations of reporters have been taught never to assume a thing \u2014 not even that their mothers love them \u2014 such claims should invite doubt.I was thinking about ripeness over the last few weeks as we tasted several examples of Rosso di Montalcino, the younger sibling of the renowned Brunello di Montalcino. Each of the three bottles I suggested, from the 2015 vintage, seemed to exhibit a different degree of ripeness. Each, depending on the taste of the consumer, could be considered to have been made with properly ripened grapes.Each wine, as is required of all Rossos and Brunellos di Montalcino, was made entirely of the sangiovese grape. At times this rule has caused frustration among some Montalcino producers, who 20 years ago were seeking to soften sangiovese\u2019s naturally high acidity, darken its characteristically ruby color and relax its often angular austerity by adding international grapes like merlot, syrah or cabernet sauvignon.You would think that producers would aim for pale rather than dark. But they have heard from consultants that consumers prefer darker reds. The nonsense apparently flows in both directions.I\u2019m happy to say that I do not think that any of these three producers is troubled by the natural characteristics of sangiovese, one of the world\u2019s great grapes. Each of these wines showed ample evidence of sangiovese\u2019s vibrant acidity. They were also naturally tannic, meaning that they demonstrated the true tannins of the grape rather than the bitter tannins that can be imparted by new oak barrels. And they showed the true flavors and character of sangiovese, unmitigated by new oak.But each bottle seemed to adhere to a different definition of ripeness. It seemed to me, judging strictly by the wine, that the Rosso from La Torre had been picked the earliest. Its dominant characteristics were freshness and purity of aromas and flavors.I loved its liveliness, its dusty, earthy red fruit flavors with a touch of minerality and bitterness. In current wine parlance, sommeliers might refer to this wine as \u201ccrunchy,\u201d like biting into a juicy apple in which the sweetness and the acidity were precisely balanced.At the other end of this admittedly narrow spectrum, the Lisini Rosso seems much riper. The fruit is a little bit sweeter, as if you are not biting into a piece of fresh fruit but maybe dipping into some compote. It\u2019s also more tannic, as if the juice of the freshly crushed grapes had macerated longer with the tannin-bearing skins, or perhaps the grape skins were a bit thicker and contained more tannic compounds.I would not call these grapes overripe by any means. Wines made from overripe grapes would be overtly jammy, with less acidity. They can feel thick, give an impression of sweetness and lack zest. Some people enjoy them, but not me.The Rosso from Le Potazzine seemed to stake out a middle ground. It offered the acid snap of the La Torre but was even more tannic than the Lisini. The fruit was not sweet, but the flavors seemed darker, with almost a licorice tinge.All of these wines improved with food, fettuccine Bolognese, but Le Potazzine really blossomed, melding beautifully with the rich, meaty sauce.Brunello is aged longer, for one thing, four years before it can be released, of which a minimum of two must be in casks. Rosso need only be aged one year before release.Producers often choose to use the fruit from younger vines or from lesser sites in their Rosso, or grapes that simply did not fit into the blend of their Brunello.Though marketers often try to capitalize on the fame of Brunello by referring to Rossos as \u201cBaby Brunellos,\u201d it\u2019s better to accept Rossos on their own terms. They are lighter, fresher, more easygoing wines, more accessible without aging, though some will evolve and improve over the years. They generally do not require contemplation, and what\u2019s wrong with that? Deliciousness is its own reward.I have noticed among some consumers a tendency to dismiss Montalcino wines in general as somehow not being authentic enough, much in the same way that many have sneered at Bordeaux. Please. Like any wine region in the world, Montalcino has its share of poseurs, manipulators and fabricators. But the good wines are beautiful and should not be missed.\u201cOddly, tasted better with the food than by itself,\u201d he said.Welcome to Italy, where wine is especially constructed to go with food. On their own, most traditionally made Italian reds can taste acidic, tannic and bitter without food. They are meant for the table, not as cocktails or aperitifs. In Italy, that\u2019s what sparkling wine is for.While I seized on these three wines for the opportunity they offered to talk about ripeness, other factors also play a role. Soils will influence the flavors; those grapes coming from heavier clay sites will be fruitier and denser, while those from sites with more limestone may be more aromatic and less fruity. The altitude of the vineyard plays a role, as does luck.By that I mean that some things are out of a grower\u2019s control. A crew of grape pickers might not be available at the moment a grower wants to harvest. That unexpected delay can result in riper grapes than envisioned.But the most important factor is intent. Each of these wines, I believed, represented the intent of the producer, and each differed. So when you hear the next marketer crowing about the \u201cperfect ripeness\u201d of the grapes, simply know that the marketers should add a clause to their claim: \u201cin our opinion.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}

As we\u2019re coming to learn more and more, such ignorance seems to be plaguing almost everybody \u2014 regardless of educational attainment, economic class, age, race, political affiliation or gender.Some very smart people are helping to spread some very dumb ideas.We all know this is a problem. The recent federal indictment of a Russian company, the Internet Research Agency, lists the numerous ways Russian trolls and bots created phony events and leveraged social media to sow disruption throughout the 2016 presidential election. New revelations about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s sophisticated use of Facebook data to target unsuspecting social media users reminds us how complex the issue has become. Even the pope has weighed in, using his bully pulpit to warn the world of this new global evil.But there are some remarkably easy steps that each of us, on our own, can take to address this issue. By following these three simple guidelines, we can collaborate to help solve a problem that\u2019s befuddling the geniuses who built Facebook and Twitter.If the problem is crowdsourced, then it seems obvious the solution will have to be crowdsourced as well. With that in mind, here are three easy steps each of us can take to help build a better civic polity. This advice will also help each of us look a little less foolish.It was retweeted by the Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe. His retweet was retweeted over 2,000 times:Yet there\u2019s no evidence anywhere that Haiti\u2019s \u201chigh court\u201d did this. There was no \u201cemergency\u201d session and there was no \u201cagreement to unseal & release documents.\u201d The event is fabricated. Remember: No link? Not news!But Cambridge Analytica is the symptom, not the disease. The larger problem is that unpleasant and frustrating information \u2014 no matter how accurate \u2014 is actively hidden from you to maximize your social media engagement. George Orwell once noted that he became a writer because he possessed \u201ca facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts.\u201d There\u2019s no place for \u201cunpleasant facts\u201d in our social media universe. Were Orwell alive today, he\u2019d remind us of the terrible political costs caused by this devolution in our informational habits.These are three simple rules. Of course, they contradict every mechanism Facebook and Twitter uses to encourage our behavior on social media. Being more skeptical, engaging more selectively and prioritizing links to information providers outside our social media silos will hurt the bottom line of the social media giants. Using social media in a more responsible manner might ultimately leave these companies to rot away as they cede their civic responsibilities to the Russian trolls and bots dedicated to polluting our discourse. If they won\u2019t act, it\u2019s up to us. If we\u2019re collectively smarter and more skeptical about social media as an information delivery device, it will ultimately lessen the influence that these corporations and trolls have on our civic governance.Michael J.

My pendulum stopped at: Ask your daughter how she feels about it. I\u2019d hate to see a reply used against you or cause your daughter (further) hurt.

We heard from about 2,000 readers. We\u2019re running a selection of their questions with some responses from our journalists below. The questions have been condensed and edited for clarity.Please see this as the start of a conversation. We welcome you to leave additional remarks in the comments section of this article.What are your criteria for defining some crimes as \u201cterrorism?\u201d \u2014 Samih Kareem, SudanWhen the U.S. government calls something \u201cterrorism\u201d or \u201cnot terrorism,\u201d how critically do you examine the word? \u2014 Stephen Dockery, Berkeley, Calif.In the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting that killed 14 people, law enforcement officials called Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook terrorists. The same was true in Orlando, Fla., where Omar Mateen killed 49 people at a nightclub.But in Charleston, S.C., where Dylann Roof murdered nine African-Americans at a historically black church, law enforcement did not label him a terrorist. The same was true in Las Vegas, where Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a concert.Under the law, terrorism is a violent, criminal act intended to intimidate civilians and governments for an ideological, political or religious purpose. In this case, we have yet to see evidence that the attacks in Texas were politically motivated, though certainly there has been suspicion that there was racial animus because the first two victims were African-American.Contradictions and debates abound over which groups governments list as terrorist and which they don\u2019t. Some examples: The United States\u2019 main partner against the Islamic State in Syria is a Kurdish militia listed as terrorist by a critical NATO ally, Turkey. Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist group by the United States government, is also a political party represented in Lebanon\u2019s Parliament. And some groups argue that when a government deliberately bombs civilians, that too should be called terrorism.It strikes me that in media coverage in general, \u201cterrorism\u201d is often used as if it were a synonym for \u201cIslamist extremist violence.\u201d That grates on me: Terrorism \u2014 whatever your working definition is \u2014 is a method, not an ideology. It\u2019s a method that could be used, and has been used in history, to further a wide spectrum of different ideologies.For these reasons, I try to avoid using the terms terrorist and terrorism at all, unless they are inside quotation marks or refer to a government\u2019s decision to place a group on its designated terrorist list.During all these years of wrestling with how to cover violence, I have found it more precise and informative to simply describe exactly what the attack was \u2014 how it was done, how many people it killed, whether there is a known or suspected motive \u2014 rather than label it terrorist or not. What\u2019s most important is what crime was committed and what its impact was.Why do you (and other outlets) keep referring to Draylen Mason as a man? He was a 17-year-old boy or teen. Calling him a man somehow feels like an effort to desensitize people to his loss. \u2014 Anne, Spokane, Wash.Why are you bending over backwards to try and concoct an image of this evil, hateful killer? Asking neighbors, friends, family for their biased, inaccurate, or revisionist opinions of the killer and his motives does nothing except insult the good people he KILLED. \u2014 Bruce, SeattleWhen it comes to Mark Conditt, we\u2019ll continue reporting on what motivated these awful acts and we\u2019ll share what we find. I have not a twinge of sympathy for him, and readers are right that our coverage should not leave the impression he was victimized.Why did you highlight this bomber as \u201cnerdy\u201d and coming from a \u201cgodly family\u201d in a tweet? Do these things make him less of a murderer? Do you see how this reads as, screams of white privilege. \u2014 Regina Reichert, DetroitWe probably shouldn\u2019t have published a tweet describing how the suspect\u2019s neighbors and peers viewed him without also providing the immediate and necessary contrast that he is suspected of killing Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason, and critically injuring others.The social and mental state of the perpetrator are in fact important as they help to explain how someone who may seem as normal as you and I, would one day wake up and commit what we view as inexplicable acts.However, it defies all logic and rules out all objectivity to discard this side of the argument/narrative when you are dealing with a brainwashed, deranged Muslim radical.All terrorists are the same in my eye, and they should be in yours too. \u2014 Ramadan Duadu, DublinThe war in Syria now gets such little attention that people in the region often ask: Does the West think it\u2019s O.K. for us to go through this? Do we not count as full humans?I believe one of our jobs as journalists is to demonstrate the common humanity of people whose lives may on the surface look very different from one another, to approach every human being as an individual and to treat every life as equally valuable and interesting. It\u2019s an ideal that we can\u2019t always live up to, but we must work toward especially as we attempt to reach an expanding and increasingly diverse global audience.Why did you wait so long \u2014 20 days and 10 days respectively \u2014 to publish profiles of the African-American victims of the bombings? \u2014 Joel Charny, WashingtonI realize that reporting on pieces like the March 22 \u201cA Bomber\u2019s Rampage Exposes Racial Fault Lines\u201d article takes considerably more time than getting quotes from neighbors and classmates, but you MUST consider what good those easy quotes do. Do they tell us anything we need to know, or are you just trying to get anything out in order to take advantage of the news cycle? \u2014 Garrett Bridger Gilmore, Long Beach, Calif.I really don\u2019t care what the bomber\u2019s hobbies were, or what his grandmother thought of him, or whether he was \u201cquiet.\u201d I want to know when and where he was radicalized. I want to know how he learned to make effective killing machines and how he was able to obtain parts and send the first few bombs practically undetected. If that information is still unavailable, perhaps run 100 percent fewer human interest stories on his childhood and wait, or better yet, investigate. \u2014 Anna Holmes, SeattleWe fanned out through his neighborhood, school, worksite and anywhere else we could identify, trying to talk to anyone we could find who knew him. We published everything we learned, as we learned it. A story that was sketchy at first was expanded as we went along, filling in new details as we learned them.We\u2019re still working to understand this perpetrator, and as we learn more, we\u2019ll pass it along. I can assure you that there is no effort underway to portray him as anything other than what he is, a murderer.I have seen pictures of Mark Conditt with the blond hair he had at the time. And holding an assault rifle. Why hasn\u2019t that one been used? \u2014 David B. Owens, ChicagoThe photographs used to show suspects is one of the ways that can show racial bias. For example, even in this request for questions, a Facebook photo of Mark Conditt is used rather than an image from video surveillance. In comparison, it is common to see mug shots when discussing people of color. How does The Times evaluate photo choices and is this sort of racial bias specifically considered? \u2014 Alison, Apex, N.C.There were also no police mug shots available of Mr. Conditt because he had not previously been arrested.We did subsequently publish surveillance video screenshots of Mr. Conditt at the FedEx location when the photos were made available.What is your plan to hire and promote more people of color and non-Christian reporters? \u2014 Emily Peterson, Oakland, Calif.What controls do you have in place to check for implicit bias? How many people of color do you have in supervisory/editorial positions? \u2014 Kate E, Central New YorkThis is important for the accuracy, fairness and richness of our journalism. The same is true of the need to diversify people in the most powerful, decision-making positions at The Times.We invited readers to submit questions and comments because we want to be more transparent, and we believe it\u2019s important to have an open conversation with our readers about these issues. We are listening to our readers\u2019 feedback and concerns, and we want our audience to know that.In responding to the reader submissions, our journalists focused on questions related to our Austin coverage. But many of our readers posed important and thoughtful questions that went far beyond the Austin story. Questions touched on coverage of past news events by The Times, media coverage from various news organizations and even racial and religious discrimination in society as a whole. While we don\u2019t have answers for many of these questions, they are worth all of us thinking about and keeping in our mind going forward. Here is a selection.The coverage is ABSOLUTELY different for White Christian attackers. Had the Austin terrorist been Muslim, there would have been national hysteria. It\u2019s a double standard and must be called out every time. \u2014 Hesham Hassaballa, ChicagoTrayvon Martin was murdered by an over-excited wannabe security guard because he was black and walking through the neighborhood, but somehow the NYT had to tell us all that he\u2019d had trouble at school for pot. The photos of him that were posted weren\u2019t the smiling, friendly sort, like the one posted of Mark Conditt, but was of him in a hoodie, trying to look tough. \u2014 Laura Kenney, Traverse City, Mich.You literally have harder hitting profiles of black murder victims than of white Christian serial killers. \u2014 Dylan Brady, Eugene, Ore.I often see coverage of violent criminals who are Muslim include reactions from the leader or members of their religious community. It is not often asked of Christian faith leaders how the sins of their congregant reflect on the congregation or Christians at large. \u2014 Angelo M. Pinto, Audubon, N.J.Whenever any sort of mass murder is perpetuated by someone from the \u201cother\u201d category, the entire community is dragged onto the public forum with only one expectation \u2014 own it and repent.\u2014 Nish Patel, BostonA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Crayons to Chemo, He\u2019s Back by Her Side", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsJames Garish is no spelling bee champ, but he never forgot the tricky string of letters that add up to the last name of his kindergarten crush, Elizabeth Stipkovits. He also never forgot the girl behind the name. Which is why he typed it into his laptop one lonely night in 2010 while serving in the Army in Iraq.\u201cI was just sitting there in my bunk, and I started wondering how life had turned out for her,\u201d said Mr. Garish, 34. McKeesport, Pa., the working-class city where he and Ms. Stipkovits grew up, wasn\u2019t always reminiscent of picnics and parades for Mr. Garish; he dropped out of school at 14 and spent more than half a decade in dead-end jobs before enlisting in the Army in 2008.Still, he wasn\u2019t immune to homesickness. So upon finding Ms. Stipkovits\u2019s profile on Facebook, he sent a friend request.Ms. Stipkovits, half a world away raising her 6-year-old daughter, Maleena, had no idea who he was. \u201cI saw the request and his name sounded familiar. But I couldn\u2019t place it,\u201d she said. She called her mother, Joy Stipkovits, who did recall a James Garish.\u201cShe told me I was in kindergarten with him. Then I remembered,\u201d Ms. Stipkovits said. \u201cHe was Little Bad Jimmy, the class clown, the holy terror, the one always getting yelled at by the teacher.\u201d That the onetime 5-year-old handful remembered her and her hard-to-spell name stopped her in her tracks. \u201cI thought that said a lot.\u201dThe relationship that has unspooled since that 2010 friend request has bound together Mr. Garish and Ms. Stipkovits in a foxhole of determination, love and brokenness. In 2014, when she was 31, Ms. Stipkovits received her first breast cancer diagnosis. Since then, the cancer has returned twice and metastasized. At the end of 2017, she was being treated for cancer in her femur and lung. In January, it had spread to her brain. \u201cLittle Bad Jimmy,\u201d now a supervisor at a McKeesport Rite-Aid, has never left her side.\u201cWe tell people I was his rock when he was in Iraq, and he\u2019s been my rock through the crazy roller-coaster ride of the last four years,\u201d said Ms. Stipkovits, 34. \u201cChemo has taken a lot of my memory. But he always reminds me he\u2019s been in love with me since kindergarten.\u201d\u201cWe would go out on up to seven missions a day. Things get a little crazy over there. It was stressful and I was sleep deprived. One of the things I looked forward to most was talking on the phone with Liz,\u201d said Mr. Garish, who was with the third infantry division based at Fort Stewart, Ga.Ms. Stipkovits remembers conversations cut painfully short because of poor reception, and the swell of anticipation mixed with compassion and admiration that would kick in when a call from Iraq reached her in McKeesport.\u201cMy dad served in Kuwait and is a retired chief in the Navy,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew how Jim felt being away from his friends and family, and that sometimes you just really need someone to vent to.\u201d She was delighted to be his someone. When Mr. Garish impulsively bought a plane ticket home for Christmas in 2010, she was even more delighted by the surprise of him on her front porch.\u201cIt was dark out and he pulled me close, and it felt good,\u201d Ms. Stipkovits said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen each other in a lot of years.\u201d Mr. Garish and Ms. Stipkovits had attended the same schools until eighth grade, shortly before he dropped out. But beyond kindergarten, their classes and social circles never overlapped. \u201cWe didn\u2019t miss a beat,\u201d she said.She hadn\u2019t expected such a smooth in-person reunion. Not because she didn\u2019t expect the former unruly schoolboy to be so thoroughly rehabilitated, but because she wasn\u2019t sure how her life as a single mother would look to Mr. Garish from up close. Ms. Stipkovits has never been married and had Maleena at 19.By the following summer, when Mr. Garish completed his service and moved back to McKeesport, he was weaving Maleena into his life, and vice versa. Just as she didn\u2019t expect Mr. Garish to be sympathetic to her single-parent status, she didn\u2019t expect her daughter to fall for the soft-spoken stranger-soldier whose personality had done a U-turn in the 22 years that had passed since kindergarten.But her daughter did. Mr. Garish spent most of that summer at Ms. Stipkovits\u2019s house, coloring and playing games with Maleena while Ms. Stipkovits, then still healthy, worked 9 to 5 as a medical receptionist.Reintegration to civilian life, Mr. Garish was finding, was a process. \u201cIt was taking a while. One of the things I noticed was, I was really tense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe neighborhood I lived in wasn\u2019t the safest, and I had to give myself time to readjust to the point where I could be in groups of people and not freak out.\u201d Long afternoons spent with Maleena helped. \u201cShe\u2019s got her mama\u2019s attitude. She\u2019s a tough little kid.\u201dHe had nearly forgotten about Jamie\u2019s Dream Team seven years later when the charity offered to throw him and Ms. Stipkovits a wedding. In the whirl of surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation that had become his life with Ms. Stipkovits since they discovered her cancer in 2014, planning a wedding seemed as ridiculous as Ms. Stipkovits\u2019s reaction when he proposed on Aug. 20, 2017.She laughed. \u201cIt was just so funny,\u201d she said. \u201cI was in a hospital bed, dying. I looked at him and said, \u2018You just want the insurance money.\u2019\u201dBut behind the laughter was elation. \u201cI had the same wish every little girl does of a fairy-tale wedding, the crystals and the Cinderella ball gown. And I always told myself that if I found someone who bonded with my daughter in the manner he did, I would marry him. Watching the two of them interact, and the way he\u2019s stuck by me, I would be a fool not to marry him.\u201dShe said yes.The fairy-tale fantasy, complete with crystal ball gown, though, was far out of reach. Not only were the hospital stays adding up, so were the hospital bills. Ms. Stipkovits and Maleena are being supported by family and Mr. Garish; she has long been too sick to work.But there are those around McKeesport who believe in making dreams come true.\u201cLiz is an amazing young woman. She\u2019s always optimistic and she\u2019s been fighting a long time now,\u201d said Lori McKown, an oncology social worker at the hospital. Doctors have not told Ms. Stipkovits how long she can expect to keep fighting. But \u201ctime is of the essence, and I wanted to do something,\u201d Ms. McKown said. In late 2017, she started contacting charities.\u201cIt was a snowy day and I was sitting at my desk looking out at the window. I thought, \u2018This couple wants to get married, and they\u2019re putting their plans off because of her illness,\u2019\u201d she said. A colleague told her about Jamie\u2019s Dream Team.\u201cLittle did I know her fianc\u00e9 had donated his first paycheck there,\u201d she said.Jamie Holmes, the founder of Jamie\u2019s Dream Team, hadn\u2019t forgotten Mr. Garish. \u201cI was like, absolutely we\u2019re going to put on a wedding for them,\u201d she said.Guests, who feasted on fried chicken, baked ziti and macaroni and cheese provided by area restaurants, didn\u2019t seem worried when Ms. Stipkovits fell after Mr. Garish playfully pushed a piece of red velvet cake, iced in pink, toward his new wife\u2019s face. She quickly got up. As her father, Joe Stipkovits said, \u201cThis is the most energetic I\u2019ve seen her in quite some time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve had more trials and tribulations than most married couples have in a lifetime,\u201d Ms. Stipkovits said just before the wedding. \u201cI told Jim, \u2018When we say our vows, the only thing we\u2019ll have left to accomplish is till death do us part.\u2019\u201dHer daughter, Maleena, who has been present for all the worries, described her new stepfather succinctly: \u201cHe makes her happy and he\u2019s a good dude.\u201dA D.J. provided by Jamie\u2019s Dream Team played, \u201cBecause You Loved Me\u201d by Celine Dion for the first dance.\u201d A particular lyric \u2014 \u201cYou were my strength when I was weak/You were my voice when I couldn\u2019t speak\u201d \u2014 had several onlookers in tears while Ms. Stipkovits and Mr. Garish held each other.Mackenzie Rodrigues contributed reporting from Monroeville, Pa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All Roads Lead to Rome, Where Potholes Will Destroy Your Tires", "Date": "2018-03-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRome JournalOn a rainy Sunday morning, Cristiano Davoli stopped traffic and rushed into the middle of the street to save the day.The 45-year-old comic book salesman, wearing a Patch Me logo across his chest, emptied a bag of asphalt into a deep and perilous pothole. He beat the pitch down with the back of a shovel. He pounded it with his boots.\u201cThat\u2019s called an emergency intervention,\u201d said Mr. Davoli, a vigilante hero in the battle against the voracious potholes that have opened across the city.All roads may lead to Rome, but when you get here the mean streets and wrecked pavements will puncture your tires, break your axles, herniate your discs, and in one recent case, swallow your S.U.V. whole.First come the cracks, resembling spider webs. They give way to the grooved pattern of a dry desert floor. Ultimately gaping potholes open up. Camouflaged in a rainy March under cappuccino-colored puddles, they twist ankles, topple zigzagging scooters and turn car rides into brain-rattling off-road excursions.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Mr. Davoli, who has made filling potholes his personal mission, risking fines for filling them in unauthorized areas. His appeals to volunteer citywide have been ignored by the mayor.The city has closed streets and reduced the speed limit in many places to an ancient Roman crawl. The potholes have caused untold accidents, hours of traffic and windfalls for tire dealers. One pothole was credited with shredding the tires of 15 cars in under an hour.Romans say the problem has never been this bad, but the Raggi administration, which has been in power for nearly two years, blames its predecessors. Margherita Gatta, the city\u2019s chief infrastructure official, said that the world\u2019s other cities had lots of potholes too, but that it was \u201cnormal that the capital makes news.\u201dRomans, who do not like walking but don\u2019t mind complaining, bemoan an abnormal situation. They have reacted by posting memes on the internet.In one, Ms. Raggi is up to her lips in a puddle-filled pothole next to the words: \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. You can still stand.\u201d In another, she takes credit for having built \u201c4,000 swimming pools in Rome.\u201dOthers show salmon leaping and alligators snapping out of wet potholes. One Facebook group has started an \u201cadopt a pothole\u201d page.Real life is no less strange. One man spent an afternoon dipping a fishing line into a hole that seemed a small pond. (\u201cBoss,\u201d a passer-by shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s no use!\u201d )Someone spray-painted \u201cpothole\u201d before a pothole in the shadow of the Colosseum. The cobble-stoned road from the train station to Piazza Venezia, in the heart of the city, is rutted, and taxi drivers say bobbling tourists laugh as if on an amusement ride.Scooter drivers, already accustomed to the new Roman slalom, find the degree of difficulty increased by mogullike bumps raised by pine-tree roots and pitch-black streets darkened by broken lampposts. Commuters say their backs hurt. Spleens are getting ruptured.Milanese always called Rome uncivilized. But now so do people in Naples.Romans, conditioned by centuries of seen-it-all cynicism, sometimes even find themselves astonished.In the Monteverde section of the city, Patrizia Ambrosini, 70, stopped to look at a 15-foot chasm fenced off on the street. The ground had given way days earlier and engulfed a Dacia Duster.\u201cWell, this is a first,\u201d she said.One traffic officer on the scene said he had taped off the sidewalk next to the sinkhole, not to protect people from the pit, but because a woman gaping at it almost got hit on the head by pieces of stucco falling from the building above it.As he explained, Thomasz Sobieszek, 47, pulled up on his scooter. \u201cI want to show you something,\u201d he said, showing the officer an illustration on his smartphone of men in togas building roads. \u201cThis is how the ancient Romans built their streets. With three levels!\u201dEarlier, and the earliest, Roman administrations seemed to care more about road maintenance. The Laws of the Twelve Tables, Rome\u2019s first set of rules dating back to 450 B.C., included instructions to make straight roads eight feet wide, stipulated what to do in case of water damage and decreed who \u201cshall build and repair the road.\u201dAround 300 B.C., Romans started building roads to move their troops, citizens and goods. Starting with the Appian Way, named after the censor who ordered its construction, Romans paved an empire. The revolutionary populist Gaius Gracchus helped build public streets because he understood the junction between a road and the rabble\u2019s heart.After Rome collapsed, urban planning fell by the wayside for centuries. In the 1700s, Msgr. Ludovico Sergardi, who oversaw public works at Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica, helped introduce the beveled black basalt cobblestones, known as sampietrini, which are central to the city\u2019s charm. Lore has it that he started laying them down after potholes nearly overturned the pope\u2019s carriage.But these days, the sampietrini have proved treacherous for the city\u2019s many scooters, slippery for dress shoes and murder for stilettos. And they require constant maintenance under heavy traffic.In 2005, Mayor Walter Veltroni tried to remove many of the cobblestones to improve traffic conditions, but subsequent administrations had different policies. In the past decade the city\u2019s streets have become an unattractive patchwork of asphalt, cobblestone, gravel and rubble.\u201cThe Via Crucis of the craters,\u201d wept the Rome-based daily Il Messaggero in November 2014. The next year, the papers lamented \u201cSwiss cheese asphalt,\u201d and Italy\u2019s consumer association sued the city for using lousy materials that contributed to \u201cpathologies for the vertebrae.\u201d A corruption and bribery scandal exposed the plots that led to \u201cthe killer potholes.\u201dBernardo Bertoluci, the movie director, made a short film of his motorized wheelchair getting stuck in the street. During the filming of a James Bond movie in central Rome, the actor Daniel Craig banged his head after hitting a pothole with his speeding Aston Martin.In May 2016, after the city estimated that half its buses broke down because of damage caused by potholes, or buche, the city introduced the toll-free emergency line \u201c060-BUCHE.\u201dToday, Mr. Davoli receives the desperate calls of municipal officials with jurisdiction over local roads and personal pothole alerts, like mini Bat-signals, on his Facebook page. He scrolled through scores of them while Ada De Donato, 75, cheered him and his team on.She asked if they also fixed sidewalks, which, marred by uncurbed dogs, shattered Peroni bottles and disjointed concrete, is hardly a refuge. \u201cLook at this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to break my neck!\u201dMr. Davoli apologized that he did only roads for now and kept filling holes. His trusty sidekick, Raffaele Scamard\u00ec, also wearing a Patch Me sweatshirt, shouted from down the road.\u201cListen,\u201d he called. \u201cThere\u2019s another dangerous one over there.\u201dThey dashed to their car and took off. Slowly. It was a bumpy ride.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Really Wants His Wingman", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump may be going to Korea! Also, to Moon Township, Pa.!While the president\u2019s plan to have direct talks with the North Koreans is fascinating, in a sort of unnerving way, right now we\u2019re going to look at the Moon Township angle. There\u2019s a special House election coming up on Tuesday, and it\u2019s perfectly possible that when it comes to international d\u00e9tente versus the 18th Congressional District, the White House\u2019s real fixation is western Pennsylvania.The 18th C.D. is at the heart of the white, working-class vote that won Trump the Electoral College. It also has wildly gerrymandered borders aimed at guaranteeing Republican control unless the incumbent does something incredible, like championing anti-abortion legislation after hinting to his mistress that she ought to get an abortion if she\u2019s pregnant.Whoops. That was Representative Tim Murphy. Gone but not forgotten.The current district is going to vanish in November when new, less-outrageous boundary lines go into effect. So the only thing that\u2019s really at stake here is whether the voters are going to send an epic, albeit mainly symbolic, rejection letter to Trump. The president is obsessed. He\u2019s scheduled to appear at a rally there this weekend, and he\u2019s sending every possible White House warrior \u2014 from Kellyanne Conway to Donald Jr. \u2014 to the front lines.People, do you think Pennsylvanians are going to get out and vote in the middle of March because Donald Jr. asked them to? Just wondering.The 18th C.D. is very connected to steel making. (Democrat Lamb, when asked about trade issues, tends to say that he thinks whatever the president of the steelworkers\u2019 union thinks.) Last week, as the race got tighter and tighter, Trump suddenly announced he was imposing a ginormous tariff on imported steel and aluminum, triggering the resignation of his chief economic adviser and something as close to a rebellion as you could imagine among the little weenies who make up the Republican members of Congress.Do you think it could possibly have all been for western Pennsylvania? Duh.The Republicans have been complaining that Saccone is a terrible candidate, which is a good way of getting off the hook themselves if he loses. It\u2019s also sort of true. His ads are boring, and his previous social media was worse.In the state legislature, Saccone was a conservative who did not always behave like a guy who expected a congressional seat to open up in his backyard. He once voted against a bill strengthening Pennsylvania\u2019s animal cruelty laws, which passed the House 167 to 20. It was called Libre\u2019s Law in honor of a young Boston terrier abuse victim. Saccone never mentions Libre, although Lamb seems to bring that puppy up quite a bit.Lamb is selling himself as a bipartisan new-broom guy who would vote to get rid of Nancy Pelosi as Democratic House leader. (Coincidentally, he\u2019s getting very little money from the official Democratic money stream, for which Pelosi is a tireless fund-raiser.)Meanwhile Saccone, who started by attempting to pummel Lamb as an enemy of the Trump tax cuts, has pulled way back on that issue. If the race is an upset, or even very close, people are going to start re-evaluating the Republican theory that cutting taxes is a selling point so stupendous that it resembles a political Second Coming.Now instead, the Republican attack ads howl that as a prosecutor, Lamb made a plea bargain deal with a drug dealer.He then demanded that the Republican say the ads were false.Perhaps the most interesting moment came when Saccone dismissed Lamb as \u201csomeone who\u2019s young and idealistic, who still hopes he can change the world.\u201d Which may go down as the most depressing political attack in modern history.So \u2026 bottom line seems to be that it\u2019s the idealist or the wingman. Guess who\u2019s the Donald Trump candidate.Advertisement"}

Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and a Facebook board member, doesn\u2019t tweet anymore, but he \u201clikes\u201d hundreds of tweets a week, a group that recently included a string that mocked the public\u2019s fear that new media forms can be turned into \u201cweapons of total mind control.\u201dPerhaps these are the wrong reasons for outrage, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be outraged. What Facebook is selling to political campaigns is the same thing Uber is selling to its drivers and customers and what YouTube is selling to advertisers who hope to reach an audience of children \u2014 namely, the right to bypass longstanding rules and regulations in order to act with impunity.Selling relief from government scrutiny of elections is a different kind of threat to the social fabric than selling relief from government scrutiny of commerce, especially in light of our country\u2019s record of denying voting rights to African-Americans. Facebook can\u2019t be allowed to be a tool for enemies of democracy because it fears that regulation could hurt its bottom line.What was valuable about allowing a presidential campaign to evade regulation? Well, to start, we know that Facebook, unlike a small-market TV station, didn\u2019t care about Russians buying political ads, even when they paid in rubles. That\u2019s a shock to our political system, which is meant to protect against foreign interference. But more menacing is the prospect that the Trump campaign and its allies may have been given free license by Facebook to suppress African-American turnout through \u201cdark ad posts\u201d that disappeared after viewing.Some of the dark Facebook ads, bought by suspected Russian fronts, have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband. What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout? Were there classic examples of voter suppression, like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket? We don\u2019t know \u2014 the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won\u2019t release them, citing the privacy of its advertisers.Facebook\u2019s vast and well-designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap, direct access to African-American voters \u2014 and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate. In the past, candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers. They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too.Todd A. Cox, the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, sees the question of our \u201creal values\u201d a bit differently. \u201cThere has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, 15th Amendment play\u201d \u2014 the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African-Americans to vote. That is, in addition to Facebook\u2019s libertarian, Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions \u2014 my right to say what I want, my privacy \u2014 we must consider the collective questions: How do we protect historically discriminated groups? How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free, fair elections before we argue about what they can say?Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals, never society as a whole. The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying, \u201cNo answer is what the wrong question begets.\u201d Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade, which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley. Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook. It is one that all Americans should have a voice in answering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Targeting Tech Giants, Europe Unveils Digital Tax Proposal", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European authorities on Wednesday proposed revamping the way many technology companies in the region are taxed, outlining wide-ranging changes that they hope will curb tax avoidance across the European Union.The system would tax a company\u2019s revenues in the countries where they are generated, rather than its profits. Regulators say so-called profit-shifting allows some businesses to use regional offices in low-tax countries to reduce payments.\u201cThe digital revolution has turned our economies upside down,\u201d said Pierre Moscovici, the European Union\u2019s tax commissioner. \u201cWhen you \u2018like\u2019 a picture, when you post a video on social media,\u201d he said, \u201cyour click sets in motion a chain of business transactions and thus creates considerable profits.\u201d\u201cBut under today\u2019s rules, those profits are not taxed,\u201d Mr. Moscovici said. \u201cThe current legal vacuum is creating a substantial shortfall in the budgetary revenues of our member states.\u201d It also creates an uneven playing field between digital and traditional businesses, he argued.The European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm, says tech companies use the profit-shifting method to reduce their tax burdens. In documents obtained by The New York Times before Wednesday\u2019s announcement, officials estimated that digital businesses in the bloc pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent for traditional businesses.Under the new proposals, a 3 percent tax would be levied on the sale of user data, targeted advertising and \u201cinterfaces that put together buyers and sellers.\u201d Officials estimate the tax would generate at least 5 billion euros, or $6.15 billion, annually for European Union member states.Minimum thresholds, however, will mean that only large tech businesses will be subject to the tax, and companies will be able to deduct the payments from their corporate tax contributions to avoid double taxation.The plans announced on Wednesday are not certain to be carried out, as they require the approval of the European Union\u2019s member states, and there is considerable disagreement over how much change is needed.Notably, while big countries like France and Germany have pushed for changes, at least two smaller members have objected, saying the system allows them to attract employers by offering tax advantages.Still, policymakers both within and outside the European Union largely agree that changes are necessary to make global companies \u2014 whether digital or not \u2014 pay their fair share of tax.Ed O\u2019Loughlin contributed reporting from Dublin.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Their Pay Has Stood Still. Now Oklahoma Teachers Could Be the Next to Walk.", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTULSA, Okla. \u2014 When she woke up one morning last week, Tiffany Bell, a teacher at Hamilton Elementary School here, had $35 in her bank account.On take-home pay of $2,200 per month, she supports her husband, a veteran who went back to school, and their three children, all of whom qualify for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, a federal benefit for low-income families. The couple\u2019s 4-year-old twins attend a Head Start preschool \u2014 another antipoverty program.Money is so tight for Ms. Bell, 26, that she had to think twice before spending $15 on Oreos for a class project, in which her third graders removed differing amounts of icing to display the phases of the moon.She knew it would be hard to support a family on a teacher\u2019s salary. \u201cBut not this hard,\u201d she said.And in Oklahoma, where teachers have not had a raise from the state in a decade, they have vowed to go on strike on April 2 if the Legislature does not act to increase pay and education budgets.All three states are paragons of austerity-minded budgeting, guided by a belief that taxes should be as low as possible to encourage people to spend more and companies to move there and grow. But one result has been a cutback in education, a sector in which a large and popular work force is finding it has labor muscles to flex after all.\u201cWe are hemorrhaging from a lack of funding,\u201d said Larry Cagle, a Tulsa teacher and organizer of one of several Facebook groups pushing for a walkout. \u201cIf I get fired, I get fired. I will absolutely not back down.\u201dOklahomans are not always averse to paying more for education. Local districts can use property taxes and bonds to pay for structures, and many of the school buildings are beautiful. Webster Middle and High School in Tulsa is a pristinely maintained Art Deco castle. In 2015, Tulsa voters passed a $415 million bond to invest in technology and the district\u2019s physical infrastructure.But most instructional costs are covered by the state, where laws and politics make it difficult to raise taxes. And it is inside the classroom that students and parents have noticed the impact of depressed state budgets.Webster, where 88 percent of students come from low-income families, has cut its advanced foreign language courses, along with classes in drama and debate. Six miles away, Carver Middle School has rationed paper and there are not enough parts to go around in robotics class, students said.About a fifth of Oklahoma school districts, mostly in rural areas, are trying an even more drastic way to save money: a four-day week. (They cannot cut the number of instructional hours, so the school days tend to be longer.)Across the state, teachers say they make ends meet by selling their blood plasma, or by working second jobs as luggage handlers, Uber drivers or in lawn maintenance.The current budget situation is so dire that some superintendents and school boards are supporting, and even helping to organize, the proposed teacher walkout.Deborah Gist, who as the hard-charging education commissioner in Rhode Island tried to weaken teachers\u2019 seniority protections and often clashed with their union, is now Tulsa\u2019s schools superintendent and is allied with the Oklahoma union \u2014 the Oklahoma Education Association \u2014 in a fight for more money.Dr. Gist said she is unable to attract or retain effective educators because they can earn up to $20,000 more per year by moving to Texas or other neighboring states. Because so few licensed teachers are applying for jobs, Tulsa has relied on emergency certifications to hire more than 100 teachers who lack training in education.\u201cOur teachers in Oklahoma are going above and beyond every single day for an unacceptable and unsustainable salary that doesn\u2019t even provide them with a living wage,\u201d she said.Teachers in Oklahoma earn $45,000 a year on average, the third-lowest in the country; only those in Mississippi and South Dakota earn less, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. They are doing better, though, than many workers in Oklahoma, which has the third-lowest cost of living and where the average teacher salary is about equal to the median household income.But teachers, especially those in their 20s and 30s, say they live paycheck to paycheck, without the middle-class stability they expected when they chose teaching as a career, often taking on student debt along the way.Becky Atherton Dukes, an art teacher at Carnegie Elementary School in Tulsa, pays $400 per month for health insurance for herself and her daughter. She and her husband, a house painter, are expecting a second child, and their day care costs will exceed Ms. Dukes\u2019s pay. \u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it would be nice to be able to afford a family vacation or have money for savings.\u201dMost here believe there is little hope of avoiding the walkout.In 2016, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have increased education funding through an additional one percent sales tax. More recently, a legislative proposal called Step Up Oklahoma would have funded $5,000 raises by increasing gas and tobacco taxes and modestly raising production taxes on the energy industry. It was supported by Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, the teachers\u2019 union and a coalition of business leaders.On Feb. 12, 63 members of the state House of Representatives voted for it, and 35 against, short of the required 75 percent supermajority.Democratic opponents said the plan was too easy on oil and gas, while raising taxes too high on the wind industry. They also asked for an increase in income taxes on high earners.Moderate Republicans say colleagues further to the right are wedded to an ideology that no longer makes sense.\u201cThey just won\u2019t raise taxes,\u201d said Representative Earl Sears, a retired principal and the chairman of the House appropriations committee. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we\u2019ve cut so much, we now have to go in and make investments. If that means raising taxes, so be it.\u201dMr. Sears also accused Democrats of wanting the schools crisis to continue, so they could run on the issue in future elections. \u201cThey really don\u2019t want to give the Republican Party a victory,\u201d he said.Indeed, anger about education cuts has helped fuel something of a blue ripple in this Republican-dominated state, with Democrats flipping four legislative seats in special elections in 2017.After the defeat of the bill, educators began to gather on Facebook and in person to share their frustration. Rank-and-file teachers pushed their union to support their demand that the state act before April 2 or face a work stoppage. The Oklahoma Education Association is now asking for a $10,000 raise for teachers, a $5,000 raise for school support staff and a $200 million increase in schools funding.On March 12, Oklahoma teachers took their first steps toward a strike, beginning a \u201cwork to contract\u201d protest in which teachers marched out of their schools when the last bell rang. They refused to tutor students, email with parents or grade papers after hours.At Carver Middle School on Tuesday, students applauded as their teachers filed out of the building.At Carnegie Elementary School, Ms. Dukes reluctantly canceled her students\u2019 annual art show. In preparation, she had meticulously organized and labeled every pinch pot and collage in her classroom. But bringing the event to fruition would have required logging long hours after school and at home, work that she believes entitles her to a raise.One of her colleagues, she said, had moved away from Oklahoma, and now earns the equivalent of $85,000 per year as a teacher.Ms. Dukes laughed. \u201cTo get her American dream,\u201d she said, \u201cshe had to move to China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Most of them are based in the United States: Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Myspace, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and YouTube. But several are based overseas: the Chinese sites Douban, QQ, Sina Weibo, Tencent Weibo and Youku; the Russian social network VK; Twoo, which was created in Belgium; and Ask.fm, a question-and-answer platform based in Latvia.But the new proposal would add a tangible new requirement for millions of people who apply to visit the United States for business or pleasure, including citizens of such countries as Brazil, China, India and Mexico.In addition, visitors traveling on diplomatic and official visas will mostly be exempted.As news of the plan emerged on Friday, so did criticism.\u201cThis attempt to collect a massive amount of information on the social media activity of millions of visa applicants is yet another ineffective and deeply problematic Trump administration plan,\u201d said Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s National Security Project. \u201cIt will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official.\u201dFacebook said its position had not changed since last year, when it said: \u201cWe oppose any efforts to force travelers at the border to turn over their private account information, including passwords.\u201dAlong with the social media information, visa applicants will be asked for past passport numbers, phone numbers and email addresses; for records of international travel; whether they have been deported or removed, or violated immigration law, in the past; and whether relatives have been involved in terrorist activities.\u201cMaintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats,\u201d the State Department said in a statement. \u201cWe already request limited contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.\u201dLast year, John F. Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security and is now Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, told members of Congress that his department was considering asking visitors for passwords and access to online accounts.\u201cWe want to get on their social media, with passwords,\u201d Mr. Kelly told members of the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to cooperate, then you don\u2019t come in.\u201dThe new State Department requirements will not take effect immediately. The proposal set off a 60-day period for public comment, which ends on May 29.On Sina Weibo, one of China\u2019s largest social media platforms, several users were critical of the plan.\u201cDoes it mean someone\u2019s visa application will likely be rejected if he/she has been critical of the U.S.?\u201d one wrote. \u201cWhat about your sacred \u2018freedom of speech?\u2019\u201dAnother user wrote: \u201cWe Chinese have learned well enough the lessons to be drawn from isolation.

{"Headline": "In Poor Countries, Antismoking Activists Face Threats and Violence", "Date": "2018-03-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal HealthSix years ago, more than a dozen men with AK-47s shot their way into Akinbode Oluwafemi\u2019s home in Lagos, Nigeria. They killed his house guard and his brother-in-law, and briefly held a muzzle to the head of one of his year-old twins.He was one of several tobacco control advocates at last week\u2019s 17th World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Cape Town who in telephone conversations described violence or threats they faced as they fought the expansion of smoking in their countries.No arrests were made in any case, and none of the victims could prove that the men assaulting or threatening them worked for the industry. But the pattern was consistent.They were first quietly warned that they were upsetting cigarette companies, tobacco farmers or government officials connected to the industry. If the activists persisted, threats or violence escalated suddenly and unpredictably.A year later, he said, an intruder pushed into the lobby of his Jakarta apartment just as he was taking his children to school.And just two years ago, he said, he received a Facebook message warning: \u201cDo not interfere in our tobacco affairs.\u201d It ended with \u201cYour coming made the atmosphere not good.\u201dWhen he looked up the sender\u2019s name, Dr. Bam said, he found an official of the Indonesia Tobacco Growers Association.Mr. Oluwafemi said he could not prove that his attackers were linked to the tobacco industry in his country, but he strongly suspected it. They were far better dressed and better armed than typical robbers in Nigeria, he said, and his modest home was an unpromising target in a neighborhood of mansions with Mercedes-Benzes.Also, he added, they started firing even before they cleared the outside wall. He may have survived, he said, partly because of the chaos caused by all the shooting \u2014 the police later counted 75 empty shells.The killers fatally shot one of their own by accident, and ultimately fled in his nine-year-old minivan, ignoring his new Toyota Camry and taking only about $400, some baby clothes and food.More telling was the fact that he was threatened both before and after the attack. The first time was in 2010, when he was on Nigerian radio criticizing the industry.\u201cSomeone called a friend of mine and said I should shut up or be killed,\u201d he said. Two years ago, as he was interviewed on Africa Independent Television, someone called another friend and said: \u201cYour boy is on TV again \u2014 we have arranged that he\u2019ll be killed.\u201dMr. Oluwafemi abandoned his house after the attack. He declined an offer from a friend, a general in the Nigerian Army, to post soldiers outside his new home.He also turned down offers from Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to move him and his family to the United States.\u201cIf I left,\u201d he said, \u201cI felt it would mean they have won.\u201dThe discussion of threats was an undercurrent at what was already a contentious conference held to highlight the tobacco industry\u2019s focus on poor and middle-income countries.It was led by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the new director-general of the World Health Organization; Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is the W.H.O.\u2019s global ambassador for noncommunicable diseases; and South Africa\u2019s health minister, Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi.Dr. Tedros, the first African to head the W.H.O., called Africa \u201cground zero for the war on tobacco\u201d as the industry, losing customers in the West, seeks new markets there.Mr. Bloomberg announced that he was donating $20 million to create a new global watchdog agency called Stopping Tobacco Organizations and Products \u2014 or S.T.O.P. \u2014 devoted to monitoring the industry\u2019s deceptive tactics.In a phone call with reporters before the conference, Mr. Bloomberg named Philip Morris, the makers of Marlboro, as his prime target.Last year, the tobacco firm created a \u201cFoundation for a Smoke-Free World\u201d and promised to donate nearly $1 billion to it over 12 years. Tobacco companies are now marketing electronic cigarettes and devices that heat cigarettes without burning them; critics consider the foundation a ruse intended to spread the notion that those products are less harmful than cigarettes and help reduce smoking rates.\u201cThis is an effort by Philip Morris to confuse the public,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s fake science as well as fake news. Deliberately misleading governments with misinformation is just something we should not put up with.\u201dAndr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, the chief executive of Philip Morris, called Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s announcement \u201csimply a repetition of decades-old rhetoric now being applied to the reality of 2018 by those who don\u2019t want men and women who would otherwise continue smoking to have access to potentially better alternatives. The ultimate result is confusion amongst adult consumers, leading us to wonder who is misleading whom.\u201dThe campaign, nicknamed Mpower, urges governments to raise tobacco taxes, prohibit smoking in public, outlaw cigarette giveaways and advertising aimed at children, and offer nicotine patches and other help to smokers trying to quit.At the conference, Dr. Loida Alzona, director of health, public safety and environmental protection at the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority in the Philippines, described how her agency was defeated in court when it tried to enforce regulations outlawing smoking on transit platforms and streets.Two men fined for smoking sued, demanding an injunction preventing her agency from penalizing anyone. They persisted even after charges against them were dropped, Dr. Alzona said, repeatedly appearing with high-priced lawyers even though they were low-paid workers.One said later in a television interview that he was among about 50 men recruited by tobacco industry lawyers to try to be arrested in order to provoke a test case, Dr. Alzona said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of years ago that Akinbode Oluwafemi\u2019s home was invaded.

The California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association has been consistently opposed to one of the sanctuary laws, Senate Bill 54, which limits cooperation between state and federal authorities when minor crimes are involved.We spoke with Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County, who is president of the association and attended Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech. (Our chat has been edited and condensed below.)Q. On what grounds do you oppose SB 54?A. We believe that it has a negative impact on public safety. And we believe that fundamentally it is wrong to limit communication between federal law enforcement agencies and law enforcement officers regardless of their jurisdiction.Q. What does SB 54 restrict you from doing?A. We want to make sure that we do not unnecessarily release people from custody who could otherwise be removed from the country if they are criminals, if they have a likelihood of reoffending or re-victimizing people in our communities.Q. The law allows state law enforcement to communicate with federal immigration authorities in the case of serious crimes. You think the list of crimes isn\u2019t broad enough?A. That\u2019s correct. For example, repeat drunk driving \u2014 you get someone who is arrested two or three times; domestic battery, assault on a peace officer; animal cruelty or abuse; serial theft \u2014 someone who has been arrested multiple times for shoplifting.Q. You are also concerned about gang members.A. If someone is in custody \u2014 and it could be for a minor offense \u2014 and if that person is a known member of a gang that is a criminal enterprise, like MS-13 for example, we see no reason why that person should be released back into the community.

It Has Spent $0.", "Date": "2018-03-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department\u2019s Global Engagement Center \u2014 which has been tasked with countering Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign \u2014 speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts.Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.\u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they\u2019re going to find ways to do that,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said in an interview last month with Fox News. \u201cAnd we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201dThe role for the Global Engagement Center would be to assess Russian efforts and then set about amplifying a different set of voices to counter them, perhaps creating a network of anti-propaganda projects dispersed around the world, experts said.\u201cThere are now thousands of former Russian journalists who have been exiled or fired who are doing counter-Russian stuff in exile who we could help,\u201d said Richard Stengel, who as the under secretary for public diplomacy in the Obama administration had oversight of the Global Engagement Center.Concerted campaigns to highlight the roles of Russian troll farms or Russian mercenaries in Ukraine and Syria could have a profound effect, Mr. Stengel said.At the end of the Obama administration, Congress directed the Pentagon to send $60 million to the State Department so it could coordinate governmentwide efforts, including those by the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, to counter anti-democratic propaganda by Russia and China. This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks.Mr. Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money. The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.State Department officials say they expect to receive the money in April. Steve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said he would contribute $1 million from his own budget to \u201ckick-start the initiative quickly.\u201d\u201cThis funding is critical to ensuring that we continue an aggressive response to malign influence and disinformation,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said.On Wednesday, Mark E. Mitchell, a top official in the Defense Department, said much wrangling remained before any of the promised $40 million is transferred to the State Department.\u201cWe\u2019re still a ways off,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.The delays have infuriated some members of Congress, which approved the funding transfer with bipartisan support.\u201cIt is well past time that the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center gets the resources Congress intended for it to effectively fight Kremlin-sponsored disinformation and other foreign propaganda operations,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Wednesday.Adele Ruppe, the center\u2019s chief of staff, defended the administration\u2019s broader efforts to counter Russian propaganda, pointing out that the State Department had provided $1.3 billion in assistance in 2017 to strengthen European resilience to Russian meddling. But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration, and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year, to $527 million, and to $491 million for the next year.While it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon, the center, which has a staff of around 60 people, including 23 contract analysts, will continue working on its original mission: countering jihadist and extremist propaganda.Most of the center\u2019s leaders are working in temporary assignments, a product of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s halt in promotions. The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.James K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W. Bush administration, said the center\u2019s uncertain funding and temporary leadership reflected the administration\u2019s lack of interest in countering either jihadist or Russian propaganda.\u201cThey\u2019ve got the vehicle to do this work in the center,\u201d Mr. Glassman said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t have is a secretary of state or a president who\u2019s interested in doing this work.\u201dMr. Tillerson is focusing his energies instead on drastically shrinking the department, leaving a significant part of its budget unused and hundreds of important decisions unmade.Because of the hiring and promotion freezes that have left large sums unspent, as well as Mr. Tillerson\u2019s refusal to delegate spending decisions, the department had a backlog of more than 1,400 official requests for Mr. Tillerson\u2019s signoff at the end of last year, according to a former senior diplomat who left the department then.Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Supercolony of Penguins Has Been Found Near Antarctica", "Date": "2018-03-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySatellite images and a drone discovered about 1.5 million Ad\u00e9lie penguins living in the Danger Islands, one of two species whose habitats require ice.A new colony of Ad\u00e9lie penguins has been discovered near Antarctica, substantially increasing the known populations of the knee-high creatures.\u201cIt\u2019s always good news when you find new penguins,\u201d said P. Dee Boersma, director of the Center for Ecosystem Sentinels at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the new study. \u201cThe trends have not been good for so many of these species.\u201dAfter several years of preparation, a team of researchers traveled in 2015 to the Danger Islands near the Weddell Sea to do a more precise count on the nine-island archipelago. Using a drone doctored to work in the extreme climate of the region, the researchers were able to get a precise estimate of the numbers of breeding pairs of Ad\u00e9lie penguins in the region: about 750,000 (or 1.5 million individuals).\u201cThe drone imagery is of a quality that just blows everything else away,\u201d said Dr. Lynch, a quantitative ecologist at Stony Brook University. \u201cYou can see each penguin on the landscape.\u201dDr. Lynch said researchers had already known about a population on Heroina Island, at the northeast end of the Danger Islands chain. Now they\u2019ve found that sizable populations live on other islands near Heroina. \u201cThese new colonies totally change our appreciation of the Danger Islands as a penguin hot spot,\u201d she said.The greater numbers will help ensure that conservation efforts focus on keeping them safe, she said.\u201cThis area falls between two marine-protected areas that are being planned right now,\u201d she said. And until this discovery, the Danger Islands \u201cwasn\u2019t considered a high priority for protection.\u201dDr. Boersma, also co-chairwoman of the Penguin Specialist Group for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, agreed that finding penguins in some of the more remote spots on earth is crucial. Now, she said, researchers need to watch them over time to track how they\u2019re faring.One of the surprises of the study, Dr. Lynch said, was that the Danger Islands penguins don\u2019t nest in a circular pattern, as would be expected, to provide the best protection from predators. Instead, they seem to be faithful to individual nesting spots, prizing habit over safety, she said.The Ad\u00e9lie are not recent migrants to the Danger Islands. Photos taken in 1957 by seaplane show colony boundaries in virtually the same locations \u2014 now that researchers know what they\u2019re looking for.The discovery of so many new animals has raised questions about how they\u2019re finding enough food. \u201cWhat it is about the ocean right in that region that makes it so productive, is something we\u2019d like to figure out,\u201d Dr. Lynch said.There were plenty of challenges working in one of the coldest places on the planet, said Hanumant Singh, another study co-author. The batteries for the drones kept freezing and losing their power, until the researchers began keeping them warm inside their jackets, said Dr. Singh, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cIf you warm them, they\u2019ll keep flying,\u201d he said.They also had to manipulate the drones to operate at such a southern latitude, where the change in the earth\u2019s magnetic field close to the poles makes navigation more difficult, said Dr. Singh, who is also an associate scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in Woods Hole, Mass.The global Ad\u00e9lie penguin population now numbers about 4 million pairs and has nearly doubled over the last four decades, for unknown reasons, Dr. Lynch said. But the population along the Western Antarctic Peninsula \u2014 one of the most rapidly warming places on the planet \u2014 has dropped substantially in recent years, she said.Ad\u00e9lie are one of two penguin species that live on ice, and thus in some of the coldest places on earth.The biggest populations of Ad\u00e9lie penguins live in the Ross Sea, below and east of New Zealand.While she remains anxious about the penguin\u2019s long-term survival, Dr. Lynch said that finding new colonies is encouraging.\u201cEcologists worry about having all your eggs in one basket,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a second basket now on opposite ends of the continent.\u201d____Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hashtag Open House", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInfluencers in Los Angeles and New York are saving us from dreary old open houses. Maybe you can get some cheap rent out of your Snapchat?LOS ANGELES \u2014 The black-lit pillow fight room was perfect. \u201cAnything with movement, it\u2019s an instant boomerang!\u201d said Ayla Woodruff. \u201cThat\u2019s just a given.\u201d She quickly jumped into the milieu, picked up a few white feathers and asked her mother to start shooting. Half a dozen models in form-fitting pajamas theatrically swung pillows at each other, jumped on the bed and hammed it up as party guests snapped pictures with their phones.This was at a real estate open house on a recent evening in Los Angeles. There were a few stacks of fliers with the usual twilight photos and bullet-point highlights of the home on offer (a $15.895-million hillside contemporary-style mansion with an infinity pool and 360-degree views of Los Angeles). With well-planned selfie backdrops at every turn, the house had been staged to catch fire on social media. There was a gold-painted room with a gold bathtub filled with plastic Bitcoins for a Scrooge McDuck-style submersion. Downstairs sat a marijuana throne surrounded by pot plants sprouting from white shopping bags. Nearby was a lounge where visitors could smoke vaguely pineapple-flavored weed with sleek white vape pens \u2014 theirs to take home if they posted a photo from the event on social media with the evening\u2019s recommended hashtag: #EnchantedWoodsLA.We\u2019ve grown accustomed to seeing all sorts of products promoted with sponsored Instagram posts or on Snapchat stories, but, so far, homes are rarely marketed this way. Some developers and real estate agents are trying to change that, experimenting with social media influencer partnerships, Instagram backdrops and Snapchat-friendly house tours to sell properties including blocks of apartments in big rental buildings and single-family luxury homes. \u201cThe standard real estate open house is a yawner,\u201d said Ernie Carswell, a Douglas Elliman agent with the listing for the Los Angeles house. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much appetite for wine and cheese.\u201d So some in the business are rethinking the scene, throwing out genre hallmarks like attractively arranged bottles of Pellegrino, crudit\u00e9 platters and rules about jumping on neatly made beds. Others are taking it a step further, spending money to move influencers into the building. Tavi Gevinson, the 21-year-old actress and founder of Rookie, lives in 300 Ashland, a 379-unit luxury apartment tower across the street from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where studios start at $2,365 per month. From time to time her Instagram feed includes images from the building. In one, she plays dominoes on the roof deck. In another, she shares a picture of her bulletin board. Both include the hashtag #300ashlandpartner.The New York-based developer Two Trees hired Ms. Gevinson and other influential locals to move in, mention the buildings in social media posts and host a few live events. Ms. Gevinson hosted a clothing tag sale on the public plaza of her building to benefit Housing Works. \u201cWe thought it would be a great way to give a voice to a building,\u201d said Brian Upbin, the head of asset management for Two Trees. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great product out there. Anyone can go to StreetEasy to see highly stylized photos or renderings.\u201dMs. Gevinson, who is entering her second year of a two-year partnership, said sharing her building\u2019s address and glimpses into her home life with her Instagram followers didn\u2019t feel as \u201cTruman Show\u201d-esque as it might sound. Though she and Two Trees declined to disclose the specific financial terms of the arrangement, Ms. Gevinson said she pays rent and the developer pays her for the promotional partnership.Alexander Ali, the publicist who planned the Los Angeles party for Mr. Carswell and the home\u2019s developer, ANR Signature Collection, said the idea was to create an event that would feel like less like a staid broker\u2019s open house and more like the Museum of Ice Cream, the popular Instagram-bait pop-up galleries in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami where guests can take pictures of each other jumping into a swimming-pool-size vat of rainbow-colored sprinkles. Earlier that evening, Mr. Ali had scrapped a plan for a giant clamshell from which a model was going to emerge to serve champagne (\u201cit just wasn\u2019t on brand\u201d), but otherwise everything was coming together as planned.\u201cThe goal is to get 100,000 impressions with 100 visitors,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who described the event as a series of \u201cmoments\u201d for guests to photograph, post and hashtag. \u201cEverything is about, \u2018You have to take a picture with this!\u2019\u201d Invitations had been sent to real estate agents as well as assorted Instagram influencers, artists and minor celebrities (including the singer Dannii Minogue, Kylie Minogue\u2019s lesser-known sister). In the end, about 150 guests spent the evening meandering their way through the 6,700-square-foot house, collecting Jo Malone gift bags in the marble-clad master bathroom and snapping \u201cdrug kingpin moment\u201d pictures of each other on the pot throne. (Were there potential buyers in the mix? No one seemed too concerned either way.) Real estate agents have never been ones to shy away from trying something attention grabbing to stand out from the pack \u2014 think goofy bus stop bench ads or embarrassing-photo billboards. Social media influence is the next logical step. Some think an influencer\u2019s wide reach may be a disadvantage. Widecasting about a house for sale \u201cwill be seen by a lot of people who can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t want to live in that neighborhood,\u201d said Gil Eyal, the C.E.O. of Hypr, a company that does social media influencer analytics. Mr. Kelman said Redfin\u2019s research has shown the best tactic is using data analysis to track potential buyer searches online. \u201cWhat works is making sure everybody who is a serious buyer knows about the open house, and using much more targeted marketing techniques,\u201d he said. (Other agencies and developers do this as well, using targeted Facebook or Instagram ads.)Social media, however, could be a good way for real estate agents to stand out from one another in a competitive market and turn themselves into influencers. Andrew Jevin, a Santa Monica-based real estate agent who attended the #EnchantedWoodsLA party, uses Snapchat and Instagram stories to show off new listings and open houses to his 8,000 followers and said that it has helped him connect with new clients. \u201cI think social media has been untapped,\u201d said Mr. Jevin, whose Snapchat handle is @thesnappingrealtor. \u201cYou\u2019re going out cold-calling people and knocking on doors, why aren\u2019t you on Instagram?\u201d Another real estate agent, Brittney Hinds, agreed. \u201cOur clients are on Instagram showcasing their lifestyle so you have to meet them where they\u2019re at,\u201d she said. (Her posts from the evening included a shot of her sipping champagne in the pillow-fight room with the caption \u201cthe after party is at your house if you live at #EnchantedWoods LA \u2026 contact me for details.\u201d) The low barrier to entry for social media campaigns can help agents and developers build buzz basically for free. Justin Barth, a Los Angeles-based developer, hired five local artists to create a selfie-friendly mural that included an Instagram handle for a new building for Vica, a new 31-condo development in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, scheduled to be completed in 2019. The building is next to the frequently Instagrammed Micheltorena Staircase. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle way to promote the project that\u2019s not so in your face,\u201d Mr. Barth said.George Jordan and Agustin Rodriguez, of ANR Signature Collection, the sellers of the $15.895 million Los Angeles property, declined to say what they spent on the social media open house but said the cost was offset by several sponsors, including the weed purveyor (Bloom) and Vesta, the staging company that furnished the home. The listing agent also paid a portion. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about the pillow fight at first, but it\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Mr. Rodriguez, standing near the home\u2019s infinity pool as the party picked up momentum behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s different, it\u2019s young, it\u2019s fun.\u201dToward the end of the evening she made her way up to the roof deck dance floor but had lost track of her parents. They emerged from around a corner near the master suite. \u201cWe\u2019re very impressed with the laundry room,\u201d Diana Woodruff shouted to her daughter. \u201cThere are two washers! Two dryers!\u201d\u201cMom! Jeez, come on!\u201d Ayla Woodruff said, corralling them upstairs to take more photos. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Leaves Its Users\u2019 Privacy Vulnerable", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialFacebook is once again struggling with revelations that manipulative characters exploited the vulnerabilities of its platform during the 2016 election to put Donald Trump in the White House. The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign, and a professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent. That may sound like decisive action, but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem.What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app, most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had. Further, Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015. The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data.It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge\u2019s effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what\u2019s called \u201cpsychographic data\u201d for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of the Criminal Immigrant", "Date": "2018-03-30", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your InboxThe Trump administration\u2019s first year of immigration policy has relied on claims that immigrants bring crime into America. President Trump\u2019s latest target is sanctuary cities.\u201cEvery day, sanctuary cities release illegal immigrants, drug dealers, traffickers, gang members back into our communities,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThey\u2019re safe havens for just some terrible people.\u201dImmigrant populations in the United States have been growing fast for decades now. Crime in the same period, however, has moved in the opposite direction, with the national rate of violent crime today well below what it was in 1980.According to data from the study, a large majority of the areas have many more immigrants today than they did in 1980 and fewer violent crimes. The Marshall Project extended the study\u2019s data up to 2016, showing that crime fell more often than it rose even as immigrant populations grew almost across the board.In 136 metro areas, almost 70 percent of those studied, the immigrant population increased between 1980 and 2016 while crime stayed stable or fell. The number of areas where crime and immigration both increased was much lower \u2014 54 areas, slightly more than a quarter of the total. The 10 places with the largest increases in immigrants all had lower levels of crime in 2016 than in 1980.There\u2019s a similar pattern in two other places where Mr. Trump has recently feuded with local leaders: Oakland, Calif., and Lawrence, Mass. He described both cities as breeding grounds for drugs and crime brought by immigrants. But Oakland, like Orange County, has had increasing immigration and falling crime. In Lawrence, though murder and robbery rates grew, overall violent crime rates still fell by 10 percent.In general, the study\u2019s data suggests either that immigration has the effect of reducing average crime, or that there is simply no relationship between the two, and that the 54 areas in the study where both grew were instances of coincidence, not cause and effect. This was a consistent pattern in each decade from 1980 to 2016, with immigrant populations and crime failing to grow together.In a majority of areas, the number of immigrants increased at least 57 percent and as much as 183 percent, with the greatest increases occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. Violent crime rates in most areas ranged between a 43 percent decline and a 6 percent rise, often trending downward by the 2000s. Places with a sharp rise in the immigrant population experienced increases in crime rates no more frequently than those with modest or no growth in immigration. On average, the immigrant population grew by 137 percent between 1980 and 2016, with average crime falling 12 percent over the same period.Because the F.B.I. changed how rape was defined in its crime figures, that category could not be included in this analysis. Focusing on the other components of the violent crime rate \u2014 assaults, robberies and murders \u2014 still fails to reveal a relationship with immigration rates.AssaultsRobberiesMurdersMost areas experienced decreases in all types of violent crime. The change in assault rates ranged from a 34 percent decline to a 29 percent rise, while robbery rates declined in the range of 12 percent to 57 percent, and murder rates declined in the range of 15 percent to 54 percent.This analysis is one of the most comprehensive longitudinal studies of the local immigrant-crime relationship. It spans decades of metropolitan area data, incorporating places with widely differing social, cultural and economic backgrounds, and a broad range of types of violent crime.Areas were chosen to reflect a range of immigrant composition, from Wheeling, W.Va., where one in 100 people was born outside the United States, to Miami, where every second person was. Some areas were home to newly formed immigrant communities; other immigrant pockets went back generations. Controlling for population characteristics, unemployment rates and other socioeconomic conditions, the researchers still found that, on average, as immigration increases in American metropolises, crime decreases.The foreign-born data, which is collected through the census, most likely undercounts the numbers of undocumented immigrants, many of whom might wish to avoid the risk of identifying themselves. They are, however, at least partly represented in the overall foreign-born population counts.Some metropolitan areas changed over time, growing to include additional regions, or splitting into separate ones. The Marshall Project consulted with the study researchers to determine when a larger area was still an appropriate match to the original described in the study. When an area split into components, raw data from each was added to calculate rates approximating the original region. When no reasonable approximation to the original area could be found, it was marked as missing for 2016.When an area was missing information for a certain year, that year's data was interpolated using figures from the closest year available. For example, crime numbers were unavailable for Chicago for 2000 and 2010. Data for those years was linearly interpolated using the 1990 and 2016 figures. Charlotte, N.C., was not included in either the 2016 or 2015 U.C.R. metropolitan area data sets, so data from 2010, the most recent year with available data for this area, was used as an estimate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Russia Meddle in Italy\u2019s Election? It May Not Have To", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 It happened in the United States. Then there were the Netherlands, France and Germany. One after the other, the West\u2019s leading democracies have staged national elections in which Russia is accused of using social media and fake news to try to influence the outcome.But the difference this time is that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia might not even need to bother, because the parties most likely to do well in Italy would probably be favored by Russia, too.Much has changed since Russia started its online misinformation campaigns, and much of it is good for Mr. Putin.Just two years ago, Mr. Putin was on the defensive and facing the prospect of Hillary Clinton, no fan of his, occupying the White House. Instead, he got President Trump.Italy is already traditionally one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe, and among the favored outcomes for Mr. Putin in Sunday\u2019s election, there are a lot to choose from.While Italy does not carry the weight of Germany or France, he said, having an Italian government willing to resist its Western partners furthers Russia\u2019s interest in dividing European countries from the United States and one another.\u201cAny division inside NATO and the European Union could be used, maybe not now, but in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to face a fractured enemy.\u201dAt a recent political rally, Mr. Salvini mocked those who alleged that he had accepted money from Mr. Putin by saying, \u201cI admire Putin as a man of state, a man of government who defends the interests of his people and his businesses, who defends his values and borders, and I esteem him for free, not for money.\u201dA web-based populist party, it reversed its previous opposition to Mr. Putin in 2014 because, defectors say, the party leadership realized how popular Mr. Putin had become.In this election, Mr. Renzi has been outspoken against homegrown manipulation of Facebook and other social media to spread misinformation, but has been careful not to blame Russia.Last week, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, also of the Democratic Party, released an annual security report warning of online \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d before the elections, but did not mention Russia by name.A map in the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Rome showed the scores of cities and towns where Russia had official and unofficial headquarters.At a recent inauguration there of a \u201cRussian Seasons\u201d program of cultural events in Italy, the Russian ambassador, Sergey Razov, celebrated the 255 cultural events in 40 Italian cities. He said they had helped bring about a \u201cpositive development of relations between our countries.\u201dAsked by The Times whether his government also sought to bring the countries together by providing political aid to Italy\u2019s many pro-Russian parties, the usually poker-faced ambassador allowed himself a slight grin.\u201cIn the last months, your American colleagues tried to ask these questions about Russian influence, for example in the Italian elections,\u201d Mr. Razov said before deferring to a denial made days earlier by Mr. Putin.That doesn\u2019t mean everyone has ruled out the possibility that Russia is entirely sitting this one out.The article offered no proof for the allegation, which Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Salvini both dismissed as \u201cfake news.\u201dMr. Salvini went the extra step of finding motivation for the article in Mr. Biden\u2019s son\u2019s being \u201cnominated to the administrative council of Ukraine\u2019s biggest energy company \u2014 you understand how the great powers work?\u201d he said.Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and now senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy, helped write the Foreign Affairs piece with Mr. Biden. \u201cBased on my time in government,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said, \u201cI am very confident that the Russians interfered, used disinformation in the Italian campaign\u201d against Mr. Renzi in 2016.Mr. Carpenter said that he maintained a strong suspicion that Russian internet trolls actively supported the Five Star Movement and the League ahead of the coming elections, but that he no longer had the security clearances to prove that.Amid all of the focus on the Five Star Movement\u2019s sympathies for Russia, Luigi Di Maio, the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, has sought to create some distance. He now tempers his remarks about Russia by pointing out that he has visited Washington as well and that his \u201cobjective\u201d is to remain an ally of the United States.\u201cMany of you have heard talk about the relations between the Five Star Movement and the Russian Federation, and I remember there was here a prime minister who had very very friendly relations with Russia and also economic business that I believe was illicit,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said, referring to Mr. Berlusconi.\u201cBut, and who knows why, the only one who is denounced as having shadowy, disturbing relations with Russia is the Five Star Movement, which surely is the party that has less relations with the Russian Federation than all the others,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Is Silicon Valley Really Over?", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHi, pals. I\u2019m Kevin. I\u2019m a columnist here at The Times, and I\u2019ll be filling in for Farhad and Mike on this newsletter while they\u2019re both \u201cout on book leave.\u201d (Read: tweeting and playing Fortnite in their PJs.) Mostly, I write about Silicon Valley and how technology interacts with the larger worlds of business and culture.Today, though, I want to talk about the Midwest.One of my main lessons from the trip was that a lot of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite have gotten fed up with the Bay Area for various reasons (housing prices, tech monoculture, too much money chasing too few start-ups, etc.), and are looking enviously at other parts of the country. Which I thought was a pretty obvious and uncontroversial take!There are basically three things I can imagine Silicon Valley investors doing in the Midwest in the near term:1. Investing in companies based there.2. Encouraging Silicon Valley-based portfolio companies to relocate some percentage of their employees there.3. Moving there themselves.My guess is that No. 3 is, if not impossible, at least several years away from being realistic for most venture capitalists, many of whom have their roots planted in the Bay Area and benefit from being near dense clusters of start-ups. But Nos. 1 and 2 seem completely plausible \u2014 and, in fact, are already happening.On the bus, I heard a lot of talk about \u201cmid-tech\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs at tech companies that aren\u2019t hard-core engineering, but require some technical expertise. (Think sales, growth, design.) While executives and engineers get positive network effects from being near clusters of other executives and engineers in San Francisco, there\u2019s no real reason that mid-tech employees can\u2019t just as easily be in Bend, Ore., or South Bend.But I\u2019m not so sure. Tools like Slack and GitHub now allow tech employees to work remotely in a way that previous generations weren\u2019t able to, and the cost-of-living differential between the Bay Area and every other city (with the exceptions of New York and L.A.) is so great these days that many employees might be willing to exchange some job security for the benefits of living elsewhere.If I had to guess, I\u2019d predict that unless Bay Area housing costs miraculously come down in the next year or two, Silicon Valley will undergo a big shake-up. Companies will feel increasingly compelled to move as many jobs as possible out of the Bay Area, and in time, the states between the coasts could effectively become Silicon Valley\u2019s back and middle office, in much the way that Wall Street banks now have thousands of employees in cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Salt Lake City.But don\u2019t expect the same to happen with venture capital \u2014 a highly face-to-face business in which proximity and start-up density still matter. As much as the venture capitalists on the bus may have loved the Midwest, they\u2019re probably going to remain tourists for the time being.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Exit Hints at Dissent on Handling of Russian Trolls", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.The impending exit of that executive \u2014 Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s chief information security officer \u2014 reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook\u2019s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company\u2019s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook\u2019s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, \u201cThese are really challenging issues, and I\u2019ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.\u201d On Twitter, he said he was \u201cstill fully engaged with my work at Facebook\u201d and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos\u2019s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was \u201cproductive.\u201dMr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a \u201cpretty crazy idea.\u201dIn the ensuing months, Facebook\u2019s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that \u201cwe decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.\u201dBy last September, after Mr. Stamos\u2019s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook\u2019s revelation was a good first step, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed it\u2019s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they\u2019ve become much more transparent.\u201dAnd the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook\u2019s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is \u201ccaught in a Catch-22.\u201d\u201cFacebook cares so much about its image that the executives don\u2019t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t, it damages their image.\u201dMr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company\u2019s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook\u2019s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos\u2019s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook\u2019s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook\u2019s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook\u2019s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos\u2019s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.\u201cI told them, \u2018Your business is based on trust, and you\u2019re losing trust,\u2019\u201d said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. \u201cThey were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it\u2019s a business problem. I couldn\u2019t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hand Grenades and Gang Violence Rattle Sweden\u2019s Middle Class", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 In the Stockholm suburb of Varby Gard, it was not unusual to see the figure of a 63-year-old man pedaling a bicycle home after the end of his shift as an aide for disabled adults, hunched against the icy wind of a Swedish winter.Daniel Cuevas Zuniga had just finished a night shift on a Sunday last month, and was cycling home with his wife, when he spotted a spherical object lying on the ground, stopped and reached down to take it in his hand.It was an M-75 hand grenade. Manufactured in great numbers for the Yugoslav national army, and then seized by paramilitaries during the civil war in the 1990s, the grenades are packed with plastic explosives and 3,000 steel balls, well suited for attacks on enemy trenches and bunkers. When Mr. Zuniga touched it, he set off the detonator.Part of the reason is that Sweden\u2019s gang violence, long contained within low-income suburbs, has begun to spill out. In large cities, hospitals report armed confrontations in emergency rooms, and school administrators say threats and weapons have become commonplace. Last week two men from Uppsala, both in their 20s, were arrested on charges of throwing grenades at the home of a bank employee who investigates fraud cases.An earlier jolt came with the death of Mr. Zuniga, who on Jan. 7 picked up the grenade, which the police believe had been thrown by members of a local gang targeting a rival gang or police officers.Paulus Borisho, 55, was in his kebab shop around 50 feet away, and the explosion made his windows shudder. He ran outside to see a thin column of black smoke rising. Mr. Zuniga lay on the bike path, curled on his side.Like many of his neighbors in Varby Gard, Mr. Borisho had sought asylum in Sweden to escape a war. He knew what a grenade sounded like. As a commando in a Lebanese militia, he had handled grenades, and remembered the strict protocols he complied with, locking up the weapons for safe keeping the minute he returned to camp.That a grenade should be found on the sidewalk outside a kebab shop, a few steps from an elementary school, was difficult for him to take in.\u201cNow, when I think of the future, I am afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cI am afraid for Europe.\u201dThe influx of heavy weapons has caught Sweden\u2019s criminal justice systems unprepared.The border with Denmark is open, with insufficient personnel to search every vehicle entering the country. Hand grenades were, until last year, classified as \u201cflammable products\u201d rather than weapons, so sentences for detonating them were mild. The police are struggling to gather information in immigrant neighborhoods, and clearance rates for gun homicide cases have fallen steadily since the 1990s.\u201cWe have lost the trust from the people who lived and worked in this area,\u201d said Gunnar Appelgren, a police superintendent and specialist in gang violence.Sweden\u2019s far right-wing party blames the government\u2019s liberal immigration policy for the rising crime, and will thrust the issue to the fore in the fall campaign.Even President Trump weighed in on the issue, saying that after taking in \u201clarge numbers\u201d of immigrants, Sweden was \u201chaving problems like they never thought possible.\u201dPolice officials are more likely to attribute gang violence to a failure of integration, citing a recent study of a Swedish street gang that found 24 percent of its members were ethnic Swedes, and 42 percent had been born in Sweden.But they, too, see an urgent problem.Affixed to the wall in Mr. Appelgren\u2019s office in Stockholm\u2019s Police Headquarters is a chart showing the increase in the use of hand grenades. Until 2014 there were about a handful every year. In 2015, that number leapt: 45 grenades were seized by the police, and 10 others were detonated. The next year, 55 were seized and 35 detonated. A modest decrease occurred in 2017, when 39 were seized and 21 were detonated.Mr. Appelgren has watched the trend apprehensively, calling it an arms race among gangs.\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see, if we don\u2019t stop it, more drive-by shootings with Kalashnikovs and hand grenades,\u201d he said. \u201cThey throw rocks and bottles at our cars, and they trick us in an ambush. When will it happen that they ambush us with Kalashnikovs? It\u2019s coming.\u201dMuch of the problem is the supply of surplus weapons. The Dayton peace agreement, which ended the Bosnian war, required paramilitaries to disarm and decommission their arsenals. Sellers in Bosnia and Serbia have networks in Sweden\u2019s diaspora and are so eager to unload excess grenades, often rusted from decades in storage, that they throw them in free with the purchase of AK-47s, Mr. Appelgren said. In Sweden the street price of a hand grenade is 100 kroner, or $12.50.\u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d said Manne Gerell, a lecturer in criminology at Malmo University. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any Western country with a similar use of hand grenades. Our hypothesis is that they are used to send a message. Not so much as a weapon, as a tool for intimidation. You don\u2019t need perfect aim. You are not trying to kill a particular person.\u201dAs for Mr. Zuniga, on the January morning when he spotted the object in his path, he had finally made a big decision.Sweden had been good to him. He had emigrated from Chile in 1985, as part of a wave of left-leaning Chileans allowed into Sweden by Olof Palme, a liberal prime minister and passionate opponent of Chile\u2019s authoritarian president at the time, Augusto Pinochet.Mr. Zuniga found work as a health aide, most recently caring for adults with severe disabilities and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He was a genial bear of a man who called everyone by a nickname \u2014 Bandito, Diablo, Loco, Feya \u2014 and no one, not even the stone-faced Swedish head nurses, could resist him.But lately, Mr. Zuniga had complained that he did not feel safe in his neighborhood.Varby Gard has produced a street gang, the Varby Gard Network, which the police have been monitoring for two years. It is led by a Tunisian man and populated by first- and second-generation immigrants from Finland, the Balkans and Africa, said Lars Broms, a detective who is investigating Mr. Zuniga\u2019s death. Intent on protecting its monopoly on the local drug trade, it is fluid and loosely organized, but like other suburban gangs in Sweden, it is developing quickly, he said.\u201cGive them 20 years, and we\u2019ll have the same as in L.A.,\u201d Mr. Broms said.On Tuesday, the police arrested two 18-year-old men on suspicion of throwing the grenade that killed Mr. Zuniga.Mr. Zuniga had complained about the changes in Varby Gard, frustrated that the police did not have better control, friends said. A music lover, he no longer went out to concerts at night, said Hugo Garrido, 60, a close friend.\u201cCrime is increasing and increasing, and they aren\u2019t doing anything about it,\u201d Mr. Garrido said. \u201cIt\u2019s denial. Swedes are very good people and they want to change the world. They want the rest of the world to be like Sweden. And the reality is that it\u2019s completely different.\u201dSo Mr. Zuniga, who was nearing retirement, had planned his exit, squirreling money away to build a house in Thailand, where his wife\u2019s family lived. He told friends he planned to go in April.Instead, on a recent Sunday his mourners streamed into an unadorned stone-colored chapel in a Stockholm cemetery, overflowing the pews and standing in the aisles. A light snow was falling outside. His son, Daniel, sent a note from Chile, calling him \u201cmy old sea wolf.\u201dHis daughter, Natalia, said she would give anything to drink one more cup of coffee with him. Wanna, a tiny woman with hair nearly down to her waist, stood at the foot of the coffin, her face stretched into a mask of grief. After that she collected herself.\u201cHe reiterated that if he died, I must return to Thailand,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want me to live here after he died. He told me to sell the house and just leave.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His new movie is playing in a theater near you.\u2019\u201dIn a statement, Amazon said the company took \u201cprivacy seriously\u201d and did \u201cnot use customers\u2019 voice recordings for targeted advertising.\u201d Amazon said that it filed \u201ca number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology,\u201d and that they \u201ctake multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services.\u201dGoogle said it did not \u201cuse raw audio to extrapolate moods, medical conditions or demographic information.\u201d The company added, \u201cAll devices that come with the Google Assistant, including Google Home, are designed with user privacy in mind.\u201dTech companies apply for a dizzying number of patents every year, many of which are never used and are years from even being possible.The companies, Mr. Court added, are \u201cbasically going to be finding out what our home life is like in qualitative ways.\u201dGoogle called Consumer Watchdog\u2019s claims \u201cunfounded,\u201d and said, \u201cProspective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications.\u201dAmazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses.But the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving.Kathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.\u201cIt was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,\u201d Ms. Zellner said.Sam Lester, the center\u2019s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.\u201cA lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it\u2019s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs. It\u2019s why we established a Food and Drug Administration years ago.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated Jeff Bezos\u2019s role in Amazon\u2019s Super Bowl ad. He was trying to figure out what to do when Alexa lost her voice; he did not fill in for her.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hooray for Harvey-less Hollywood!", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLLYWOOD \u2014 I ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Vanity Fair Oscar party last year. He should have been in his element, dominating and manipulating the Oscars, using the statuettes as a golden lure for young actresses, swanning around as a rare avatar of good taste and champion of roles for older women in an industry consumed with comic books and teenage boys.But he was acting disjointed, talking smack to people from The New York Times.Maybe with his sixth sense for great stories, he somehow knew he was about to become one of the most scorching stories in Hollywood history, with an ending echoing that all-time classic of female empowerment and great shoes, \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d As with the Wicked Witch of the West, all Weinstein\u2019s power and malevolence would go up in smoke when an ill-used woman (or in his case, 84) finally fought back.The melting of Harveywood, the fervid hunt for other predators and the pulling back of the curtain on Hollywood\u2019s big little lies about sexual assault, harassment and sexism are making for a fraught awards season.This is a town built on selling sex, beauty and youth. At the Oscars, actresses who have paid a fortune to dermatologists and surgeons will still vogue on the red carpet as they do the Roger Ailes twirl in gowns and jewels that they are paid handsomely to model.\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect confluence of two industries historically built on the objectification, fetishization and peddling of women \u2014 fashion and Hollywood \u2014 and both are fighting for their reputation and relevance right now while still hanging onto their codependence, hoping the moment we are in doesn\u2019t subsume a pretty damn good business relationship,\u201d said Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHow far can this moment really go without completely endangering and questioning everything Hollywood has held dear?\u201dTime\u2019s Up, after all, was born at C.A.A., the agency dominated by white men who, their despoiled clients charge, served as a conveyor belt to the Weinstein hotel suites.This moment, with women feeling triumphant about finally shaking up the network of old, white men who run Hollywood in a sexist way, is a bit of an illusion, since the entertainment industry has been taken over by an even more impenetrable group of younger, white men from the tech universe, which has an even more virulent bro culture. It\u2019s like gasping with relief as you climb up to the mountain peak, only to discover that it\u2019s actually a much bigger mountain.\u201cNetflix is No. 1, spending 8 billion on original scripted television content and Amazon is No. 2, with 5 billion,\u201d said Scott Galloway, the author of \u201cThe Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\u201d \u201cHastings and Bezos are the new studio chiefs, the new kings. Amazon could create the next \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and monetize it by selling paper towels.\u201dOn the surface, there are a lot of promising signs for women. There\u2019s the new Anita Hill-led Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equity in the Workplace, which is looking into a technology system that would allow women to share information on predators. The guilds have written new sexual harassment guidelines. Some companies are making employees sit through seminars where, as one top entertainment boss told me, they learn that \u201cyou can tell a woman her dress is beautiful as long as you do not comment on what\u2019s inside the dress.\u201dThis is a noted improvement in an industry where, for decades, men felt no qualms undressing in front of female executives, asking job applicants to take off their tops and bringing in pea shooters to aim at the cleavage of female producers.Yet many women here fear that the reckoning is merely a therapy session, or that \u201cit\u2019s just Kabuki,\u201d as Min said. \u201cWhen people talk about who will take over for Bob Iger when he eventually retires, no woman is ever in the mix. And so shouldn\u2019t we be questioning why that is and how do you start grooming women for those jobs?\u201d Even when a woman gets to be a studio chief, there\u2019s a man above her helping make the final decisions for the biggest budgets.The Oscar telecast is trying to keep out most of the politics \u2014 viewers don\u2019t like it \u2014 but they tried to have a symbolic moment by asking Ashley Judd, one of Weinstein\u2019s first accusers, to be a presenter. That, however, got overshadowed by news of publicists plotting how to steer their clients around Ryan Seacrest, a host of the E! red carpet show, who has been accused of sexual misbehavior.Men are quaking. Business here has been on pause for months. As one male executive at the heart of the hive complained: \u201cMen\u2019s heads are on sticks with blood pouring down their faces. Whatever happened to the fun boy-girl game?\u201d A game, after all, that Hollywood made famous with dazzling directors like Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder.Physically abusive behavior will be curtailed, for sure. Men will think twice before coming out of showers exposing themselves. \u201cSo much of Hollywood is about what\u2019s perceived to be cool,\u201d said a top male producer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no longer perceived as cool to be a pig. Everyone here wants to win, but the way of winning will no longer include being a bully.\u201dBut an instant fix for sexism is wishful thinking. \u201cAll the stuff that allowed these guys to be protected is so subtle and baked into the cake, it\u2019s really hard to unravel it,\u201d one top woman at a major studio told me. \u201cMen are doing a head fake, saying, \u2018Yeah, yeah, of course we want to fix it,\u2019 while what they\u2019re really thinking is, \u2018How do we get out of this looking like we do something without doing anything?\u2019 Men like to say, \u2018We choose the best people,\u2019 but the best people are always white men. The only place they think that they need women is as babes in films. As long as men have power over women, they\u2019re going to try to have sex with them.\u201dBut I\u2019m sanguine for this reason: Men only give up their grip on power when an institution is no longer as relevant, like when they finally let women anchor the network evening news. And Hollywood, as we knew it, is over.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At the Crossroads of Church and Race, a Reporter Glimpses His Childhood", "Date": "2018-03-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI grew up in a little Baptist church in small-town Alabama. The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.But I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.Then the Trump election came, with its troubling racial overtones. For many, it wasn\u2019t even complicated at that point. They just stopped going.Among dozens of interviews, several were with people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the national hatchery of the megachurch. I went to a few different services there but kept hearing about Gateway, one of the largest churches in the country. I heard of a dozen people who had left or were planning to leave, including Ms. Pruitt, the woman who became the center of the story. Those I was able to reach knew of others. Most attributed their break to the senior pastor\u2019s decision to align himself with President Trump (he did not explicitly endorse from the pulpit, but his preference was clear).At the same time, I saw black families who continued to attend services at Gateway when I went. I knew that there were black pastors on staff and I learned that the senior pastor, who has an African-American son-in-law, had preached a widely shared sermon on the sin of racism in the fall of 2017. This was an interesting case study.Back to the little church I grew up in. It was founded in 1971, before I was born, by exiles from the main Baptist church in town. They were the smaller faction in a dispute over whether the church, all white at the time, would invite the nearby black churches to a community Thanksgiving service. The pastor was for it, a narrow majority of the congregation was opposed, and so the pastor was forced to leave.He and some of the others from the church began meeting around town, in a hardware store, a bank, a movie theater, in a series of gatherings that would go on to become a new church in town \u2014 the one I still go to when I visit home.I had been thinking of that church when I set out to report this story, but had little idea how relevant it would be.Advertisement"}

Chief Michael Olivieri of the Pomona Police Department said that Officer Casillas joined the department in September and was about to complete field training.The shooting occurred shortly after 9 p.m. local time, the authorities said. The episode began after officers from Pomona, a city of about 150,000 people 30 miles outside Los Angeles, responded to a call of a person driving recklessly.They tried to stop the driver, who led them on a pursuit before crashing into a parked vehicle.They were taken to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, where Officer Casillas died. The other officer, who was in serious condition, was undergoing surgery and expected to survive.Officer Casillas grew up in Los Angeles County and attended local colleges and universities before joining the Pomona Police Department as a record specialist in December 2014.

{"Headline": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Zuckerberg\u2019s Answers to Privacy Scandal Raise More Questions", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsYou know those weeks when crazy things happen at work, your entire schedule goes haywire and the concept of a good night\u2019s sleep starts to resemble a hazy and futile dream, like full employment or healthy pizza?We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but we managed to get him to address several important topics: the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook\u2019s lax data policies, its plans to clamp down on third-party developer access and notify users whose data was misused, election interference (including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year\u2019s Alabama special election) and Facebook\u2019s broader responsibility as a global power.But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s responses also raised more questions.Here, for example, is how he answered a question about Facebook\u2019s business model, which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data.Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.Narrowly, it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services. Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access \u2014 including, in some countries, effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program, which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans.Switching to a subscription model wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight. There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections, false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion, and innumerable other issues. But moving away from an ad-supported model would make the network harder to exploit. (Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms, for example.) And it would lessen the company\u2019s incentive to sell out its users\u2019 privacy to advertisers.What if all of Facebook cost $5 per month to use, and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely? Would users revolt en masse, and decide to colonize some other free social media app? Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars?Maybe. But being smaller might not be a bad thing. If we\u2019ve learned anything from this year\u2019s troubles, it\u2019s this: Facebook\u2019s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex, but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant. Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook\u2019s problems, but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all \u2014 its enormous scale, paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users\u2019 private data to the greatest extent possible \u2014 there\u2019s only so much he can do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Parwana Afghan Kitchen in Adelaide, South Australia", "Date": "2018-03-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare9 PhotosMy erroneous assumption was based on my experience of neighborhood family restaurants, and on my understanding of Adelaide as a dining city. There aren\u2019t many high-demand reservations in the South Australian capital. But Parwana excels at many things, and defying expectations is one of them.Zelmai and Farida Ayubi, the owners, fled the war in Afghanistan in 1987 with their five children. Parwana is a multigenerational affair, and dining there (which I eventually managed to do, by calling well in advance) mimics the boisterous energy of visiting a large family\u2019s home. The restaurant opened in 2009 as a collaboration between parents who still treasured the food and traditions of their homeland, and children who had grown up almost entirely in Australia. Farida Ayubi is the chef, while her children and husband manage the front of house.The small storefront space has a striking aesthetic, one that is worthy of a design magazine but stays true to the history and culture of the family. The floors are tiled in bright geometric patterns; the walls are covered in old family photos and various vintage flotsam, backed by colorful paint in primary colors.There are two seatings each night, one at 6 p.m. and another at 8 p.m. This style of service adds to the homey feel of the place, with all the food coming out in one great flurry. Alcohol is strictly bring-your-own, and customers can sometimes be seen sharing bottles with nearby tables. The menu is quite short \u2014 rather than offer lots of dishes on any given evening, the menu changes throughout the week. There are always dumplings, rice, stews and grilled meats, but they vary.Rice is central \u2014 practically everything else at the restaurant is meant to be built around it, and it may be Farida Ayubi\u2019s greatest gift to the universe. It is not often that a dish as common as rice will knock me off my dinner chair, but the aged, long-grain narej palaw at Parwana left me agog. Shot through with slivered almonds, pistachios and a restrained amount of candied orange zest, its main attribute was the toasty fragrance of the rice itself \u2014 the other ingredients acted only as brilliant supporting characters.I couldn\u2019t keep myself from repeatedly bending over to inhale the steam rising from the platter, so much so that I started to make my tablemates anxious. To hell with decorum: If someone made a perfume that accurately evoked the rice at Parwana, I would bathe in the stuff.It is best to come with a group, as the servings are large and can easily overwhelm. You will want to try the banjaan borani, a great puddinglike slump of eggplant cooked in fresh tomatoes and topped with garlic yogurt and mint. Depending on the day of the week, there will be chicken or lamb slow cooked in yogurt and spices, served with a deep-green herb chutney that tastes like photosynthesis splashed with lemon. (You can buy this as an extra to go with your meal, and I wish it also came in jars to take home.)On Friday and Saturday nights there is ashak, half-moon-shaped fried dumplings stuffed with chives and topped with minced lamb and a drizzle of yogurt. Lamb meatballs cooked in a rich tomato sauce show up on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Thankfully, you can get the outrageously creamy saffron and ginger ice cream any night.The language on Parwana\u2019s website (which shares the beautiful design aesthetic of the dining room) is direct in its acknowledgment of the circumstances that created the restaurant: \u201cAt Parwana we believe that even loss and suffering can forge beauty and generosity.\u201dIn crisp and colorful photos surrounding these words, Farida Ayubi, the chef and matriarch of the Ayubi family, stares stony-faced at the camera. Her stark expression is perhaps a reminder of the loss she has suffered, but it is also subversive, a reversal of the norms of restaurant marketing in which white male chefs are presented as formidable knife-wielding badasses, while women and immigrants embody smiling hospitality.Parwana challenges the tidy and boring categories into which immigrant-run restaurants are so often shunted. Its most lovable attribute is its embodiment of the taste and style and multigenerational, multicontinental complexity of the Ayubi family. That Adelaide has made it one of the hardest reservations in town is a testament to the astute appetites of this city.Advertisement"}

Julie Turkewitz, a correspondent who is based in Denver, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.How often are you on the road on assignment?I\u2019m on the road about a third of the year. I cover a section of the West, which means I spend a lot of time in small towns and on winding mountain roads. I also work breaking news stories all over the country.So that must mean you live out of a suitcase. What are your most essential tech tools for doing your work?My travel bag is a constant work in progress. I try to be prepared for anything, because I never know when a trip is going to involve a surprise sit-down with a governor or an unexpected flight to cover a hurricane.For all the talk about the changing media landscape, the most important tools of my job are a pen, a notebook and a way to file the story to my editors. There are still many places in America without cellphone or internet service, so simply communicating with my editors can be a challenge. I\u2019m often filing on a laptop from the back seat of a car on the side of a road over a weak signal through my phone or a mobile hot spot.I carry two phones (in case one falls in the mud), a power strip that allows me to charge my computer from the car, and a Canon 5D camera that I bought off a White House photographer years ago. I use my iPhone\u2019s recording app, or a downloadable app called TapeACall, and I will occasionally pay for a transcription service for lengthy interviews. I\u2019ve used both Trint.com and Rev.com.When I\u2019m working on breaking news stories, Twitter is crucial. Law enforcement agencies send out updates through social media, and the first thing I do when I head into a big story is make sure that I'm receiving their new tweets as immediate text messages. Then I use social media to report the texture of the story as it unfolds.Lastly, roving reporters have to take care of themselves. I travel with an extra thin yoga mat from Manduka that packs down to the size of a book.What could be better?We need longer-lasting batteries. Battery life is a constant source of stress for reporters in the field.You\u2019ve reported extensively on the Parkland, Fla., school shooting and many other such shootings. After Parkland, the survivors used Twitter and other outlets to speak out about gun control. Do you foresee this use of social media having any effect on gun control regulations?I\u2019m curious to see what\u2019s next. Will social media messaging continue to be as powerful as the weeks go on? And how will students deal with their new roles as survivors, advocates and public figures?Has tech affected how you research and investigate the people you write about?Social media has expanded the reporter-subject relationship, making it more personal, and allowing for interaction beyond the life of a particular story.This means that I sometimes contact people on Facebook to ask for an interview, and stay connected to them for weeks or months. As a reporter covering a vast region \u2014 and as someone who focuses on capturing national narratives and sentiments \u2014 I find social media to be a helpful way to avoid a news bubble. It keeps me connected to Montana and Utah and Wyoming even when I can\u2019t be there.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?Audible audiobooks and Spotify playlists have gotten me through many a road trip.And I try to spend as much non-travel time in face-to-face conversations with friends and family.Advertisement"}

We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201dThe answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.Here\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201dThe stock options won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. \u201cMr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges.

Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!President Trump assailed Amazon on Thursday, accusing the online retail giant of paying \u201clittle or no taxes to state & local governments,\u201d while taking advantage of the United States Postal Service and \u201ccausing tremendous loss to the U.S.\u201dAmazon\u2019s stock price dropped in early trading Thursday after the president\u2019s comments. But his Twitter post lacked important context about the Postal Service and relied on outdated and incorrect facts regarding Amazon\u2019s taxes. Here is an assessment of the president\u2019s claims.\u201cIf this was five years ago, the tweet would be making a very compelling point,\u201d said Carl Davis, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Historically, \u201cthere is no doubt that Amazon used its ability to not collect sales tax to gain a competitive advantage.\u201dBut that criticism is outdated.Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.Jim Tankersley, Alan Rappeport and Linda Qiu contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The immense buildings will join the four existing data centers, totaling 1.27 million square feet, that Facebook has built here since 2010 at a cost of $1.1 billion. They are among 11 centers the company has built in the United States and overseas.Nearby, Apple built its own $988 million, 660,000-square-foot data center, which the company will soon expand to one million square feet. It is one of seven built by Apple in the United States. One more is under construction in Iowa, and three others are planned in China, Denmark and Ireland, according to an Apple spokeswoman.The Facebook and Apple projects here are part of a wave of global data center construction and development, a market valued at $88 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group, a market research firm in Reno, Nev.There\u2019s not much architectural excitement about a data center. But the windowless, big-box buildings form the climate-controlled central nervous system of online commerce and communications. They are as essential to the basic economic infrastructure of the 21st century as iron ore mines and auto assembly plants were to the 20th.Like the big industrial projects of the previous century, the investments that Facebook, Apple and their competitors have made in land, buildings and equipment are considerable, typically more than $1 billion each. The centers consume prodigious amounts of electricity and water, just like factories. Property tax breaks that Oregon and other states use to lure data centers also are comparable. What is different is slim staffing.Facebook employs around 200 people here to manage buildings 1,000 feet long. Inside are aisle after aisle of computer servers networked to receive, store, stream and transmit the flood of digital bytes that steer daily life for more than two billion people.\u201cThe market is very big because the demand is huge,\u201d said Rob Johnson, chief executive of Vertiv, a $4 billion global technology company in Columbus, Ohio, that designs, builds and supplies equipment to data centers. \u201cData centers serve the requirements for all the smartphones, streaming, high-definition video and all the new applications like autonomous vehicles. The technology is driving immense amounts of data and traffic.\u201dOregon\u2019s incentive package allows both companies to avoid property taxes for 15 years, saving Facebook and Apple roughly $45 million each over that period. State law also has a sweetener for cities. Companies receiving the tax break are required to pay employees 150 percent of the median regional wage. Prineville data center workers earn at least $60,000 a year.Prineville counts 400 permanent jobs in the data centers, influencing its small-town culture, filling the municipal treasury and transforming its sagebrush and juniper landscape.Mayor Betty Roppe noted that Facebook and Apple provided Prineville with income from other municipal accounts. For instance, the city receives a 5 percent \u201cfranchise\u201d fee on all electricity sales in its jurisdiction. Because Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s centers consume nearly $40 million in electricity annually, total franchise fees last year reached $2.2 million, up from $340,000 in 2010.When the abatements expire midway through the 2020s, the value of Prineville\u2019s taxable property will increase by roughly $2 billion, more than doubling the total from the $1.5 billion in property currently assessed by the city. Revenue is projected to reach $9 million annually, up from $4 million currently.\u201cWe were a cowboy and timber town,\u201d said Steve Forrester, Prineville\u2019s city manager and a former sawmill executive. \u201cWe went from \u2018I got to go feed my cows\u2019 to the most technically advanced companies in the world siting data centers in our little town. It freaked some people out.\u201dOnce-struggling Prineville has become a factor in turning central Oregon into a dynamic region of demographic and economic transition. It is becoming a bedroom community for Bend, 36 miles away, where the population has nearly doubled since 2000, making it the sixth-fastest-growing city in the country.The data centers also are changing the region\u2019s electrical market. Avangrid Renewables just opened one of Oregon\u2019s largest solar-generating stations outside Prineville, a $120 million, 56-megawatt plant to supply clean energy to Apple. Crook County authorities say they have entertained inquiries for building four more solar stations of similar size to supply data center needs.In 2009, when Ms. Roppe was a member of the City Council, she convened planning meetings with city executives to save Prineville from sawmill shutdowns and a deep recession. Her economic goals were straightforward: diversifying the economy and seeking companies willing to pay living wages.\u201cOur unadjusted employment was 24 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we did whatever we had to do to change that.\u201dWhen seven lawyers arrived in town to scout land for a company called Vitesse, she learned how competitive Prineville was to data center developers. The city and region fill all basic requirements \u2014 available land, ample electricity, access to fresh water, proximity to markets and generous tax breaks. Another advantage was cool summers \u2014 Facebook cools its data centers with fresh air.Ms. Roppe and her aides soon were made aware that Vitesse was a disguise for Facebook. The company bought 127 acres near the airport for $2.7 million and publicly revealed itself at a groundbreaking ceremony in January 2010.A year later, Apple\u2019s scouts arrived as agents of a front company called Pillar. \u201cWe always were left guessing as to who we were dealing with,\u201d Ms. Roppe said. In 2012, after buying 160 acres for $3.6 million, Apple started construction of its big data center.The presence of two big Silicon Valley companies once unnerved Prineville. Though most data center employees are from Crook County, young people wearing hoodies and driving late-model electric hybrid cars were a new presence in bars and on streets where cowboy hats and pickups once dominated.\u201cThere was anxiousness,\u201d Mr. Forrester said. \u201cThe mill types were going around saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want the Mark Zuckerberg types. They\u2019re going to ruin our town.\u2019\u201dAnxiety about newcomers has been replaced by relief over local business generated by the data centers, and new stress over rising housing costs. Residential and office vacancy rates are under 5 percent.\u201cFacebook and Apple brought a lot to this community,\u201d said Erika Vaughan, the owner of Cougar Cuts barbershop. \u201cThey are big, but they support small business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in March, as tens of thousands of children across the country flooded out of their classrooms to protest gun violence in schools, the moment was hailed by some as a tremendous display of power \u2014 perhaps especially in those places where school administrators flexed their own authority and tried to prohibit students from participating. \u201cSupporters say the walkouts and demonstrations represent a realization of power and influence by young people,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201cSo amazing to see young people take back their power and USE it!\u201d Miley Cyrus tweeted. \u201cBy myself, I don\u2019t think I have the power,\u201d one student told MSNBC. \u201cBut together with all these people here, I think we can make a change.\u201dThe very reason for the demonstrations, of course, was that the students did not possess one very specific kind of power \u2014 the ability to make rules or laws that might somehow curtail the number of guns and shootings in their schools. This lack of control over their own safety has been a key aspect of their rhetoric ever since survivors of the February shooting in Parkland, Fla., captured the nation\u2019s attention via Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re children,\u201d David Hogg said in an appearance on CNN. \u201cYou guys are the adults.\u201dAt least one senator seemed to agree, locating the real power not with the students but with the audience they addressed: \u201cKeep speaking truth to power and demanding change,\u201d Kirsten Gillibrand urged. In theory, that power resides with the nation\u2019s voters, but even this is too indirect; we already know that Americans overwhelmingly favor more stringent gun regulation than their elected officials are inclined to enact. It is a much smaller segment of people who hold the clearest authority to change things: the professional political class. And even as those children demonstrated, a healthy portion of that class was studiously ignoring them and earnestly debating the merits of arming teachers instead. If they were in any real way affected by the power of a student walkout, they certainly weren\u2019t admitting it. The students\u2019 power to captivate a share of the public sat in one corner; elected officials\u2019 power to actually rule over that public sat quietly in another. No matter how thundering the children\u2019s dissent might have been, there was no meaningful intersection between those two kinds of power.Nye\u2019s terms are now used by political scientists and business-school professors alike. They are a product of the same line of thinking that appears in a common expression: \u201cPower comes in many forms.\u201d This is the same line of thinking too that so often has undergraduate students intoxicated by the ideas of the French theorist Michel Foucault, who saw power as ephemeral, taking countless shapes, everywhere and nowhere: It was \u201cat once visible and invisible, present and hidden, ubiquitous,\u201d like a light emanating from a thousand pinprick sources. Foucault\u2019s idea of resistance was to spend your time mapping out all those pinprick sources of power, like the stars: If you wanted to speak truth to power, he suggested, you first had to divine your position inside a whole constellation of influence. This sort of thinking can make our view of power far more nuanced and complex, but it can also make it quite confusing. The dispiriting message some took away from Foucault was that things were, ultimately, a bit hopeless: Power was far too chaotic to help anyone figure out the right thing to do.This dizzying and disordered vision of power isn\u2019t reserved for high-stakes international affairs or abstract philosophical contexts. It is a feature of almost every social or cultural battle we have. The question of power has buzzed its way, for instance, through a huge share of recent conversations about sexual harassment. In many #MeToo stories, the power a harasser has over his target is clear and hard as a diamond: He is the boss; he can hire or fire, promote or demote. But in so many others, a softer pull is involved \u2014 a matter of age, or ambient status, or standing within an industry. Last month, when several women told NPR about what they saw as exploitative relationships with the writer Sherman Alexie, one described her account as one \u201cabout power, and abuse of power.\u201d This wasn\u2019t because Alexie necessarily held any formal or official power over the other writers he encountered; the power his accuser was referring to derived from his literary success, influence and social standing.It was this point, Chotiner said, that was \u201cthe crux of our disagreement.\u201d Which is in its own way a summation of where we all are: Everyone, from the online critic to the president, seems always to believe that power lies elsewhere, in some branch of the constellation beyond their reach. Try to map out almost any part of this cultural moment, and you will find something similarly chaotic \u2014 all the players passing by one another, each convinced they are doing the right thing, and very few convinced that they, in the face of powerful opposition, have enough influence to affect much at all.The chaos and multiplicity of power, then, can be something of a magic trick, keeping us arguing forever about who has it. Which isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t room for clarity about certain definite, reliable sources of power. The science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, for instance, found it difficult to believe in any single, stable reality \u2014 but in a 1978 essay, he explained how even an anarchic world could have its masters. He believed in creating new realities, he said; he\u2019d dedicated his life to it. But he didn\u2019t think all realities were created equal. \u201cUnceasingly we are bombarded with pseudorealities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it.\u201dHe was talking, back then, about television and the Disney corporation. Today, though, it\u2019s easy to hear those words and think of Facebook, or Twitter, or any of the \u201celectronic mechanisms\u201d on which our broad movements of anger or disinformation emerge. Right now the owners of these platforms seem to believe they are merely facilitating maps of every point of power in the universe. They thrive on all our little contests and arguments about who has power over whom and eschew responsibility for any of the chaos created by them. But as we\u2019ve learned in recent weeks, there is actual power accruing to the hosts of all our debates, and to the maps they make of us \u2014 maps others may use in trying to manipulate, say, the outcome of an election. This power is concrete, and its source obvious. It is worth, as Dick says, our distrust.Advertisement"}

They were in command of their own story once again.It has become obvious that many of the most well-known students at Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, Fla., are adept at using social media, and Twitter in particular, where many journalists spend much of their time talking to one another.Many observers have simply assumed that, like fish in water, the students are skilled simply because they have been using the platforms for most of their lives. That is not entirely true.\u201cFacebook is not really used by the people in my community.\u201dMs. Gonz\u00e1lez was surrounded by classmates who were familiar with Twitter\u2019s ever-evolving dialect of memes, wisecracks and news stories. Within a week, she said, they had taught her the basics. How to make a thread. How to follow a thread. And, perhaps most importantly, the difference between a retweet, which reposts someone else\u2019s tweet, and a quote tweet, which allows a user to retweet with a comment above the original.The Parkland students\u2019 use of quote tweets is one of their most effective tools. Ms. Chadwick, in particular, has used the technique, as well as other memes to mock the students\u2019 ideological opponents.In one memorable exchange, Ms. Chadwick was scrolling through her Twitter feed last month when she saw someone remark that politicians were \u201ceasy to buy.\u201d She and her classmates had spent the last week educating themselves on how easy the AR-15 was to purchase. She made the obvious connection, and tweeted:The Fox News host Laura Ingraham chided Ms. Chadwick, 16, for her tone, and attributed the quote to \u201cStoneman Douglas sophomore Sarah Chadwick.\u201dMs. Chadwick\u2019s response?Given their single-minded focus on preventing school shootings, the more prominent Parkland students most often find themselves tangling with conservative politicians and commentators who support broad gun ownership rights, including Senator Marco Rubio, Ms. Ingraham, the N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch and the Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren.In response to a call and texts, Ms. Loesch, who is usually not shy about responding online or elsewhere to critics, directed an interview request to an N.R.A. official, who declined to comment.And as for Ms. DeVos? Students said that she spoke to few of them on her visit Wednesday, and left in a hurry.In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Lahren applauded the students\u2019 use of social media to fight for their views. She said she was not bothered by quote tweets, which she saw as simply \u201ca way to continue a conversation,\u201d a tool that she said that she also used frequently.\u201cEven if people maybe side with the other people a little bit more, they understand both sides,\u201d she said, of the benefits of quote tweeting. \u201cWe want people to be educated.\u201dThe social media activism has come with a cost for the high schoolers, who before the shooting just used these platforms to keep up with friends, make jokes and pass the time. Ms. Tarr was one of several students interviewed who said that she no longer felt comfortable using her Twitter account to express her opinions on pop culture, or the other lighter subjects she used to tweet about.\u201cThe fact is that I have to represent our movement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me tweeting whatever I want to tweet about. It has to be drawn back to who I am to the media, to who I am to the country.\u201dIt is another way in which the students at Parkland have lost the normalcy of their teenage years. Ryan Deitsch said that he did not feel comfortable even tweeting his opinion of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d (he thought it was great and that comparisons to \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were beside the point). Many other parts of his life have been put on hold. He has yet to respond to the colleges that have accepted him.But while Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez and Ms. Chadwick said they usually composed their tweets on the fly, Ms. Tarr said she often took more time, mindful of her new audience and of the gravity of what she says online now.\u201cI\u2019ll start typing a tweet, then I\u2019ll delete it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll think \u2018what else can I say\u2019 then type and delete again. I do miss having that teenage Twitter account. But we don\u2019t get that regular teenage life anymore. It just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dFollow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman.Advertisement"}

African Diaspora", "Date": "2018-03-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylens\u201cThat was the first time I had ever seen an image of another queer African person,\u201d Mr. Owunna recalled. He was so moved by the experience, he began a project exploring the queer African diaspora. There was only one problem \u2014 he didn\u2019t know any queer Africans. \u201cThat was part of the reason that I felt so isolated for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S., I only had ever met two other queer African people in my entire life, and I was 23. And so that was part of what really was the motivation for me \u2014 was actually just to build community and to connect with people.\u201dUntil that moment, his experience of being part of the queer African diaspora had been shaped by his experiences with his family. Though they are accepting now, the journey to that point has been long and uncertain \u2014 he was outed when he was 15, and at 18, he was brought by his family back to Nigeria to exorcise the gay away. \u201cI grew up feeling invalidated from every single corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI never felt there was a space that existed for me. And so it was really important for me to tell my story and to tell the story of my community.\u201dBut for Mr. Owunna, a project that began as filling a void and reclaiming space for a group left out of our narratives of both queerness and African-ness, quickly became an act of radical self-love and community building, too.\u201cI definitely thought I was just going to do something around people\u2019s relationships with their parents, and all this pain,\u201d he said. But one of the first people he photographed urged him to use his project to showcase love and empowerment instead, and so Limit(less) took on a new direction. \u201cLook at all these people!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, the person who created it? There\u2019s something special there, there\u2019s definitely something special there that is incredibly touching.\u201dThe pictures are defiant and arresting, challenging notions of what queer people look like, what African people look like and the grace that comes from loving oneself. Bearing witness to that power had a profound impact on Mr. Owunna. Meeting so many proud L.G.B.T.Q. people of African descent taught him how to love himself. Those who had the biggest impact on him exemplified love and acceptance that he would never have thought possible. This past fall, on a whirlwind trip to Europe, where he made his final images for the project, he met a queer Nigerian mother and their daughter, as well as a pair of gay identical twins from Kenya. \u201cJust seeing the idea of a queer African family and seeing it realized and seeing just so much love there, that really touched me,\u201d Mr. Owunna said.Mr. Owunna hopes his project is a small step toward reclaiming space for L.G.B.T.Q. African people and showing the power that comes from that identity.\u201cWhen I was growing up, these images would have meant so much to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been incomparable from what I was going through at the time, to have that, to have a perspective that matched my own. This project is important for a lot of queer and trans Africans to know that we exist, we can exist and we can love ourselves. And I think from that space, that\u2019s really radical.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Like most editors, he works an additional job \u2014 in his case, as a writer and production assistant to a sculptor and set designer \u2014 to finance Mouthfeel and support himself.Most of these magazines come together as a labor of love, in chunks of spare time carved out on nights and weekends.After crowdfunding an initial investment, or putting in personal savings, small teams with low overheads may be able to pay for the costs of printing and freelance contributors, usually with a mix of sales, brand partnerships and events.This can generate enough to fund the next issue, but many editors say it\u2019s not enough to pay themselves a full salary, let alone hire a full-time staff. Some do hire professionals, on a freelance basis, while others rely on the help of friends and family to share design tips or proofread pages.Claudia Wu, who has worked in independent publishing for years in New York and loves making magazines, said she still finds the business side challenging. \u201cThings look much rosier from the outside than the inside,\u201d she said.\u201cIf you just love the process of putting a magazine together, it can be the greatest creative outlet that you can have,\u201d Ms. Wu, 41, said. \u201cBut in terms of longevity, it\u2019s about how much pain you can endure.\u201dAs Mr. Muncy of Toothache put it: \u201cDistribution sucks, printing\u2019s expensive and no one wants to advertise.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to be aspirational, or pretty, or something you\u2019re striving for,\u201d Ms. Keough said. \u201cWe wanted to tell stories as they were.\u201dFor some editors and designers, the magazine is part of a larger brand strategy, or what Ms. Chou called \u201ca very expensive calling card.\u201dLinYee Yuan\u2019s new twice-yearly print publication, Mold, came about as an expansion of her website, and a way to explore its story ideas more deeply, around themes such as the microbiome or food waste.\u201cBy 2050, we won\u2019t be able to feed nine billion people on the planet, if we continue to eat and drink the way we do now,\u201d Ms. Yuan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a downer. I understand that it\u2019s not something everybody wants to be confronted with in their daily lives, but I think it\u2019s so urgent.\u201dMold is driven by this sense of urgency \u2014 telling stories at the intersection of food and design that look to the future. Though Ms. Yuan, 37, was quick to note that she was the magazine\u2019s only employee, she didn\u2019t see this as an obstacle.Ms. Yuan raised more than $35,000 on Kickstarter last year and pulled together the first two issues of Mold in her apartment in New York City; she now prints about 5,000 copies of each issue and sells them locally, as well as in Britain, France, Germany, Singapore and Taiwan.\u201cA magazine that has a full-time staff of one can still find a global audience,\u201d Ms. Yuan said, \u201cIt can make some sort of impact in the world.\u201dSince his first issue last year, collaborating with freelancers all over the world, Mr. Satterfield has covered the origins of corn, coffee and winemaking in depth, with reporting from the Republic of Georgia, Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia.\u201cThe new democracy in media is that if you have a flagship product and grow a following around that, you\u2019re able to leverage it into more ambitious, larger projects,\u201d said Mr. Satterfield, who aims to expand Whetstone into video production.His own readership is steadily growing, and he will print about 2,000 copies of his summer issue.

The false report was spread by well-known conservatives, including Erick Erickson, who has contributed to The New York Times opinion section. Mr. Erickson later deleted his original tweet.Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa, posted on Facebook about the Cuban flag sewn to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s jacket.\u201cThis is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d the post said, \u201cand ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self-defense.\u201d It showed an image of her with the flag patch visible on her jacket.She also retweeted another of Mr. Hogg\u2019s tweets, which called on Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida of Cuban descent, to respond to Mr. King.Many attacks on the Parkland students do not even pretend to focus on issues or substance.

{"Headline": "Anti-Semitism Accusations Taint Labour Party, Once Home to U.K.\u2019s Jews", "Date": "2018-03-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo when it appeared in the Twitter feed of a British lawmaker \u2014 along with a question about why the leader of her opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, once opposed its removal \u2014 Luciana Berger wanted answers.Ms. Berger was not impressed.Other Labour lawmakers seemed worried, too.The crisis deepened with news on Thursday of the resignation of Christine Shawcroft, the chair of Labour\u2019s internal disputes panel, after the leak of an email suggesting that she had lent support to a council candidate suspended after accusations of anti-Semitism.But there is little doubt that the atmosphere in the Labour Party has changed. A veteran of left-wing struggles, Mr. Corbyn learned his politics fighting apartheid in South Africa and campaigning against what he saw as Western militarism and neo-imperialism. While many of those battles have been won, the plight of the Palestinians remains a sore point on the left, one deepened by the hard-line policies of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.At the same time, the Labour Party\u2019s membership has grown bigger and more diverse, while Momentum, a campaign that promotes Mr. Corbyn\u2019s radical brand of politics, has emerged as a powerful force, tilting the political balance further to the left.The mere fact that the party was having such a discussion would have been all but unthinkable in days past.\u201cLabour has a very strong tradition of support for Zionism and Israel,\u201d said June Edmunds, a lecturer in sociology at the University of Sussex. That, she added, was \u201cbased on the formative impact of the genocide of the Jews on the postwar generation as well as the view that Jewish nationalism represented a form of anti-colonialism.\u201dOpinion began shifting after the Arab-Israeli War in 1967, though it was the Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 that generated sharper criticism of Israel alongside growing sympathy for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Ms. Edmunds said. Events in Gaza and Israeli settlement policy have only added to those feelings.Criticism of Israeli policy is, of course, not the same thing as anti-Semitism, though, as Ms. Edmunds put it, \u201cthere can be overlaps \u2014 within Labour and other parties \u2014 between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.\u201d\u201cWe had a shameful record until very recently, in historical terms,\u201d he said, \u201cEngland was the first European country to expel Jewish people, in 1290, with their exile lasting for 350 years.\u201dNowadays, the insidious anti-Semitism of the British establishment has given way to something more overt. Reported anti-Semitic incidents in Britain have increased, the select committee report noted, accelerated by social media. Ms. Berger has released a snapshot of some of the abuse she has received, including Twitter posts likening her to a pig and calling for her head to be put on a spike. One read, \u201cwaking up and remembering you\u2019re a Jew must be a horrid start to one\u2019s day.\u201dNevertheless, the majority of anti-Semitic abuse and crime \u201chas historically been, and continues to be, committed by individuals associated with (or motivated by) far right-wing parties and political activity,\u201d the report said.The Labour Party\u2019s problems with anti-Semitism have become intertwined with the personality and leadership of Mr. Corbyn, who spent three decades on the fringes of politics, opposing NATO and Western foreign policy, while championing anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist causes.In 2015, when he was elected leader, concerns were raised about Mr. Corbyn\u2019s earlier reference to Hamas and Hezbollah as his \u201cfriends.\u201d\u201cAs a maverick backbencher, it wasn\u2019t a problem to welcome Hamas or Hezbollah,\u201d said Mark Wickham-Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Bristol. \u201cBut as leader, he\u2019s supposed to have a more multilayered series of relationships, and the past comes back to haunt him.\u201dDonald Macintyre, a political commentator and author of \u201cGaza, Preparing for Dawn,\u201d said that, by failing to deal with the anti-Semitism issue, Mr. Corbyn \u201cweakens the credibility of wholly legitimate criticisms of Israeli occupation and settlements.\u201dSocial media posts from the days when fewer people took notice of what Mr. Corbyn thought have resurfaced showing him to have been a member of several Facebook groups in which members had shared anti-Semitic comments and images.Other Corbyn controversies have often involved Israeli policy, on which there are different opinions in the Jewish community. But, Mr. Pollard said, \u201cThis mural was classic old fashioned anti-Semitism, nothing to do with Israel at all.\u201dMr. Pollard said he thought that Mr. Corbyn was indifferent to anti-Semitism, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t see it as \u2018proper racism\u2019 because most Jews are \u2018part of the ruling elite.\u2019 \u201dMs. Lukes and other Corbyn supporters say they detect a plot by internal enemies to undermine a charismatic, left-wing leader.\u201cThe timing is not coincidental; there has been a lot of talk about what the people who oppose Jeremy Corbyn are likely to do next,\u201d she said, adding that they \u201cmay be thinking that it is quite a neat way to stir things up a bit.\u201dMs. Luke, whose grandparents died at Auschwitz, said she believed that Labour needed to deal better with complaints of anti-Semitism, adding that the digital era had brought new people into political activism, some of whom were susceptible to internet conspiracy theories.But she said she still saw the protest against Mr. Corbyn as politically motivated. \u201cFaith and community leaders should not be interfering to unseat the leader of a political party, or skew the outcome of the elections,\u201d she said, suggesting an intention to damage Labour\u2019s standing in coming local elections and to increase pressure on Mr. Corbyn\u2019s leadership.Stewart Wood, a member of the House of Lords and former aide to the previous Labour leader, Ed Miliband, agreed that Mr. Corbyn was not anti-Semitic \u2014 indeed, for such a committed anti-racist it is \u201ca horrific accusation,\u201d he said \u2014 but he acknowledged that \u201ca few elements inside the left of our party have drifted into it in the past few years.\u201dUnder the Labour former prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr. Corbyn and his allies felt themselves outcasts in the party, and \u201cthe culture of the tribe of outsiders is to support each other, instinctively,\u201d Mr. Wood said.\u201cBut,\u201d Mr. Wood added, \u201cnow that he is leader, the admirable instinct to support people who were with him in the tough times as an outsider can sometimes end up hurting his leadership by giving the impression that he is prepared to tolerate the intolerable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But at several new restaurants, the richly glowing golden metal is on the surface of the bar, not just the foot rail. Brass is nudging aside zinc, the traditional metal for bar tops. At Legacy Records near Hudson Yards, the main curved bar and a utility bar are both covered in burnished brass. Robert Bohr, an owner, said he wanted it for warmth and for how well it complemented the midcentury style of the restaurant, designed by Ken Fulk. At Harry\u2019s, a venerable steakhouse on Hanover Square that was recently redecorated for about $1 million by Antonio Tadrissi of PDLab in Toronto, the 36-foot bar is covered in brass. \u201cBrass ages beautifully and gracefully, just like Harry,\u201d Mr. Tadrissi said, referring to Harry Poulakakos, the founder of the 46-year-old restaurant, which is now owned by his son, Peter Poulakakos.

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents", "Date": "2018-03-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data, as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network\u2019s alerting users.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data \u201cto target political advertising and manipulate voters.\u201dBut Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.\u201cIt is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid answering difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers,\u201d Mr. Collins said in a statement. \u201cThis also creates a false reassurance that Facebook\u2019s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.\u201dThe fallout from the reports added to questions Facebook was already confronting over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news. The social media giant has grappled with the criticism over the issue for much of the past year, and struggled to keep public opinion on its side.Over the weekend, Facebook was on the defensive. Top executives took to Twitter to argue that the company\u2019s protections had not been breached, and that Facebook was thus not at fault.The data was obtained in 2014, when Cambridge Analytica, through an outside researcher, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and from those of their friends \u2014 activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach was based on a technique pioneered at Cambridge University by data scientists who claimed it could reveal more about a person than even their parents or romantic partners knew.The researcher hired by Cambridge Analytica, Alexandr Kogan, told Facebook and his app\u2019s users that he was collecting information for academic purposes, not for a political data firm owned by a wealthy conservative. Facebook did nothing to verify how the information was being used.Mr. Bosworth argued on Twitter that a violation had been committed only by Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan, whose app \u201cdid not follow the data agreements.\u201d\u201cThe recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a \u2018breach\u2019 under any reasonable definition of the term,\u201d Mr. Stamos tweeted.The explanation did little, however, to stem the tide of anger as independent researchers pointed out that many others could have similarly misused Facebook data.Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, wrote that the lack oversight and transparency into what sort of data Facebook collected on its users meant that the company\u2019s platform could continue to be exploited.\u201cUnethical people will always do bad things when we make it easy for them and there are few \u2014 if any \u2014 lasting repercussions,\u201d Mr. Albright said.Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement that the company was looking into whether the data in question still existed. \u201cThat is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people\u2019s information,\u201d he said.This month, The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. And a former employee of the data firm described having recently seen hundreds of gigabytes of unencrypted data files on Cambridge servers.There were also questions from technology experts and others about Facebook\u2019s reaction to the news reports by The Times and The Observer, especially its decision to suspend the account of Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data harvesting \u2014 but also spoke out about it to the two news organizations.On Friday, Facebook threatened to sue The Observer to stop it from publishing, the newspaper\u2019s outgoing editor, John Mulholland, said on Twitter.Then, late Friday evening, Facebook posted a statement that expressed alarm at the data leak. The company promised to take action and announced that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie.By then, Facebook had learned that Mr. Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, was a named source for the news reports.In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Wylie described himself as \u201ca curious and na\u00efve 23-year-old,\u201d when he first went to work for Cambridge Analytica.\u201cI feel a sense of regret every day when I see where they have helped take our world,\u201d he added. \u201cI need to make amends, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m coming forward.\u201dHis lawyer, Tamsin Allen, said that last week Mr. Wylie offered to help Facebook recover the missing data.Now, though, Facebook said on Sunday, Mr. Wylie is refusing to cooperate with the company until the suspension is lifted \u2014 a move the social network is not willing to make because of his role in the data harvesting.In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers said that in the light of the new reports, they wanted fresh answers from both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about how the data was obtained and what was done with it.Mr. Collins, the British lawmaker, said he planned to call Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, to return to Parliament and answer questions about testimony last month in which he claimed that the company never obtained or used Facebook data.\u201cIt seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,\u201d Mr. Collins said.Also on Saturday, the two top Congressional Democrats leading inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam Schiff of California \u2014 called for investigations of the Facebook data leak.\u201cThis raises serious questions about the level of detail that Cambridge Analytica knew about users,\u201d said Mr. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee.An earlier version of this article misidentified the role of Senator Amy Klobuchar on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is a Democratic member of the committee, not the ranking Democratic member.

{"Headline": "Embracing China, Facebook and Himself, Cambodia\u2019s Ruler Digs In", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTUNG TRANG, Cambodia \u2014 As the sun rose over the murk of the Mekong River, the man who has ruled Cambodia for more than three decades, Prime Minister Hun Sen, clasped hands with the Chinese ambassador and beamed.\u201cThe Chinese leaders respect me highly and treat me as an equal,\u201d Mr. Hun Sen said last month during the groundbreaking of a $57 million Chinese-funded bridge in the district of Stung Trang.\u201cLet me ask those of you who have accused me of being too close to China,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat have you offered me besides cursing and disciplining me and threatening to put sanctions on me?\u201dFor a quarter century, the West helped rebuild Cambodia while it was still reeling from the genocidal Khmer Rouge. The United States and Europe tied billions of dollars in aid to an effort to transform Cambodia into a liberal democracy.That campaign has failed. Instead, Cambodia has come to stand as the highest watermark for China\u2019s influence in Southeast Asia and as the stage for Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s evolution into one of Asia\u2019s most unstinting autocrats.Mr. Hun Sen, 65, likes to be known as Lord Prime Minister and Supreme Military Commander, and has said he plans to stay in power for another decade or two. He\u2019s making sure of it: His government has dissolved Cambodia\u2019s main opposition party ahead of general elections set for July, jailed dozens of critics and shuttered dissenting news media outlets.In Senate elections late last month, his Cambodian People\u2019s Party swept all seats on offer.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s enduring grip on power has been supported by China\u2019s largess, which comes without the West\u2019s admonishments to protect human rights and democratic institutions.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s authoritarian descent reflects an overall retreat of democracy across Southeast Asia. There is also a perception across the region that the United States under President Trump has withdrawn its influence, leaving China free to exercise its clout. While some countries, like Vietnam, nurse historic grievances with China and have tried to resist its economic magnetism, others, like Laos and Cambodia, seem on the path toward becoming client states of Beijing.\u201cCambodia is in danger of returning to being a totalitarian state,\u201d said Mao Monyvann, a Cambodian former opposition lawmaker. \u201cAnd the worst thing is that Hun Sen looked around and he saw that China supported him and that America was not punishing other Asian countries for doing similar things, so he just went ahead with his crackdown.\u201dChina is Cambodia\u2019s largest benefactor, providing the country with nearly one-third of its foreign investment last year. Beijing has gifted Cambodia 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers.\u201cIn terms of funding for infrastructure, we welcome any country that\u2019s willing,\u201d said Sun Chanthol, Cambodia\u2019s minister for public works and transport. \u201cBut so far, only the Chinese are responding so generously.\u201dMr. Hun Sen has long condemned Western powers for treating Cambodians as pawns in a geopolitical game. He has a point: The French colonized Cambodia and the Americans bombed the countryside. A state-building experiment by the United Nations spread graft.But his government\u2019s accusations have grown increasingly outlandish.Dissenting voices have been branded as Western agents. Kem Sokha, the leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, was detained in September and charged with treason, accused of plotting a United States-funded coup. He denies the charges.\u201cThe U.S. wants to break up Cambodia and destroy our country,\u201d said Phay Siphan, a government spokesman. \u201cThe U.S. is paranoid and wants the Cambodian government to be weak so it can come back to this region and chase China away.\u201dDuring his 33 years leading Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen has displayed a faultless sense of when to switch sides.The son of farmers became a fighter for the Khmer Rouge, whose murderous rule from 1975 to 1979 resulted in the deaths of about a fifth of the national population.\u201cYes, we were Khmer Rouge soldiers,\u201d said Dy Bit, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s cousin. \u201cThere was nothing else to do.\u201dMr. Dy Bit\u2019s sister and neighbor were beaten to death by the radical communists.\u201cSome us killed,\u201d he said, \u201cand some of us were killed.\u201dBut in 1977, Mr. Hun Sen defected to neighboring Vietnam. When Vietnamese troops ejected the Khmer Rouge from Phnom Penh two years later, Mr. Hun Sen, at 26, returned as the world\u2019s youngest foreign minister.By the time the United Nations arrived in 1992 to administer a transitional authority, Mr. Hun Sen was firmly in control of Cambodia. He later sidelined his co-prime minister, whose party had won elections in 1993.Throughout his political reinventions, perhaps only Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s antipathy toward the United States has remained unchanged.He grew up in a wooden house near the Mekong, in a province that was heavily bombed by the Americans as the Vietnam War spilled across the border.While he led the puppet administration installed by the Vietnamese, Mr. Hun Sen chafed at the fact that the United States refused to recognize his government. Instead, Washington, still smarting over its retreat from Vietnam, pushed for Cambodia to be represented at the United Nations by the Khmer Rouge, which still held a corner of the country.Mr. Hun Sen has never been invited to the White House. But he has traveled to Beijing numerous times, and in 2016, President Xi Jinping of China visited Cambodia.Shortly before Mr. Xi\u2019s trip, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s government shielded Beijing from mild criticism by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of China\u2019s expansive claims to the South China Sea.During his visit, Mr. Xi described the two countries as \u201cgood neighbors, real friends who are loyal to each other.\u201dMr. Hun Sen\u2019s supporters suggest that Beijing is more sympathetic to his authoritarian impulses because that is the natural state of affairs in Asia.\u201cWe only respect one ruler because in our history there was only one king,\u201d said Mr. Phay Siphan, the government spokesman. \u201cThe Chinese understand this because they have closer blood to us.\u201dMr. Hun Sen, however, has also borrowed from Mr. Trump\u2019s playbook.Other times, he has been more direct. In a speech on March 3, Mr. Hun Sen called William A. Heidt, the United States ambassador to Cambodia, a \u201cliar ambassador.\u201dMr. Hun Sen has proved adept at using social media. The public relations firm Burson-Marsteller says that his interactions on Facebook make him the third-most engaged leader in the world, although the opposition accuses Mr. Hun Sen of buying his \u201clikes\u201d through click farms.On a cool February morning, Mr. Hun Sen addressed 10,000 young garment workers on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The speech was broadcast live on Facebook, and a stream of hearts and thumbs up floated across Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s page.After the hourlong talk, which strayed into the merits of drinking one\u2019s own urine and his recent struggle with diarrhea, Mr. Hun Sen posed for photos with members of the crowd. Every worker was given the equivalent of $5 in cash in an envelope that specified the money was a gift from Mr. Hun Sen and his wife, Bun Rany.Yet his Cambodian People\u2019s Party is not assured of the youth vote in the election scheduled for July 29. In the last election, in 2013, the opposition, buoyed by support from young Cambodians, threatened to unseat the ruling party.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s campaign strategy has been to position his government as the sole guarantor of peace in Cambodia.\u201cWithout us, there would still be war, and you wouldn\u2019t have the choice to work in factories,\u201d he told the garment workers.Yet nearly 70 percent of Cambodia\u2019s population is younger than 30. They have known no other leader but Mr. Hun Sen, and they appear eager for change.Mr. Hun Sen, though, seems keen to keep politics a family concern. He has put his youngest son, Hun Many, in charge of courting the nation\u2019s youth. Currently Cambodia\u2019s second-youngest lawmaker, Mr. Hun Many has expressed interest in becoming prime minister.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s eldest son, Hun Manet, a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, is widely considered to be angling for the job of commander in chief. The prime minister\u2019s second son, Hun Manith, is rising in the intelligence services.\u201cWe have to remember that democracy is an important pillar, but it is not the only one,\u201d said Mr. Hun Many, who was educated in the United States and Australia.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Chinese backers echo the importance of stability.\u201cUnder the leadership of Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia has maintained peaceful development and enjoyed lively economic growth,\u201d Xiong Bo, the Chinese ambassador, said at the Mekong ceremony.Cambodia achieved 6.9 percent economic growth last year. In 2005, half of Cambodians lived below the poverty line. Less than a decade later, fewer than 14 percent did.But even as millions of rural residents have graduated to factory work, expectations are rising along with income levels. Security officers have responded to workers\u2019 protests with bullets.That puts all the more pressure on Mr. Hun Sen to attract Chinese money. Western investors have been put off by Cambodia\u2019s endemic corruption, not to mention the official anti-Western rhetoric.In Sihanoukville, business is booming. In the coastal backwater once popular with Western backpackers, 20 new casinos have opened in the past two years. A dozen more are scheduled to begin operations this year.The clientele is almost exclusively from China; Chinese arrivals to Sihanoukville rose by nearly 200 percent last year.On day five of business at the Chinese-owned New MGM casino last month, Chinese gamblers could be seen placing bets of $100,000 in the V.I.P. room. Chinese managers oversaw the till while Cambodian prostitutes napped nearby.Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s vacation villa is across the street from the New MGM.In late January, Yun Min, the governor of Preah Sihanouk Province, wrote an internal report warning that so many Chinese workers had descended on Sihanoukville that the local economy was suffering. He denounced the influence of Chinese gangsters.\u201cSome mischievous people,\u201d he cautioned in the report, might use Sihanoukville\u2019s makeover \u201cto attack and influence the Cambodia-China relationship.\u201dMr. Hun Sen publicly dismissed Mr. Yun Min\u2019s criticism. Less than a week later, the governor seemed chastened.\u201cLike in any family, we might have disagreements with China,\u201d said Mr. Yun Min, sitting in his office, a Chinese construction crane hovering above. \u201cBut our Lord Prime Minister Hun Sen is very clear that we still love our family.\u201dSun Narin contributed reporting from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Future of Time Warner, Coming Soon to a Court Near You", "Date": "2018-03-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeginning next week, AT&T and the Justice Department will lock horns in court to determine if the telecommunications giant will be allowed to absorb the entertainment powerhouse Time Warner.For the better part of a year and a half, the $85.4 billion acquisition was regarded, more or less, as a fait accompli. That changed completely in November, when the Justice Department moved to block the deal.Now the talk in media circles revolves around what will happen if the acquisition is stopped and Time Warner \u2014 the owner of HBO, Warner Bros., CNN, TBS and TNT \u2014 is made an orphan. And what will it mean for the old-guard entertainment companies in the streaming age?\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the ecosystem, the media ecosystem, that this deal goes through,\u201d said David Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery. \u201cFor the first time in the history of this business you have these massive global companies \u2014 Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, Google \u2014 of a scale we\u2019ve never seen. They\u2019re like massive transformers.\u201cThey\u2019re transforming this entire industry, and they\u2019ve decided they love content, and they\u2019re sucking it up and disrupting the current ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Zaslav added. \u201cIn order to have to real stability, the great cable companies, mobile and satellite companies need to be able to compete with these global-scale companies.\u201dThe media industry has undergone significant change since the blockbuster deal was announced in October 2016.All the while, digital rivals keep tossing money around.Netflix is now spending up to $8 billion a year on content, up from $6 billion in 2016. Its free cash flow could balloon to negative $4 billion this year but its market value has skyrocketed to $139 billion from roughly $54 billion since the Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced.And while Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple have opened their wallets, Time Warner has been sitting on the sidelines.\u201cIt\u2019s bad in the sense that that\u2019s a lost year and a half from business planning perspective,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal.A Time Warner spokesman said the company was \u201cconfident they would prevail at trial.\u201d He would not speculate on what would happen should the judge, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, rule for the government.The Justice Department argues that since AT&T has such a wide distribution network (it owns DirecTV), a deal could spell disaster for consumers. AT&T has countered that costs for consumers would likely go down.Though Time Warner has been in a state of limbo for the last 18 months, analysts agree that its core businesses have been performing well.\u201cThe wheels certainly haven\u2019t fallen off,\u201d Mr. Wieser said.And while some think the deal being blocked will scare off potential suitors, there are many analysts who are convinced that Time Warner is too attractive to sit alone for long. For example, could HBO and Warner Bros. be sliced off and sold to companies like Apple or Amazon? The networks TNT and TBS to an entity like Viacom?\u201cIf there is a demand for other media assets, there is nothing on the scale of Time Warner anymore,\u201d said Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays Capital. \u201cThat gives it a scarcity value.\u201dMr. Venkateshwar also pointed out that Time Warner would benefit from the new tax law, which would give the company even more runway if it has to go another year or two by itself.Another analyst, Amy Yong, at Macquarie Group, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t really dismiss how powerful HBO is. And Warner Bros. the studio. And, even to some extent, Turner and CNN. These are great consumer brands.\u201dHBO continues to be a juggernaut, producing hit shows like \u201cWestworld\u201d (which returns next month) and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The network\u2019s annual revenues now exceed $6 billion.

And since Donald J. Trump announced his presidential run nearly three years ago, CNN has set ratings records.Warner Bros., among its slate of hits, also had several misfires, like \u201cJustice League\u201d and \u201cKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\u201dAnd though CNN\u2019s revenues have grown, it hasn\u2019t been at the rate of MSNBC and Fox News, which draw more viewers in prime time. TBS and TNT, and Turner\u2019s slate of cable channels, continue to experience ratings declines as more consumers cut the cord.Nevertheless, the research firm MoffettNathanson has told investors that Time Warner\u2019s upside \u201chas been overlooked because it is tied up in deal hell.\u201dThe firm believes that if the AT&T acquisition falls apart, Time Warner could be split up and sold to the highest bidder \u2014 and perhaps even thrive as a result.\u201cThe separation of Time Warner would likely draw two distinct sets of bidders into the marketplace,\u201d it told investors. \u201cOn the content side, we would expect to see interest from current film entertainment competitors like Sony and CBS/Viacom and even new scripted digital entrants like Apple or Amazon. As for Turner, we would think there would be interest from existing cable network operators like Viacom or Discovery.\u201dBut what would the ripples be if the deal collapses?\u201cLet\u2019s just say they also block the Fox-Disney acquisition for some reason, that would all of a sudden make you go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s actually an active effort to restrain the size of business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wieser said. \u201cThat\u2019d have an effect on all industries, not just media.\u201dMost analysts regard that outcome \u2014 both the AT&T-Time Warner and Fox-Disney deals being blocked \u2014 as unlikely, but the question becomes far more existential for Time Warner and its direct peers if the AT&T deal goes down. If they aren\u2019t allowed to scale up to compete with Silicon Valley, how long could they be around?\u201cYou suddenly have, from scratch, for the last six or eight years, $15 billion being spent by Amazon or Netflix,\u201d Mr. Zaslav, the Discovery chief executive, said. \u201cThat could soon be $20 or $25 billion.

{"Headline": "A Celebration of Black Southern Food, at JuneBaby in Seattle", "Date": "2018-03-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review12 PhotosFried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense.This is the tactic \u2014 find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them \u2014 favored by most of the South\u2019s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn\u2019t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don\u2019t serve, that pulled me in deeper.Like any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he\u2019s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky. He stews pigs\u2019 ears until they surrender their ornery stiffness, then slices and fries them into irresistible, crunchy sticks. He seasons okra and tomatoes with a North African spice mix and stews them with hog maw, otherwise known as the outer wall of the stomach.Mr. Jordan would disagree. By the way, he cooks chitterlings, too.These are the cuts that enslaved black people on plantations were allowed to keep when hogs were killed; after Emancipation, these were the cuts they might have had the money to afford and the skills to make into something memorable. Their healthy representation on the menu tells you that JuneBaby is not just a Southern restaurant but, specifically, a black Southern restaurant.He was raised in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the surrounding culture wasn\u2019t particularly Southern but his mother\u2019s table was. \u201cThe food she cooked was the only food she knew,\u201d Mr. Jordan said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s where I got my experience of fried fish, fried chicken, braised meats, offals, bread pudding.\u201dThe chitterlings are essentially his paternal grandmother\u2019s recipe, stewed with onions, carrots and garlic. Instead of water, he might use some chicken stock, or the collagen-rich liquid thrown off by the pigs\u2019 ears. Rather than use a pot on the stove, he softens them in a pressure cooker. This both speeds the process by several hours and allows him to welcome the customers who line up each night waiting for the doors to open into a dining room that does not smell like intestines.As variety meats go, intestines are not at the top of my list. Out of strong curiosity, I\u2019ve eaten them packed into andouillettes in France, fried and kept under heat lamps in a gas station in Mississippi, and grilled over charcoal in the backyard of a Korean restaurant in Queens. I liked them best at JuneBaby.\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s chitterlings were a thing I loved, but never talked about,\u201d Mr. Jordan said, a thought that will sound familiar to immigrants and other people whose families\u2019 food veers from the mainstream American diet. \u201cYou tell your friends as a kid you eat chitterlings, they run away from you.\u201dJunebaby\u2019s chitterlings never come off the menu. They are not a huge revenue center for the restaurant but they may be, in a cultural sense, a loss leader.The dining room has a welcoming, domestic atmosphere; somehow it always feels as if a warm breeze were blowing through the screens, even in winter with the windows shut.For all the braised and simmered and stewed dishes, the kitchen glides easily into lighter territory. Vegetables keep their crunch. Bright green broccoli is tossed with grated Cheddar, almonds, apples and very delicate puffs of pork skin, all of them sharpened by preserved-lemon vinaigrette.The buttermilk biscuits and raised dinner rolls, known here as Antebellum Wheat Buns, are made with a light, practiced hand under the direction of Margaryta Karagodina, the pastry chef. Red-flint cornbread, baked in an iron skillet, gets its minerally sweetness from sorghum.Some of the desserts are slices of church-supper favorites, like a rich brick of bread pudding, interspersed with dark chocolate and soft apricots, sitting on cr\u00e8me anglaise. The Black Forest cake was the kind you rarely see anymore, three chocolate-cake layers frosted with cocoa-dusted whipped cream.Alongside one of these, it\u2019s a good idea to let Mr. Jordan take you all the way back to the beginning of his career and have a flip. This is frozen fruit juice \u2014 pineapple the night I had it \u2014 in a paper cup, a tribute to the homemade Popsicles Mr. Jordan used to whip up out of powdered drink mix and sell when he was a boy in St. Petersburg. If the word flip doesn\u2019t ring a bell, one of its other names might: huckabuck, hucklebuck, frozen cup, freeze cup, cool cup.The encyclopedia is another way JuneBaby drew me in. It nudged me to consider what I was eating. And it situated Mr. Jordan\u2019s family recipes in a centuries-long arc of American history. Many restaurants start with a chef\u2019s personal story. JuneBaby traces that story back to where it meets the country\u2019s.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "If You Love High TV Bills, This Is the Merger for You", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith so much attention on tech giants, it is almost possible to overlook the doings of AT&T, the once fearsome telephone monopolist. Even in an age of bigness, it is a behemoth. Its revenue, $160 billion in 2017, is four times that of Facebook. And AT&T boasts 166 million paying wireless and video subscribers in the United States.And yet the company wants to build an even bigger empire. AT&T is seeking to acquire another giant, Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN, Turner Networks, the Warner Bros. studios and DC Comics, among other media properties. Their planned merger would create a union of pipes (AT&T) and content (Time Warner) that would be the largest such company in the world.In a way, AT&T has a point. The figure does vastly understate the full costs of this merger to the American public. What we really have here is a brazen effort to prolong the life of a dying business model \u2014 \u201cfull-service\u201d pay TV \u2014 by making \u201ccord-cutting\u201d more expensive, and thereby strangling a revolution in internet television that remains in its toddlerhood. Even worse, greenlighting the deal could set off a domino effect.If AT&T acquires Time Warner, other companies will face intense pressure to follow suit. The AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the second largest in media history, behind only AOL\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner in 2000. A vertically integrated AT&T-Time Warner would have an important bargaining advantage over its non-integrated rivals. That\u2019s particularly dangerous for rivals like Dish, which offers a virtual pay-TV service called Sling TV for as little as $20 a month.Post-merger, when an AT&T-Time Warner negotiates with Dish for access to HBO and CNN, for example, it would hold all the cards. It could set new and higher prices, knowing that if Dish pays more, it hurts itself. But if it refuses and leaves a big hole in its lineup, it hurts itself more, by driving some of its customers to AT&T.That harsh logic will not only force Dish and similar companies to raise their prices to reflect higher costs (as Justice argues), but also drive them to seek their own dancing partners (bodyguards might be another term), to gain reciprocal bargaining power. Perhaps Dish sells itself to Disney or Viacom. Verizon might buy parts of Fox or Viacom. Cable providers like Charter and Altice could pick up whatever is left.Whatever the precise combinations might be, the media lineup would rearrange itself into a new group of \u201cmajors.\u201d Consumers would face, in effect, a giant replica of the 1930s Hollywood studio system, an integrated oligopoly in which each player cooperates to keep those big bills big.Making things worse, the effects may bleed into the wireless market. Once AT&T becomes a content company, it can take advantage of the repeal of net neutrality to promote its own content (like television shows from HBO) to AT&T Wireless subscribers. It would bet that many consumers wouldn\u2019t switch to a competing T-Mobile plan, even if it\u2019s cheaper, if it doesn\u2019t let them stream the last season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Any way you count it, the result is a grand and easily predictable reduction in effective competition. This is what most clearly justifies Justice\u2019s opposition to the merger.Should we really worry about this merger when Netflix and Amazon remain hot, and consumers are dumping their cable and satellite subscriptions anyway? That is actually what\u2019s at stake with this merger: whether that continues, or whether AT&T and friends get in the way. Even if AT&T and its peers manage to only postpone their inexorable decline, a few years of stalling can be worth billions of dollars. That\u2019s why AT&T, in its own arguments in favor of the merger, offers so little benefit for the public. Its first promise to consumers is that they will \u201cmake the advertising in Time Warner\u2019s programming more customized,\u201d based on the data AT&T holds.The main outcome of this merger would be to make sure Americans keep paying far too much for pay TV. We can only hope that the court sees this deal for what it is.Tim Wu is a law professor at Columbia, the author of \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Struggle to Get Inside Our Heads\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Little Movie Studio That Could", "Date": "2018-03-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 At the Sundance Film Festival here in January, executives at A24, the upstart movie and television studio, stood in the back of a makeshift theater looking as if they were about to be physically ill.A24\u2019s latest offering, \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d an intimate coming-of-age dramedy set for release in theaters on July 13, was minutes away from its festival premiere. What if the audience hated it? \u201cThis movie is just so personal for me,\u201d Nicolette Aizenberg, an A24 executive, said to someone who had just asked why she was quite literally shaking in her brown snow boots.Since starting five years ago, A24 has delivered one cultural thunderclap after another, peaking with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d last year\u2019s surprise winner (especially to the folks of \u201cLa La Land\u201d) of the Oscar for best picture. Other A24 hits over the past few years include \u201cSpring Breakers,\u201d about college girls who get mixed up with a messianic drug and arms dealer; the creepy-cool \u201cEx Machina,\u201d which introduced the future Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander to most viewers; \u201cThe Lobster,\u201d a dystopian cult favorite; and the Oscar-winning \u201cRoom\u201d (Brie Larson for best actress). Among the A24 films up for Oscars at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony are \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d (adapted screenplay) and \u201cThe Florida Project\u201d (Willem Dafoe, supporting actor).But the studio\u2019s biggest hit so far, both critically and commercially, is the film nominated for five Oscars this year, including best picture: Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cLady Bird,\u201d which has collected about $50 million in North American ticket sales. (Its other Oscar nominations include best director, for Ms. Gerwig, and best actress, for Saoirse Ronan.) Scott Rudin, a producer of both \u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d said in an email that A24 has \u201cthe best team I have ever worked with anywhere, and since I am now approaching Methuselah\u2019s age, that is a considerable statement.\u201d\u201cThey are the original Coca-Cola,\u201d Mr. Rudin said of A24, \u201cand everybody else is New Coke. Except for Searchlight, which is Tab.\u201dExactly how has A24, an offbeat, 55-person company named after an Italian highway, managed to get tough customers like Mr. Rudin eating out of its hand? Moreover, how has the company so quickly created such a strong consumer identity, with analysts saying that fans are starting to buy tickets simply because they see A24\u2019s retro logo on a trailer?A24 declined interview requests. Its founders \u2014 David Fenkel, Daniel Katz and John Hodges, all of whom have extensive art film experience \u2014 seem to see a sense of mystery as part of their branding and competitive strategy, or at least they don\u2019t want A24 to fall into the trap of a Weinstein-style cult of personality. \u201cFrankly, nobody outside the tent has the slightest understanding of what they do, which is very, very smart,\u201d Mr. Rudin said.Founded with a few million dollars in seed money from Guggenheim Partners, where Mr. Katz once led the film finance group, A24 has been constructed around one notion: There has to be a better way.As the DVD market collapsed, making thin studio profit margins even thinner, film companies became desperate to cut marketing costs (\u201cspray and pray\u201d television campaigns mostly) by going directly to consumers through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. But most established studios \u2014 hindered by hierarchies and allergic to talk of social media algorithms \u2014 were struggling to treat tweets and Instagram posts as the spine of a marketing campaign instead of an add-on.\u201cEverything about A24 is just fresh as a new daisy,\u201d said Barry Diller, the former Hollywood mogul who runs IAC/InterActive Corporation and has invested in several A24 projects. \u201cEnthusiasm. Aggression. Sheer smarts.\u201dAt the same time, A24\u2019s founders tapped into a deep unhappiness among young filmmakers about the state of the film business. Across Hollywood, all most executives talk about are franchises and \u201ctent poles,\u201d movies with edges sanded off so they can play to the widest possible global audience. Even most art house companies, struggling to fill seats in the age of Netflix, have become more dependent on stars and marketable concepts. Nothing bums out the auteur set faster.Even so, the sustainability of A24 remains a question.And A24 has savvy competitors hot on its tail. One is Neon, which is also focused on using social media to go after millennials. Founded last year by Tom Quinn, a longtime independent film executive, and Tim League, the chief executive of the funky Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, Neon was behind \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d the darkly comedic Tonya Harding biopic that has collected about $30 million. Its star, Margot Robbie, is nominated for best actress on Sunday; Allison Janney is up for best supporting actress.But even those in Hollywood who believe A24 is overhyped \u2014 and there are plenty, perhaps nudged along by envy \u2014 concede that the studio has done an astounding job at building a brand.\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is that they\u2019re tapping into a new type of entertainment enthusiast,\u201d said DeeDee Gordon, an independent brand strategist who has consulted for A24. \u201cIt\u2019s similar, I think, to what happened in foodie culture. It used to be a rarefied niche. Then it became democratized. Every income level. Every life stage. Global. That is the opportunity that A24 now has at its fingertips.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Norway\u2019s Justice Minister Resigns in Storm Over Facebook Post", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOSLO \u2014 Sylvi Listhaug\u2019s anti-immigration views and sharp comments have made her one of Norway\u2019s most polarizing political figures, but it was a single, incendiary Facebook post that has threatened to bring down the government and led to her resignation as justice minister on Tuesday.Ms. Listhaug and her right-wing Progress Party, which is a junior partner in a fragile coalition, supported a bill that would have allowed the government to strip Norwegian citizenship from those suspected of joining terrorist or foreign militant groups, without a court hearing. After the bill was defeated earlier this month, she lashed out online.In a Facebook post, which she has since taken down, she said the center-left Labor Party \u201cbelieves the terrorists\u2019 rights are more important than the nation\u2019s security,\u201d and attached a photo of two veiled and gun-toting fighters from the Shabab militant group in Somalia, thousands of miles away.The post drew likes and shares from Ms. Listhaug\u2019s anti-immigrant political base, and a far-right Facebook group orchestrated the delivery of piles of flowers to the Justice Ministry. But it also attracted outraged reactions and prompted an online campaign asking people opposed to her to contribute to the charitable group Doctors Without Borders. The effort raised its target figure of 15 million kroner, about $1.94 million, in a matter of days.\u201cI can\u2019t recollect any other incidents in northern Europe where social media has created a cabinet crisis of this magnitude,\u201d said Eirik Loekke of Civita, a center-right political think tank.\u201cThis saves the government,\u201d said Lars G. Svasand, a political scientist at the University of Bergen.Ms. Solberg\u2019s center-right Conservative Party leads a minority coalition alongside the populist Progress Party and the more centrist Liberal Party. The prime minister elevated Ms. Listhaug to the justice post in January, in an attempt to co-opt and moderate the hard-line anti-immigrant populists.Norway is often ranked as having one of the world\u2019s most democratic and stable political systems, and in the past, minority coalitions have managed to govern through quiet pragmatism and compromise.But Ms. Listhaug, 40, who rose to prominence as a social media firebrand, has struck out against that kind of cozy consensus, in a way that has fueled her rapid rise and fall.She gained an early taste for politics as an intern at the Republican Party in the United States, before moving into a career alternating between national politics and lobbying.She has been in government since 2013, first catching attention as an outspoken agriculture minister who took on small farmers and reindeer herders from the country\u2019s indigenous Sami minority by cutting back subsidies. And she has stridently criticized other lawmakers from rival parties, including accusing the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Knut Arild Hareide, of \u201clicking the back of Imams.\u201dEspen Teigen, an adviser to Ms. Listhaug who is often cited as a driving force behind her social media strategy, also announced his resignation on Tuesday.In a Facebook post of his own, Labor\u2019s current leader, Jonas G. Store, welcomed Ms. Listhaug\u2019s decision to step down.\u201cThis case started with a Facebook post that never should have been published,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe cannot have a minister of justice who brings wood to the fire of hatred and conspiracy theories.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted a Facebook post by the Norwegian justice minister, Sylvi Listhaug. She wrote that \u201cThe Labor Party believes the terrorists\u2019 rights are more important than the nation\u2019s security,\u201d not that the party was \u201cprotecting terrorists over citizens.\u201dHenrik Pryser Libell reported from Oslo, and Richard Martyn-Hemphill from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In South Korea, Another Former President Lands in Jail", "Date": "2018-03-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean authorities arrested a former president on Friday on charges of bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion, the country\u2019s second former leader to be imprisoned within the past year.\u201cI consider all this my own fault and feel remorse,\u201d Mr. Lee, 76, said in a handwritten statement posted on Facebook shortly before his arrest.Mr. Lee was accused of collecting more than $10 million in bribes from various sources, including Samsung, the county\u2019s largest business conglomerate, when he was a presidential candidate and after he took office. Samsung has not commented on the case, although prosecutors have questioned one of its former vice chairmen and raided his home.Prosecutors say that Mr. Lee hid his ownership of a lucrative auto-parts maker in the name of relatives and embezzled $32 million from the business. Mr. Lee was also accused of using his presidential power to help settle a legal case implicating the auto-parts company, getting a business conglomerate to pay $5.8 million in lawyer fees, they said. If convicted, Mr. Lee could be sentenced to life in prison.Almost all of South Korea\u2019s presidents have seen their reputations tarnished toward the end of their tenure or during their retirement because of corruption scandals involving them, their relatives or aides. Mr. Lee is the fourth former president to have been arrested on corruption charges since the 1990s.The former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to death and his friend and successor, Roh Tae-woo, was sentenced to 22\u00bd years in prison on bribery, mutiny and sedition charges in 1996. Both of their sentences were later reduced, and they were pardoned and released in 1997.Ms. Park, who succeeded Mr. Lee in 2013, became the first South Korean president to be impeached by Parliament. That vote in December 2016 followed weeks of huge demonstrations fueled by accusations that she was involved in a corruption scandal. She was formally removed from office and arrested last March.Last month, prosecutors asked a Seoul court to sentence Ms. Park to 30 years in prison on charges of collecting or demanding $21 million in bribes from big businesses. A three-judge panel is scheduled to announce its ruling on Ms. Park on April 6.In the wake of Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment, critics attributed the recurring corruption scandals at the center of political power in South Korea to what they called the unbridled power of its \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Moon\u2019s government unveiled a bill to revise the Constitution to curtail presidential power.In his proposed constitutional revision, Mr. Moon suggested that the current, single five-year presidential term be replaced with a four-year term and that the incumbent leader be allowed to seek another term. But Mr. Moon cannot benefit from the proposed revision and cannot seek re-election.The proposed revision deprives the president of the right to name the chief of the country\u2019s Constitutional Court, handing that decision over to the court\u2019s justices. It also reduced the president\u2019s power in appointing commissioners of the government watchdog Board of Audit and Inspection. It also curtailed the president\u2019s power to grant special pardons, which critics said has long been abused to free business tycoons convicted of bribery and other white-color crimes.But Mr. Moon will find it hard to pass his bill through Parliament. His governing party has only 121 seats there, well short of the 195 votes needed for a constitutional revision. Even if the bill is approved by lawmakers, it is also subject to referendum.Advertisement"}

Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine (and the West\u2019s de facto acquiescence in it) is the most visible evidence of the flimsiness of the post-Cold War\u2019s national borders.But what about covert Russian influence peddling in places like Bulgaria; or overt influence peddling through the Russia Today \u201cnews\u201d channel; or cyberoperations, via Twitter and Facebook, to disrupt and undermine Western elections?After the Cold War, many of us na\u00efvely assumed that the communications revolution would be the vehicle through which the West would spread its values, attitudes and tastes to the rest of the world. We forgot that the revolution worked in the opposite direction as well: that for every Google executive fighting for political liberalization in Cairo, there might also be an alienated young Islamist in the West learning how to build a bomb by reading Inspire, Al Qaeda\u2019s slick online magazine.Kaplan never loses sight of this fluidity: \u201cThe smaller the world actually becomes because of the advance of technology,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe more permeable, complicated and overwhelming it seems, with its numberless, seemingly intractable crises that are all entwined.\u201dKaplan makes clear that, at its best, Realism provides American statesmen with a middle path between what Kissinger once called \u201cthe disastrous oscillations between overcommitment and isolation.\u201d This is what guided the Nixon administration as it sought to get out of Vietnam in a way that preserved America\u2019s reputation as a reliable ally, while also securing a balance of power (through the opening with China) that would help see the United States through the Cold War.That Kissinger was willing to do this in ways that scandalized moralistic American liberals is more than fine by Kaplan. \u201cEnsuring a nation\u2019s survival sometimes leaves tragically little room for private morality,\u201d he argues. \u201cThe rare individuals who have recognized the necessity of violating such morality, acted accordingly and taken responsibility for their actions are among the most necessary leaders for their countries, even as they have caused great unease among generations of well-meaning intellectuals who, free of the burden of real-world bureaucratic responsibility, make choices in the abstract and treat morality as an inflexible absolute.\u201dThere is much truth in that observation: Foreign policy is not merely a subset of ethics. Yet Realism also has limits that its practitioners can fail to appreciate. If it offers a powerful caution against overdosing on the kind of idealism that led us into nation-building exercises in Vietnam and Iraq, it can also keep statesmen from grasping their opportunities. Many Realists were scandalized by Ronald Reagan\u2019s belief that the Cold War could be won. He proved to be right, in part because he understood the moral dimensions of the struggle against Communism better than they did; and in part, too, because sometimes there really is a good case for optimism.Kaplan gets this: \u201cA student of Shakespeare,\u201d he writes, \u201cwould have grasped Vladimir Putin\u2019s character long before an international relations wonk.\u201d Geography may be the immutable fact of geopolitics, but geopolitics is still politics, and thus a human story.It\u2019s a dark prophecy from an observer with a depressingly accurate record of predictions. When it comes to curbing our enthusiasms, Kaplan\u2019s achievement is to throw so much shade with so much verve.Bret Stephens is a columnist for The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Most of America\u2019s Fruit Is Now Imported. Is That a Bad Thing?", "Date": "2018-03-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s obvious to anyone who visits an American supermarket in winter \u2014 past displays brimming with Chilean grapes, Mexican berries and Vietnamese dragon fruit \u2014 that foreign farms supply much of our produce.Imports have increased steadily for decades, but the extent of the change may be surprising: More than half of the fresh fruit and almost a third of the fresh vegetables Americans buy now come from other countries.Although local, seasonal and farm-to-table are watchwords for many consumers, globalization has triumphed in the produce aisle. And despite the protectionist \u201cAmerica First\u201d message coming from the Trump administration, the growth in imports appears likely to continue.So this is an apt moment to examine how the shift happened, and what it portends \u2014 good or ill \u2014 for American consumers and farmers.The surge in imports, mostly from Latin America and Canada, flows from many other changes during the last 40 years, starting with improvements in roads, containerized shipping and storage technology. Horticulturists developed varieties and growing practices adapted to warmer climates \u2014 enabling, say, blueberries and blackberries to be grown in central Mexico.Many foreign crops have recently been approved for importation using these protocols, including Chinese apples and Colombian avocados. Some are still in the rule-making process (Chinese citrus, European apples), and others are under study (Brazilian citrus, Mexican guavas).Greater availability has led to a huge increase in per-capita consumption of many crops, including mangoes (up 1,850 percent from 1975 to 2016), limes, avocados, grapes, asparagus, artichokes and squash. Yet consumption has fallen for other crops \u2014 like peaches, oranges, cabbages and celery \u2014 that are still primarily grown in America.For consumers, the chief advantages of the import boom are the increased availability and variety of fresh produce, particularly in winter, when imported berries, grapes and stone fruit now compete with citrus and stored apples.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to criticize food that comes from far away,\u201d Mr. Pollan said. \u201cBut if the question is whether this is good for your health or not, in general it is.\u201dMany imports cost less than domestically grown equivalents, and competition from imports keeps prices down for domestic produce.But unlike imported furniture or washing machines, produce is perishable and may suffer from transport. It may be picked less ripe. Varieties may be selected for durability at the expense of flavor, and treatments mandated to kill pests (hot water for mangoes, cold temperatures for citrus) can degrade flavor or texture.In many fruits, acidity drops over time, and off flavors develop; weeks-old cherries, for example, may still look fine but taste flat. Vegetables, too, can decline. Domestic asparagus, grown mostly in California, Michigan and Washington, tends to be plumper, juicier and more flavorful than the more fibrous and rubbery imports from Mexico and Peru.It might seem logical that older produce is also less nutritious, and for some compounds such as vitamin C, levels do decline with time. But there does not appear to be any evidence that the overall nutrient content degrades significantly. From a public health standpoint, the benefits of increased availability and consumption of imported produce outweigh any such worries, nutritionists say.Even so, Mr. Pollan said, \u201cI generally have more confidence in domestic than imported organic.\u201dThen there are environmental issues: Because imported fruits and vegetables typically travel farther than domestic produce from farm to table, they cause greater harm from carbon emissions and pollution. That\u2019s especially true for produce arriving by air, which is likely to be fresher and cost more than produce arriving by ship.For American farmers, too, imports have had mixed consequences. The increased international trade in produce has benefited many of them (including growers of Northwestern apples and California citrus) but harmed others (producers of Florida tomatoes and California asparagus).Most growers\u2019 organizations maintain that trade accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement have helped American produce farmers on balance.Most of the advantage from exports, however, has gone to large growers.The Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration is likely to worsen the shortage and high cost of labor, a serious threat for many American farmers. \u201cThe United States needs immigration reform and a stable labor force if it wants to continue to grow most of its own produce,\u201d Mr. Runsten said.The federal government is focused on the economics. Jason Hafemeister, trade counsel to the secretary of agriculture, said in an interview that increased trade has generally benefited farmers and consumers. The Trump administration seeks to ensure a level playing field in trade for American farmers, he added, but wants to let consumers choose what matters to them in produce, whether price, freshness or origin.Mr. Pollan, not surprisingly, does worry as imports climb. \u201cI think it would be a tremendous loss if we weren\u2019t growing a significant percentage of our produce, for reasons having to do both with quality, and with the knowledge of the environment that farmers bring to a society,\u201d he said.Consumers who agree can vote with their dollars by prizing local and domestic produce when available, and staying alert for decreased quality in less-fresh imports. The next decade or two will determine whether Americans can enjoy the advantages of an increasingly globalized supply without losing the very real benefits of domestic produce.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the ritual of eating seasonally, the pleasure one can have as fruit comes into the market,\u201d Mr. Pollan said.Advertisement"}

A woman crossing a street outside the boundaries of a crosswalk \u2014 something that many of us do \u2014 was hit by a driverless Uber car and killed. The car\u2019s computer may have lacked the ability to recognize a person where a person wasn\u2019t technically supposed to be, and Uber\u2019s emergency driver in the car evidently failed to override the computer.For the victim\u2019s friends and family, there are no larger lessons, only tragedy. For the rest of us, however, the larger lessons are vital. We need to figure out how to avoid future tragedies, given the increasing use of driverless cars.To me, there are two main lessons:Uber and the other driverless-car companies have a moral responsibility to make their products safer than they evidently are. The rest of us have a responsibility to realize that the status quo \u2014 human-driven cars killing 100 Americans each day \u2014 isn\u2019t acceptable, either.

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Case: How the Biggest Antitrust Trial in Years Could Play Out", "Date": "2018-03-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s case to block AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s $85 billion blockbuster merger heads to trial this week, with opening statements expected on Thursday. The case is being billed as one of the most important antitrust trials in years.Here\u2019s what you need to know.Opening statements are scheduled for Thursday, with the Justice Department and AT&T getting 45 minutes each to lay out their main arguments. Expect lots of colorful claims and defenses from both sides. Top officials from the Justice Department, including the head of its antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, are expected to show up in United States District Court in Washington to watch. AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, and Time Warner\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, will be there, too \u2014 as will scores of other media, telecom and tech executives, as the outcome of the trial could reshape the media industry.Read more on what the trial could mean for the future of TV.The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks \u2014 unless there is a settlement \u2014 with each side calling about 30 witnesses and presenting reams of evidence. The Justice Department alone plans to show 519 exhibits. It could take many weeks longer for Judge Richard J. Leon to make a decision on the $85 billion merger.The Justice Department sued to block the merger because it believes the combination of AT&T with Time Warner would hurt competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.AT&T and Time Warner argue that the opposite will happen. With their combination, they say, they will be a stronger competitor to the giants of Silicon Valley, such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, which are spending billions of dollars on video that they can then distribute on their services.Judge Leon has experience in antitrust disputes, giving final approval of Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011 \u2014 a case that many have looked to for precedent.The Justice Department\u2019s legal team is led by Craig Conrath, a longtime government litigator who has argued for government antitrust actions throughout several administrations.AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s defense team is led by Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles litigator who doesn\u2019t have experience in antitrust law. He gained fame for his successful case against O. J. Simpson in a wrongful-death suit brought by the family of Ron Goldman.The most interesting testimony will probably come from company executives. Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes are expected to take the stand. Ahead of the opening statements, Judge Leon said he also wanted to question third parties including Google. Last fall, Google argued in a deposition that shows made by Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, were important to its YouTube service.Turner, which owns CNN, TBS and TNT, is a key focus of the Justice Department\u2019s case. The department says that those channels are \u201cmust watch\u201d television that is valuable to the health of rivals like Dish and Google, and that combining them with AT&T\u2019s wireless and satellite services would encourage the new company to withhold those shows or make them much more expensive.If Judge Leon sides with the Justice Department, it will be much harder for telecom, tech and media firms to strike deals with each other. Blocking the so-called vertical merger of two companies that don\u2019t directly compete with each other would set a higher bar for other deals.If AT&T and Time Warner win, expect further consolidation in the industry. Several deals are already in the works or being discussed, pending a sign from the court on whether they can proceed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Welcome to Zucktown. Where Everything Is Just Zucky.", "Date": "2018-03-21", "News": "In Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook is building a real community and testing the proposition: Do people love tech companies so much they will live inside them?Supported byMENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 John Tenanes, Facebook\u2019s vice president for real estate, is showing off the company\u2019s plans for expansion. It will have offices for thousands of programmers to extend Facebook\u2019s fearsome reach. But that is not what Mr. Tenanes is excited about.He leans over a scale model of the 59-acre site, which is named Willow Village. \u201cThere will be housing there,\u201d he points. \u201cThere will be a retail street along here, with a grocery store and a drugstore. That round building in the corner? Maybe a cultural center.\u201dIn just a few years, Facebook built a virtual community that linked more than two billion people, an achievement with few precedents. Now the social network is building a real community, the kind you can walk around. It is a project with many precedents in American history, quite a few of them cautionary tales about what happens when a powerful corporation takes control of civic life.Facebook, Mr. Tenanes says, has a dual mission: \u201cWe want to balance our growth with the community\u2019s needs.\u201dWillow Village will be wedged between the Menlo Park neighborhood of Belle Haven and the city of East Palo Alto, both heavily Hispanic communities that are among Silicon Valley\u2019s poorest. Facebook is planning 1,500 apartments, and has agreed with Menlo Park to offer 225 of them at below-market rates. The most likely tenants of the full-price units are Facebook employees, who already receive a five-figure bonus if they live near the office.The community will have eight acres of parks, plazas and bike-pedestrian paths open to the public. Facebook wants to revitalize the railway running alongside the property and will finish next year a pedestrian bridge over the expressway. The bridge will provide access to the trail that rings San Francisco Bay, a boon for birders and bikers.Mr. Tenanes contemplates the audacity of building a city.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d he says.The social media colossus is not the only Big Tech company in the complicated position of dressing up its expansion as a gift to its neighbors.A few miles down the 101 highway, another new civic-corporate partnership is underway in the city of Mountain View. Google is promising to place the public \u201cin the very heart of Google\u2019s vibrant community.\u201dThe search company plans a 600,000-square-foot office building with a roof that melts up into soft peaks, kind of like a meringue. It will have stores, cafes, gardens and even a space for theatrical performances, as well as a place for consumers to test-drive new Google technology.Google will build 5,000 homes on its property under an agreement brokered with Mountain View in December. Call it Alphabet City as a nod to Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent. The company said it was still figuring out its future as a landlord, and declined further comment.Zucktown and Alphabet City, as well as similar projects being contemplated across Silicon Valley, could at a minimum have consequences for the start-up culture that transformed fruit orchards into the world\u2019s greatest tech hub. Silicon Valley was built by engineers jumping from company to company. That drove the innovation that sped the rise of some firms and hastened the demise of others.As workers begin to literally live at the office, they will inevitably be more beholden to bosses who also collect the rent. After all, it is much harder to find a place to live in Silicon Valley than a new job. Turnover may slump, and so might the turnover in ideas.The push into the physical also has implications for the 1.2 million people in Silicon Valley who are teachers, fitness instructors, clerks, baristas \u2014 all those who hold jobs that do not come with stock options. As they inch down the clogged streets and bid money they don\u2019t have on miserable houses, they will hear the siren call of Big Tech: We can fix broken communities by building new ones. Trust us.On a wall in the Facebook division charged with the company\u2019s growth there is a poster with a classic tech admonition: \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d Facebook is in essence tweaking that to \u201cGo Big at Home.\u201d About 12,000 of its 25,000 employees work in Menlo Park. In a decade, it will have space for 35,000 \u2014 slightly more than the city\u2019s current population.The notion of communities run by and for companies has been a fixture in the United States almost from the beginning. Often these places were exercises in plunder.In the textile town of Lowell, Mass., in 1846, the mill clock slowed down to lengthen shifts and then sped up at night when the workers were off, according to one contemporary reformer. U.S. Steel built Gary, Ind., but took little responsibility for its employees, many of whom lived in substandard housing in crime-ridden neighborhoods.There were more benign examples too. Milton Hershey began building a chocolate factory in the middle of Pennsylvania in 1903 and then surrounded it with a community where, he pledged, there would be \u201cno poverty, no nuisances, no evil.\u201d In return for surrendering certain rights \u2014 like local elections and privacy \u2014 workers in the town of Hershey got medical coverage, a free junior college, parks and a zoo.Corporate good will, however, had a way of curdling over time.In Wisconsin, the Kohler family established a plumbing-fixtures factory in 1900 and then created a town around it. Kohler built houses for couples and dorms for single men, financed schools, had a pension plan and paid well. When economic conditions deteriorated during the Depression, however, the employees tried to strike. Kohler responded by arming its deputies with machine guns. In the ensuing clash, more than 40 strikers were shot and two were killed.Hardy Green, author of \u201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy,\u201d said that the tech companies had been reviving elements of the company town in the United States for years now.The free meals, nap pods, concierge services, yoga classes, on-site laundry and haircuts are a perk but also a modern way of slowing down the mill clock so the workers can spend more time working. But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.Only seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.Mr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.City Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201dMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201dMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.Apple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.So the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around. Housing seems the next step. No one bats an eye if universities build housing for students, grad students and tenured professors.\u201dWhen the tech companies played a much smaller role in Silicon Valley 25 years ago, even the working class could afford to live here. So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.However enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.Measure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters. Patti Fry, a former chairwoman of the Menlo Park City Planning Commission and an architect of the measure, said she is wary of Facebook\u2019s increasing size and power.\u201cThey\u2019re doing more than most companies, but most of what they do serves them,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect a company to have as a priority providing community services that a real community needs. They\u2019re in business to be in business.\u201dDrew Combs is a former journalist who became a member of the Menlo Park Planning Commission and then ran for City Council in 2014. He was loosely associated with Measure M and when it failed, so did his bid. He is now chairman of the planning commission, which reviews the use permits required for large projects.\u201cI don\u2019t think in a lot of cases this is a good-versus-evil battle,\u201d Mr. Combs said. \u201cThis is a negotiation between different stakeholders.\u201dMr. Combs has since gotten a new job. He now works at Facebook. He recuses himself when Facebook issues come up before the commission, and also recuses himself from the question of whether Facebook is turning into a one-company town.\u201cLocal issues here are passionately and thoroughly debated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t waned during the six years I\u2019ve been involved and I don\u2019t expect that it will in the future.\u201dFacebook\u2019s move toward openness and community engagement is recent. Its current campus, which it moved into in 2011, is a ring of buildings with a \u201cstreet\u201d in the middle that has restaurants, pop-up shops, a book exchange and other amenities, but only employees can go there.Across the street, the company opened in 2015 an office designed by Frank Gehry. It is basically one enormous room \u2014 the largest open-floor plan in the world, Facebook says. On the landscaped roof is a garden, a walking loop and many trees. The neighbors cannot see any of this.In Zucktown, this notion of firmly separated insiders and outsiders will be deliberately blurred.\u201cThe retail stores will not be managed by Facebook. But we have the mechanism, we are the property owner,\u201d says Mr. Tenanes, the real estate chief, adding that he doesn\u2019t know exactly how it will work in practice. \u201cIt is a bit new.\u201dMenlo Science & Technology Park, a decaying office park that will be torn down for Willow Village, is not exactly a beloved part of the city, and neither are the other sites on which Facebook has been building. They were in an industrial zone. That has helped insulate the company from criticism, which nonetheless simmers beneath the surface in Belle Haven.Facebook, in a comment at the end of the film, acknowledges, \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do.\u201d The company has increased its efforts in the community. So has the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan for philanthropy. At the same time, Facebook has continued to expand.Ms. Taylor grew up in Belle Haven, left, came back to run for the Menlo Park City Council in 2016, narrowly lost, and last year formed Belle Haven Action. It is an organization on a shoestring; she and two colleagues do not have offices and hold meetings at the local community center.\u201cFacebook is very smart,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have money in every problem. Immigration. Housing. Transportation. Education.\u201d For example, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative gave $3 million to an East Palo Alto legal services group that helps low-income residents with housing and immigration issues. It has given more than $7 million to create a primary school.And it is helping fund Belle Haven Action. In January, the organization got a $75,000 grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.Ms. Taylor acknowledged it is awkward for an advocacy group to be funded by the company it is confronting, but said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have resources, that makes your work so much harder. This is about being a disrupter but also a negotiator.\u201dA recent accomplishment by Belle Haven Action: getting a \u201cno right turn\u201d sign on a busy Facebook parking lot to stop workers from heading deeper into the community in an attempt to avoid congestion. Next it would like the company to install cameras on the streets to monitor traffic and pedestrian safety.\u201cWe need movement because nothing has been done for so long,\u201d said Ms. Taylor. \u201cNow Facebook comes in and they\u2019re willing to give us a few pennies and something for the community. The trains will run. We\u2019ll have better schools, a grocery store \u2014 although we\u2019re going to push for a co-op.\u201dIts critics, Apple says, don\u2019t understand.Ms. Wang, the former Cupertino council member, has no regrets about not pushing Mr. Jobs harder. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Apple,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job. The campus is very impressive.\u201dHer only wish \u2014 and it\u2019s a small one \u2014 is that someday Apple will invite her in to actually see it.If Apple is unapproachable, Facebook and its money are becoming inescapable. In addition to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2019s grants to local organizations, the social network is getting more involved with local policing.In 2014, Facebook paid $200,000 to create a new Menlo Park police substation adjoining its campus. It pays the annual rent. It also financed the $173,146 annual salary and benefits of an officer. Last year the company proposed giving the city $11 million to pay for a six-officer unit. That plan evoked some disquiet.\u201cOur goal is to strengthen the community,\u201d said Juan Salazar, a Facebook public policy manager. \u201cWe want a more permeable relationship, where we engage more. The parks, the grocery store, are places to congregate together, to build a sense of place.\u201dDavid Kirkpatrick, whose book \u201cThe Facebook Effect\u201d is a history of the company\u2019s early years, is ambivalent about the expansion. While he says \u201cFacebook is a company that at least tries to have a conscience,\u201d he also worries about so much enforced togetherness on employees.\u201cFacebook has the attitude that if you are really a good employee you will live, eat and sleep Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cThat creates insularity, which is a big problem in Silicon Valley already.\u201dIf Silicon Valley is the laboratory for the increasingly intimate relationship between big tech, its workers and its neighbors (who are also frequently its users), seeds are being planted elsewhere as well.As Facebook works to make Willow Village a reality, its ambitions can only grow.The 1,500 apartments \u201care a starting point,\u201d said Mr. Tenanes. \u201cI would hope we could do more. We\u2019re solving a problem here.\u201dAn earlier version of two picture captions with this article misstated the location of two Facebook buildings that will be razed to make room for the company\u2019s new development.

But critics say that Mr. Oktar has become a convenient trigger for the government to pursue wide-reaching restrictions on internet content and broadcasters.Just three days after the government announced its campaign against Mr. Oktar, it introduced an expansive set of new internet restrictions that would affect millions of Turks who use the internet and social media.\u201cWith Master Adnan as an excuse, extensive censorship coming for internet media,\u201d one news website headline warned.The draft law has passed the parliamentary commission stage, and may go to a vote next week, legislators say.Even before it is passed, outside authorities are raising alarms. Harlem D\u00e9sir, representative on freedom of the media at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, urged legislators to revise the bill, saying it restricted pluralism online and could be incompatible with international conventions.As Mr. Erdogan plans to run in an election for a presidency with newly enhanced powers, which may come this year, the new media law would put yet another heavy finger on the scale in his favor. It would allow him to mute whatever opposition voices have not already been silenced.\u201cIt is just about control,\u201d said Kerem Altiparmak, a human rights and media lawyer. \u201cConsidering what has been happening in Turkey, I have no doubt this is a hegemonic power, controlling newspapers, TV and the judiciary, that is now out to control the internet sector.\u201dThe irony is that Mr. Erdogan is responsible for the economic progress that has made Turkey a largely middle-class country and allowed many to be educated and able to afford cellphones and the internet.A former businessman and mayor of Istanbul, Mr. Erdogan began his transformation of Turkey by building on the early, enormous popularity he gained with social programs that offered health care and pensions to all, and infrastructure projects that eased housing and transportation strains.Initially, he oversaw democratic reforms as part of Turkey\u2019s bid for European Union membership. But as Mr. Erdogan notched up electoral successes, he not only undermined his opponents but he also turned on various allies who had helped him rise to power.His first target was Turkey\u2019s once powerful military, which he emasculated with a series of arrests and high-profile trials that was completed in 2013.Later, he turned against former allies within the Islamist movement, followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States. They had led the campaign to dismantle the military and were demanding a greater share of power.In 2013, Mr. Erdogan closed down the network of university-preparatory schools run by Mr. Gulen, cutting into a major source of finance and influence for his movement.So far, Mr. Erdogan has detained more than 60,000 people accused of being Gulen followers and purged or suspended 150,000 government employees. He also used the opportunity to round up academics, journalists and political opponents.In fact, virtually all the levers of power now belong to Mr. Erdogan, including much of the news media.The government tamed the largest and most powerful media companies by imposing huge tax fines on them and forcing them to sell off assets, and pushing loyal businessmen to take over publications and television channels.After the 2016 coup, 150 media outlets were closed down, and journalists were imprisoned at a pace that left Turkey second only to China, a much larger country, for the numbers jailed.In 2002, when Mr. Erdogan became prime minister, pro-government businesses owned fewer than a quarter of Turkish media outlets, according to \u201cThe New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey,\u201d by Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish research program at The Washington Institute.By 2011, they owned about 50 percent, and by 2017 most of the mainstream media outlets were in their hands. Censors control content in government media offices, and private media outlets are issued strict guidelines.\u201cErdogan can successfully edit out reality,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said in an interview.The co-opting of the mainstream media has helped push Turks, especially the young and middle class, to the internet, which is delivering popular alternatives to a growing audience.Besides a growing number of entertainment providers, including Netflix, and the Turkish equivalents Puhu TV and BluTV, there are several lively independent internet news outlets that publish through social media platforms and podcasts.All of them could be targeted under an article slipped into the innocuous-sounding bill under consideration \u2014 \u201cTax Law and the Law to Change Some Laws and Decrees.\u201dAs drafted it would force any outlets broadcasting via the internet to be licensed. It would also give the watchdog Radio and Television Supreme Council powers to halt live-streaming and fine companies over content.Ahmet Arslan, minister for transportation and communication, who denies there is censorship in Turkey, defended the bill before journalists at an event celebrating Secure Internet Day.\u201cWe have to take measures about radio and television broadcasts if there is a wrongdoing about national security, and ethical values of the country,\u201d Mr. Arslan said.\u201cOur aim is to bring a legal regulation, and prevent mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is certainly not to intervene against any correct broadcasting, any work that is done in harmony with our values.\u201dThe government already imposes restrictions on television shows, making channels edit out curses and blur cigarettes and alcohol. Shows viewed via the internet have so far escaped such controls.\u201cIf there is any wrongdoing, there should of course be an intervention,\u201d Mr. Arslan concluded. \u201cThis is the aim of the regulation.\u201dBut Mr. Altiparmak, who is also a lecturer in law at the University of Ankara, said that while it was necessary to license television channels, because television frequencies were limited, the internet was limitless and so licensing was not necessary in the same way.Instead, the bill would merely allow the government to block any outlet it dislikes by refusing a license without having to prove grounds of national security or ethics.\u201cThe first thing is a judge will be able to block a website without having to show a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond they can bring sanctions against TV stations and fines on internet TV.\u201dThe Turkish telecommunications regulatory authority, BTK, already regulates internet providers, removing content and blocking websites that it disapproves of.Indeed, the scale of the government crackdown has instilled such fear and suspicion in Turkey that many intellectuals and journalists have fled the country.In the first weeks of 2018, as Turkey began a military operation against Kurdish militants in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin, the police detained more than 600 people for opposing the intervention on social media or for taking part in protests.Garo Paylan, a member of Parliament for the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party and a member of the commission studying the bill, warned that the government intended to curb the internet the same way it had constrained television and newspapers.\u201cAny kind of broadcast over social media can be included, which means millions of people won\u2019t be able to broadcast,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\u201cOnly supporters will be able to get a license,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it would cost an amount. Many people would hold back from applying.\u201dThe government could take action against anyone broadcasting without a license, although Hamit Ersoy, a member of Radio and Television Supreme Council, said the bill was aimed at online on-demand broadcasting and not social media, in comments to the Anadolu news agency.Mr. Paylan\u2019s predominantly Kurdish party has especially suffered. Nine lawmakers are in jail, including the leader of the party, who was accused of terrorism. The party is effectively banned from all mainstream media.Its legislators now broadcast parliamentary news to their followers via Facebook\u2019s Periscope. Now those broadcasts could be stopped as well, Mr. Paylan said.\u201cIf enacted, we will see the same situation for internet that the press and television fell into,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this will detach us from the rest of the world more.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He appeared to be using a cellphone. The last known documentation of Mr. Dombroski alive was at 1:30 a.m., as he was walking just south of where he was found \u2014 about a mile and a half from the bar, the police said on Tuesday.\u201cWe dearly love our son and cherish our son,\u201d she said while standing with her husband, John, and her other two sons, John and Kevin. \u201cWe want him back.\u201dMs. Dombroski said that she had reviewed the camera tapes and believed that Mark was not feeling well because he had sustained a shoulder injury during a rugby match that day.

He also still had his wallet and cellphone.Asked about speculation that Mr. Dombroski may have been in a fight at the bar, or that he went to Fort Prospect to meet someone, Mr. Field-Lament asked that anyone making such claims contact the police. \u201cWe all want to get to the bottom of what happened to Mark,\u201d he said.Mr. Field-Lament confirmed that the F.B.I. had been involved since Sunday because Mr. Dombroski\u2019s family has \u201ca connection\u201d to a former director of the F.B.I., but he did not identify the director.

After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February.

{"Headline": "Dropbox Chief to Join Elite Ranks of Idea-to-I.P.O. Founders", "Date": "2018-03-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Drew Houston played computer games like Starcraft in high school, he made some changes so the games ran more smoothly on his friends\u2019 computers.\u201cHe created this one little application, and it would basically display everybody\u2019s shared files, and then if you clicked on a file, it would go ahead and ask everyone else on the network if they wanted to download it as well,\u201d said Andrew Croswell, a friend of Mr. Houston\u2019s from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Mass.Mr. Houston, now 35, has since taken a version of that same concept and turned it into Dropbox, an online file storage and collaboration company that has grown rapidly since its founding in 2007.Whether Mr. Houston successfully takes Dropbox public will be closely watched, with other privately held tech companies like Uber and Airbnb also edging toward an I.P.O. Dropbox, which is based in San Francisco, is unprofitable, and Mr. Houston now has to navigate through a challenging time, both guiding his company around the tech giants that are squeezing into its space and adapting his frat guy persona to a changing culture.\u201cHe\u2019s maybe one of the last ones of a very un-C.E.O.-like C.E.O.,\u201d said Jeffrey Mann, a vice president at research firm Gartner, who follows the file-sharing and collaboration industry. \u201cHe was technical. He started out by coding. Most start-ups now when they get to that size, founders like him get pushed aside for someone with a finance or management background. But he managed to stay there.\u201dDropbox said Mr. Houston was unavailable for comment, citing the quiet period before an I.P.O. But according to interviews with more than a dozen people, Mr. Houston \u2014 a private man with a love of 1990s rock and business books \u2014 built his company with an easygoing management style and a dry sense of humor, which helped him deal with the bumps along the way.Mr. Houston grew up in Acton, a suburb outside Boston, the oldest of three children. His father, an engineer, and his mother, a librarian, noticed early on that Mr. Houston was precocious and encouraged him to explore his interest in computers, but did not want him skipping grades.\u201cHis parents wanted him to stay in first grade for socialization, and they didn\u2019t want to use the term gifted,\u201d said Claudia Couto, who taught at Mr. Houston\u2019s elementary school and tutored him privately. She is now retired.At M.I.T., he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, which he has said helped him learn how to build a corporate culture.After his sophomore year, he took a year off and started an SAT prep company called Accolade with one of his former high school teachers, Andrew Crick. Upon returning to M.I.T., Mr. Houston decided to learn as much about business as he could, plowing through business books from a chair he set up on the roof of his fraternity, he has said.On a bus one day from Boston to New York, Mr. Houston forgot his USB flash stick. Frustrated, he started coding what would be the foundation of Dropbox. He became less interested in Accolade, which closed.\u201cHe was really interested in entrepreneurship, which was not a common trajectory for M.I.T. students,\u201d said Kyle Vogt, 32, chief executive of the self-driving car company Cruise Automation, who met Mr. Houston at an M.I.T. entrepreneurship club event. \u201cThe default back then was to stay in Boston or go to New York and work for a hedge fund.\u201dIn 2007, Mr. Houston entered Dropbox into the Boston program of Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. Paul Graham, who was running Y Combinator, said Mr. Houston needed a co-founder fast. Mr. Vogt referred Mr. Houston to Arash Ferdowsi, an M.I.T. student. Within two weeks, Mr. Ferdowsi became Dropbox\u2019s co-founder; he owns a 10 percent stake of the company.The duo worked in Cambridge, Mass., but struggled to land more funding.In August 2007, Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved to San Francisco to get closer to the start-up scene. A month later, they raised $1.2 million from investors including Sequoia Capital.Mr. Houston and Mr. Ferdowsi moved into an apartment building in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood. It was known as the Y Scraper because of how many Y Combinator company founders lived and worked there. Mr. Houston and Mr. Vogt later became roommates.\u201cTo this day, he still likes to have people over to his apartment and do jam sessions,\u201d Mr. Vogt said.Dropbox also developed a reputation as an unwelcoming workplace for women. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve been struggling with are how to balance Dropbox being a fun place to work with accusations of having a frat boy atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Mann said.\u201cFrom Day One, Dropbox has been an incredibly user-friendly product \u2014 which is a big reason why it spread virally \u2014 but it also took the company too long to realize the money was in being a business-focused company, not a consumer-focused one,\u201d said Ben Thompson, the analyst behind the influential tech newsletter Stratechery.Dropbox instilled more financial discipline. In 2016, employees lost many in-office perks. (The panda remained. A note posted nearby said it would serve as \u201ca reminder\u201d to be thoughtful about spending.)Whether Dropbox can compete against behemoths like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, which all provide cloud storage, remains a question.\u201cHere you have somebody who\u2019s literally in competition with all four, except Facebook,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, an early Dropbox investor. But he added that Mr. Houston\u2019s even-keeled demeanor had allowed the company to work with competitors like Microsoft and Google.He is a bachelor and, his friends said, lives like one.\u201cHe never cooks. He\u2019s a snack guy all the way if that makes any sense,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cHe definitely wants a family.\u201dOn weekends, he and his friends around the country still put on their headsets and play video games together.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do any of the hacks anymore,\u201d Mr. Croswell said. \u201cSoftware companies all fixed that kind of stuff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
