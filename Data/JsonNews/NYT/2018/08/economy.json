{"Headline": "Canada and U.S. Meet as Trump Moves Ahead With Mexico Trade Deal", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A day after President Trump threatened to exclude Canada from a revised North American Free Trade Agreement, top Canadian officials raced to Washington and said they were moving \u201cfull steam ahead\u201d to try to reach a compromise that could save the trilateral pact.\u201cThis is a really big deal,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, said on Tuesday after meeting with the United States trade representative. \u201cWe are encouraged by the progress that the U.S. and Mexico have made, particularly on cars and labor,\u201d she said, adding that those concessions were \u201cgoing to be valuable for workers in Canada and the United States.\u201d\u201cWe will, as we have done throughout this negotiation, stand up for the Canadian national interest and for Canadian values while looking for areas where we can find a compromise,\u201d she said, before heading to meet with Mexican officials.Canada may have little choice but to sign onto the pact. In the nearly quarter century since Nafta went into effect, various industries like automakers and food suppliers have built coordinated supply chains across the continent. If those links are splintered by new trade agreements, \u201cwe\u2019re clearly left off worse than we were before,\u201d said Christopher Wilson, the deputy director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute.The effects would be especially severe for the global auto industry, which has built its supply chain around North America and relies on materials and components from Canada. Auto industry groups warned that a Nafta without Canada would drive up prices for American manufacturers and make them less competitive with foreign companies.\u201cIt is imperative that a trilateral agreement be inked,\u201d Jay Timmons, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement.Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers reiterated on Tuesday that the United States was prepared to notify Congress of its intent to complete a deal with Mexico on Friday unless Canada quickly got on board.\u201cWell, this deal is pretty well put together with Mexico. So the president, as he\u2019s indicated, is fully prepared to go ahead with or without Canada,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe hope that Canada will come in.\u201dMr. Ross, speaking on Fox Business, said he was confident that Canada would ultimately join the deal because its economy \u201ccan\u2019t survive very well\u201d without the United States.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, suggested in an interview with CNBC that the United States and Canada could strike a separate bilateral deal if an agreement was not reached by Friday.\u201cThe U.S. market and the Canadian markets are very intertwined,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for them to get this deal and it\u2019s important for us to get this deal.\u201dMr. Trump has also said the United States could sign a deal with Canada at a later date. But economists cautioned that a patchwork of bilateral deals would have very different implications for the North American economy than the single comprehensive agreement currently in place.\u201cOur industries have integrated so much together that it\u2019s hard to unravel it at this point,\u201d said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.The new rules also stipulate that automakers must use more local steel, aluminum, glass and parts, and have 40 percent to 45 percent of the vehicle made by workers earning at least $16 an hour \u2014 a provision meant to benefit the higher-wage countries of the United States and Canada.But these rules were written with the participation of all three North American economies in mind, said Jennifer A. Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law Center. Cutting out Canada, which is a major supplier of aluminum, steel, automobile components and other goods, could upend the automobile industry\u2019s calculus, making the administration\u2019s proposed rules far more cumbersome than they are already.\u201cIf you can\u2019t include Canada, I\u2019m not sure if they want the rules as they are now,\u201d Ms. Hillman said.Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive, said the new trade rules appeared to be a mixed bag for automakers. They are likely to encourage slightly more production in North America, but also push vehicle prices higher, raising costs and decreasing sales. \u201cIn the end, they may produce a little more here, but sell a little less,\u201d he said.He added that manufacturers were unlikely to make any major moves in the short term because changes in production take years of planning. \u201cThey can\u2019t change on a dime,\u201d he said.Canada has its own considerations in deciding whether to join the deal. Leaders there will have to weigh the optics of looking as if they are being strong-armed into a Nafta deal, especially given Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity in Canada and a coming election for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.However, given that Canada has just over one-tenth the population of its superpower neighbor, and that it sends about three-quarters of its exports to America, the prime minister\u2019s bargaining hand is limited.\u201cIt really puts the prime minister and Minister Freeland in a tough spot,\u201d said Bill Anderson, the director of the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor in Ontario. \u201cFrom the Canadian perspective, being asked to turn on a dime, here\u2019s the deal, take it or leave it, is offensive. But at the same time, the Canadian government is very pragmatic. I don\u2019t think they will walk away from a deal and end up with nothing.\u201dIn a briefing Monday about the deal, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, denied that the tight timeline was a power play intended to pressure Canada, and insisted that after a year of intense negotiations, Canada and the United States were on the same page on many issues.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t designed to put pressure on anyone or anything like that,\u201d he said, pointing out that the countries had gone through seven rounds of negotiations and \u201cliterally tens of thousands of hours\u201d of talks that were either between the United States and Canada or all three nations. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like Canada is coming in at the last minute.\u201dNeal Boudette contributed reporting from Ann Arbor, Mich., and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dwindling Catch Has Alaskans Uneasy", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "Red salmon, a summertime pleasure that feeds residents through the winter, has failed to show up this season in most rivers.Supported byANCHORAGE \u2014 After just a few hours of letting the current comb through his net in the Copper River, Shane Cummings knew that something wasn\u2019t right. Dr. Cummings, a sports medicine specialist, had driven 250 miles east of Anchorage with a seasoned fishing party, including a few men who had gone to the river every summer since the 1960s. They motored between sandbars to a familiar spot, and slid the wide hoops of their nets into the steel-colored water. In a good year, they could pull 70 or 80 red salmon from the river, which they would later brine in sugar and salt and bathe in alder smoke, their Little Chief smokers puffing in their driveways. They would carry Ziplocs of fish to the neighbors and set long tables in their backyards, pulling fillet after fillet off the grill. But as the hours passed on this day in early June, nobody on the river netted a red, or even saw one. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t usual at all,\u201d Dr. Cummings said.Like many people around the world in an era of climate change and pollution, Alaskans have seen startling disruptions in the fisheries that sustain them \u2014 in this case, the salmon that return to rivers in warmer months to spawn after feeding in the open sea. In the last decade or so, king salmon \u2014 large, muscular fish prized for their mild flavor and oil-rich flesh \u2014 have been smaller, and their numbers have fallen well below expectations.People here have more or less adapted to their disappearance somewhat, by catching other fish. But the loss of red salmon is something different. Smaller than king salmon, with a saltier flavor and flesh as bright as raspberry jam, red salmon are what high summer in Alaska tastes like. This summer, though, has turned into one of the worst for red-salmon fishing that anyone here can remember. Susitna RiverCopper RiverALASKAAnchorageCookInletPrince William SoundKodiakBristolBay Gulf of AlaskaKodiak I.Chignik   100 milesBy The New York Times\u201cIt\u2019s totally out of everyone\u2019s wheelhouse,\u201d said Stormy Haught, the state\u2019s biologist for Prince William Sound and the Copper River area. \u201cI had calls \u2014 \u2018Really? The reds aren\u2019t running? Are you sure the sonar is even working?\u2019 It was very unexpected for the general public.\u201dState wildlife managers closed river after river to fishing in July so enough salmon could reach their spawning grounds. From commercial boats to restaurant kitchens to backyard barbecues, people are uneasy.Fishing has its natural ups and downs, and this year is not as dire as it feels to some, Mr. Evridge said. Over all, Alaska\u2019s commercial red-salmon catch was just above the five-year average at the end of July, thanks to record catches this summer in one area: Bristol Bay, the world\u2019s largest wild red-salmon fishery, in Southwest Alaska. That fishery is far from the state\u2019s population base, however, and most of its catch is shipped out of state and around the world. For restaurants and cooks outside Alaska, the main impact of this year\u2019s red-salmon disruption has been an increase in prices. Here in Alaska, though, the effects have rippled into daily routines and livelihoods.In the rural Aleut fishing village of Chignik, the fishing fleet, the town\u2019s economic lifeblood, has sat idle, as have the locals who smoke and freeze fish throughout the winter instead of buying expensive groceries that have to be shipped in. The village may need food aid to weather the cold months.\u201cThat\u2019s a good chunk of my family\u2019s recipes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt weighs on your mind. Is this how it\u2019s going to be?\u201dMr. Evridge, the economist, grew up in Kodiak and usually fishes the Copper River himself. This year, he said, people don\u2019t just miss food \u2014 they miss an experience that\u2019s intertwined with their connection to the vast, wild place.\u201cUnloading the four-wheeler, the dusty road, perching on the rocks at the river, hauling fish back up, bringing it home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I sit down to the table in November and look at a piece of salmon, there\u2019s a story attached.\u201d\u201cSome researchers are pointing toward warmer water, but it kind of depends on which populations we\u2019re talking about and where they are,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, massive changes in all kinds of things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be one thing only, it\u2019s going to be a combination of insults that cause these problems.\u201d Water off much of Alaska\u2019s coast has cooled this year, but warmth persists in the Bering Sea, which is home to some of the world\u2019s largest fisheries.\u201cThey would have hit some very warm ocean water right in a critical life stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey out-migrated into a marine environment wasn\u2019t really conducive to sockeye development and survival.\u201d Higher temperatures can harm the plankton that salmon eat, Mr. Templin said, but there isn\u2019t enough data to explain whether that has affected the red salmon.At Bear Tooth, where chefs and managers taste their dishes every week, Ms. Johnson said they noticed that this season\u2019s red salmon were not only smaller, but tasted slightly different. Other chefs have noticed it, too, as have some fishermen. Some say the fish tastes off; others say it has more of an umami flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s not as clean and not as rich in a way \u2014 a little bit briny,\u201d said Ms. Johnson. \u201cI can taste what summer red tastes like in my mouth in the winter.\u201d \u201cYou know how you know it\u2019s summer in Alaska? It smells like smoking salmon and mud and two-stroke oil,\u201d Mr. Apling-Gilman said. \u201cTo not have that, or to have it be so compromised and so restricted, it\u2019s super scary. It puts everything in perspective, ecologically, politically.\u201d The fishing was good, they said, but there was always anxiety about letting customers down.\u201cWe have to believe the tide will rise, the fish will come back,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cWe\u2019re fishermen; we\u2019re eternal optimists, right?\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the Anchorage body of water where many people were shown fishing. It is Ship Creek, not Fish Creek.An earlier version of the article misstated the year when the smolt, or young salmon, for this year\u2019s red-salmon runs headed to the sea.

After all, the same Republicans now wringing their hands over budget deficits just blew up that same deficit by enacting a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.So it might seem shocking that only a few months later they\u2019re once again posing as deficit hawks and calling for spending cuts. That is, it might seem shocking if it weren\u2019t for the fact that this has been the G.O.P.\u2019s budget strategy for decades. First, cut taxes. Then, bemoan the deficit created by those tax cuts and demand cuts in social spending.

{"Headline": "Plan to Punish Immigrants for Using Welfare Could Boost G.O.P. Candidates", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is advancing a plan to punish legal immigrants for accepting food stamps, public housing and other government benefits they are entitled to \u2014 a strategy that appeals to conservatives and could help to galvanize Republican voters before the midterm elections.But already, the rule could serve as a talking point for Republican candidates seeking to counter an expected wave of Democratic enthusiasm, seizing on President Trump\u2019s claims that immigrants are an outsize drain on American taxpayers.As drafted, the rule would authorize federal officials to revoke legal resident status from legal immigrants who accept government assistance currently available to them.It essentially concludes that those immigrants are more likely to become \u201cpublic charges\u201d \u2014 dependent on programs like Medicaid, children\u2019s nutrition aid and even housing and transit subsidies.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters \u2014 voters who will be key to victories by Republicans in close contests this fall \u2014 believe that legal immigration has cost them jobs, depressed wages and forced higher taxes.Recent studies, however, have found that increased legal immigration has led to higher, not lower, wages. Other studies by social scientists suggest that immigration leads to greater, not lower, productivity in the United States and somewhat lower prices for some goods and services.Such studies are unlikely to convince the president\u2019s most ardent supporters, especially in the face of a barrage of campaign commercials that are certain to be broadcast in the months ahead.Republicans across the United States have already embraced the president\u2019s hard-line messaging about illegal immigration and crime. They are betting that they will benefit politically the way that Mr. Trump did during the 2016 presidential campaign.At a rally on Saturday in Ohio, the president tried to bestow the issue on Troy Balderson, the embattled Republican House candidate in Tuesday\u2019s special election. The contest \u2014 the final special election before the November vote \u2014 was notable for its surprisingly tough challenge from a Democratic opponent in an overwhelmingly Republican district.\u201cA vote for Troy\u2019s opponent is a vote for open borders, which means massive crime,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the rally. \u201cWe want our country to be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens!\u201dThe crowd responded with enthusiastic chants of \u201cbuild the wall!\u201dOn its own, the proposal for legal immigrants who accept government aid is unlikely to be a political driver in the midterm elections, said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports stricter immigration policies.\u201cBut I do think it will be well received by voters who tend to believe that our immigration system needs to be tightened, and that people applying for immigration benefits meet standards for self-sufficiency,\u201d she said.The proposed rule would allow immigration caseworkers to consider \u201cheavily weighed negative factors\u201d in determining whether green card candidates and other legal residents are likely to become dependent on government assistance, according to a leaked draft of the proposal. Those \u201cnegative factors\u201d include accepting common tax credits and other welfare programs, like food stamps, transit assistance and health programs for children.It would exclude some entitlements from being considered in the \u201cpublic charge\u201d determination \u2014 like immunizations, attending public school, receiving free or reduced-price school lunches or earned benefits such as disability insurance and Medicare.Unauthorized immigrants are already ineligible for nearly all public benefits. The rule could force even legal immigrants to voluntarily forgo benefits to avoid risking being deported \u2014 with severe impacts, especially for children.Trump administration officials said the proposal intends to promote fiscal responsibility by enforcing longstanding rules that require immigrants to support themselves financially when they enter the United States.A Homeland Security Department official familiar with the proposal said that more than half of all immigrant households use one or more welfare programs. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan was still being considered, said the Trump administration considers providing benefits to immigrants as deeply unfair to American taxpayers.Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said that any changes that are made would ensure that the government is careful in how it spends taxpayer funds as it upholds current laws in processing benefit requests by immigrants.As a candidate, Mr. Trump made an immigration crackdown one of his signature \u2014 and most divisive \u2014 campaign themes. Since Mr. Trump took office, several of his top aides \u2014 including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller, the White House domestic policy adviser \u2014 have pushed to shut down illegal immigration and drastically limit legal entry into the United States.Some of those efforts, including a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that has resulted in separating migrant children from their parents, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a wall along the southwestern border, have been stymied by Congress and the courts.The proposal to change the welfare rules for immigrants is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to curb what the president and his aides say is rampant fraud by immigrants using public benefits.The Homeland Security Department has also proposed using money collected from immigrants \u2014 including to pay for green cards \u2014 to hire hundreds of special agents to focus on immigrant benefit fraud.That proposal, as outlined in a fiscal 2019 budget document, was in response to an expected increase in investigations into identity and benefit fraud.Emily Baumgaertner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A bite of an orange is endless summer.But the most basic decisions about the state\u2019s future will be made in Sacramento, many of them by the end of the legislative session on Aug. 31, and those decisions could help steer a rudderless world through the gathering climate storm.So far, Mr. Brown has not stood up to the oil industry. He\u2019s not alone, of course \u2014 very few leaders have shown this kind of courage. (In Canada, the theoretical climate champion Justin Trudeau recently nationalized a pipeline in order to make sure that the exploitation of Alberta\u2019s dirty tar sands could continue.) But Mr. Brown is term-limited, not to mention 80 years old; he\u2019ll never run for office again, so like no other leader, he could resist the financial might of the fossil fuel industry. In the end, it\u2019s how he will be judged by history.And in the end, it\u2019s up to the rest of us to ensure that he, and the California Legislature and leaders everywhere, do the right thing. A large movement of citizens is the only power that can match the financial majesty of the oil industry, and that movement is focused on California for the rest of this summer. Mr. Brown has summoned city and state leaders from around the planet for a climate meeting in mid-September, but before they gather, ordinary people will make their voices heard on Sept. 8. The group Rise for Climate, Jobs and Justice will sponsor rallies around the world, but the biggest is expected to be in the Bay Area, where marchers will try to spur action on a scale equal to the danger.The atmosphere in the streets of San Francisco will reflect the new California: full of the confidence bred by technological prowess, but full, too, of the dread that comes from watching people die from wildfire, and of the anger that comes from watching leaders talk more than they act. California has long played an outsize role in the world\u2019s affairs, but never more than right now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada and U.S. Express Optimism as Pressure Builds to Reach Nafta Accord", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and Canada are aiming to reach a deal by the end of the week that keeps the three-country North American Free Trade Agreement intact, as President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada expressed optimism that the two countries could resolve their differences.\u201cI think Canada very much wants to make a deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday, sounding far more optimistic than just days before, when he announced a deal with Mexico and threatened to leave Canada behind.\u201cRight now we call it the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and we\u2019ll see whether or not Canada gets into it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably not going to be good at all if they don\u2019t.\u201dBoth countries are under pressure to find a way to keep Nafta intact and to prevent the United States from moving ahead without Canada. Republican lawmakers have warned the White House that a bilateral agreement with just Mexico would probably not pass congressional muster, and companies have said a Nafta without Canada would cause severe economic damage.On Wednesday, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, who is in Washington for talks, expressed optimism that the discussions were moving in a positive direction and said Canadian and American officials were working intently to try to resolve remaining differences.\u201cMexico has made some significant concessions, which will be really good for Canadian workers,\u201d Ms. Freeland told reporters outside the Office of the United States Trade Representative. \u201cOn that basis, we are optimistic about having some really good productive conversations this week.\u201dMr. Trudeau, speaking in Ontario, said, \u201cThere is a possibility of getting to a good deal for Canada by Friday.\u201dThe deal that American negotiators reached with Mexico appears to give the United States much of what it has been demanding over the past year, particularly related to automobiles. Mexican officials have essentially agreed to a quota of cars and car parts into the United States by accepting a deal that would impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imports above a certain threshold, according to officials.Exports of cars and sport-utility vehicles in excess of 2.4 million could be subject to the auto tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to impose as a matter of national security. The deal would also impose tariffs on Mexican exports of auto parts that exceed $90 billion, according to industry executives. Both figures are higher than Mexico\u2019s shipments to the United States last year, giving Mexico some ability to increase its exports but essentially creating a quota that applies to all Mexican cars and car parts.Mexican officials insisted on Wednesday that the pact would offer their industry important protection from the threat of Mr. Trump\u2019s auto tariffs by carving out an exemption for a large volume of autos and car parts.Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico\u2019s economy minister, described the auto provisions as a win for Mexican carmakers, saying that around 70 percent of Mexican automotive exports will qualify for free trade under Nafta and that the side agreement would help ensure that any effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed auto tariffs would be limited.\u201cIt respects our existing capacity, it respects the new plants that are being developed, and it provides room for growth,\u201d Mr. Guajardo said.But auto industry executives said such an agreement could ultimately limit the number of imports from Mexico, push production outside North America and raise prices for vehicles.\u201cIf we run up against these quotas, we are going to make manufacturing more expensive in the United States. Period,\u201d said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association.White House officials have been attempting to sell the agreement it reached with Mexico as one that Canada cannot refuse, but the Trump administration may have no choice but to strike a deal given blowback from Congress about a bilateral agreement with Mexico. Congress has the ultimate legal authority over trade agreements, and the administration received approval to renegotiate Nafta under \u201cfast-track\u201d authority, which creates a streamlined process for passing the trade agreement into law.\u201cUltimately, Canada is very important,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of votes,\u201d he said, adding that the White House would probably need the support of Democrats to pass an agreement without Canada.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, also warned that the White House should not leave Canada behind.\u201cI\u2019ve long supported modernizing Nafta in order to create more American jobs,\u201d Mr. Portman said in an email. \u201cBut to truly make it work, Canada, which is Ohio\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, needs to be part of the final agreement.\u201dA trade agreement that does not include Canada \u201cwould be a net negative for northeastern Ohio, if not for the whole state,\u201d said Mindy McLaughlin, director of international business attraction at Team NEO, which represents businesses in northeastern Ohio. \u201cThe supply chain between companies in our part of the country and Canada is completely integrated. Parts go back and forth across the border many times.\u201dCanadian companies, she added, are also among the largest foreign direct investors in the region. \u201cFrom a growth perspective, it\u2019s important for our state and northeastern Ohio to maintain a strong diplomatic relationship with Canada,\u201d she said. \u201cNot including Canada in Nafta would severely damage that.\u201dEven with Canada on board, however, a revised Nafta deal could face a long road to approval in Congress.Democrats have long blamed Nafta for sending American jobs abroad, and they have pushed Mr. Trump to include tougher protections for workers in the deal. Republicans have criticized some of the administration\u2019s proposals they see as disadvantaging business, including the sunset clause and limitations to companies\u2019 ability to sue foreign governments.On Tuesday, Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, sent a letter to Mr. Trump saying that Canada must be included in any revised Nafta.\u201cAny new agreement that excludes Canada would unfortunately be a significant step in the wrong direction compared to the trilateral agreement in place today,\u201d he wrote.But companies are warning that pressing ahead with a bilateral agreement could also tip the economic rules governing the North American economy into a mess of uncertainty.\u201cCanada is a very important trading partner for us,\u201d said David Zrostlik, the president of Stellar Industries in Garner, Iowa.His company manufactures maintenance trucks for mining and construction equipment, and some of the materials he uses are imported from Canada. His firm is feeling the pain of Mr. Trump\u2019s metals tariffs, and if Canada is excluded from Nafta, Mr. Zrostlik fears that it would make his exports less competitive overseas. Stellar exports about 10 percent of its production, and Canada is its biggest market.\u201cWhat we thought was going to be a temporary bump would become permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts us.\u201dLegal experts remain divided about what would happen to the United States-Canada trading relationship if they are no longer knit together through Nafta. Relations between Canada and Mexico would likely be governed by the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the countries are likely to approve early next year. But that pact excludes the United States, and the relationship could wind up reverting to the rules of an earlier United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.Many Canadians have interpreted Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to move ahead with a bilateral deal without them as bluster, given the procedural and legal hurdles standing in the way.\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d said Debra Steger, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who is a former senior trade negotiator for Canada and a onetime official at the World Trade Organization. \u201cIt\u2019s just a negotiating tactic that sounds good if you don\u2019t understand the law and the rules.\u201dJennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law Center, said, \u201cFrom my perspective, it\u2019s not clear to me how the administration comes and says that a bilateral agreement with Mexico was properly notified to the Congress.\u201dHowever, she conceded, that point probably does not matter unless Congress is willing to fight the administration. Although members of Congress have objected loudly to Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies, they have not rallied behind legislation that would actually stay his hand. With midterm elections approach, Republicans have been wary of speaking out too much against the president.Reporting was contributed by Katie Rogers from Washington, Nelson D.

KLM, the Dutch sister airline of Air France, announced a similar suspension last month.The moves seemed bound to deepen Iran\u2019s sense of economic isolation, which has worsened considerably in the nearly four months since President Trump scrapped American participation in the nuclear agreement negotiated by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama.Mr. Trump and his aides have warned foreign businesses to steer clear of Iran to avoid reimposed American sanctions, which take full effect in November.\u201cDrastically reducing direct flights to Europe certainly has a psychological and economic impact,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, an aviation and defense industry consultancy in Fairfax, Va.Both British Airways and Air France attributed their decisions to a drop in demand that had made the Iran routes unprofitable, and they did not mention the effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. But industry analysts said the primary cause was clear.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the economic sanctions that have been imposed on Iran are affecting its economy and limit some companies\u2019 ability to do business there,\u201d said Henry Harteveld, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure there\u2019s been a sharp falloff in traffic both originating from Iran as well as traffic from Europe and other international points, including the U.S., going into Iran.\u201dMr. Harteveld said a rise in the price of jet fuel might also have played a role. \u201cJet fuel is like a stern parent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt forces a lot of discipline on you as an airline, and routes that are marginal are often scaled down or cut if they\u2019re not meeting profit expectations.\u201dBritish Airways said its last round-trip flight between London and Tehran would be Sept. 22-23. In a statement, the airline apologized for \u201cany disruption this may cause to our customers\u2019 travel plans\u201d and said it was arranging rebookings or refunds.Air France said it had \u201cdecided to early-end the summer season service from Paris to Tehran\u201d starting Sept. 17, \u201cas a result of weak economic performance.\u201d It offered customers rebooking options.Other foreign-based airlines still provide service to Iran. But the departures of British Airways and Air France will reduce travel options as Britain and France are trying to save the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was intended to end Iran\u2019s economic isolation in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear development.\u201cThe news that British Airways and Air France will stop flying to Iran is a prestige blow to the government,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. \u201cMajor carriers from two nations that support the nuclear agreement are no longer serving Tehran.\u201dMr. Trump, who has described the nuclear agreement as a disaster, even though most countries including the United States\u2019 European allies have said it was working, announced in May that the United States was withdrawing from the accord.The Trump administration has since begun reimposing suspended American sanctions on Iran, including severe restrictions on Iranian banking, automaking and \u2014 most significantly \u2014 sales of petroleum, Iran\u2019s vital export.Under the reimposed sanctions, companies that do business with Iran risk penalties in the far larger American market, which has intimidated big multinational companies that depend on their connections with the United States. Many have withdrawn from Iran or suspended plans to invest there.The impact has helped to severely weaken Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, which has made imports in Iran and travel abroad for Iranians far more costly.\u201cThe market is punishing Iran,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said, \u201cwhich for better or worse is exactly what Trump wants.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Conspiracy Theory Should Worry Trump", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen two or more people join together to break the law, as Michael Cohen says he and the president did, the penalties can be harsh. Mr. Katyal was an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration.His defense then evolved to denying any personal responsibility for those actions. Predictably, Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement on Tuesday destroyed that defense, too, after he told a federal judge under oath that the president had directed him to arrange payments to the two women, who claim to have had affairs with Mr. Trump, \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Now President Trump has moved on to a new defense, claiming that what he did wasn\u2019t a crime and so it can\u2019t be prosecuted. That argument has no basis, either, and is inconsistent with centuries of Anglo-American law.Here\u2019s the new Trump argument, stripped down to its essence: It was clear that he would reimburse Mr. Cohen for those payments to the women, and he\u2019s allowed under Supreme Court precedent to give his campaign as much of his own money as he wants to. But, the Trump defenders say, reporting violations happen all the time, and that is certainly true. But there are two facets that make the Trump reporting violations criminally significant, as opposed to a misdemeanor oversight or bureaucratic snafu: It appears to have been an intentional end-run around the campaign finance laws and to involve a conspiracy. Each of these points explains why the new Trump argument will fail. Criminal law focuses on mens rea, or criminal intent. This means the very same act can be criminal if done with one state of mind and innocent if done with another. It is a mistake to think about Mr. Cohen\u2019s allegations as some sort of routine paperwork error. Structuring a transaction to intentionally avoid reporting it as required by the law is a very serious offense, not a technical one that can be forgiven. That is particularly true of the secret payments to the two women, which, had they been disclosed before the election, as they should have been, might have altered the outcome. The answer is that it isn\u2019t the same crime, and hasn\u2019t been thought of that way in the Anglo-American legal tradition for over 500 years. Rather, conspiracy has always been a separate offense, punished independently without calibration to the underlying crime. So conspiracy to sell a joint can be punished the same way as conspiracy to sell a kilo of marijuana. Why would the law be written that way? The answer has to do with the harm to society when individuals agree with one another to commit criminal acts. These acts are seen as possessing a higher level of moral culpability and are also more dangerous. Two people can often do more harm than one. And those criminal economies of scale are sometimes supplemented by psychological dangers. People tend to take more risks in groups than alone. For these reasons, the law has always treated conspiracy harshly. Indeed, for much of American history, conspiring to commit an immoral but not illegal act was itself punishable as conspiracy.Incidentally, it\u2019s no surprise that Mr. Trump himself came out in an interview aired Thursday against the practice of \u201cflipping,\u201d where prosecutors give a guilty person a deal in exchange for information against another person. Flipping and conspiracy charges go hand-in-hand; the latter is what encourages the former.We are approaching a reckoning, where criminal and perhaps impeachment processes will begin asking hard questions. It would be a huge mistake for the president to rely on assurances from his legal team that what he did was ordinary and not prosecutable. Rather, if the Cohen allegations are true, what President Trump did was knowingly conspire to violate federal campaign law and to hide it from the American people right before the election, and that very severe crime is one that must be punished.

{"Headline": "How Rising Inequality Has Widened the Justice Gap", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewRising inequality has harmed low-income families not only by depriving them of a fair share of society\u2019s income growth, but also in a more specific way: It has stacked the legal system even more heavily against them.Indigent persons charged with crimes are entitled to state-sponsored lawyers, but here, too, funding shortages are widespread.The stakes in criminal proceedings are often enormous, but civil disputes often produce life-shattering outcomes as well.Solving this problem will require not only moral outrage, but also a clearer understanding of how market forces have contributed to it.Free-market enthusiasts celebrate Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand,\u201d which describes how markets harness self-interest to serve the broader interests of society. Yet Smith himself understood that greed alone wouldn\u2019t create a just community. He believed that markets could function adequately only in the context of an elaborate foundation of laws and ethical norms.But even the most carefully devised regulations aren\u2019t sufficient. They must also be enforced, which requires costly resources. Generally, we let families decide for themselves whether to incur the necessary expenses to engage in civil disputes. Yet many families simply cannot afford to pay for competent legal representation.Rising inequality has reduced the supply of legal aid by kindling resistance to taxation. A sense of entitlement to income produced by the fruits of one\u2019s own labor has always existed, but in today\u2019s winner-take-all economy, those on top earn vastly more than before. And changes in campaign finance laws have enabled them to lobby successfully for lower tax rates, contributing to widening budget deficits.Rising inequality has increased the need for legal assistance by inflating the cost to low-income families of achieving other basic goals.In almost every modern society, for example, an important goal of parents is to send their children to good schools. But a \u201cgood school\u201d is an inescapably relative concept \u2014 it is one that compares favorably with other schools in the local environment. And the best schools are almost invariably located in costlier neighborhoods.Higher spending on housing by top earners has shifted the frames of reference that shape spending by those just below them, and so on. Because of this expenditure cascade, the median new house in the United States is now 50 percent larger than in 1980, even though median income has grown little in the interim.Is this a matter of public concern? Most economists celebrate reliance on market rates of pay in the name of efficiency, but many go on to argue that they also promote a measure of fairness, rewarding those who work hard and invest in developing their skills. Well and good. Yet it is an overreach to claim that market-determined rates of pay are morally just.Many top earners are not only talented and hardworking, but they are also lucky to have grown up in privileged circumstances. And it is one thing to say that someone who is 10 percent more skillful should be paid 10 percent more. But in today\u2019s winner-take-all marketplace, those who are only 1 percent more talented often earn thousands of times more. These observations are difficult to square with anyone\u2019s conception of a just society.The good news is that we could relieve both revenue shortfalls and household budget distress \u2014 and provide more legal aid to the poor \u2014 without causing painful dislocations for the rich.Many people who could easily afford the tax increases necessary to pay for more generous social services currently resist that step because they believe it would make it harder for them to buy the special extras they want. But that belief is mistaken, because the standards that define special are elastic. When everyone spends less, those standards adjust accordingly.Much private spending is thus mutually offsetting, resembling across-the-board increases in weaponry in arms races that do not alter the balance of power. Because higher taxes don\u2019t affect relative purchasing power, they have little effect on people\u2019s ability to buy life\u2019s luxuries.We could simultaneously support the Legal Services Corporation and other social services more generously and inhibit the expenditure cascades that have made it more difficult to afford these services. And most reassuring to those whose taxes rose, the very same households as before would still be in the top 10 percent.It would be instructive to ask wealthy taxpayers who oppose this policy change to explain why.Advertisement"}

NATO\u2019s newest member, which declared independence from Serbia in 2006, is indeed small.

But we found that flying into the capital of Podgorica put us within easy striking distance of a variety of attractions: the Dinaric Alps in the north, the Adriatic coast to the south, and the cultural treasures of mid-Montenegro.Ancient towns, from Herceg Novi on the edge of the Bay of Kotor to walled Ulcinj near the Albanian border, dot the 70-mile coastal drive. Construction is rampant, suggesting more, if not mass, tourism isn\u2019t too distant. We found crews restoring the Venetian palaces lining seafront Perast.Those, along with the Ottoman forts strung along the coast, testify to the centuries-long fight for control of this strategic region by the great seafaring powers of the 14th- through mid-19th-century.

{"Headline": "Isamu Shibayama Dies at 88, His Quest for Reparations Unfulfilled", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil he turned 11\u00bd, Isamu Shibayama\u2019s childhood was idyllic.His father was a successful textile importer and dress-shirt wholesaler in Lima, Peru. His house was staffed by servants. He was chauffeured to private school. He spent summers living on the coast with his grandparents, who owned a department store, and swimming in the Pacific.Then, on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.Isamu\u2019s father was playing tennis when news of the air raid was broadcast. He was immediately summoned home. His family and their friends were frightened. But even with anti-Japanese sentiment spreading in Peru, nobody predicted what would happen next.The Shibayama family, joining nearly 2,000 others of Japanese heritage living in Peru, were rounded up by the police, turned over to American troops and shipped to prison camps in Texas and other states. They would remain there from 1942 to 1944, sharing the fate of tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans who were also interned.Even more, his forced removal from the country in which he was born set him on a lifetime quest for a formal apology and reparations from the United States government.Mr. Shibayama did become a citizen. But when he died on July 31 in San Jose, Calif., at 88 a retired gas station owner, his ultimate mission remained unfulfilled.At a hearing to determine whether Mr. Shibayama and two of his brothers had been victims of human rights violations during World War II, the commission\u2019s president, Francisco Jose Eguiguren Praeli, a former Peruvian justice minister, expressed his personal apologies. But the commission had yet to issue any formal findings when Mr. Shibayama died.Washington\u2019s agenda in expatriating the Peruvians of Japanese descent from Latin America was twofold. One aim, the government said, was to make the nation\u2019s southern border less vulnerable to infiltration or attack; the other was to provide a pool of people of Japanese ethnicity who might be traded for American civilians stranded in Japan after the Pearl Harbor attack.Whatever resistance the policy generated in Peru, it was tempered by the same kind of anti-Japanese prejudice that the war had stoked in the United States.Moreover, there was a growing consensus that expelling the ethnic Japanese, particularly those who ran businesses, would reduce competition for other Peruvians struggling in a depressed economy.Japanese began migrating to Peru in the late 19th century, mostly as contract laborers, but many moved to the cities and had become, like Mr. Shibayama\u2019s father, successful entrepreneurs.Isamu Shibayama was born on June 6, 1930, in Lima, Peru\u2019s capital. He was the eldest of eight children of Yuzo and Tatsue (Ishibashi) Shibayama, immigrants from Fukuoka, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. He was baptized Carlos Arturo Isamu and came to be called Art for short.After the war broke out, his grandparents in Peru were among the first to be seized. Sent to the United States, they were put in a detention camp for enemy aliens in Seagoville, Tex., near Dallas, until they were deported to Japan in an exchange for Americans held there.In Peru, Mr. Shibayama\u2019s father went into hiding, but he turned himself in after his wife and 11-year-old daughter were arrested.After being shipped to New Orleans, the family was taken by train to the federal government\u2019s largest wartime internment camp, in Crystal City, Tex., southwest of San Antonio.Mr. Shibayama recalled that as a schoolboy he had difficulty in classes taught in English and Japanese \u2014 his primary language was Spanish \u2014 but managed to finish the eighth grade. Around the camp, he delivered mail and ice and joined the baseball team.When the war ended, in 1945, the family was warned that they would be unwelcome in Peru. But neither were they embraced in their new home. The American authorities classified them as illegal immigrants on the grounds that they had entered the country without proper authorization.With the war over, his family was scheduled to be deported to Japan, by then a devastated country enduring shortages of food and other staples. The family was unwilling to go.They were rescued by Wayne M. Collins, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, who intervened and arranged to have Mr. Shibayama\u2019s father hired by Seabrook Farms, a frozen-vegetable packing factory in New Jersey. The family was paroled and moved there, settling in the town of Seabrook.In time the family moved to Chicago. In 1952, though still classified as an illegal immigrant, Mr. Shibayama was drafted into the Army and deployed to Germany. He was honorably discharged two years later.After returning to Chicago, he took the advice of solicitous immigration officials and traveled to Canada so that he could re-enter the United States from there. Once he did, he was told that he could qualify for permanent residency but would have to live in the United States for about five years before he was eligible for citizenship.In the interim, he took a mechanics course, was hired by a car dealer and married Betty Morita, a Japanese-American who had lived on a farm in Oregon before she, too, was sent to an internment camp.She survives him, along with their children, Bekki and Brian; his brothers, Ken, Tac and George; and his sister, Rose Nishimura. His death was confirmed by his daughter.Mr. Shibayama received permanent resident status in 1956 and was finally granted citizenship in 1970, the same year he moved to California.After the Office of Redress Administration was established as part of the Justice Department in 1988 to indemnify Japanese-Americans who had been interned, Mr. Shibayama applied for reparations. His request was denied; only Japanese-Americans who had been citizens or permanent residents during the war were eligible, and he, of course, had been neither.Mr. Shibayama, however, declined the payment and sued on his own. When he lost in federal court, he and two of his brothers, Ken and Tac, filed their petition before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2002. That body can issue findings, mediate and refer cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which is also overseen by the Organization of American States.Sixteen years later, Art Shibayama\u2019s brothers are still awaiting a decision.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Litany of Grievances: How Turkish-American Relations Deteriorated", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s abrupt increase in tariffs on Turkey, aggravating an economic crisis in the country that spilled into global financial markets on Friday, appeared to be a response to Turkey\u2019s refusal to release an American pastor. But the escalation also reflected a litany of deep-seated grievances between the United States and Turkey that threatens relations between the two NATO allies.Those grievances, analysts said, have been amplified by Mr. Trump and his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both strong-willed leaders who share a penchant for invective and doubling down when threatened.Sinan Ciddi, executive director of the Institute of Turkish Studies in Washington, said Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Trump were headed toward the \u201crabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland.\u201dHow did it come to this? Here is a look at the issues behind the rising American tensions with Turkey, a country of 79 million that straddles Europe and Asia and has long played a vital role in the stability of the Middle East.Seemingly at the center of the dispute is the case of Andrew Brunson, a 50-year-old American pastor from North Carolina. Mr. Brunson has been detained in Turkey for more than a year and a half on suspicion of engaging in espionage and having links to plotters of the failed coup to topple Mr. Erdogan in 2016.Mr. Brunson, who has done missionary work in Turkey for more than 20 years and headed a small church in the city of Izmir on Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, has denied the accusations. He could face 35 years in prison if found guilty.Though Mr. Brunson was moved from prison to house arrest last month, his case has still touched a nerve in the Trump administration. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are devout evangelical Christians, a core voter group for Mr. Trump. The president has raised the case personally with Mr. Erdogan more than once, including in a phone call.Turkey\u2019s refusal to release the pastor, Mr. Pierini said, appeared to reflect \u201ca complete misreading of U.S. policy by the Turks.\u201dBulent Aliriza, the director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research organization, said the Brunson case had \u201cbrought to a head simmering tensions in the U.S.-Turkish relationship.\u201dThose tensions date back years. Some historians tie the decline to 2003, when the Turks refused to allow American troops to transit through Turkey in the American-led invasion of Iraq.Relations worsened during the last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, particularly over Turkish government accusations that the United States was involved in the failed coup.To the Americans, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s seeming tolerance of the Islamic State militants who had established themselves in Syria was unacceptable.For Mr. Erdogan, one of the most grating grievances with the United States centers on the person he regards as the instigator of the failed coup: Fethullah Gulen, an influential Turkish cleric and former ally who lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen has denied the accusations.Frustrated by what they saw as the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to extradite Mr. Gulen, the Turkish authorities accused the United States of complicity with him. When Mr. Trump took office, there was some hope expressed by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s aides that Mr. Gulen would be extradited. But there has been no indication of any change.Yes, for a time it seemed that Mr. Trump had taken a liking to Mr. Erdogan, a strongman leader whom he praised after a NATO summit this year. But when negotiations between American and Turkish officials over Mr. Brunson\u2019s release fell through, attitudes changed.\u201cThere is that affinity Trump has with strong leaders, and Erdogan is certainly one of them,\u201d Mr. Aliriza said. \u201cBut then something snapped, and it snapped on the Brunson issue because apparently Trump thought that he had a deal with Erdogan.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s autocratic behavior is now considered by outside economists and many investors as a threat to Turkey\u2019s economy, once the envy of the region. Rapidly rising debts have fueled fears of insolvency in the country, now accelerated by a plunge in the value of the currency, the lira. Mr. Erdogan says he regards these stresses as the work of foreign conspirators.\u201cIt was benefiting from tons of money coming in. It was on the way to becoming an E.U. member. It had good relations with the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Aliriza said of Turkey. \u201cErdogan is now rejecting globalization, saying that the global economic forces that were his allies are now his enemies.\u201dMr. Erdogan remained defiant in a speech on Friday in the northern city of Bayburt, saying his government \u201cwill not lose the economic war.\u201dBut experts say he may be miscalculating the true effect of the sanctions imposed by the United States, and warn that there is nobody in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s immediate circle who dares question his judgment.\u201cEssentially you\u2019re heading for the cliff,\u201d Mr. Pierini said. \u201cThe issue now is who will be courageous enough to tell the president, \u2018This is the wrong way.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The NEG\u2019 Aims to Be Australia\u2019s Latest Energy Solution. Will It Work?", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia on Friday came one step closer to approving the National Energy Guarantee, or NEG, a contentious energy and climate policy meant to curb emissions and provide some stability to the country\u2019s volatile energy market.State energy ministers agreed to move the proposal forward, according to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s government, which announced the decision on Friday morning.The states\u2019 approval is a preliminary step that keeps the proposal alive. Before it can be approved at the federal level it must first undergo additional negotiation. Some critics, including environmentalists, have said the policy does not go far enough to combat climate change.Here\u2019s a look at the NEG and what its impact is likely to be.The NEG is a broad energy proposal that bundles two policies into one: energy reliability and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.The proposed legislation is meant to lower energy prices and increase investment in clean energy generation, including wind, solar, batteries and other renewables.Climate change targets and improved reliability have never been integrated into a single policy quite like this, which has unnerved some analysts and policymakers because there are no examples to follow.The NEG applies to the National Energy Market, a power grid that includes every region except Western Australia and the Northern Territory.Energy and climate policies in Australia have come and gone, never staying in place long enough to make a difference. In recent years, renewable energy has become cheaper and more efficient, rapidly changing the market and making stability in the grid harder to achieve.Under the framework, energy providers would have to demonstrate annually that they are meeting emissions standards.The NEG does not include carbon pricing, a proposal championed by some economists in which emissions are given a market value. Professor Frank Jotzo of Australian National University said the NEG would provide a similar financial incentive to reduce emissions, calling the mechanism a \u201ccumbersome way of achieving a very similar result.\u201dThe second part of the NEG, the reliability guarantee, is designed to encourage more energy contracting and investment to add another layer of security to the market.It is unclear if consumers will feel the change in their wallets.The government rejected a clean energy target in October on the basis that it would not do enough to lower energy prices.Greenpeace, which has said the new policy does not go far enough, has predicted that energy prices will only fall if the emissions target is more ambitious.The policy aims to reduce energy emission levels in 2030 to 26 percent below the levels recorded in 2005. That is the same target Australia set for the country in the Paris Agreement.That means all the other sources of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, including agriculture, mining and transportation, would have to make significant reductions by 2030 as well.In Western Australia, where much of Australia\u2019s mining activity takes place, no major emissions policy would be in place at all.Given the small scope of industries affected, it is unlikely Australia would meet its Paris Agreement commitment with only the NEG.States led by the opposition Labor Party have expressed concern over the proposed emissions target and the lack of a mechanism to update such targets in the future.\u201cWe want to know the arrangements will not limit any future government\u2019s mandate to change the target,\u201d Anthony Lynham, Queensland\u2019s energy minister, said in April.The Climate Council, a crowd-funded climate organization, concluded that the NEG would not do enough to tackle climate change, and that it could \u201cderail\u201d Australia\u2019s booming renewables industry.Dylan McConnell, a researcher at the Australian-German Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne, said any policy should help promote renewable energy, which he said was good for consumers and the environment.\u201cRenewable energy is pushing the economy,\u201d he said, \u201cand policy is lagging behind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chill Remains Between China and United States in Latest Trade Talks", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A restart of trade talks between the United States and China ended on Thursday with little sign of progress as Washington moved ahead with additional tariffs and President Trump met with legislators to discuss a new law aimed at curbing Chinese investment.A person familiar with the talks described them as a detailed discussion of China\u2019s policies and the difficulties facing the Chinese economy. This person described the tone of the conversations as \u201cfrank\u201d and said the team from the United States spoke with one voice. However, there were no signs of an imminent breakthrough, and no further talks have been scheduled at this time.In a statement on Thursday night, the White House reiterated the general areas of concern about the trade relationship that the Trump administration has been focused on for months.\u201cWe concluded two days of discussions with counterparts from China and exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship, including by addressing structural issues in China such as those identified in the Section 301 report,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cWe appreciated the Chinese delegation coming to the United States to participate in these meetings.\u201dAmerican negotiators focused more on asking China to make structural changes to its managed economy rather than simply purchasing American products, as had happened in some negotiating rounds in the past, another person briefed on the meeting said. But the United States and China remained far apart on a range of issues, with China complaining about United States violations of World Trade Organization rules, and the United States dismissing those concerns as irrelevant to bigger economic challenges between the countries, the person added.Many China experts and American businesses that depend on China as a source and a market for their products now say they expect relations to weaken further before a resolution is reached.\u201cThese are relatively low-level, relatively exploratory sessions,\u201d Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told reporters at an event in Kentucky on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cAnytime you have interaction, there\u2019s always some hope of some sort of progress. In terms of a big breakthrough, no, these talks are not destined as of today for a big breakthrough.\u201dChina has expressed frustration that the United States has not established a clear point person in the negotiations, which have been led by an alternating group of officials including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; Mr. Ross; and others. This week, the Treasury Department designated David Malpass, the under secretary for international affairs, to lead the discussions.While the Trump administration has outlined its broad priorities, the specifics of its demands remain murky and China continues to meet every new tariff threat with its own promise of retaliation.\u201cI\u2019m not particularly optimistic that we\u2019re going to see a deal anytime soon,\u201d said David Loevinger, the Treasury Department\u2019s senior coordinator for China from 2009 to 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s still kind of unclear what it would take for the U.S. to get to yes on a trade deal.\u201dAlso unclear is whether the tariffs and investment restrictions have done much to persuade China to make further concessions on trade, beyond its offers this year to purchase American goods and open up some markets to more foreign competition. Some Chinese officials now appear to suspect that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade plans are part of a broader effort aimed at thwarting China\u2019s rise, and that any concessions would do little to prevent what looks like an intensifying struggle for global dominance between the countries.\u201cWhen I came, we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow China to be bigger than us in a very short period of time,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen anymore.\u201dStill, there is hope on both sides that the current talks can serve as a steppingstone to more significant negotiations this year. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina in November.\u201cI don\u2019t see any breakthroughs unless the Chinese bring something completely unexpected, which seems unlikely, but these talks could be useful in setting expectations by identifying what areas are fruitful for further discussion and what ideas are nonstarters,\u201d said Christopher Adams, who had been the senior coordinator for China affairs at the Treasury Department before leaving this year.On Thursday, the president seemed content to promote his tough trade record as he met with Republican senators including John Cornyn of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Mike Crapo of Idaho and Marco Rubio of Florida.The president praised the lawmakers for passing legislation this month that would strengthen the review of foreign deals in America by an interagency group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. He also highlighted his own tariffs on China, which he said were bringing a \u201ctremendous amount of money\u201d into government coffers.\u201cThey won\u2019t be stealing our companies anymore, especially companies that are quite complex,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe will protect America\u2019s crown jewels of intellectual property and advanced technologies from harmful foreign investments.\u201dThe new investment rules, which must be put in place in the next 18 months, will allow the committee to look at a wider range of purchases, including real estate deals and those in which foreigners do not take a controlling stake of a company. The government has already started hiring new officials for those posts, a senior administration official said in a briefing call about the legislation on Thursday morning.The senior administration official added that the United States was open to engaging with China, and emphasized that Beijing must address \u201cthe fundamental concerns we have raised\u201d over their trade practices. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aiming for the Stars, and a Chunk of Rock, in Senegal", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 When Salma Sylla was a little girl, she tried to find relief from Senegal\u2019s steamy hot season by retreating to the roof of her home to sleep. Restless and overheated, she would lie awake staring at the stars.The area where she lived outside Dakar, the capital, had no electricity, and the heavens sparkled. She tried to count the stars, realizing more shone on some nights than on others.Ms. Sylla, now 37, was intrigued. But studying the stars in Senegal was not easy: High school courses were limited; libraries rarely had books on space; telescopes were few and expensive.\u201cThis is the farthest exploration of anything in space that has ever taken place, by quite a lot,\u201d said Alan Stern, project leader for NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission. \u201cWe are way, way out there.\u201dFor the scientists, coming to Senegal was a process of elimination. Most of the areas that offered the best viewing were in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The other options \u2014 in neighboring Mali, for example \u2014 were in areas patrolled by violent extremists.The countryside of Senegal is peaceful, parts of it do not have electricity, and many rural areas are sparsely populated. That was a bonus for the scientists, who wanted a clear sky, free of light. Still, Senegal was a risky proposition. The area is on the cusp of the rainy season, and cloudy skies threatened to block the event, which occurred early Saturday and lasted less than a second.Scientists are still evaluating data from the viewing, but the skies turned out to be clear and they are hopeful.Senegal was an enthusiastic host. About two dozen Senegalese astronomers and scientists, including Ms. Sylla, accompanied the New Horizons team in the field and contributed to the viewing.African countries have racked up their own space achievements. Moroccan astronomers have discovered comets, asteroids and planets outside our solar system. Ghana\u2019s first satellite is now orbiting the earth. Students in Tunisia have organized public events to observe the sky, even though they do not have an observatory.\u201cAstronomy is virtually as popular in Africa as it is everywhere in the world,\u201d said David Baratoux, the president of the African Initiative for Planetary Sciences and Space, who is based in France.The biggest hindrance is money. The United States spends more on its space program than the value of Senegal\u2019s entire economy. The 21 high-powered telescopes brought by the New Horizons team were nearly double the number of telescopes available in all of Senegal.The New Horizons team hopes that the telescopes in Senegal and a handful in Colombia, with some assistance from the Hubble Space Telescope, will answer some questions about Ultima Thule, part of the Kuiper belt, before its spacecraft arrives. Is it shaped like a potato, for instance, or is it actually two objects orbiting each other?Last week, at a late-night dress rehearsal for Saturday\u2019s viewing, Diarra Dieng, an applied physics student in Dakar, tweaked the settings on a $3,500 telescope, guided by a NASA scientist.\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d she said, as she tried to train the telescope on the correct star.Instructors at Ms. Dieng\u2019s high school in Dakar had encouraged her to pursue studies in science, but she was skeptical at first. \u201cI never knew girls could do this kind of work,\u201d she said.The New Horizons team had spread across the lawn of a conference center to work out equipment kinks ahead of the viewing. The biggest problem came when someone accidentally turned on the sprinkler system.The scientists let anyone milling about the nearby parking lot get a view of Saturn and Mars. Students who had studied astronomy through online courses joined a long line. Fathers hoisted small children to the eyepiece. The minister of higher education took a peek.\u201cMmmmm,\u201d was all one woman could say, shaking her head as if in disbelief.The higher education minister, Mary Teuw Niane, said he hoped the team\u2019s visit would foster future student collaborations with NASA.Dr. Verbiscer was 5 when a human first walked on the moon in 1969. Transfixed by the Apollo mission, she wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween. So she shopped for a costume with her mother and finally found one: It was in the boys\u2019 section.In Senegal, Ms. Sylla remembers her grandmother telling her the stars were obscured some nights to help hyena hunters go undetected. Her quest to find out what was really happening in the skies led her to persist. She cobbled together studies at Senegalese institutions and abroad.Today, Ms. Sylla is the first Ph.D. student in astronomy at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar.An earlier version of this article misidentified Senegal\u2019s higher education minister.

Idling at the currency exchange desk, he got into a conversation with an employee about whether Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, would be good for his industry. When Mr. Goodall said no and suggested that the consequences would be \u201cdisastrous,\u201d the clerk replied that everyone he asked that question \u201cgives the same answer.\u201d\u201cWell, I needed to say something,\u201d Mr. Goodall said in a recent interview.Carmakers and financial institutions, airplane manufacturers and the energy industry: All have voiced anxiety about how much negotiation remains to be done. Last month, Amazon weighed in: Doug Gurr, the company\u2019s most senior executive in Britain, warned that if the country left the European Union without negotiating a new arrangement with the bloc (the \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario), there could be civil unrest.Months after his encounter at the airport, Mr. Goodall still seems incensed. He is a realist, he said: Classical music was never going to be top of the priority list. But he felt that the arguments were being drowned out by bigger, better-funded lobbying groups.\u201cThe music business is international, and in this country we have an international reputation,\u201d Mr. Goodall said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of losing it.\u201dMichael Jay, the chairman of the committee that wrote the House of Lords report, agrees. \u201cIndividuals working in the U.K. cultural sector are highly mobile, and have thrived on collaboration with people from all over the world,\u201d he said in a statement.If British ensembles are required to organize visas for every concert in, for example, Amsterdam or Berlin, as well as licenses to travel with their instruments, they would find it harder to tour \u2014 and, given the likely costs, it would be much harder to make touring financially viable.Ms. Kani said that the Grange Park Opera was \u201cvery dependent on European singers\u201d and that British performers benefited from having to compete with musicians from abroad. \u201cIt raises everyone\u2019s game,\u201d she said.There are myriad other concerns for the sector: the fate of thousands of students from other European Union countries in British music schools, Pan-European regulations on intellectual property, and cultural funding that flows directly from the bloc\u2019s institutions. While haggling over Britain\u2019s exit continues, all those issues are up in the air.\u201cIt\u2019s a very messy situation,\u201d Mr. Goodall said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in so many industries, from pharmaceuticals to technology. And the issue is, there so few answers. No one seems to know.\u201dJohn Whittingdale, a Brexit-supporting member of Parliament and a former minister who ran the culture department, said in an interview that such anxieties were alarmist. \u201cWe have some of the best orchestras, musicians and conductors in the world, and that has nothing to do with the E.U.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns that musicians have are largely to do with the arrangements once we leave, and those will be in our gift. They will depend entirely on the immigration rules that we put in place.\u201dMr. Whittingdale added that he hoped that after Britain\u2019s exit it would be easier for performers from anywhere in the world to come to Britain \u2014 not just European Union citizens.In an interview at the Southbank Center, a London arts venue close to the offices that the European Union Youth Orchestra has recently vacated, Mr. Marcus was eager to present the ensemble\u2019s move to Italy as an opportunity rather than a retreat. But the reality was that young British instrumentalists were likely to lose out, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in our own version of a transition period, but after 2020 we\u2019ll have to see how things shake down.\u201dHe said he was also anxious that Britain would end up more isolated, culturally as well as politically. \u201cThe U.K. has a thriving cultural scene; it might not disappear overnight. But over a 50-year period, who knows?\u201dThere are signs that, amid all the other sound and fury over Brexit, politicians are starting to pay more attention to the concerns of the creative industry. The House of Lords report has brought the issue a little higher up the lawmaking agenda, though what that will mean in practice is \u2014 as with nearly everything else surrounding the issue \u2014 difficult to judge.In a statement, a spokesman for the culture ministry said, \u201cWe recognize the need for classical musicians to tour across the E.U. without prohibitive restrictions and to regularly move goods on a temporary basis.\u201dAsked about Brexit, Ruth Gibson, 32, a viola player originally from Ireland but who is now based in London, rolled her eyes. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m trying not to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re freelance musicians; more uncertainty is the last thing we need, to be honest.\u201d\u201cMusic has no borders,\u201d Ms. Gibson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The first place he should look for new revenue streams was among his fabulously wealthy oligarch cronies, opponents said.It was not clear whether the changes that Mr. Putin outlined in his speech would be sufficient to mollify widespread anger and unease.Although average pensions in Russia are fairly low, amounting to a few hundred dollars per month, many retirees survive once they are past retirement age by continuing to work in jobs like security guards. Now that extra margin will be largely eliminated.One significant concession that Mr. Putin announced was raising the retirement age for women to 60 from 55, instead of to 63. The change for men remained at 65 instead of the previous 60.In addition, Mr. Putin outlined a welter of benefits for retirees to try to cushion the blow, including subsidies for those who cannot find work after age 50, tax benefits, lower retirement ages for women with at least three children, and higher pensions in rural areas where dependence on government retirement funds is particularly high.Dmitry B. Oreshkin, a political scientist and Kremlin critic, noted that the Putin administration was trying to subsidize Crimea and the separatist republics in Ukraine as well as wage war in Syria, at a time when there are more than half as many retirees (46 million) as workers (76 million).\u201cPutin also failed to create an alternative \u2014 the economy is stagnating, and under current conditions this decision was inevitable,\u201d Mr. Oreshkin said in an interview.Mr. Putin had been trying to distance himself from the pension plan since the government announced it in June, on the day the World Cup began in Russia, apparently hoping citizens would not notice.The plan hurt his popularity anyway, and his approval rating plunged to the mid-60s from around 80 percent \u2014 its lowest level since Mr. Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.In tone and content, Mr. Putin tried to present the pension changes as a necessary step to maintain prosperity in Russia and the moment for debate passed.\u201cIt is already clear that the government will still have to do this, sooner or later,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the later we make them, the harsher these decisions will be.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko, Lincoln Pigman and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When can it be limited? Should those decisions be up to a private company at all? And if a company shies away from acting, as Facebook did with Mr. Jones until Apple moved first, where does that leave the rest of us?But to activists and officials in much of the developing world, both the problem and Facebook\u2019s muddled solutions will be old news.Before there was Alex Jones, the American conspiracy theorist, there was Amith Weerasinghe, the Sri Lankan extremist who used Facebook as his personal broadcast station.And so on.\u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t seem to get that they\u2019re the largest news agency in the world,\u201d Harindra Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan official, said a few days after Mr. Weerasinghe\u2019s arrest.The problem, he said, goes beyond a few underregulated extremists. It also involves the algorithm-driven newsfeed that is core to the company\u2019s business model. \u201cThey are blind to seeing the real repercussions,\u201d Mr. Dissanayake said of Facebook\u2019s leaders.Developing countries\u2019 experiences with Facebook suggest that the company, however noble its intent, has set in motion a series of problems we are only beginning to understand and that the company has proved unable or unwilling to fully address:\u2014 Reality-distorting misinformation that can run rampant on the newsfeed, which promotes content that will reliably engage users.\u2014 Extremism and hate speech that tap into users\u2019 darkest impulses, and polarize politics.\u2014 Malicious actors granted near-limitless reach on one of the most sophisticated communications platforms in history, relatively unchecked by social norms or traditional gatekeepers.\u2014 And a private company uneager to wade into contentious debates, much less pick winners and losers.But chillingly similar Facebook-linked problems are becoming increasingly visible in wealthy, developed countries like the United States. So is the difficulty of solving those problems \u2014 and the consequences of Facebook\u2019s preference for action that can be incremental, reactive and agonizingly slow.Though Facebook officials often portray the violence associated with it as new or impossible to predict, the incidents date to at least 2012. So does the pressure to more actively regulate speech on the platform.\u201cI think in the back deep-deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya, a senior executive who left Facebook in 2011, said at a policy conference last year. \u201cWe have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.\u201dThere were other warnings, typically from activists or civil society leaders in the developing countries where Facebook\u2019s expansion was fastest and most obviously disruptive. But they were little heeded.\u201cFacebook is the platform that we could not meet with for years,\u201d Damar Juniarto, who leads an Indonesian organization that tracks online hate groups, told me in March.Facebook representatives eventually met with Mr. Juniarto, and the company has shut most pages associated with the Muslim Cyber Army.In the developing countries where such incidents seem most common, or at least most explicitly violent, Facebook simply faces little pressure to act.In Sri Lanka, government officials spoke of the company as if it were a superpower to be feared and appeased.Even officials in India, a major power, struggled to get the company to listen. Indian pressure on Facebook, however, has dropped since the arrival of new government leaders who rose, in part, on a Hindu nationalist wave still prevalent on social media.American officials have far greater leverage over Facebook, as members of Congress proved when lawmakers summoned Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive officer, to testify in April. But the Americans seem unsure what they want Facebook to do, or how to compel it to act. So they, too, are not very effective at changing the company\u2019s behavior.More broadly, Americans seem unsure precisely how far Facebook should go in regulating speech on the platform, or what it should do about the data suggesting that misinformation is more common on the political right.All of which comes through in Facebook\u2019s hesitation about shutting down Mr. Jones\u2019 page, despite his long record of demonstrable falsehoods that have real-world consequences.American commitment to free speech is unusually tied into the country\u2019s sense of itself. Still, the dilemma here is not so different from those government officials and Facebook itself face in places like Indonesia or Sri Lanka.So while few are comfortable \u2014 perhaps Facebook least of all \u2014 with a private company acting as a vastly powerful regulator of public speech, even fewer seem willing to step in and take on the task themselves.There are growing indications Facebook\u2019s problems in rich countries may go beyond misinformation to do the kind of harm developing countries have experienced.\u201cI think it does something to their sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cThese things, if they reach thousands of people, you cannot get it back.\u201dThe platform has grown so powerful, so quickly, that we are still struggling to understand its influence. Social scientists regularly discover new ways that Facebook alters the societies where it operates: a link to hate crimes, a rise in extremism, a distortion of social norms.After all, Mr. Jones, for all his demagogic skills, was tapping into misinformation and paranoia already on the platform.In Germany, Gerhard Pauli, a state prosecutor based in Hagen, told me last month about a local firefighter trainee who had grown so fearful of refugees that he attempted to burn down a local refugee group house. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure that social media made it worse,\u201d he said.Mr. Pauli said that his office spent more and more time tracking rumors and hate speech on Facebook, and that it seemed to rise in advance of violence, as when the mayor of nearby Altena was stabbed last year.Though Germany is a major economy with some of the world\u2019s strictest social media regulations, Mr. Pauli had only somewhat more success with Facebook than his peers in the developing world.\u201cIn the beginning, they did nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You have no jurisdiction over us.\u2019 In the last few years, they are more helpful, especially in cases of child abuse.\u201dBut, in other matters, the company remains skittish, Mr. Pauli said. \u201cThey do have a lot of information, but they don\u2019t want to lose users,\u201d he said.The prosecutor has grown especially concerned, he said, about social media rumors \u2014 say, a stranger near a school \u2014 that could spin ordinarily self-contained Germans into violence. Not so unlike in Sri Lanka or India.\u201cWe have lots of situations where somebody saw somebody outside the kindergarten,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin five minutes it\u2019s spreading, and from post to post, it gets worse. It takes two hours and then you have some lynch mob on the street.\u201dAmanda Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That means American buyers could be required to pay 25 percent more for a Ming dynasty bowl sold by a British owner at an auction in New York, as well as for a painting by a young Beijing-based artist at a gallery in Hong Kong.\u201cIt will have a chilling impact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will quickly reduce the market for Chinese art in America to a backwater.\u201dProfessional organizations like the Art Dealers Association of America, the Association of Art Museum Directors and the British Antique Dealers\u2019 Association have also stated their opposition to the proposal.Peter Tompa, a lawyer based in Washington, represented two lobbying groups that work on behalf of museums, dealers and collectors at the hearings on Wednesday. Mr. Tompa said a member of the trade committee asked him one question: Since art is a luxury item, wouldn\u2019t people pay?Mr. Tompa said he had told the committee that the main problem was slow turnover of inventory in the art trade and that a tariff would mean greater capital outlays by dealers.Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and the Asia Week New York association of dealers said in a written complaint that the United States, not China, would be affected most. \u201cImposing duties on Chinese-origin art will not impact the trade practices or policies of China, since the vast majority of such artwork is imported into the United States from countries other than China,\u201d the complaint read.Dealers have pointed out that adding a 25 percent duty to the fees known as the \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d could deter both buyers and sellers of Chinese art at auctions in the United States, reversing growth in that sector.In recent years, sales of the finest Chinese antiques have been dominated by Chinese dealers and collectors. The market for international contemporary art, on the other hand, is dominated by American dealers and collectors. They are also alarmed by what the impact of a proposed tariff would be on the Chinese artists they sell.\u201cOne of the strengths of the American economy has been it\u2019s a free market for all,\u201d said Jeffrey Deitch, a leading New York dealer and curator. \u201cIt\u2019s made New York City the world capital of the art business. To jeopardize this situation could have very serious consequences.\u201dThe proposed import tariff would be determined by the \u201clocation of production, not the nationality of the person creating it,\u201d the office of the United States trade representative said in a statement emailed in response to questions. Mr. Ai\u2019s works, having been produced in Germany, would be exempt from any penalties.The situation would be different, however, for works from contemporary artists with studios in China.The show should open before any tariffs are imposed on imported artworks, but Marc Glimcher, the president and chief executive of Pace Gallery, is still concerned.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting a tariff on stocks: If the price of an item is significantly altered by a tariff, the market will look elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said.Purchases in New York are already subject to a local sales tax of nearly 9 percent, he said, adding, \u201cIf we had to raise the prices by 25 percent, it would be difficult to sell the show.\u201d\u201cAny protection of the U.S. art market will have the opposite effect,\u201d Mr. Glimcher continued. \u201cIt does nothing positive.\u201dBut the imposition of punitive import tariffs would affect more than the art market in the United States. It would also make it difficult for Chinese artists to exhibit their work, diminishing cultural exchange.\u201cIt\u2019s about more than the money,\u201d said Mr. Deitch, a former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. \u201cThis is where the consensus is reached about what art is important.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a Chinese artist,\u201d Mr. Deitch added, \u201cyou want to show your work here, you want to be in the center of the international art discourse.\u201dSo far, the Trump administration has gotten low marks for its concern for cultural matters. But, over the coming weeks, the art world says it will work to convince lawmakers that, if the United States wants to wage an economic war with China, taxing art would be a self-inflicted wound.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Monitoring Tariffs but Suggests Rate Increases Are on Track", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal Reserve officials are poised to continue gradually raising interest rates but are monitoring for signs of widespread economic fallout from President Trump\u2019s trade policies, according to minutes from the most recent Fed meeting released on Wednesday.The Fed minutes suggest that officials are concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could hurt the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of any damage in the data. Fed officials are also increasingly worried that trouble is brewing in the residential construction market, based on a recent slowdown in home building.For now, however, the Fed shows no signs of deviating from its current path to return interest rates to more historically normal levels, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s recent calls for the central bank to stop raising interest rates.Several officials hinted in the minutes that they are preparing to remove a hallmark phrase of the last decade, one that has indicated the Fed intends to provide support for the economy. Future Fed statements may no longer carry language reading \u201cthe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative\u201d as rates continue to rise toward a more historically normal level and the Fed continues to wind down its post-crisis economic stimulus.Federal Open Market Committee officials left rates unchanged after the meeting that ended Aug. 1 and laid the groundwork in their post-meeting statement to raise rates in September, the third time this year. Since mid-July, Mr. Trump has used interviews and Twitter to pressure the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to pause the pace of increases, which have left the Fed\u2019s target interest rate between 1.75 percent and 2 percent.Minutes from the meeting revealed no willingness among Fed officials to grant Mr. Trump\u2019s request. Officials \u201cindicated that information gathered since the Committee met in June had not significantly altered their outlook for the U.S. economy,\u201d the minutes reported. \u201cMany participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation.\u201dThat\u2019s Fed-speak for \u201craise interest rates again\u201d \u2014 and the minutes note that investors are overwhelmingly convinced another rate increase is coming next month.While the economic recovery is strong, the Fed minutes show that officials are cognizant of the disparity between slow growth in nominal wages and the strength of the labor market, but they remain largely convinced those gains are about to accelerate.Officials were united in their concerns over the potential of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies to crimp economic growth. Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs levied on steel and aluminum from countries including Japan, Mexico and Canada, and additional tariffs on other imported goods from China.\u201cAll participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of uncertainty and risk,\u201d the minutes reported. A prolonged trade dispute, officials said, would likely bring \u201cadverse effects on business sentiment, investment spending and employment. Moreover, wide-ranging tariff increases would also reduce the purchasing power of U.S. households,\u201d while disrupting supply chains and reducing productivity.But while companies are complaining about tariffs affecting them, the officials noted that \u201cmost businesses concerned about trade disputes had not yet cut back their capital expenditures or hiring but might do so if trade tensions were not resolved soon.\u201dOther than trade, the Fed\u2019s biggest worry about the economy wasn\u2019t inflation but residential construction. Several officials noted that new home building has slowed, possibly reflecting \u201cdeclining home affordability, higher mortgage rates, scarcity of available lots in certain cities and delays in building approvals.\u201d Some of their business contacts, officials said, had also complained of labor shortages in the construction sector \u2014 and of tariff increases pushing up their cost of materials.Officials also noted that mortgage purchases and home refinancing had also slowed. Some expressed worry over \u201cthe possibility of a significant weakening in the housing sector\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the effects of higher rates on borrowing and construction. There was no sign in the minutes that Fed officials were worried home values were in a \u201cbubble,\u201d similar to the period before the financial crisis.In other areas, Fed officials expressed more division.Some officials theorized that the slow pace of wage growth \u2014 even before accounting for inflation, which has wiped out all wage gains for nonsupervisory workers over the last year \u2014 reflected slow productivity growth or lags in companies\u2019 responses to a tight labor market, which typically pushes employers to raise salaries when competing for workers. Others said the pace of increases suggests there is still more room for unemployment to fall before it begins to push up wages more significantly. Some officials said they expected to see improvement \u201cbefore long\u201d in part because firms in their regions were beginning to report more willingness to raise pay.There are also continuing differences over the banking system and whether to push for even larger capital cushions given the robust economy. The minutes report officials argued for and against strengthening capital requirements for banks now, \u201cwhile their profits are strong and the economic outlook is favorable\u201d in order to better stabilize the financial system against an economic shock.Advertisement"}

On Monday, the day the new economic plan was rolled out, streets were quiet and most shops were closed, as Mr. Maduro had decreed a national holiday. But most remained closed on Tuesday as shopkeepers tried to understand how to reset prices in the new currency and buyers struggled to make the conversion.Rosa Pe\u00f1a walked into a small shoe shop that was open in the low-income neighborhood of Petare, in Caracas, to look for flip-flops for her granddaughter. She brought a cellphone, which she borrowed from her daughter, to calculate what she would pay for the shoes in the new currency and to compare that with what she would have paid in the old, familiar one.Even with the help of a conversion app for the two currencies, she couldn\u2019t grasp what the new price meant.\u201cI can\u2019t even understand these numbers,\u201d Mrs. Pe\u00f1a said, holding up the phone. \u201cMy daughter gave me this, and she showed me how to use it, but we can\u2019t understand when we convert big amounts.\u201dThe new plan also introduced an increase in the minimum wage of more than 3,000 percent, which many business owners said they could not afford, leaving employees afraid for their jobs.\u201cWe are waiting for the store owner to tell us what he is going to do with us,\u201d said Marietta Guerrero, the manager of one of the few shops that opened in Caracas on Tuesday.As she wrote receipts with a black marker, waiting for the cash machines to be adjusted to the new currency, she explained that after only one month at her job, she is scared she might get fired.\u201cNo one here can afford an employee,\u201d she said, before helping a customer who could not figure out if she had enough of the new currency to make a purchase.It was not clear on Tuesday how many businesses were closed in response to the opposition\u2019s initiative and how many were waiting for clarity on the meaning of the new rules.Andr\u00e9s Vel\u00e1squez, an opposition leader, said the question of why the population was staying home was not relevant. The chaos created by the new measures was evident, he said.\u201cThe answer is there for the world to see,\u201d he said.For Henkel Garc\u00eda, a Venezuelan economist, Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan has brought more questions than answers so far.\u201cPeople are cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cMost businesses did not open not only because of the strike, but also because they\u2019re waiting for more information to see if they are going to keep operating or not.\u201dVenezuelans who could not stay home did what they could to cope with their new reality. In a Pdvsa gas station, Ren\u00e9 Manzanilla taught his co-workers the difference between one currency and the other.\u201cRemember, you can\u2019t receive 500 bol\u00edvar bills, those are not going to work,\u201d he said.\u201cBut how much is 500?\u201d another worker asked.Mr. Manzanilla was silent for a moment.\u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201cI am confused.

He opens his Uber app and in London, a curtain opens.At the Victoria and Albert Museum here Mr. Idrissa\u2019s sleep and app-use habits are on display, in a collaborative piece he created with the artist Miranda July called \u201cI\u2019m the President, Baby.\u201d Mr. Idrissa is a Los Angeles-based Uber driver who came to the United States from Niger. He suffers from persistent insomnia. The work charts his sleep habits and his use of the apps WhatsApp, Uber and Instagram in real-time for viewers in London. Each of the four curtains is linked to a specific action: When Mr. Idrissa wakes up or opens an app, a set of curtains open; when he closes an app, or goes to sleep, another set closes.The piece is part of the show \u201cThe Future Starts Here,\u201d running through Nov. 4. The show assembles objects \u2014 some prototypes of advanced technology, some so familiar they may seem old-fashioned \u2014 and artworks that serve as starting points for imagining possible futures and examining the complexities of modern life.Sit down at a table for one, with a bottle of the meal-replacement drink Soylent, in a recreation of a Dutch restaurant for solo diners. Marvel at the models of planned floating cities, or a 13-year-old\u2019s vision of a rebuilt Aleppo. Pick up a book from a library curated for the end of civilization, and read.Alongside these there are works of art, like Ms. July and Mr. Idrissa\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m the President, Baby\u201d is a lens into issues of migration, app-based communication, the gig economy, surveillance, social media and privacy \u2014 all that from four sets of elegant curtains, opening and closing on a museum wall.Mr. Idrissa said his insomnia started in about 2006. He came to the United States on a student visa, which expired. \u201cI was supposed to be deported, and they sent me a letter,\u201d Mr. Idrissa said in a recent interview. He said that one day the immigration authorities \u201ccame to my door at 4 or 5 in the morning and the lady there wouldn\u2019t let them in. So there were three or four years of just hiding, and I sleep only a couple hours a night.\u201d Now, Mr. Idrissa is a citizen of the United States, but the insomnia hasn\u2019t left. He says he often spends hours awake on his bed, scrolling through apps.\u201cI remember I told him about the trauma of the birth of my child,\u201d Ms. July said. \u201cI had this rough, rough birth, and I was really quite sad. We were both talking about a trauma that wasn\u2019t really leaving our bodies.\u201d She said the conversation stayed with her, and that when she was commissioned to make a work for the Victoria and Albert show she thought of Mr. Idrissa. He agreed to work on it with her, despite Ms. July\u2019s initial concern that the project was too invasive.\u201cIt\u2019s making something into a civilized object that\u2019s also kind of a distressing feeling potentially, or at least unsettling,\u201d Ms. July said.Many of the objects and artworks in the \u201cThe Future Starts Here\u201d could be described that way. The show is sprawling, overwhelming, awash with screen-light. The half-familiar automated sounds of Siri and Alexa\u2019s voices pulsate on repeat in parts of the gallery, along with the buzz of futuristic music. The exhibition itself is beautifully housed and designed, in bright neon and pastel colors. It\u2019s divided into four thematic areas \u2014 Self, Public, Planet and Afterlife \u2014 though these arenas feel porous.The exhibition\u2019s co-curator Rory Hyde said that he wasn\u2019t sure the museum could have done the show five years ago, when digitization seemed to sound the death knell for physical objects.\u201cBut objects are relevant again,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you think about the self-driving car, or Facebook\u2019s aircraft. Even the tech companies are moving back into physical engineering.\u201dMariana Pestana, the show\u2019s other co-curator said: \u201cObjects have this incredible capacity to embody visions. We think of these objects as beginnings that open up a set of possibilities.\u201dTo walk into the show is to be confronted by big questions in all-caps text: \u201cWHAT MAKES US HUMAN?\u201d \u201cIS EDWARD SNOWDEN A HERO OR A TRAITOR?\u201d \u201cWE ARE ALL CONNECTED, BUT DO WE FEEL LONELY?\u201d The wall text explores nightmare scenarios and seeks to maintain optimism, often at the same time. The questions present an alternative to tech evangelism and extreme pessimism, but sometimes as a framing device they can feel didactic.The effect, though, is to make us realize how little we know the answers to these questions, and how uncertain we are about what the world will look like in five years, much less 50. The objects succeed in imbuing their own wonder and terror.There are some historical objects in the show as well \u2014 an early home telephone and a celestial globe from around 1627 \u2014 that allow viewers to consider just how much and how rapidly society and the objects in it have changed. A scarf that reads \u201cVotes for Women\u201d reminds us that 2018 is the centennial of women\u2019s right to vote in Britain.\u201cWe\u2019re now at the centenary of the first women\u2019s vote in the U.K.,\u201d Ms. Pestana said. \u201cA hundred years ago this idea that women could vote was a radical idea, and not a plausible future. Nowadays it\u2019s something of the norm, at least in the West, so we wanted to use this object to consider that some of the ideas in the show, even if they seem radical and implausible, maybe they\u2019re not, maybe they can be the future.\u201dPerhaps the most moving parts of the show are the artistic works, like Ms. July and Mr. Idrissa\u2019s, that respond in some way to the too-much-ness of contemporary and future life. They\u2019re interspersed throughout the show, among the objects themselves.Almost easy to miss, tucked next to a splashy flier that reads, \u201cCampaign to Stop Killer Robots,\u201d is a stuffed panda. You might walk right past it, or take it for another version of the cuddle-you-to-sleep robot seal.It\u2019s actually part of Ai Weiwei and Jacob Appelbaum\u2019s 2015 work, \u201cPanda to Panda.\u201d The panda is stuffed with shredded government documents and a memory card containing information leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. A series of these pandas were sent to dissidents around the world, creating what Mr. Appelbaum called a \u201cdistributed backup\u201d of the politically sensitive documents they had published. \u201cPanda to Panda\u201d is also an art piece about subverting state power, surveillance, and secrets. This particular panda, the wall text notes, is on loan from Julian Assange.\u201cThe safest place to put these things is in a museum, a gallery, where it\u2019s protected as an object,\u201d Mr. Appelbaum said, in a video about the piece.And there it sits, an object among the other objects \u2014 simultaneously a piece of art, a thing, a part of history and a harbinger of possible futures.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Claims Election Night Credit. It\u2019s Not That Simple.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisBut the presidential braggadocio that followed Tuesday\u2019s election night squeakers ignores another reality that the White House is loath to acknowledge: Mr. Trump \u2014 and his chaotic, controversy-laden tenure in the Oval Office \u2014 is largely responsible for the toxic political climate that is undermining the Republican candidates he is trying to save.Economic growth topped 4 percent earlier this year. Unemployment is low; stock prices are high. Yet Republicans speak darkly of the awful environment their candidates face in midterm elections 90 days away.\u201cTrump injects a certain level of uncertainty and chaos into these races,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a veteran Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee. \u201cThere is no doubt that Trump is actually increasing Democrat turnout.\u201dThe president appears to exist in a sunny political environment all his own. In a late-night tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump bragged about \u201ca big turn for the better\u201d in Mr. Balderson\u2019s campaign after the president held a boisterous get-out-the-vote rally in Ohio on Saturday night. On Wednesday morning, he crowed that Republicans went \u201c5 for 5\u201d in races on Tuesday and predicted that whenever he campaigns for candidates, \u201cthey will win!\u201d\u201cAs long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win! I LOVE the people, & they certainly seem to like the job I\u2019m doing. If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave!\u201d he boasted Wednesday on Twitter.It is impossible to know for sure the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s last-minute help in an Ohio district that Republicans should have won easily. The president could be right that he lifted turnout among Mr. Balderson\u2019s supporters just enough to secure the win, if and when it is declared. Or it\u2019s possible that his rally did nothing much \u2014 polls ahead of Election Day suggested a one-point race, which is about where it ended up.Nor is it possible to gauge the impact of a late-tweeted endorsement of Mr. Kobach, the divisive Kansas secretary of state who headed the president\u2019s voter integrity commission before challenging the sitting Republican governor.The president\u2019s political advisers said internal polling in Mr. Balderson\u2019s race showed him trailing, and turned around only after Vice President Mike Pence visited and the president held the last-minute rally. They noted that far more Democrats were voting early than Republicans in Ohio until those White House visits.But Republican and Democratic strategists alike said Mr. Trump\u2019s low approval ratings and his lack of a disciplined message about the booming economy had harmed Republican candidates in general this year.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has escalated trade wars with China and the United States\u2019 European allies, complained repeatedly about the investigation into Russian election interference, caused a border crisis by separating migrant families, attacked the N.B.A.\u2019s most popular star and praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster, said the president was \u201cunmistakably the most powerful, influential person\u201d among his loyal supporters. He can make a difference in close races by generating enthusiasm in his political base ahead of Election Day.But Mr. Luntz said that scores of Republican candidates are facing a disastrous election season in which independent voters are leaning heavily toward the Democratic Party and away from Mr. Trump \u2014 and Democrats are at least as energized by Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement as Republicans.He said the president was fooling himself if he thought the Balderson race in Ohio, which remained too close to call on Wednesday, was a victory for the party.\u201cThat district has been Republican in 48 out of 50 years,\u201d Mr. Luntz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a wake-up call. That\u2019s a hit in the head with a baseball bat.\u201dThat is a point Democrats hammered home on Wednesday.\u201cLast night proved Democrats can close the gap anywhere, even in the reddest districts,\u201d said Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf we\u2019re keeping it this close in this district now, it\u2019s a good sign for our chances across the country this November.\u201dThe president \u2014 no surprise \u2014 sees it differently.In his day-after tweets, Mr. Trump assailed what he called the \u201cFake News Media\u201d for refusing to give him credit for a successful season of special elections and primaries. If you listened to the press, he said, \u201cyou would think we are being clobbered.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t they play it straight, so unfair to the Republican Party and in particular, your favorite President!\u201d he continued.The president also claimed that his popularity with \u201cthe people\u201d would help the Republican Party in the fall. In fact, Mr. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating \u2014 which has hovered in the low 40 percent range for months \u2014 is among the worst of the last nine presidents for this point in his tenure.John McLaughlin, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pollster and still does polling work for the White House, said Republican candidates needed to do more than just invite the president for a last-minute rally. He said they needed to more fully embrace the president\u2019s agenda if they wanted to win.Mr. McLaughlin noted that more than 205,000 people who live in Mr. Balderson\u2019s district voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 \u2014 more than twice the number of Republicans who voted for Mr. Balderson on Tuesday. Mr. McLaughlin calls the difference the Trump Voter Deficit.\u201cTrump basically bailed out the G.O.P. establishment. They were losing until he got into the race,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said. He said Republican leaders in Washington had done too much to resist Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on trade, immigration and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\u201cYou need to act,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said. \u201cYou need to pass his agenda. You need to fight for his agenda.\u201dBut many strategists say it is not that simple. While he remains exceedingly popular among self-described Republicans, that universe is shrinking, and Mr. Trump is making choices that complicate the party\u2019s overall hopes of remaining in the majority after November\u2019s elections.In addition to an agenda that has turned off many independents, Mr. Trump is complicating individual races by breaking from precedent and taking sides in contested primaries. In governors\u2019 races in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Kansas, the president intervened to lift his preferred candidates and effectively handed the Republican Governors Association the bill.With hard-line candidates winning nominations thanks to Mr. Trump, general elections could prove more difficult for Republicans. And it will be up to the governors association to prop up the candidates the president effectively crowned.For some of the races \u2014 even ones in which Mr. Trump helped recruit the candidate \u2014 the best bet for Republicans may be to keep voters\u2019 attention focused more on local issues and less on the swirl of national politics in Washington.\u201cYou need to try to localize these races and run them where it becomes not a referendum on Trump\u2019s favorability, but a test of candidate strength,\u201d Mr. Madden said. \u201cTrump is a double-edged sword.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Because Alibaba has given some employees awards based on Ant shares, the group\u2019s compensation expenses grew sizably.Had that not been the case, the company said, profits would have grown by more than a third.Alibaba is already among the world\u2019s largest and most influential forces in digital retail. But it is setting its sights on providing technology to enable all commerce, whether online or off, along with logistics and marketing. Thursday\u2019s strong results suggest that the company\u2019s empire building has not harmed the current core of its business: selling ads to the merchants on its shopping platforms.\u201cThis model is kind of unique,\u201d said Jialong Shi, an analyst in Hong Kong with the investment bank Nomura. \u201cIf the macro slowdown is to take a toll on the overall retail business, Alibaba should, on the back of this unique marketplace model, fare relatively better.\u201dJD.com, the Chinese e-retailer and Alibaba rival, has had a similarly rough year. Investor skepticism also has not spared a swath of smaller Chinese names, in businesses from e-books to gadgets.The more different realms of consumer life in which Alibaba has a hand, the more data it can amass on how consumers spend, and on what they want. That makes Alibaba\u2019s platforms more useful to vendors, which in turn helps the company sell more ads and services to those merchants.But all that spending for the future has eaten somewhat into Alibaba\u2019s profits in the present. And the uncertainty confronting China\u2019s economy could still mean that the company\u2019s sales growth hits stumbles.A far greater value of merchandise is still sold on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao platform than on Pinduoduo, and Taobao still has many more merchants. But Steven Zhu, an analyst with the research firm Pacific Epoch, said surveys of merchants and conversations with industry insiders had led him to believe that many of Pinduoduo\u2019s more than one million merchants were also on Taobao.That suggests that these vendors might shift their energies this year to selling wares on the newer, hotter platform.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, I think Pinduoduo still has issues,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. But for Alibaba, he said, Pinduoduo\u2019s size \u201cis something that you cannot ignore at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201dTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plunge in Lira, Turkey\u2019s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkey\u2019s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets. Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns. But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes. A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.After the Turkish lira fell even further \u2014 one dollar bought 3.8 liras at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was worth 7.2 liras \u2014 investors dumped other emerging-market currencies. The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand lost 2 percent after falling nearly 6 percent last week.Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping nearly 2 percent during the day. European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lagged for much of the day, and closed down 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent.\u201cTurkey\u2019s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country \u2014 in this case, Turkey \u2014 can quickly spread to other regions.Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country\u2019s prospects. Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank\u2019s independence.Normally, a country in Turkey\u2019s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency\u2019s slide. But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.\u201cIn the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as \u2018risk off\u2019 toward emerging markets,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.But \u201cTurkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.\u201dBut it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already at 17.75 percent. Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.\u201cDo not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists\u2019 and merchants\u2019 responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C.\u201dYet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey\u2019s interior ministry had opened investigations into 346 social media accounts officials said had helped \u201cmanipulate perceptions\u201d about the lira.Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.\u201cThe catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade,\u201d said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING. \u201cThis is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it\u2019s a pretty toxic environment.\u201dChina\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday. The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi by 0.34 percent against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level in 15 months.China\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 2 percent at one point on Monday, but it closed down 0.3 percent. The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index fell 2 percent. Stocks in Seoul fell 1.5 percent. A broad index of Europe\u2019s biggest companies was down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading.A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet. Turkey\u2019s economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned, but I wouldn\u2019t be pressing the panic button,\u201d the economist, Xu Sitao, said.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Ms. Perelman runs the cooking blog Smitten Kitchen.First of all, those tomatoes are often staggeringly expensive, as they should be. Farming is brutally hard work. And the results are highly unpredictable, I\u2019ve found in my few failed stints as a Gentlewoman Balcony Farmer. In a city where rents have never been higher, groceries also cost huge chunks of money. As long you can buy five dumplings in Chinatown for $1.25 \u2014 forever, I hope \u2014 it\u2019s never going to be purely economical to cook at home.And what kind of monster wants to turn on an oven in August, anyway?

And when we get home, we\u2019re more exhausted than ever. Netflix, not a sink full of dishes, beckons.Restaurant delivery is a glorious thing. Everything goes in the trash chute and you have zero dishes to wash. (Unless you\u2019re the kind of civilized person who transfers takeout to plates, in which case, warmly, I believe you\u2019ve brought these problems on yourself.)Even good recipes lie. The yields are often bananas. The cooking times are always dubious, too. A \u201c20-minute recipe\u201d seems to take me, on average, about 75 minutes. But everyone knows that cooking is really the least of the hurdles. Creating a meal alone \u2014 schlepping groceries, doing all the prep, all the dishes, and being stuck with days of leftovers \u2014 can feel like an education in why you should definitely not do that again anytime soon.Obstacles to cooking can come from inside the house, too. Any of the spouses, partners or roommates we have invited into our lives can come home any day and tell us that he or she has adopted a new diet and can no longer eat whatever you just unpacked from the grocery store or love the most.Let\u2019s say you and this spouse or partner have worked out your mixed-dietary relationship and decide to build a mixed-dietary family? Adding more humans to your life means you will have to prepare food with more urgency, thus eliminating the joy it brings you. Maybe you have one of those types of kids who willingly eats kale. Enjoy your good luck, but keep this to yourself. You\u2019ve beaten the odds and it\u2019s impolite to brag. Most parents are mired in a daily battle against young people with untenable demands for a steady diet of macaroni and cheese and halved grapes.We\u2019re in a time when there is such fandom, such fervor over cooking. But those high-speed hands-and-pans videos only remind me of what a slow, inefficient cook I am. Instagram pictures of flawlessly styled plates of food make even my most successful attempts at home look flat. Professional chefs show off elaborate recipes in cookbooks. Sometimes the most sensible act of rebellion tastes like a bowl of popcorn.I am supposed to say: You should cook anyway. Because it\u2019s the right thing to do, we\u2019ve been told ad infinitum. But I don\u2019t want to. There are enough people lining up, eager to lecture or cast a side-eye at your bowl of popcorn. Here\u2019s why I cook:I like the way that closely following a recipe can alleviate pressure after a long day of having to make all the decisions.I love how a dish that worked, or a meal that everyone liked, has the power to change my day.I like that pulling off a good meal when you least expect it is the fastest way to feel victorious, even when real life does not. I like the way that, even when I\u2019m standing over the stove, cursing the recipe writer who suggested that onions might caramelize in 10 minutes, I\u2019m totally absorbed. I\u2019m not on group texts. I\u2019m not following the outrage of the moment on Twitter. I\u2019m getting a brief, needed respite and refuel from fretting over our democracy or forcibly separated families or any of the other horrible things humans do to one another. This thing \u2014 focus, concentration, a goal and the reward of something delicious I get to devour \u2014 is so rare in my day-to-day life, I\u2019ll take it when I can. And if someone wants to do the dishes or schlep the groceries, or can give me their word that the recipe contains no surprises, I might do it again tomorrow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some States Sitting on Piles of Cash, and Cities Want a Cut ", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStates like Ohio are placing their surpluses in rainy-day funds, but cities that have suffered because of cuts since the recession say it is time to loosen up. LORAIN, Ohio \u2014 Welcome to Lorain, where the mayor, Chase Ritenauer, would like to show you around.The police car over there? It broke down during a pursuit not long ago, leaving the officer to continue the chase on foot. The new high school? It is part of a school system so badly underfunded that it is now overseen by the state. Traffic signals are kept operating with parts recycled from discarded traffic lights.This city of 63,000 is in such dire financial straits that it has ceded part of an administrative building to raccoons; repeatedly calling the exterminator was too costly.But even as Lorain and many other Ohio cities are barely scraping by, the state government is flush with money.Ohio announced a budget surplus of $657 million in July. State officials have made it clear, however, that none of the windfall will go to Lorain or any other city or town, many of which are struggling because of heavy cuts made by the state over the years.What\u2019s happening in this political swing state offers a snapshot of what is playing out across the country. As states reap the benefits of an expanding national economy, at least 39 have reported budget surpluses \u2014 leaving joyous but somewhat perplexed state officials to figure out what to do with the unexpected cash. Last year, 17 states had surpluses, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.But state finances have changed so precipitously since the Great Recession more than a decade ago that there is a general wariness about what might come next. Many state officials have been reluctant to increase spending. Still, the combination of a surplus and fresh revenue means that states that had endured years of involuntary frugality are virtually swimming in cash.Notably, West Virginia concluded a budget cycle with a surplus \u2014 without having to resort to midyear budget cuts \u2014 for the first time in six years. California, with a $9 billion surplus, sent about $6 billion to its rainy-day fund. Virginia, which had a $551 million surplus, placed all of it in reserve. And more than three-quarters of Maine\u2019s $101 million surplus was set aside.In Ohio, the decision about whether to spend money on pressing needs or stash it away has largely fallen along ideological lines. Republicans have tended to favor building Ohio\u2019s reserves, while Democrats have supported using the money to address more immediate needs, including a devastating opioid crisis, a decaying infrastructure and overwhelmed police departments.Supporters of spending the money say Ohio\u2019s cities have sacrificed mightily in the last decade, and it is time for payback.\u201cYou point to this account and say we are successful, but we are not successful if people are suffering,\u201d said Nickie J. Antonio, a member of the state\u2019s House of Representatives. \u201cYou are not successful if you are balancing that bank account on the backs of people.\u201dIn Lorain, Mr. Ritenauer agrees. He said things are plenty bad, right now. \u201cIt\u2019s raining in a lot of communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to tread water.\u201dOhio has been on a financial roller coaster in the last decade. There have been deep budget cuts since the recession, and only last year, budget officials were predicting a $1 billion deficit before a surge of tax revenue changed everything.The governor, John Kasich, said state officials like himself were simply being prudent \u2014 the consequence of bitter lessons learned from the recession, when state governments amassed $117 billion in deficits in 2009 alone.Saving money in good times, he said, \u201cgives you an opportunity not to be in a panic\u201d if things go sour.Ohio had a projected shortfall of $7.7 billion in 2011 when Mr. Kasich took office, with just 89 cents in its rainy-day fund. \u201cWe were way in the hole,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cAnd I look at the breadth and the depth and the scale of the change, and it\u2019s stunning to me.\u201dUnlike Ohio, some states have used portions of their surpluses to make up for past cuts. California, for example, spent large amounts on needs that it deemed pressing and on people and projects that suffered during the recession. Programs for homeless people, schools, universities, road and bridge repairs, reducing carbon pollution, and even pothole filling all received significant funding.Budget watchdogs say that as a rule, despite the nation being in the midst of its second-longest period of economic expansion, state governments are wise to save.\u201cWe\u2019ve learned our lessons over the last two or three recessions,\u201d said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. \u201cThe economy goes up, it goes down. There has been a lot of pressure on governors to put money away.\u201dIn Ohio, where the poverty rate of 14.6 percent is higher than the national average, complaints about the governor\u2019s miserly spending have been especially loud.Cities say significantly less revenue from property taxes and the state\u2019s repeal of the estate tax have also hurt their ability to balance budgets.In Middletown, a city of 48,000 in southwestern Ohio, Mayor Larry Mulligan Jr. said the city had lost 10 percent of its revenue because the state reduced or eliminated taxes and imposed funding cuts.Middletown has laid off firefighters, canceled Fourth of July fireworks, and sharply reduced services, Mr. Mulligan said.Potholes abound. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to keep up the major thoroughfares, but there are sections that are pretty bad,\u201d he said.He said he had proposed a quarter percent income tax increase this year to generate $3 million a year to repair roads.But the City Council balked, and he said he did not press the issue because Middletown has already established a tax to help fund public safety and increased a number of its municipal fees to maintain services.\u201cLooking at the large surplus,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s time to talk about the critical needs of the cities.\u201dMr. Kasich however, disputes that his tax and funding cuts have caused widespread pain.\u201cWe have a constant whining from local governments,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want handouts. They want it to be easy.\u201dMr. Ritenauer of Lorain, an industrial city along Lake Erie, said his goal was simply to carry out basic responsibilities \u2014 like providing adequate police protection.The police force, he said, is far below its authorized strength, and there are sometimes too few patrol cars in decent repair to cover the city. A few years ago, the police car leading the Memorial Day parade stalled and had to be towed.Signs of breakdown are everywhere: The heavy steel door that secures the indoor garage where many city vehicles are parked is broken and can only be pulled open or closed with a heavy rope.It hardly matters, a city employee said, gesturing to a hole in the side of the building that was large enough to drive a car through.Even the roof of the city\u2019s aging road salt depot has caved in. For now, it has been patched with plywood boards. But the company that delivers the salt will no longer place it inside the depot out of fear that the roof will collapse entirely.\u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating job,\u201d Mr. Ritenauer said. \u201cEspecially when you don\u2019t have the resources to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Protests Pop Up Across Iran, Fueled by Daily Dissatisfaction", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTEHRAN \u2014 Across Iran\u2019s heartland, from the sweltering heat of its southern cities to the bustling capital, protesters have taken to the streets with increasing intensity in recent months, much to the satisfaction of the Trump administration, which is hoping the civil unrest will put pressure on Iranian leaders.Some demonstrations \u2014 about the weak economy, strict Islamic rules, water shortages, religious disputes, local grievances \u2014 have turned deadly. The protesters have shouted harsh slogans against clerical leaders and their policies. The events are broadly shared on social media and on the dozens of Persian language satellite channels beaming into the Islamic republic.On Thursday, protests were held in the cities of Arak, Isfahan, Karaj and Shiraz, as people \u2014 in numbers ranging in the hundreds, perhaps more \u2014 took to the streets, chanting slogans like \u201cdeath to high prices,\u201d but also criticizing top officials. A smaller protest was held in Tehran, where some people were arrested, according to videos taken at the scene.In the city of Eshtehard, west of the capital, protesters attacked a religious school on Thursday, forcing 500 clerics in training to flee, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.Truck drivers who went on strike in May for higher wages restarted their strike last week. The strike has affected fuel deliveries, leaving some gasoline stations empty in parts of the country, including Caspian Sea areas north of Tehran.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who supported the nuclear agreement, is under fire not only from hard-liners but also from the Iranians who voted for him \u2014 the vast middle class. Both groups say his economic policies have failed.The demonstrations began after a week of unprecedented nationwide protests in January. In more than 80 cities, including Tehran, people took to the streets with economic demands and calls for more freedoms. In total, 25 people were killed and more than 4,000 were arrested.The protests over the past six months have been relatively isolated, sporadic, scattered and much smaller than the antigovernment demonstrations in 2009, when millions took to the streets. But they reflect a common theme of rising dissatisfaction, many say.Activists critical of the government concede the demonstrations do not threaten Iran\u2019s leadership. Security forces, mindful of the 2009 upheavals, are now much better equipped to crush any organized antigovernment demonstrations. The protesters share neither unifying leadership nor clear agenda.While many members of the large middle class are unhappy, they mostly watch from the sidelines, adverse to uncertainty.\u201cThere is no vision, no leadership, and the protests will not lead to any chain reaction across the country, at this point,\u201d said Bahman Amoei, a well-known political activist who has spent several stints in jail for his activities.\u201cI have to admit that the state, its security and propaganda machine, is capable of engineering public opinion very successfully and persuade the wider populace that the status quo is in their favor and change will be too costly,\u201d he said.However, for the country of 80 million, long one of the calmest in the Middle East, the growing list of demonstrations and strikes is remarkable.There also have been strikes, most notably in the Kurdish regions, where bazaars closed in April to protest restrictions on border trade. Truckers went on strike the following month. In the city of Kazeroun, two people were killed in clashes over plans to redraw its borders.Videos show that some protesters have gone well beyond strictly economic grievances to challenge Iran\u2019s foreign policy and religious rules. Secular protest slogans aimed at Iran\u2019s leadership also criticize its support for Syria and groups in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon. Often protesters evoke the name of Reza Shah, an authoritarian who industrialized Iran at the beginning of the century, with a very firm hand. In Khorramshahr, videos showed protesters shouting: \u201cYou have plundered us in the name of religion.\u201dBecause of travel restrictions placed on foreign reporters, it is hard to determine the scope of demonstrations and clashes around the country.Interviews with protesters in Tehran suggest they are exasperated with what many view as the government\u2019s economic incompetence and corruption. One said that he felt as if his life were shrinking by the day and simply could not take it anymore.\u201cWe had been given bad news for days, our hearts were full of anger,\u201d said the protester, Hassan Seyedi, a broker at the Alaedine electronics bazaar in Tehran.\u201cWe filmed and took selfies; the second day we went out again,\u201d Mr. Seyedi said. But now his was back in his small shop, where he pays a monthly rent of more than $3,100. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to protest too long,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make any money I can.\u201dThe protests have compounded the increasingly dire predicament that Iran\u2019s leaders face as they prepare to deal with the restored American sanctions. Foreign investors are leaving the country, and the Iranian government, anticipating less oil income, has tightened the use of foreign currency. That move has accelerated the decline in the rial, driving anger that seems more aimed at Iran\u2019s leaders than the United States.Hard-liners have consistently played down the protests. \u201cAround a hundred people take to the streets in cities populated by five million people,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst. He accused Iran\u2019s enemies, most notably the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel, of helping foreign based opposition groups. \u201cForeign powers are seeking to seize upon our economical problems and create unrest.\u201dIran\u2019s leaders are struggling to come up with new solutions to keep their country running. Instead, factional feuds are leading to daily accusations of corruption and decadence.Last month a website linked to a former presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, who has been under house arrest since 2011, alleged that Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a hero of the hard-liners, was part of a mafia importing cars. Hard-line news outlets criticized photographs of Mr. Rouhani wearing foreign brands. Beyond the accusations, no one seems to have a solution.\u201cThere is incompetence on all levels,\u201d said Hojjat Kalashi, a sociologist who has been banned from leaving the country because of his writings. \u201cOur officials keep on hoping for some form of an international breakthrough, a deal that will solve everything, but in reality they have no strategy.\u201dAt Tehran\u2019s Grand Bazaar, things were back to normal after the protests and strike last month. In the gold trading area, one merchant, Mostafa Arabzadeh, admitted that he had also closed his shop. \u201cTo protect my valuables,\u201d he said.Mr. Arabzadeh said he disliked the protesters and felt they were playing into the hands of Iran\u2019s enemies. \u201cPeople that are angry forget we have one thing the rest of the region doesn\u2019t have: peace and stability,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe should cherish that.\u201dBut many agreed that the protests and the strikes would continue in one form or another. \u201cPeople are no longer afraid to show their dissatisfaction,\u201d said Abolghasem Golbaf, a publisher.When schools reopen after the summer break, Mr. Golbaf said, students and professors would very likely join the demonstrations, possibly presenting a new challenge to security forces. \u201cPeople want their voices heard,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Superstar Firms and Amazon Effects Reshaping the Economy? ", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe biggest companies may be influencing things like inflation and wage growth, possibly at the expense of central bankers\u2019 power to do so.JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 Two of the most important economic facts of the last few decades are that more industries are being dominated by a handful of extraordinarily successful companies and that wages, inflation and growth have remained stubbornly low. Many of the world\u2019s most powerful economic policymakers are now taking seriously the possibility that the first of those facts is a cause of the second \u2014 and that the growing concentration of corporate power has confounded the efforts of central banks to keep economies healthy. Mainstream economists are discussing questions like whether \u201cmonopsony\u201d \u2014 the outsize power of a few consolidated employers \u2014 is part of the problem of low wage growth. They are looking at whether the \u201csuperstar firms\u201d that dominate many leading industries are responsible for sluggish investment spending. And they\u2019re exploring whether there is an \u201cAmazon Effect\u201d in which fast-changing pricing algorithms by the online retailer and its rivals mean bigger swings in inflation. If not yet fully embraced, the ideas have become prominent enough that this weekend, at an annual symposium in the Grand Tetons, leaders of the Federal Reserve and other central banks discussed whether corporate consolidation might have broad implications for economic policy.Central bankers tend not to chase the latest research fads, as Mr. Furman put it. But they, too, are wrestling more intensely with the possibility that the details of how companies compete and exert power matter a great deal for the overall well-being of the economy.While these topics more commonly show up in debates around antitrust policy or how the labor market is regulated, it may have implications for the work of central banks as well. For example, if concentrated corporate power is depressing wage growth, the Fed may be able to keep interest rates lower for longer without inflation breaking out. If online retail makes prices jump around more than they once did, policymakers should be more reluctant to make abrupt policy changes based on short-term swings in consumer prices.Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the host of the conference, has been intrigued by the weak lending to small and midsize businesses in recent years, even amid an economic recovery. She and her staff have explored whether the increasing concentration of the banking industry among a handful of giants might be a cause.\u201cLooking at the size and footprint of firms has not been mainstream,\u201d Ms. George said, \u201cbut it appears to be very broad-based and a signal of something worth taking seriously.\u201dBanks are generally disinclined to treat intellectual property or other intangible items as collateral against loans, which could mean interest rate cuts by a central bank have less power to generate increased investment spending.When workers have few potential employers to choose from, he said, they may have less ability to demand higher pay, and it becomes easier for employers to collude to restrict pay, whether through explicit back-room deals or more subtle signaling.But he said monetary policy might have some power to reduce that effect. By keeping interest rates low and allowing the labor market to strengthen, employers may eventually find they have no choice but to increase worker pay. \u201cAllowing the labor market to run hotter than otherwise could possibly cause collusion to break down,\u201d Mr. Krueger said. \u201cIf the collusion does wither, wages and employment would rise.\u201dPhysical retailers tend to be slow to change prices because of some temporary disturbance, like a spike in the value of the dollar or a fall in gasoline prices. But online retailers are able to reflect changing prices almost instantly.\u201cThe implication is that retail prices are becoming less \u2018insulated\u2019 from these common nationwide shocks,\u201d Mr. Cavallo wrote. \u201cFuel prices, exchange-rate fluctuations or any other force affecting costs that may enter the pricing algorithms used by these firms are more likely to have a faster and larger impact on retail prices than in the past.\u201dIt\u2019s hardly the case that central bankers are becoming storm-the-barricades opponents of corporate power. Much of the discussion so far has been more about trying to understand the facts, rather than leaping to allow this emerging research to drive policy actions.For some of the people who have argued for years that concentrated corporate power is behind many of the economy\u2019s travails, the central bankers are late to the party.\u201cWage stagnation is not a puzzle,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, who spoke on a panel organized by the activist group Fed Up outside the lodge where the Fed symposium later took place. \u201cCutting-edge research tells us exactly what\u2019s going on, and yet the Fed seems to be considering this for the first time.\u201dThere is an almost tribal dimension that limits these conversations about how corporate concentration might affect the overall economy and policy. People who study industrial organization or antitrust policy are, for the most part, in a different clan from those who spend their time talking about bond yields and inflation targets.But card-carrying members of that macroeconomic tribe are starting to see that they may have plenty to learn about some of the inner workings of the economy: the details of how businesses compete, set prices and hire people.Kristin Forbes, an M.I.T. economist and a former Bank of England policymaker, faced the knotty task of setting policy for the British economy at a time when economic data was sending conflicting signals. This type of work can bring more coherence to seeming contradictions.\u201cWe would look at macro data, but that data can hide a lot of what\u2019s happening underneath,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a deepening sense of the importance of fusing microeconomic data with macroeconomic trends.\u201d With the Federal Reserve facing the challenge of an American economy that is by many measures at a healthy cruising speed, yet still falling short in its capacity to generate well-paying jobs for millions of people, people at this particular gathering in Jackson Hole could agree that it\u2019s not enough to view the economy using high-altitude data. The details of what is happening in individual industries and markets matter a lot more than it once seemed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "We knew everything we needed to know, and nothing stood in our way. Nothing, that is, except ourselves. A tragedy in two acts.The world has warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. The Paris climate agreement \u2014 the nonbinding, unenforceable and already unheeded treaty signed on Earth Day in 2016 \u2014 hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. The odds of succeeding, according to a recent study based on current emissions trends, are one in 20. If by some miracle we are able to limit warming to two degrees, we will only have to negotiate the extinction of the world\u2019s tropical reefs, sea-level rise of several meters and the abandonment of the Persian Gulf. The climate scientist James Hansen has called two-degree warming \u201ca prescription for long-term disaster.\u201d Long-term disaster is now the best-case scenario. Three-degree warming is a prescription for short-term disaster: forests in the Arctic and the loss of most coastal cities. Robert Watson, a former director of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has argued that three-degree warming is the realistic minimum. Four degrees: Europe in permanent drought; vast areas of China, India and Bangladesh claimed by desert; Polynesia swallowed by the sea; the Colorado River thinned to a trickle; the American Southwest largely uninhabitable. The prospect of a five-degree warming has prompted some of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists to warn of the end of human civilization.Is it a comfort or a curse, the knowledge that we could have avoided all this?Because in the decade that ran from 1979 to 1989, we had an excellent opportunity to solve the climate crisis. The world\u2019s major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding, global framework to reduce carbon emissions \u2014 far closer than we\u2019ve come since. During those years, the conditions for success could not have been more favorable. The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way \u2014 nothing except ourselves.Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979. By that year, data collected since 1957 confirmed what had been known since before the turn of the 20th century: Human beings have altered Earth\u2019s atmosphere through the indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels. The main scientific questions were settled beyond debate, and as the 1980s began, attention turned from diagnosis of the problem to refinement of the predicted consequences. Compared with string theory and genetic engineering, the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d \u2014 a metaphor dating to the early 1900s \u2014 was ancient history, described in any Introduction to Biology textbook. Nor was the basic science especially complicated. It could be reduced to a simple axiom: The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet. And every year, by burning coal, oil and gas, humankind belched increasingly obscene quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Why didn\u2019t we act? A common boogeyman today is the fossil-fuel industry, which in recent decades has committed to playing the role of villain with comic-book bravado. An entire subfield of climate literature has chronicled the machinations of industry lobbyists, the corruption of scientists and the propaganda campaigns that even now continue to debase the political debate, long after the largest oil-and-gas companies have abandoned the dumb show of denialism. But the coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989. During the preceding decade, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon and Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions.Nor can the Republican Party be blamed. Today, only 42 percent of Republicans know that \u201cmost scientists believe global warming is occurring,\u201d and that percentage is falling. But during the 1980s, many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: nonpartisan and of the highest possible stakes. Among those who called for urgent, immediate and far-reaching climate policy were Senators John Chafee, Robert Stafford and David Durenberger; the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly; and, during his campaign for president, George H.W. Bush. As Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, the acting chairman of the president\u2019s Council for Environmental Quality, told industry executives in 1981, \u201cThere can be no more important or conservative concern than the protection of the globe itself.\u201d The issue was unimpeachable, like support for veterans or small business. Except the climate had an even broader constituency, composed of every human being on Earth.It was understood that action would have to come immediately. At the start of the 1980s, scientists within the federal government predicted that conclusive evidence of warming would appear on the global temperature record by the end of the decade, at which point it would be too late to avoid disaster. More than 30 percent of the human population lacked access to electricity. Billions of people would not need to attain the \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d in order to drastically increase global carbon emissions; a light bulb in every village would do it. A report prepared at the request of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences advised that \u201cthe carbon-dioxide issue should appear on the international agenda in a context that will maximize cooperation and consensus-building and minimize political manipulation, controversy and division.\u201d If the world had adopted the proposal widely endorsed at the end of the \u201980s \u2014 a freezing of carbon emissions, with a reduction of 20 percent by 2005 \u2014 warming could have been held to less than 1.5 degrees.A broad international consensus had settled on a solution: a global treaty to curb carbon emissions. The idea began to coalesce as early as February 1979, at the first World Climate Conference in Geneva, when scientists from 50 nations agreed unanimously that it was \u201curgently necessary\u201d to act. Four months later, at the Group of 7 meeting in Tokyo, the leaders of the world\u2019s seven wealthiest nations signed a statement resolving to reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the first major diplomatic meeting to approve the framework for a binding treaty was called in the Netherlands. Delegates from more than 60 nations attended, with the goal of establishing a global summit meeting to be held about a year later. Among scientists and world leaders, the sentiment was unanimous: Action had to be taken, and the United States would need to lead. It didn\u2019t.The inaugural chapter of the climate-change saga is over. In that chapter \u2014 call it Apprehension \u2014 we identified the threat and its consequences. We spoke, with increasing urgency and self-delusion, of the prospect of triumphing against long odds. But we did not seriously consider the prospect of failure. We understood what failure would mean for global temperatures, coastlines, agricultural yield, immigration patterns, the world economy. But we have not allowed ourselves to comprehend what failure might mean for us. How will it change the way we see ourselves, how we remember the past, how we imagine the future? Why did we do this to ourselves? These questions will be the subject of climate change\u2019s second chapter \u2014 call it The Reckoning. There can be no understanding of our current and future predicament without understanding why we failed to solve this problem when we had the chance.That we came so close, as a civilization, to breaking our suicide pact with fossil fuels can be credited to the efforts of a handful of people, among them a hyperkinetic lobbyist and a guileless atmospheric physicist who, at great personal cost, tried to warn humanity of what was coming. They risked their careers in a painful, escalating campaign to solve the problem, first in scientific reports, later through conventional avenues of political persuasion and finally with a strategy of public shaming. Their efforts were shrewd, passionate, robust. And they failed. What follows is their story, and ours.The first suggestion to Rafe Pomerance that humankind was destroying the conditions necessary for its own survival came on Page 66 of the government publication EPA-600/7-78-019. It was a technical report about coal, bound in a coal-black cover with beige lettering \u2014 one of many such reports that lay in uneven piles around Pomerance\u2019s windowless office on the first floor of the Capitol Hill townhouse that, in the late 1970s, served as the Washington headquarters of Friends of the Earth. In the final paragraph of a chapter on environmental regulation, the coal report\u2019s authors noted that the continued use of fossil fuels might, within two or three decades, bring about \u201csignificant and damaging\u201d changes to the global atmosphere.Pomerance paused, startled, over the orphaned paragraph. It seemed to have come out of nowhere. He reread it. It made no sense to him. Pomerance was not a scientist; he graduated from Cornell 11 years earlier with a degree in history. He had the tweedy appearance of an undernourished doctoral student emerging at dawn from the stacks. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and a thickish mustache that wilted disapprovingly over the corners of his mouth, though his defining characteristic was his gratuitous height, 6 feet 4 inches, which seemed to embarrass him; he stooped over to accommodate his interlocutors. He had an active face prone to breaking out in wide, even maniacal grins, but in composure, as when he read the coal pamphlet, it projected concern. He struggled with technical reports. He proceeded as a historian might: cautiously, scrutinizing the source material, reading between the lines. When that failed, he made phone calls, often to the authors of the reports, who tended to be surprised to hear from him. Scientists, he had found, were not in the habit of fielding questions from political lobbyists. They were not in the habit of thinking about politics.Pomerance had one big question about the coal report. If the burning of coal, oil and natural gas could invite global catastrophe, why had nobody told him about it? If anyone in Washington \u2014 if anyone in the United States \u2014 should have been aware of such a danger, it was Pomerance. As the deputy legislative director of Friends of the Earth, the wily, pugnacious nonprofit that David Brower helped found after resigning from the Sierra Club a decade earlier, Pomerance was one of the nation\u2019s most connected environmental activists. That he was as easily accepted in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building as at Earth Day rallies might have had something to do with the fact that he was a Morgenthau \u2014 the great-grandson of Henry Sr., Woodrow Wilson\u2019s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; great-nephew of Henry Jr., Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Treasury secretary; second cousin to Robert, district attorney for Manhattan. Or perhaps it was just his charisma \u2014 voluble, energetic and obsessive, he seemed to be everywhere, speaking with everyone, in a very loud voice, at once. His chief obsession was air. After working as an organizer for welfare rights, he spent the second half of his 20s laboring to protect and expand the Clean Air Act, the comprehensive law regulating air pollution. That led him to the problem of acid rain, and the coal report.He showed the unsettling paragraph to his office mate, Betsy Agle. Had she ever heard of the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d? Was it really possible that human beings were overheating the planet?Agle shrugged. She hadn\u2019t heard about it, either.That might have been the end of it, had Agle not greeted Pomerance in the office a few mornings later holding a copy of a newspaper forwarded by Friends of the Earth\u2019s Denver office. Isn\u2019t this what you were talking about the other day? she asked.Agle pointed to an article about a prominent geophysicist named Gordon MacDonald, who was conducting a study on climate change with the Jasons, the mysterious coterie of elite scientists to which he belonged. Pomerance hadn\u2019t heard of MacDonald, but he knew all about the Jasons. They were like one of those teams of superheroes with complementary powers that join forces in times of galactic crisis. They had been brought together by federal agencies, including the C.I.A, to devise scientific solutions to national-security problems: how to detect an incoming missile; how to predict fallout from a nuclear bomb; how to develop unconventional weapons, like plague-infested rats. The Jasons\u2019 activities had been a secret until the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed their plan to festoon the Ho Chi Minh Trail with motion sensors that signaled to bombers. After the furor that followed \u2014 protesters set MacDonald\u2019s garage on fire \u2014 the Jasons began to use their powers for peace instead of war.There was an urgent problem that demanded their attention, MacDonald believed, because human civilization faced an existential crisis. In \u201cHow to Wreck the Environment,\u201d a 1968 essay published while he was a science adviser to Lyndon Johnson, MacDonald predicted a near future in which \u201cnuclear weapons were effectively banned and the weapons of mass destruction were those of environmental catastrophe.\u201d One of the most potentially devastating such weapons, he believed, was the gas that we exhaled with every breath: carbon dioxide. By vastly increasing carbon emissions, the world\u2019s most advanced militaries could alter weather patterns and wreak famine, drought and economic collapse.In the decade since then, MacDonald had been alarmed to see humankind begin in earnest to weaponize weather \u2014 not out of malice, but unwittingly. During the spring of 1977 and the summer of 1978, the Jasons met to determine what would happen once the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled from pre-Industrial Revolution levels. It was an arbitrary milestone, the doubling, but a useful one, as its inevitability was not in question; the threshold would most likely be breached by 2035. The Jasons\u2019 report to the Department of Energy, \u201cThe Long-Term Impact of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Climate,\u201d was written in an understated tone that only enhanced its nightmarish findings: Global temperatures would increase by an average of two to three degrees Celsius; Dust Bowl conditions would \u201cthreaten large areas of North America, Asia and Africa\u201d; access to drinking water and agricultural production would fall, triggering mass migration on an unprecedented scale. \u201cPerhaps the most ominous feature,\u201d however, was the effect of a changing climate on the poles. Even a minimal warming \u201ccould lead to rapid melting\u201d of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet contained enough water to raise the level of the oceans 16 feet.The Jasons sent the report to dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad; to industry groups like the National Coal Association and the Electric Power Research Institute; and within the government, to the National Academy of Sciences, the Commerce Department, the E.P.A., NASA, the Pentagon, the N.S.A., every branch of the military, the National Security Council and the White House.Pomerance read about the atmospheric crisis in a state of shock that swelled briskly into outrage. \u201cThis,\u201d he told Betsy Agle, \u201cis the whole banana.\u201dGordon MacDonald worked at the federally funded Mitre Corporation, a think tank that works with agencies throughout the government. His title was senior research analyst, which was another way of saying senior science adviser to the national-intelligence community. After a single phone call, Pomerance, a former Vietnam War protester and conscientious objector, drove several miles on the Beltway to a group of anonymous white office buildings that more closely resembled the headquarters of a regional banking firm than the solar plexus of the American military-industrial complex. He was shown into the office of a brawny, soft-spoken man in blocky, horn-rimmed frames, who extended a hand like a bear\u2019s paw.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re interested in this,\u201d MacDonald said, sizing up the young activist.\u201cHow could I not be?\u201d Pomerance said. \u201cHow could anyone not be?\u201dMacDonald explained that he first studied the carbon-dioxide issue when he was about Pomerance\u2019s age \u2014 in 1961, when he served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy. Pomerance pieced together that MacDonald, in his youth, had been something of a prodigy: In his 20s, he advised Dwight D. Eisenhower on space exploration; at 32, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences; at 40, he was appointed to the inaugural Council on Environmental Quality, where he advised Richard Nixon on the environmental dangers of burning coal. He monitored the carbon-dioxide problem the whole time, with increasing alarm.MacDonald spoke for two hours. Pomerance was appalled. \u201cIf I set up briefings with some people on the Hill,\u201d he asked MacDonald, \u201cwill you tell them what you just told me?\u201dThus began the Gordon and Rafe carbon-dioxide roadshow. Beginning in the spring of 1979, Pomerance arranged informal briefings with the E.P.A., the National Security Council, The New York Times, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Energy Department, which, Pomerance learned, had established an Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects two years earlier at MacDonald\u2019s urging. The men settled into a routine, with MacDonald explaining the science and Pomerance adding the exclamation points. They were surprised to learn how few senior officials were familiar with the Jasons\u2019 findings, let alone understood the ramifications of global warming. At last, having worked their way up the federal hierarchy, the two went to see the president\u2019s top scientist, Frank Press.Press\u2019s office was in the Old Executive Office Building, the granite fortress that stands on the White House grounds just paces away from the West Wing. Out of respect for MacDonald, Press had summoned to their meeting what seemed to be the entire senior staff of the president\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy \u2014 the officials consulted on every critical matter of energy and national security. What Pomerance had expected to be yet another casual briefing assumed the character of a high-level national-security meeting. He decided to let MacDonald do all the talking. There was no need to emphasize to Press and his lieutenants that this was an issue of profound national significance. The hushed mood in the office told him that this was already understood.To explain what the carbon-dioxide problem meant for the future, MacDonald would begin his presentation by going back more than a century to John Tyndall \u2014 an Irish physicist who was an early champion of Charles Darwin\u2019s work and died after being accidentally poisoned by his wife. In 1859, Tyndall found that carbon dioxide absorbed heat and that variations in the composition of the atmosphere could create changes in climate. These findings inspired Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and future Nobel laureate, to deduce in 1896 that the combustion of coal and petroleum could raise global temperatures. This warming would become noticeable in a few centuries, Arrhenius calculated, or sooner if consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase.Consumption increased beyond anything the Swedish chemist could have imagined. Four decades later, a British steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar discovered that, at the weather stations he observed, the previous five years were the hottest in recorded history. Humankind, he wrote in a paper, had become \u201cable to speed up the processes of Nature.\u201d That was in 1939.MacDonald\u2019s voice was calm but authoritative, his powerful, heavy hands conveying the force of his argument. He was a geophysicist trapped in the body of an offensive lineman \u2014 he had turned down a football scholarship to Rice in order to attend Harvard \u2014 and seemed miscast as a preacher of atmospheric physics and existential doom. His audience listened in bowed silence. Pomerance couldn\u2019t read them. Political bureaucrats were skilled at hiding their opinions. Pomerance wasn\u2019t. He shifted restlessly in his chair, glancing between MacDonald and the government suits, trying to see whether they grasped the shape of the behemoth that MacDonald was describing.MacDonald\u2019s history concluded with Roger Revelle, perhaps the most distinguished of the priestly caste of government scientists who, since the Manhattan Project, advised every president on major policy; he had been a close colleague of MacDonald and Press since they served together under Kennedy. In a 1957 paper written with Hans Suess, Revelle concluded that \u201chuman beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.\u201d Revelle helped the Weather Bureau establish a continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide at a site perched near the summit of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii, 11,500 feet above the sea \u2014 a rare pristine natural laboratory on a planet blanketed by fossil-fuel emissions. A young geochemist named Charles David Keeling charted the data. Keeling\u2019s graph came to be known as the Keeling curve, though it more closely resembled a jagged lightning bolt hurled toward the firmament. MacDonald had a habit of tracing the Keeling curve in the air, his thick forefinger jabbing toward the ceiling.After nearly a decade of observation, Revelle had shared his concerns with Lyndon Johnson, who included them in a special message to Congress two weeks after his inauguration. Johnson explained that his generation had \u201caltered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale\u201d through the burning of fossil fuels, and his administration commissioned a study of the subject by his Science Advisory Committee. Revelle was its chairman, and its 1965 executive report on carbon dioxide warned of the rapid melting of Antarctica, rising seas, increased acidity of fresh waters \u2014 changes that would require no less than a coordinated global effort to forestall.Yet emissions continued to rise, and at this rate, MacDonald warned, they could see a snowless New England, the swamping of major coastal cities, as much as a 40 percent decline in national wheat production, the forced migration of about one-quarter of the world\u2019s population. Not within centuries \u2014 within their own lifetimes.\u201cWhat would you have us do?\u201d Press asked.The president\u2019s plan, in the wake of the Saudi oil crisis, to promote solar energy \u2014 he had gone so far as to install 32 solar panels on the roof of the White House to heat his family\u2019s water \u2014 was a good start, MacDonald thought. But Jimmy Carter\u2019s plan to stimulate production of synthetic fuels \u2014 gas and liquid fuel extracted from shale and tar sands \u2014 was a dangerous idea. Nuclear power, despite the recent tragedy at Three Mile Island, should be expanded. But even natural gas and ethanol were preferable to coal. There was no way around it: Coal production would ultimately have to end.The president\u2019s advisers asked respectful questions, but Pomerance couldn\u2019t tell whether they were persuaded. The men all stood and shook hands, and Press led MacDonald and Pomerance out of his office. After they emerged from the Old Executive Office Building onto Pennsylvania Avenue, Pomerance asked MacDonald what he thought would happen.Knowing Frank as I do, MacDonald said, I really couldn\u2019t tell you.In the days that followed, Pomerance grew uneasy. Until this point, he had fixated on the science of the carbon-dioxide issue and its possible political ramifications. But now that his meetings on Capitol Hill had concluded, he began to question what all this might mean for his own future. His wife, Lenore, was eight months pregnant; was it ethical, he wondered, to bring a child onto a planet that before much longer could become inhospitable to life? And he wondered why it had fallen to him, a 32-year-old lobbyist without scientific training, to bring greater attention to this crisis.Finally, weeks later, MacDonald called to tell him that Press had taken up the issue. On May 22, Press wrote a letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences requesting a full assessment of the carbon-dioxide issue. Jule Charney, the father of modern meteorology, would gather the nation\u2019s top oceanographers, atmospheric scientists and climate modelers to judge whether MacDonald\u2019s alarm was justified \u2014 whether the world was, in fact, headed to cataclysm.Pomerance was amazed by how much momentum had built in such a short time. Scientists at the highest levels of government had known about the dangers of fossil-fuel combustion for decades. Yet they had produced little besides journal articles, academic symposiums, technical reports. Nor had any politician, journalist or activist championed the issue. That, Pomerance figured, was about to change. If Charney\u2019s group confirmed that the world was careering toward an existential crisis, the president would be forced to act.There was a brown velvet love seat in the living room of James and Anniek Hansen, under a bright window looking out on Morningside Park in Manhattan, that nobody ever sat in. Erik, their 2-year-old son, was forbidden to go near it. The ceiling above the couch sagged ominously, as if pregnant with some alien life form, and the bulge grew with each passing week. Jim promised Anniek that he would fix it, which was only fair, because it had been on his insistence that they gave up the prospect of a prewar apartment in Spuyten Duyvil overlooking the Hudson and moved from Riverdale to this two-story walk-up with crumbling walls, police-siren lullabies and gravid ceiling. Jim had resented the 45-minute commute to NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan and complained that such a gross waste of his time would soon be unsustainable, once the Pioneer spacecraft reached Venus and began to beam back data. But even after the Hansens moved within a few blocks of the institute, Jim couldn\u2019t make time for the ceiling, and after four months it finally burst, releasing a confetti of browned pipes and splintered wood.Jim repeated his vow to fix the ceiling as soon as he had a moment free from work. Anniek held him to his word, though it required her to live with a hole in her ceiling until Thanksgiving \u2014 seven months of plaster dust powdering the love seat.Another promise Jim made to Anniek: He would make it home for dinner every night by 7 p.m. By 8:30, however, he was back at his calculations. Anniek did not begrudge him his deep commitment to his work; it was one of the things she loved about him. Still, it baffled her that the subject of his obsession should be the atmospheric conditions of a planet more than 24 million miles away. It baffled Jim, too. His voyage to Venus from Denison, Iowa, the fifth child of a diner waitress and an itinerant farmer turned bartender, had been a series of bizarre twists of fate over which he claimed no agency. It was just something that happened to him.Hansen figured he was the only scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who, as a child, did not dream of outer space. He dreamed only of baseball. On clear nights, his transistor radio picked up the broadcast of the Kansas City Blues, the New York Yankees\u2019 AAA affiliate. Every morning, he cut out the box scores, pasted them into a notebook and tallied statistics. Hansen found comfort in numbers and equations. He majored in math and physics at the University of Iowa, but he never would have taken an interest in celestial matters were it not for the unlikely coincidence of two events during the year he graduated: the eruption of a volcano in Bali and a total eclipse of the moon.On the night of Dec. 30, 1963 \u2014 whipping wind, 12 degrees below zero \u2014 Hansen accompanied his astronomy professor to a cornfield far from town. They set a telescope in an old corncrib and, between 2 and 8 in the morning, made continuous photoelectric recordings of the eclipse, pausing only when the extension cord froze and when they dashed to the car for a few minutes to avoid frostbite.During an eclipse, the moon resembles a tangerine or, if the eclipse is total, a drop of blood. But this night, the moon vanished altogether. Hansen made the mystery the subject of his master\u2019s thesis, concluding that the moon had been obscured by the dust erupted into the atmosphere by Mount Agung, on the other side of the planet from his corncrib, six months earlier. The discovery led to his fascination with the influence of invisible particles on the visible world. You could not make sense of the visible world until you understood the whimsies of the invisible one.One of the leading authorities on the invisible world happened to be teaching then at Iowa: James Van Allen made the first major discovery of the space age, identifying the two doughnut-shaped regions of convulsing particles that circle Earth, now known as the Van Allen belts. At Van Allen\u2019s prodding, Hansen turned from the moon to Venus. Why, he tried to determine, was its surface so hot? In 1967, a Soviet satellite beamed back the answer: The planet\u2019s atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide. Though once it may have had habitable temperatures, it was believed to have succumbed to a runaway greenhouse effect: As the sun grew brighter, Venus\u2019s ocean began to evaporate, thickening the atmosphere, which forced yet greater evaporation \u2014 a self-perpetuating cycle that finally boiled off the ocean entirely and heated the planet\u2019s surface to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At the other extreme, Mars\u2019s thin atmosphere had insufficient carbon dioxide to trap much heat at all, leaving it about 900 degrees colder. Earth lay in the middle, its Goldilocks greenhouse effect just strong enough to support life.Anniek expected Jim\u2019s professional life to resume some semblance of normality once the data from Venus had been collected and analyzed. But shortly after Pioneer entered Venus\u2019s atmosphere, Hansen came home from the office in an uncharacteristic fervor \u2014 with an apology. The prospect of two or three more years of intense work had sprung up before him. NASA was expanding its study of Earth\u2019s atmospheric conditions. Hansen had already done some work on Earth\u2019s atmosphere for Jule Charney at the Goddard Institute, helping to develop computerized weather models. Now Hansen would have an opportunity to apply to Earth the lessons he had learned from Venus.We want to learn more about Earth\u2019s climate, Jim told Anniek \u2014 and how humanity can influence it. He would use giant new supercomputers to map the planet\u2019s atmosphere. They would create Mirror Worlds: parallel realities that mimicked our own. These digital simulacra, technically called \u201cgeneral circulation models,\u201d combined the mathematical formulas that governed the behavior of the sea, land and sky into a single computer model. Unlike the real world, they could be sped forward to reveal the future.Anniek\u2019s disappointment \u2014 another several years of distraction, stress, time spent apart from family \u2014 was tempered, if only slightly, by the high strain of Jim\u2019s enthusiasm. She thought she understood it. Does this mean, she asked, that you\u2019ll able to predict weather more accurately?Yes, Jim said. Something like that.The scientists summoned by Jule Charney to judge the fate of civilization arrived on July 23, 1979, with their wives, children and weekend bags at a three-story mansion in Woods Hole, on the southwestern spur of Cape Cod. They would review all the available science and decide whether the White House should take seriously Gordon MacDonald\u2019s prediction of a climate apocalypse. The Jasons had predicted a warming of two or three degrees Celsius by the middle of the 21st century, but like Roger Revelle before them, they emphasized their reasons for uncertainty. Charney\u2019s scientists were asked to quantify that uncertainty. They had to get it right: Their conclusion would be delivered to the president. But first they would hold a clambake.They gathered with their families on a bluff overlooking Quissett Harbor and took turns tossing mesh produce bags stuffed with lobster, clams and corn into a bubbling caldron. While the children scrambled across the rolling lawn, the scientists mingled with a claque of visiting dignitaries, whose status lay somewhere between chaperone and client \u2014 men from the Departments of State, Energy, Defense and Agriculture; the E.P.A.; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They exchanged pleasantries and took in the sunset. It was a hot day, high 80s, but the harbor breeze was salty and cool. It didn\u2019t look like the dawning of an apocalypse. The government officials, many of them scientists themselves, tried to suppress their awe of the legends in their presence: Henry Stommel, the world\u2019s leading oceanographer; his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Carl Wunsch, a Jason; the Manhattan Project alumnus Cecil Leith; the Harvard planetary physicist Richard Goody. These were the men who, in the last three decades, had discovered foundational principles underlying the relationships among sun, atmosphere, land and ocean \u2014 which is to say, the climate.The hierarchy was made visible during the workshop sessions, held in the carriage house next door: The scientists sat at tables arranged in a rectangle, while their federal observers sat along the room\u2019s perimeter, taking in the action as at a theater in the round. The first two days of meetings didn\u2019t make very good theater, however, as the scientists reviewed the basic principles of the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, radiative transfer. On the third day, Charney introduced a new prop: a black speaker, attached to a telephone. He dialed, and Jim Hansen answered.Charney called Hansen because he had grasped that in order to determine the exact range of future warming, his group would have to venture into the realm of the Mirror Worlds. Jule Charney himself had used a general circulation model to revolutionize weather prediction. But Hansen was one of just a few modelers who had studied the effects of carbon emissions. When, at Charney\u2019s request, Hansen programmed his model to consider a future of doubled carbon dioxide, it predicted a temperature increase of four degrees Celsius. That was twice as much warming as the prediction made by the most prominent climate modeler, Syukuro Manabe, whose government lab at Princeton was the first to model the greenhouse effect. The difference between the two predictions \u2014 between warming of two degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius \u2014 was the difference between damaged coral reefs and no reefs whatsoever, between thinning forests and forests enveloped by desert, between catastrophe and chaos.In the carriage house, the disembodied voice of Jim Hansen explained, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone, how his model weighed the influences of clouds, oceans and snow on warming. The older scientists interrupted, shouting questions; when they did not transmit through the telephone, Charney repeated them in a bellow. The questions kept coming, often before their younger respondent could finish his answers, and Hansen wondered if it wouldn\u2019t have been easier for him to drive the five hours and meet with them in person.Among Charney\u2019s group was Akio Arakawa, a pioneer of computer modeling. On the final night at Woods Hole, Arakawa stayed up in his motel room with printouts from the models by Hansen and Manabe blanketing his double bed. The discrepancy between the models, Arakawa concluded, came down to ice and snow. The whiteness of the world\u2019s snowfields reflected light; if snow melted in a warmer climate, less radiation would escape the atmosphere, leading to even greater warming. Shortly before dawn, Arakawa concluded that Manabe had given too little weight to the influence of melting sea ice, while Hansen had overemphasized it. The best estimate lay in between. Which meant that the Jasons\u2019 calculation was too optimistic. When carbon dioxide doubled in 2035 or thereabouts, global temperatures would increase between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, with the most likely outcome a warming of three degrees.The publication of Jule Charney\u2019s report, \u201cCarbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment,\u201d several months later was not accompanied by a banquet, a parade or even a news conference. Yet within the highest levels of the federal government, the scientific community and the oil-and-gas industry \u2014 within the commonwealth of people who had begun to concern themselves with the future habitability of the planet \u2014 the Charney report would come to have the authority of settled fact. It was the summation of all the predictions that had come before, and it would withstand the scrutiny of the decades that followed it. Charney\u2019s group had considered everything known about ocean, sun, sea, air and fossil fuels and had distilled it to a single number: three. When the doubling threshold was broached, as appeared inevitable, the world would warm three degrees Celsius. The last time the world was three degrees warmer was during the Pliocene, three million years ago, when beech trees grew in Antarctica, the seas were 80 feet higher and horses galloped across the Canadian coast of the Arctic Ocean.The Charney report left Jim Hansen with more urgent questions. Three degrees would be nightmarish, and unless carbon emissions ceased suddenly, three degrees would be only the beginning. The real question was whether the warming trend could be reversed. Was there time to act? And how would a global commitment to cease burning fossil fuels come about, exactly? Who had the power to make such a thing happen? Hansen didn\u2019t know how to begin to answer these questions. But he would learn.After the publication of the Charney report, Exxon decided to create its own dedicated carbon-dioxide research program, with an annual budget of $600,000. Only Exxon was asking a slightly different question than Jule Charney. Exxon didn\u2019t concern itself primarily with how much the world would warm. It wanted to know how much of the warming Exxon could be blamed for.A senior researcher named Henry Shaw had argued that the company needed a deeper understanding of the issue in order to influence future legislation that might restrict carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201cIt behooves us to start a very aggressive defensive program,\u201d Shaw wrote in a memo to a manager, \u201cbecause there is a good probability that legislation affecting our business will be passed.\u201dShaw turned to Wallace Broecker, a Columbia University oceanographer who was the second author of Roger Revelle\u2019s 1965 carbon-dioxide report for Lyndon Johnson. In 1977, in a presentation at the American Geophysical Union, Broecker predicted that fossil fuels would have to be restricted, whether by taxation or fiat. More recently, he had testified before Congress, calling carbon dioxide \u201cthe No.1 long-term environmental problem.\u201d If presidents and senators trusted Broecker to tell them the bad news, he was good enough for Exxon.The company had been studying the carbon-dioxide problem for decades, since before it changed its name to Exxon. In 1957, scientists from Humble Oil published a study tracking \u201cthe enormous quantity of carbon dioxide\u201d contributed to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution \u201cfrom the combustion of fossil fuels.\u201d Even then, the observation that burning fossil fuels had increased the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was well understood and accepted by Humble\u2019s scientists. What was new, in 1957, was the effort to quantify what percentage of emissions had been contributed by the oil-and-gas industry.The American Petroleum Institute, the industry\u2019s largest trade association, asked the same question in 1958 through its air-pollution study group and replicated the findings made by Humble Oil. So did another A.P.I. study conducted by the Stanford Research Institute a decade later, in 1968, which concluded that the burning of fossil fuels would bring \u201csignificant temperature changes\u201d by the year 2000 and ultimately \u201cserious worldwide environmental changes,\u201d including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap and rising seas. It was \u201cironic,\u201d the study\u2019s authors noted, that politicians, regulators and environmentalists fixated on local incidents of air pollution that were immediately observable, while the climate crisis, whose damage would be of far greater severity and scale, went entirely unheeded.The ritual repeated itself every few years. Industry scientists, at the behest of their corporate bosses, reviewed the problem and found good reasons for alarm and better excuses to do nothing. Why should they act when almost nobody within the United States government \u2014 nor, for that matter, within the environmental movement \u2014 seemed worried? Besides, as the National Petroleum Council put it in 1972, changes in the climate would probably not be apparent \u201cuntil at least the turn of the century.\u201d The industry had enough urgent crises: antitrust legislation introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy; concerns about the health effects of gasoline; battles over the Clean Air Act; and the financial shock of benzene regulation, which increased the cost of every gallon of gas sold in America. Why take on an intractable problem that would not be detected until this generation of employees was safely retired? Worse, the solutions seemed more punitive than the problem itself. Historically, energy use had correlated to economic growth \u2014 the more fossil fuels we burned, the better our lives became. Why mess with that?But the Charney report had changed industry\u2019s cost-benefit calculus. Now there was a formal consensus about the nature of the crisis. As Henry Shaw emphasized in his conversations with Exxon\u2019s executives, the cost of inattention would rise in step with the Keeling curve.Wallace Broecker did not think much of one of Exxon\u2019s proposals for its new carbon-dioxide program: testing the corked air in vintage bottles of French wine to demonstrate how much carbon levels had increased over time. But he did help his colleague Taro Takahashi with a more ambitious experiment conducted onboard one of Exxon\u2019s largest supertankers, the Esso Atlantic, to determine how much carbon the oceans could absorb before coughing it back into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the graduate student installed on the tanker botched the job, and the data came back a mess.Shaw was running out of time. In 1978, an Exxon colleague circulated an internal memo warning that humankind had only five to 10 years before policy action would be necessary. But Congress seemed ready to act a lot sooner than that. On April 3, 1980, Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, held the first congressional hearing on carbon-dioxide buildup in the atmosphere. Gordon MacDonald testified that the United States should \u201ctake the initiative\u201d and develop, through the United Nations, a way to coordinate every nation\u2019s energy policies to address the problem. That June, Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act of 1980, which directed the National Academy of Sciences to start a multiyear, comprehensive study, to be called \u201cChanging Climate,\u201d that would analyze social and economic effects of climate change. More urgent, the National Commission on Air Quality, at the request of Congress, invited two dozen experts, including Henry Shaw himself, to a meeting in Florida to propose climate policy.It seemed that some kind of legislation to restrict carbon combustion was inevitable. The Charney report had confirmed the diagnosis of the problem \u2014 a problem that Exxon helped create. Now Exxon would help shape the solution.Two days before Halloween, Rafe Pomerance traveled to a cotton-candy castle on the Gulf of Mexico, near St. Petersburg, Fla, that locals called the Pink Palace. The Don CeSar hotel was a child\u2019s daydream with cantilevered planes of bubble-gum stucco and vanilla-white cupolas that appeared to melt in the sunshine like scoops of ice cream. The hotel stood amid blooms of poisonwood and gumbo limbo on a narrow spit of porous limestone that rose no higher than five feet above the sea. In its carnival of historical amnesia and childlike faith in the power of fantasy, the Pink Palace was a fine setting for the first rehearsal of a conversation that would be earnestly restaged, with little variation and increasing desperation, for the next 40 years.In the year and a half since he had read the coal report, Pomerance had attended countless conferences and briefings about the science of global warming. But until now, nobody had shown much interest in the only subject that he cared about, the only subject that mattered \u2014 how to prevent warming. In a sense, he had himself to thank: During the expansion of the Clean Air Act, he pushed for the creation of the National Commission on Air Quality, charged with ensuring that the goals of the act were being met. One such goal was a stable global climate. The Charney report had made clear that goal was not being met, and now the commission wanted to hear proposals for legislation. It was a profound responsibility, and the two dozen experts invited to the Pink Palace \u2014 policy gurus, deep thinkers, an industry scientist and an environmental activist \u2014 had only three days to achieve it, but the utopian setting made everything seem possible. The conference room looked better suited to hosting a wedding party than a bureaucratic meeting, its tall windows framing postcard views of the beach. The sands were blindingly white, the surf was idle, the air unseasonably hot and the dress code relaxed: sunglasses and guayaberas, jackets frowned upon.\u201cI have a very vested interest in this,\u201d said State Representative Tom McPherson, a Florida Democrat, introducing himself to the delegation, \u201cbecause I own substantial holdings 15 miles inland of the coast, and any beachfront property appreciates in value.\u201d There was no formal agenda, just a young moderator from the E.P.A. named Thomas Jorling and a few handouts left on every seat, including a copy of the Charney report. Jorling acknowledged the vagueness of their mission.\u201cWe are flying blind, with little or no idea where the mountains are,\u201d he said. But the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: A failure to recommend policy, he said, would be the same as endorsing the present policy \u2014 which was no policy. He asked who wanted \u201cto break the ice,\u201d not quite appreciating the pun.\u201cWe might start out with an emotional question,\u201d proposed Thomas Waltz, an economist at the National Climate Program. \u201cThe question is fundamental to being a human being: Do we care?\u201dThis provoked huffy consternation. \u201cIn caring or not caring,\u201d said John Laurmann, a Stanford engineer, \u201cI would think the main thing is the timing.\u201d It was not an emotional question, in other words, but an economic one: How much did we value the future?William Elliott, a NOAA scientist, introduced some hard facts: If the United States stopped burning carbon that year, it would delay the arrival of the doubling threshold by only five years. If Western nations somehow managed to stabilize emissions, it would forestall the inevitable by only eight years. The only way to avoid the worst was to stop burning coal. Yet China, the Soviet Union and the United States, by far the world\u2019s three largest coal producers, were frantically accelerating extraction.\u201cDo we have a problem?\u201d asked Anthony Scoville, a congressional science consultant. \u201cWe do, but it is not the atmospheric problem. It is the political problem.\u201d He doubted that any scientific report, no matter how ominous its predictions, would persuade politicians to act.Pomerance glanced out at the beach, where the occasional tourist dawdled in the surf. Beyond the conference room, few Americans realized that the planet would soon cease to resemble itself.What if the problem was that they were thinking of it as a problem? \u201cWhat I am saying,\u201d Scoville continued, \u201cis that in a sense we are making a transition not only in energy but the economy as a whole.\u201d Even if the coal and oil industries collapsed, renewable technologies like solar energy would take their place. Jimmy Carter was planning to invest $80 billion in synthetic fuel. \u201cMy God,\u201d Scoville said, \u201cwith $80 billion, you could have a photovoltaics industry going that would obviate the need for synfuels forever!\u201dThe talk of ending oil production stirred for the first time the gentleman from Exxon. \u201cI think there is a transition period,\u201d Henry Shaw said. \u201cWe are not going to stop burning fossil fuels and start looking toward solar or nuclear fusion and so on. We are going to have a very orderly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.\u201d\u201cWe are talking about some major fights in this country,\u201d said Waltz, the economist. \u201cWe had better be thinking this thing through.\u201dBut first \u2014 lunch. It was a bright day, low 80s, and the group voted to break for three hours to enjoy the Florida sun. Pomerance couldn\u2019t \u2014 he was restless. He had refrained from speaking, happy to let others lead the discussion, provided it moved in the right direction. But the high-minded talk had soon stalled into fecklessness and pusillanimity. He reflected that he was just about the only participant without an advanced degree. But few of these policy geniuses were showing much sense. They understood what was at stake, but they hadn\u2019t taken it to heart. They remained cool, detached \u2014 pragmatists overmatched by a problem that had no pragmatic resolution. \u201cPrudence,\u201d Jorling said, \u201cis essential.\u201dAfter lunch, Jorling tried to focus the conversation. What did they need to know in order to take action?David Slade, who as the director of the Energy Department\u2019s $200 million Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects had probably considered the question more deeply than anyone else in the room, said he figured that at some point, probably within their lifetimes, they would see the warming themselves.\u201cAnd at that time,\u201d Pomerance bellowed, \u201cit will be too late to do anything about it.\u201dYet nobody could agree what to do. John Perry, a meteorologist who had worked as a staff member on the Charney report, suggested that American energy policy merely \u201ctake into account\u201d the risks of global warming, though he acknowledged that a nonbinding measure might seem \u201cintolerably stodgy.\u201d\u201cIt is so weak,\u201d Pomerance said, the air seeping out of him, \u201cas to not get us anywhere.\u201dReading the indecision in the room, Jorling reversed himself and wondered if it might be best to avoid proposing any specific policy. \u201cLet\u2019s not load ourselves down with that burden,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let others worry.\u201dPomerance begged Jorling to reconsider. The commission had asked for hard proposals. But why stop there? Why not propose a new national energy plan? \u201cThere is no single action that is going to solve the problem,\u201d Pomerance said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep saying, That isn\u2019t going to do it, and This isn\u2019t going to do it, because then we end up doing nothing.\u201dScoville pointed out that the United States was responsible for the largest share of global carbon emissions. But not for long. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to exercise leadership,\u201d he said, \u201cthe opportunity is now.\u201d One way to lead, he proposed, would be to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and regulate it as such. This was received by the room like a belch. By Scoville\u2019s logic, every sigh was an act of pollution. Did the science really support such an extreme measure?The Charney report did exactly that, Pomerance said. He was beginning to lose his patience, his civility, his stamina. \u201cNow, if everybody wants to sit around and wait until the world warms up more than it has warmed up since there have been humans around \u2014 fine. But I would like to have a shot at avoiding it.\u201dMost everybody else seemed content to sit around. Some of the attendees confused uncertainty around the margins of the issue (whether warming would be three or four degrees Celsius in 50 or 75 years) for uncertainty about the severity of the problem. As Gordon MacDonald liked to say, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would rise; the only question was when. The lag between the emission of a gas and the warming it produced could be several decades. It was like adding an extra blanket on a mild night: It took a few minutes before you started to sweat.Yet Slade, the director of the Energy Department\u2019s carbon-dioxide program, considered the lag a saving grace. If changes did not occur for a decade or more, he said, those in the room couldn\u2019t be blamed for failing to prevent them. So what was the problem?\u201cCall it whatever.\u201d Besides, Pomerance added, they didn\u2019t have to ban coal tomorrow. A pair of modest steps could be taken immediately to show the world that the United States was serious: the implementation of a carbon tax and increased investment in renewable energy. Then the United States could organize an international summit meeting to address climate change. This was his closing plea to the group. The next day, they would have to draft policy proposals.But when the group reconvened after breakfast, they immediately became stuck on a sentence in their prefatory paragraph declaring that climatic changes were \u201clikely to occur.\u201d\u201cWill occur,\u201d proposed Laurmann, the Stanford engineer.\u201cWhat about the words: highly likely to occur?\u201d Scoville asked.\u201cAlmost sure,\u201d said David Rose, the nuclear engineer from M.I.T.\u201cAlmost surely,\u201d another said.\u201cChanges of an undetermined \u2014 \u201d\u201cChanges as yet of a little-understood nature?\u201d\u201cHighly or extremely likely to occur,\u201d Pomerance said.\u201cAlmost surely to occur?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Pomerance said.\u201cI would like to make one statement,\u201d said Annemarie Crocetti, a public-health scholar who sat on the National Commission on Air Quality and had barely spoken all week. \u201cI have noticed that very often when we as scientists are cautious in our statements, everybody else misses the point, because they don\u2019t understand our qualifications.\u201d\u201cAs a nonscientist,\u201d said Tom McPherson, the Florida legislator, \u201cI really concur.\u201dYet these two dozen experts, who agreed on the major points and had made a commitment to Congress, could not draft a single paragraph. Hours passed in a hell of fruitless negotiation, self-defeating proposals and impulsive speechifying. Pomerance and Scoville pushed to include a statement calling for the United States to \u201csharply accelerate international dialogue,\u201d but they were sunk by objections and caveats.\u201cIt is very emotional,\u201d Crocetti said, succumbing to her frustration. \u201cWhat we have asked is to get people from different disciplines to come together and tell us what you agree on and what your problems are. And you have only made vague statements \u2014 \u201dShe was interrupted by Waltz, the economist, who wanted simply to note that climate change would have profound effects. Crocetti waited until he exhausted himself, before resuming in a calm voice. \u201cAll I am asking you to say is: \u2018We got ourselves a bunch of experts, and by God, they all endorse this point of view and think it is very important. They have disagreements about the details of this and that, but they feel that it behooves us to intervene at this point and try to prevent it.\u2019\u2009\u201dThey never got to policy proposals. They never got to the second paragraph. The final statement was signed by only the moderator, who phrased it more weakly than the declaration calling for the workshop in the first place. \u201cThe guide I would suggest,\u201d Jorling wrote, \u201cis whether we know enough not to recommend changes in existing policy.\u201dPomerance had seen enough. A consensus-based strategy would not work \u2014 could not work \u2014 without American leadership. And the United States wouldn\u2019t act unless a strong leader persuaded it to do so \u2014 someone who would speak with authority about the science, demand action from those in power and risk everything in pursuit of justice. Pomerance knew he wasn\u2019t that person: He was an organizer, a strategist, a fixer \u2014 which meant he was an optimist and even, perhaps, a romantic. His job was to assemble a movement. And every movement, even one backed by widespread consensus, needed a hero. He just had to find one.The meeting ended Friday morning. On Tuesday, four days later, Ronald Reagan was elected president. And Rafe Pomerance soon found himself wondering whether what had seemed to have been a beginning had actually been the end.After the election, Reagan considered plans to close the Energy Department, increase coal production on federal land and deregulate surface coal mining. Once in office, he appointed James Watt, the president of a legal firm that fought to open public lands to mining and drilling, to run the Interior Department. \u201cWe\u2019re deliriously happy,\u201d the president of the National Coal Association was reported to have said. Reagan preserved the E.P.A. but named as its administrator Anne Gorsuch, an anti-regulation zealot who proceeded to cut the agency\u2019s staff and budget by about a quarter. In the midst of this carnage, the Council on Environmental Quality submitted a report to the White House warning that fossil fuels could \u201cpermanently and disastrously\u201d alter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, leading to \u201ca warming of the Earth, possibly with very serious effects.\u201d Reagan did not act on the council\u2019s advice. Instead, his administration considered eliminating the council.At the Pink Palace, Anthony Scoville had said that the problem was not atmospheric but political. That was only half right, Pomerance thought. For behind every political problem, there lay a publicity problem. And the climate crisis had a publicity nightmare. The Florida meeting had failed to prepare a coherent statement, let alone legislation, and now everything was going backward. Even Pomerance couldn\u2019t devote much time to climate change; Friends of the Earth was busier than ever. The campaigns to defeat the nominations of James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were just the beginning; there were also efforts to block mining in wilderness areas, maintain the Clean Air Act\u2019s standards for air pollutants and preserve funding for renewable energy (Reagan \u201chas declared open war on solar energy,\u201d the director of the nation\u2019s lead solar-energy research agency said, after he was asked to resign). Reagan appeared determined to reverse the environmental achievements of Jimmy Carter, before undoing those of Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and, if he could get away with it, Theodore Roosevelt.Reagan\u2019s violence to environmental regulations alarmed even members of his own party. Senator Robert Stafford, a Vermont Republican and chairman of the committee that held confirmation hearings on Gorsuch, took the unusual step of lecturing her from the dais about her moral obligation to protect the nation\u2019s air and water. Watt\u2019s plan to open the waters off California for oil drilling was denounced by the state\u2019s Republican senator, and Reagan\u2019s proposal to eliminate the position of science adviser was roundly derided by the scientists and engineers who advised him during his presidential campaign. When Reagan considered closing the Council on Environmental Quality, its acting chairman, Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, wrote to the vice president and the White House chief of staff begging them to reconsider; in a major speech the same week, \u201cA Conservative\u2019s Program for the Environment,\u201d Baldwin argued that it was \u201ctime for today\u2019s conservatives explicitly to embrace environmentalism.\u201d Environmental protection was not only good sense. It was good business. What could be more conservative than an efficient use of resources that led to fewer federal subsidies?Meanwhile the Charney report continued to vibrate at the periphery of public consciousness. Its conclusions were confirmed by major studies from the Aspen Institute, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis near Vienna and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Every month or so, nationally syndicated articles appeared summoning apocalypse: \u201cAnother Warning on \u2018Greenhouse Effect,\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201cGlobal Warming Trend \u2018Beyond Human Experience,\u2019\u2009\u201d \u201cWarming Trend Could \u2018Pit Nation Against Nation.\u2019\u2009\u201d People magazine had profiled Gordon MacDonald, photographing him standing on the steps of the Capitol and pointing above his head to the level the water would reach when the polar ice caps melted. \u201cIf Gordon MacDonald is wrong, they\u2019ll laugh,\u201d the article read. \u201cOtherwise, they\u2019ll gurgle.\u201dBut Pomerance understood that in order to sustain major coverage, you needed major events. Studies were fine; speeches were good; news conferences were better. Hearings, however, were best. The ritual\u2019s theatrical trappings \u2014 the members of Congress holding forth on the dais, their aides decorously passing notes, the witnesses sipping nervously from their water glasses, the audience transfixed in the gallery \u2014 offered antagonists, dramatic tension, narrative. But you couldn\u2019t have a hearing without a scandal, or at least a scientific breakthrough. And two years after the Charney group met at Woods Hole, it seemed there was no more science to break through.It was with a shiver of optimism, then, that Pomerance read on the front page of The New York Times on Aug. 22, 1981, about a forthcoming paper in Science by a team of seven NASA scientists. They had found that the world had already warmed in the past century. Temperatures hadn\u2019t increased beyond the range of historical averages, but the scientists predicted that the warming signal would emerge from the noise of routine weather fluctuations much sooner than previously expected. Most unusual of all, the paper ended with a policy recommendation: In the coming decades, the authors wrote, humankind should develop alternative sources of energy and use fossil fuels only \u201cas necessary.\u201d The lead author was James Hansen.Pomerance called Hansen to ask for a meeting. He explained to Hansen that he wanted to make sure he understood the paper\u2019s conclusions. But more than that, he wanted to understand James Hansen.At the Goddard Institute, Pomerance entered Hansen\u2019s office, maneuvering through some 30 piles of documents arrayed across the floor like the skyscrapers of a model city, some as high as his waist. On top of many of the stacks lay a scrap of cardboard on which had been scrawled words like Trace Gases, Ocean, Jupiter, Venus. At the desk, Pomerance found, hidden behind another paper metropolis, a quiet, composed man with a heavy brow and implacable green eyes. Hansen\u2019s speech was soft, equable, deliberate to the point of halting. He would have no trouble passing for a small-town accountant, insurance-claims manager or actuary. In a sense he held all of those jobs, only his client was the global atmosphere. Pomerance\u2019s political sensitivities sparked. He liked what he saw.As Hansen spoke, Pomerance listened and watched. He understood Hansen\u2019s basic findings well enough: Earth had been warming since 1880, and the warming would reach \u201calmost unprecedented magnitude\u201d in the next century, leading to the familiar suite of terrors, including the flooding of a 10th of New Jersey and a quarter of Louisiana and Florida. But Pomerance was excited to find that Hansen could translate the complexities of atmospheric science into plain English. Though he was something of a wunderkind \u2014 at 40, he was about to be named director of the Goddard Institute \u2014 he spoke with the plain-spoken Midwestern forthrightness that played on Capitol Hill. He presented like a heartland voter, the kind of man interviewed on the evening news about the state of the American dream or photographed in the dying sun against a blurry agricultural landscape in a campaign ad. And unlike most scientists in the field, he was not afraid to follow his research to its policy implications. He was perfect.\u201cWhat you have to say needs to be heard,\u201d Pomerance said. \u201cAre you willing to be a witness?\u201dThough few people other than Rafe Pomerance seemed to have noticed amid Reagan\u2019s environmental blitzkrieg, another hearing on the greenhouse effect was held several weeks earlier, on July 31, 1981. It was led by Representative James Scheuer, a New York Democrat \u2014 who lived at sea level on the Rockaway Peninsula, in a neighborhood no more than four blocks wide, sandwiched between two beaches \u2014 and a canny, 33-year-old congressman named Albert Gore Jr.Gore had learned about climate change a dozen years earlier as an undergraduate at Harvard, when he took a class taught by Roger Revelle. Humankind was on the brink of radically transforming the global atmosphere, Revelle explained, drawing Keeling\u2019s rising zigzag on the blackboard, and risked bringing about the collapse of civilization. Gore was stunned: Why wasn\u2019t anyone talking about this? He had no memory of hearing it from his father, a three-term senator from Tennessee who later served as chairman of an Ohio coal company. Once in office, Gore figured that if Revelle gave Congress the same lecture, his colleagues would be moved to act. Or at least that the hearing would get picked up by one of the three major national news broadcasts.Gore\u2019s hearing was part of a larger campaign he had designed with his staff director, Tom Grumbly. After winning his third term in 1980, Gore was granted his first leadership position, albeit a modest one: chairman of an oversight subcommittee within the Committee on Science and Technology \u2014 a subcommittee that he had lobbied to create. Most in Congress considered the science committee a legislative backwater, if they considered it at all; this made Gore\u2019s subcommittee, which had no legislative authority, an afterthought to an afterthought. That, Gore vowed, would change. Environmental and health stories had all the elements of narrative drama: villains, victims and heroes. In a hearing, you could summon all three, with the chairman serving as narrator, chorus and moral authority. He told his staff director that he wanted to hold a hearing every week.It was like storyboarding episodes of a weekly procedural drama. Grumbly assembled a list of subjects that possessed the necessary dramatic elements: a Massachusetts cancer researcher who faked his results, the dangers of excessive salt in the American diet, the disappearance of an airplane on Long Island. All fit Gore\u2019s template; all had sizzle. But Gore wondered why Grumbly hadn\u2019t included the greenhouse effect.There are no villains, Grumbly said. Besides, who\u2019s your victim?If we don\u2019t do something, Gore replied, we\u2019re all going to be the victims.The Revelle hearing went as Grumbly had predicted. The urgency of the issue was lost on Gore\u2019s older colleagues, who drifted in and out while the witnesses testified. There were few people left by the time the Brookings Institution economist Lester Lave warned that humankind\u2019s profligate exploitation of fossil fuels posed an existential test to human nature. \u201cCarbon dioxide stands as a symbol now of our willingness to confront the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a sad day when we decide that we just don\u2019t have the time or thoughtfulness to address those issues.\u201d That night, the news programs featured the resolution of the baseball strike, the ongoing budgetary debate and the national surplus of butter.But Gore soon found another opening. Congressional staff members on the science committee heard that the White House planned to eliminate the Energy Department\u2019s carbon-dioxide program. If they could put a hearing together quickly enough, they could shame the White House before it could go through with its plan. The Times article about Hansen\u2019s paper had proved that there was a national audience for the carbon-dioxide problem \u2014 it just had to be framed correctly. Hansen could occupy the role of hero: a mild-mannered scientist who had seen the future and now sought to rouse the world to action. A villain was emerging, too: Fred Koomanoff, Reagan\u2019s new director of the Energy Department\u2019s carbon-dioxide program, a Bronx native with the manner of a sergeant major and an unconstrained passion for budget-cutting. Each man would testify.Hansen did not disclose to Gore\u2019s staff that, in late November, he received a letter from Koomanoff declining to fund his climate-modeling research despite a promise from Koomanoff\u2019s predecessor. Koomanoff left open the possibility of funding other carbon-dioxide research, but Hansen was not optimistic, and when his funding lapsed, he had to release five employees, half his staff. Koomanoff, it seemed, would not be moved. But the hearing would give Hansen the chance to appeal directly to the congressmen who oversaw Koomanoff\u2019s budget.Hansen flew to Washington to testify on March 25, 1982, performing before a gallery even more thinly populated than at Gore\u2019s first hearing on the greenhouse effect. Gore began by attacking the Reagan administration for cutting funding for carbon-dioxide research despite the \u201cbroad consensus in the scientific community that the greenhouse effect is a reality.\u201d William Carney, a Republican from New York, bemoaned the burning of fossil fuels and argued passionately that science should serve as the basis for legislative policy. Bob Shamansky, a Democrat from Ohio, objected to the use of the term \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d for such a horrifying phenomenon, because he had always enjoyed visiting greenhouses. \u201cEverything,\u201d he said, \u201cseems to flourish in there.\u201d He suggested that they call it the \u201cmicrowave oven\u201d effect, \u201cbecause we are not flourishing too well under this; apparently, we are getting cooked.\u201dThere emerged, despite the general comity, a partisan divide. Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans demanded action. \u201cToday I have a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d said Robert Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania. In each of the last five years, he said, \u201cwe have been told and told and told that there is a problem with the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all accept that fact, and we realize that the potential consequences are certainly major in their impact on mankind.\u201d Yet they had failed to propose a single law. \u201cNow is the time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research is clear. It is up to us now to summon the political will.\u201dGore disagreed: A higher degree of certainty was required, he believed, in order to persuade a majority of Congress to restrict the use of fossil fuels. The reforms required were of such magnitude and sweep that they \u201cwould challenge the political will of our civilization.\u201dYet the experts invited by Gore agreed with the Republicans: The science was certain enough. Melvin Calvin, a Berkeley chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the carbon cycle, said that it was useless to wait for stronger evidence of warming. \u201cYou cannot do a thing about it when the signals are so big that they come out of the noise,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to look for early warning signs.\u201dHansen\u2019s job was to share the warning signs, to translate the data into plain English. He explained a few discoveries that his team had made \u2014 not with computer models but in libraries. By analyzing records from hundreds of weather stations, he found that the surface temperature of the planet had already increased four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the previous century. Data from several hundred tide-gauge stations showed that the oceans had risen four inches since the 1880s. Most disturbing of all, century-old glass astronomy plates had revealed a new problem: Some of the more obscure greenhouse gases \u2014 especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a class of man-made substances used in refrigerators and spray cans \u2014 had proliferated wildly in recent years. \u201cWe may already have in the pipeline a larger amount of climate change than people generally realize,\u201d Hansen told the nearly empty room.Gore asked when the planet would reach a point of no return \u2014 a \u201ctrigger point,\u201d after which temperatures would spike. \u201cI want to know,\u201d Gore said, \u201cwhether I am going to face it or my kids are going to face it.\u201d\u201cYour kids are likely to face it,\u201d Calvin replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you will or not. You look pretty young.\u201dIt occurred to Hansen that this was the only political question that mattered: How long until the worst began? It was not a question on which geophysicists expended much effort; the difference between five years and 50 years in the future was meaningless in geologic time. Politicians were capable of thinking only in terms of electoral time: six years, four years, two years. But when it came to the carbon problem, the two time schemes were converging.\u201cWithin 10 or 20 years,\u201d Hansen said, \u201cwe will see climate changes which are clearly larger than the natural variability.\u201dJames Scheuer wanted to make sure he understood this correctly. No one else had predicted that the signal would emerge that quickly. \u201cIf it were one or two degrees per century,\u201d he said, \u201cthat would be within the range of human adaptability. But we are pushing beyond the range of human adaptability.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Hansen said.How soon, Scheuer asked, would they have to change the national model of energy production?Hansen hesitated \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a scientific question. But he couldn\u2019t help himself. He had been irritated, during the hearing, by all the ludicrous talk about the possibility of growing more trees to offset emissions. False hopes were worse than no hope at all: They undermined the prospect of developing real solutions.\u201cThat time is very soon,\u201d Hansen said finally.\u201cMy opinion is that it is past,\u201d Calvin said, but he was not heard because he spoke from his seat. He was told to speak into the microphone.\u201cIt is already later,\u201d Calvin said, \u201cthan you think.\u201dFrom Gore\u2019s perspective, the hearing was an unequivocal success. That night Dan Rather devoted three minutes of \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d to the greenhouse effect. A correspondent explained that temperatures had increased over the previous century, great sheets of pack ice in Antarctica were rapidly melting, the seas were rising; Calvin said that \u201cthe trend is all in the direction of an impending catastrophe\u201d; and Gore mocked Reagan for his shortsightedness. Later, Gore could take credit for protecting the Energy Department\u2019s carbon-dioxide program, which in the end was largely preserved.But Hansen did not get new funding for his carbon-dioxide research. He wondered whether he had been doomed by his testimony or by his conclusion, in the Science paper, that full exploitation of coal resources \u2014 a stated goal of Reagan\u2019s energy policy \u2014 was \u201cundesirable.\u201d Whatever the cause, he found himself alone. He knew he had done nothing wrong \u2014 he had only done diligent research and reported his findings, first to his peers, then to the American people. But now it seemed as if he was being punished for it.Anniek could read his disappointment, but she was not entirely displeased. Jim cut down on his work hours, leaving the Goddard Institute at 5 o\u2019clock each day, which allowed him to coach his children\u2019s basketball and baseball teams. (He was a patient, committed coach, detail-oriented, if a touch too competitive for his wife\u2019s liking.) At home, Jim spoke only about the teams and their fortunes, keeping to himself his musings \u2014 whether he would be able to secure federal funding for his climate experiments, whether the institute would be forced to move its office to Maryland to cut costs.But perhaps there were other ways forward. Not long after Hansen laid off five of his assistants, a major symposium he was helping to organize received overtures from a funding partner far wealthier and less ideologically blinkered than the Reagan administration: Exxon. Following Henry Shaw\u2019s recommendation to establish credibility ahead of any future legislative battles, Exxon had begun to spend conspicuously on global-warming research. It donated tens of thousands of dollars to some of the most prominent research efforts, including one at Woods Hole led by the ecologist George Woodwell, who had been calling for major climate policy as early as the mid-1970s, and an international effort coordinated by the United Nations. Now Shaw offered to fund the October 1982 symposium on climate change at Columbia\u2019s Lamont-Doherty campus.As an indication of the seriousness with which Exxon took the issue, Shaw sent Edward David Jr., the president of the research division and the former science adviser to Nixon. Hansen was glad for the support. He figured that Exxon\u2019s contributions might go well beyond picking up the bill for travel expenses, lodging and a dinner for dozens of scientists at the colonial-style Clinton Inn in Tenafly, N.J. As a gesture of appreciation, David was invited to give the keynote address.There were moments in David\u2019s speech in which he seemed to channel Rafe Pomerance. David boasted that Exxon would usher in a new global energy system to save the planet from the ravages of climate change. He went so far as to argue that capitalism\u2019s blind faith in the wisdom of the free market was \u201cless than satisfying\u201d when it came to the greenhouse effect. Ethical considerations were necessary, too. He pledged that Exxon would revise its corporate strategy to account for climate change, even if it were not \u201cfashionable\u201d to do so. As Exxon had already made heavy investments in nuclear and solar technology, he was \u201cgenerally upbeat\u201d that Exxon would \u201cinvent\u201d a future of renewable energy.Hansen had reason to feel upbeat himself. If the world\u2019s largest oil-and-gas company supported a new national energy model, the White House would not stand in its way. The Reagan administration was hostile to change from within its ranks. But it couldn\u2019t be hostile to Exxon.It seemed that something was beginning to turn. With the carbon-dioxide problem as with other environmental crises, the Reagan administration had alienated many of its own supporters. The early demonstrations of autocratic force had retreated into compromise and deference. By the end of 1982, multiple congressional committees were investigating Anne Gorsuch for her indifference to enforcing the cleanup of Superfund sites, and the House voted to hold her in contempt of Congress; Republicans in Congress turned on James Watt after he eliminated thousands of acres of land from consideration for wilderness designation. Each cabinet member would resign within a year.The carbon-dioxide issue was beginning to receive major national attention \u2014 Hansen\u2019s own findings had become front-page news, after all. What started as a scientific story was turning into a political story. This prospect would have alarmed Hansen several years earlier; it still made him uneasy. But he was beginning to understand that politics offered freedoms that the rigors of the scientific ethic denied. The political realm was itself a kind of Mirror World, a parallel reality that crudely mimicked our own. It shared many of our most fundamental laws, like the laws of gravity and inertia and publicity. And if you applied enough pressure, the Mirror World of politics could be sped forward to reveal a new future. Hansen was beginning to understand that too.From a stray comment in an obscure coal report to portentous front-page headlines in the national press and hearings on Capitol Hill \u2014 in just three years, Rafe Pomerance had watched as an issue considered esoteric even within the scientific community rose nearly to the level of action, the level at which congressmen made statements like, \u201cIt is up to us now to summon the political will.\u201d Then, overnight, it died. Pomerance knew, from tired experience, that politics didn\u2019t move in a straight line, but jaggedly, like the Keeling curve \u2014 a slow progression interrupted by sharp seasonal declines. But in the fall of 1983, the climate issue entered an especially long, dark winter. And all because of a single report that had done nothing to change the state of climate science but transformed the state of climate politics.After the publication of the Charney report in 1979, Jimmy Carter had directed the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a comprehensive, $1 million analysis of the carbon-dioxide problem: a Warren Commission for the greenhouse effect. A team of scientist-dignitaries \u2014 among them Revelle, the Princeton modeler Syukuro Manabe and the Harvard political economist Thomas Schelling, one of the intellectual architects of Cold War game theory \u2014 would review the literature, evaluate the consequences of global warming for the world order and propose remedies. Then Reagan won the White House.For the next three years, as the commission continued its work \u2014 drawing upon the help of about 70 experts from the fields of atmospheric chemistry, economics and political science, including veterans of the Charney group and the Manhattan Project \u2014 the incipient report served as the Reagan administration\u2019s answer to every question on the subject. There could be no climate policy, Fred Koomanoff and his associates said, until the academy ruled. In the Mirror World of the Reagan administration, the warming problem hadn\u2019t been abandoned at all. A careful, comprehensive solution was being devised. Everyone just had to wait for the academy\u2019s elders to explain what it was.On Oct. 19, 1983, the commission finally announced its findings at a formal gala, preceded by cocktails and dinner in the academy\u2019s cruciform Great Hall, a secular Sistine Chapel, with vaulted ceilings soaring to a dome painted as the sun. An inscription encircling the sun honored science as the \u201cpilot of industry,\u201d and the academy had invited the nation\u2019s foremost pilots of industry: Andrew Callegari, the head of Exxon\u2019s carbon-dioxide research program, and vice presidents from Peabody Coal, General Motors and the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. They were eager to learn how the United States planned to act, so they could prepare for the inevitable policy debates. Rafe Pomerance was eager, too. But he wasn\u2019t invited.The authors did try to imagine some of them: an ice-free Arctic, for instance, and Boston sinking into its harbor, Beacon Hill an island two miles off the coast. There was speculation about political revolution, trade wars and a long quotation from \u201cA Distant Mirror,\u201d a medieval history written by Pomerance\u2019s aunt, Barbara Tuchman, describing how climate changes in the 14th century led to \u201cpeople eating their own children\u201d and \u201cfeeding on hanged bodies taken down from the gibbet.\u201d The committee\u2019s chairman, William Nierenberg \u2014 a Jason, presidential adviser and director of Scripps, the nation\u2019s pre-eminent oceanographic institution \u2014 argued that action had to be taken immediately, before all the details could be known with certainty, or else it would be too late.That\u2019s what Nierenberg wrote in \u201cChanging Climate.\u201d But it\u2019s not what he said in the press interviews that followed. He argued the opposite: There was no urgent need for action. The public should not entertain the most \u201cextreme negative speculations\u201d about climate change (despite the fact that many of those speculations appeared in his report). Though \u201cChanging Climate\u201d urged an accelerated transition to renewable fuels, noting that it would take thousands of years for the atmosphere to recover from the damage of the last century, Nierenberg recommended \u201ccaution, not panic.\u201d Better to wait and see. Better to bet on American ingenuity to save the day. Major interventions in national energy policy, taken immediately, might end up being more expensive, and less effective, than actions taken decades in the future, after more was understood about the economic and social consequences of a warmer planet. Yes, the climate would change, mostly for the worst, but future generations would be better equipped to change with it.As Pomerance listened at the briefing to the commission\u2019s appeasements, he glanced, baffled, around the room. The reporters and staff members listened politely to the presentation and took dutiful notes, as at any technical briefing. Government officials who knew Nierenberg were not surprised by his conclusions: He was an optimist by training and experience, a devout believer in the doctrine of American exceptionalism, one of the elite class of scientists who had helped the nation win a global war, invent the most deadly weapon conceivable and create the booming aerospace and computer industries. America had solved every existential problem it had confronted over the previous generation; it would not be daunted by an excess of carbon dioxide. Nierenberg had also served on Reagan\u2019s transition team. Nobody believed that he had been directly influenced by his political connections, but his views \u2014 optimistic about the saving graces of market forces, pessimistic about the value of government regulation \u2014 reflected all the ardor of his party.The damage of \u201cChanging Climate\u201d was squared by the amount of attention it received. Nierenberg\u2019s speech in the Great Hall, being one-500th the length of the actual assessment, received 500 times the press coverage. As The Wall Street Journal put it, in a line echoed by trade journals across the nation: \u201cA panel of top scientists has some advice for people worried about the much-publicized warming of the Earth\u2019s climate: You can cope.\u201d The effusiveness of Nierenberg\u2019s reassurances invited derision. On \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d Dan Rather said the academy had given \u201ca cold shoulder\u201d to a grim, 200-page E.P.A. assessment published earlier that week (titled \u201cCan We Delay a Greenhouse Warming?\u201d; the E.P.A.\u2019s answer, reduced to a word, was no). The Washington Post described the two reports, taken together, as \u201cclarion calls to inaction.\u201dOn its front page, The New York Times published its most prominent piece on global warming to date, under the headline \u201cHaste on Global Warming Trend Is Opposed.\u201d Although the paper included an excerpt from \u201cChanging Climate\u201d that detailed some of the report\u2019s gloomier predictions, the article itself gave the greatest weight to a statement, heavily workshopped by the White House\u2019s senior staff, from George Keyworth II, Reagan\u2019s science adviser. Keyworth used Nierenberg\u2019s optimism as reason to discount the E.P.A.\u2019s \u201cunwarranted and unnecessarily alarmist\u201d report and warned against taking any \u201cnear-term corrective action\u201d on global warming. Just in case it wasn\u2019t clear, Keyworth added, \u201cthere are no actions recommended other than continued research.\u201dExxon soon revised its position on climate-change research. In a presentation at an industry conference, Henry Shaw cited \u201cChanging Climate\u201d as evidence that \u201cthe general consensus is that society has sufficient time to technologically adapt to a CO\u2082 greenhouse effect.\u201d If the academy had concluded that regulations were not a serious option, why should Exxon protest? Edward David Jr., two years removed from boasting of Exxon\u2019s commitment to transforming global energy policy, told Science that the corporation had reconsidered. \u201cExxon has reverted to being mainly a supplier of conventional hydrocarbon fuels \u2014 petroleum products, natural gas and steam coal,\u201d David said. The American Petroleum Institute canceled its own carbon-dioxide research program, too.A few months after the publication of \u201cChanging Climate,\u201d Pomerance announced his resignation from Friends of the Earth. He had various reasons: He had struggled with the politics of managing a staff and a board, and the environmental movement from which the organization had emerged in the early \u201970s was in crisis. It lacked a unifying cause. Climate change, Pomerance believed, could be that cause. But its insubstantiality made it difficult to rally the older activists, whose strategic model relied on protests at sites of horrific degradation \u2014 Love Canal, Hetch Hetchy, Three Mile Island. How did you protest when the toxic waste dump was the entire planet or, worse, its invisible atmosphere?Observing her husband, Lenore Pomerance was reminded of an old Philadelphia Bulletin ad campaign: \u201cIn Philadelphia \u2014 nearly everyone reads The Bulletin.\u201d On a crowded beach, all the sunbathers have their faces buried in their newspapers, except for one man, who stares off into the distance. Here the scenario was reversed: Rafe, the loner, was staring down the world\u2019s largest problem while everyone else was distracted by the minutiae of daily life. Pomerance acted cheerful at home, fooling his kids. But he couldn\u2019t fool Lenore. She worried about his health. Near the end of his tenure at Friends of the Earth, a doctor found that he had an abnormally high heart rate.Pomerance planned to take a couple of months to reflect on what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Two months stretched to about a year. He brooded; he checked out. He spent weeks at a time at an old farmhouse that he and Lenore owned in West Virginia, near Seneca Rocks. When they bought it in the early \u201970s, the house had a wood-burning stove and no running water. To make a phone call on a private line, you had drive to the operator\u2019s house and hope she was in. Pomerance sat in the cold house and thought.The winter took him back to his childhood in Greenwich. He had a vivid memory of being taught by his mother to ice skate on a frozen pond a short walk from their home. He remembered the muffled hush of twilight, the snow dusting the ice, the ghostly clearing encircled by a wood darker than the night. Their house was designed by his father, an architect whose glass-enveloped buildings mocked the vanity of humankind\u2019s efforts to improve on nature; the windows invited the elements inside, the trees and the ice and, in the rattling of the broad panes, the wind. Winter, Pomerance believed, was part of his soul. When he thought about the future, he worried about the loss of ice, the loss of the spiky Connecticut January mornings. He worried about the loss of some irreplaceable part of himself.He wanted to recommit himself to the fight but couldn\u2019t figure out how. If science, industry and the press could not move the government to act, then who could? He didn\u2019t see what was left for him, or anyone else, to do. He didn\u2019t see that the answer was at that moment floating over his head, about 10 miles above his West Virginian farmhouse, just above the highest clouds in the sky.It was as if, without warning, the sky opened and the sun burst through in all its irradiating, blinding fury. The mental image was of a pin stuck through a balloon, a chink in an eggshell, a crack in the ceiling \u2014 Armageddon descending from above. It was a sudden global emergency: There was a hole in the ozone layer.The klaxon was rung by a team of British government scientists, until then little known in the field, who made regular visits to research stations in Antarctica \u2014 one on the Argentine Islands, the other on a sheet of ice floating into the sea at the rate of a quarter mile per year. At each site, the scientists had set up a machine invented in the 1920s called the Dobson spectrophotometer, which resembled a large slide projector turned with its eye staring straight up. After several years of results so alarming that they disbelieved their own evidence, the British scientists at last reported their discovery in an article published in May 1985 by Nature. \u201cThe spring values of total O\u2083 in Antarctica have now fallen considerably,\u201d the abstract read. But by the time the news filtered into national headlines and television broadcasts several months later, it had transfigured into something far more terrifying: a substantial increase in skin cancer, a sharp decline in the global agricultural yield and the mass death of fish larva, near the base of the marine food chain. Later came fears of atrophied immune systems and blindness.The urgency of the alarm seemed to have everything to do with the phrase \u201ca hole in the ozone layer,\u201d which, charitably put, was a mixed metaphor. For there was no hole, and there was no layer. Ozone, which shielded Earth from ultraviolet radiation, was distributed throughout the atmosphere, settling mostly in the middle stratosphere and never in a concentration higher than 15 parts per million. As for the \u201chole\u201d \u2014 while the amount of ozone over Antarctica had declined drastically, the depletion was a temporary phenomenon, lasting about two months a year. In satellite images colorized to show ozone density, however, the darker region appeared to depict a void. When F.Sherwood Rowland, one of the chemists who identified the problem in 1974, spoke of the \u201cozone hole\u201d in a university slide lecture in November 1985, the crisis found its catchphrase. The New York Times used it that same day in its article about the British team\u2019s findings, and while scientific journals initially refused to use the term, within a year it was unavoidable. The ozone crisis had its signal, which was also a symbol: a hole.It was already understood, thanks to the work of Rowland and his colleague Mario Molina, that the damage was largely caused by the man-made CFCs used in refrigerators, spray bottles and plastic foams, which escaped into the stratosphere and devoured ozone molecules. It was also understood that the ozone problem and the greenhouse-gas problem were linked. CFCs were unusually potent greenhouse gases. Though CFCs had been mass-produced only since the 1930s, they were already responsible, by Jim Hansen\u2019s calculation, for nearly half of Earth\u2019s warming during the 1970s. But nobody was worried about CFCs because of their warming potential. They were worried about getting skin cancer.The United Nations, through two of its intergovernmental agencies \u2014 the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization \u2014 had in 1977 established a World Plan of Action on the Ozone Layer. In 1985, UNEP adopted a framework for a global treaty, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The negotiators failed to agree upon any specific CFC regulations in Vienna, but after the British scientists reported their findings from the Antarctic two months later, the Reagan administration proposed a reduction in CFC emissions of 95 percent. The speed of the reversal was all the more remarkable because CFC regulation faced virulent opposition. Dozens of American businesses with the word \u201crefrigeration\u201d in their names, together with hundreds involved in the production, manufacture and consumption of chemicals, plastics, paper goods and frozen food \u2014 around 500 companies in total, from DuPont and the American Petroleum Institute to Mrs. Smith\u2019s Frozen Food Company of Pottstown, Pa. \u2014 had united in 1980 as the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy. The alliance hounded the E.P.A., members of Congress and Reagan himself, insisting that ozone science was uncertain. The few concessions the alliance won, like forcing the E.P.A. to withdraw a plan to regulate CFCs, were swiftly overturned by lawsuits, and once the public discovered the \u201cozone hole,\u201d every relevant government agency and every sitting United States senator urged the president to endorse the United Nations\u2019 plans for a treaty. When Reagan finally submitted the Vienna Convention to the Senate for ratification, he praised the \u201cleading role\u201d played by the United States, fooling nobody.Senior members of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, including Bert Bolin, a veteran of the Charney group, began to wonder whether they could do for the carbon-dioxide problem what they had done for ozone policy. The organizations had been holding semiannual conferences on global warming since the early 1970s. But in 1985, just several months after the bad news from the Antarctic, at an otherwise sleepy meeting in Villach, Austria, the assembled 89 scientists from 29 countries began to discuss a subject that fell wildly outside their discipline: politics.An Irish hydrology expert asked if his country should reconsider the location of its dams. A Dutch seacoast engineer questioned the wisdom of rebuilding dikes that had been destroyed by recent floods. And the conference\u2019s chairman, James Bruce, an unassuming, pragmatic hydrometeorologist from Ontario, posed a question that shocked his audience.Bruce was a minister of the Canadian environmental agency, a position that conferred him the esteem that his American counterparts had forfeited when Reagan won the White House. Just before leaving for Villach, he met with provincial dam and hydropower managers. O.K., one of them said, you scientists win. You\u2019ve convinced me that the climate is changing. Well, tell me how it\u2019s changing. In 20 years, will the rain be falling somewhere else?Bruce took this challenge to Villach: You\u2019re the experts. What am I supposed to tell him? People are hearing the message, and they want to hear more. So how do we, in the scientific world, begin a dialogue with the world of action?The formal report ratified at Villach contained the most forceful warnings yet issued by a scientific body. Most major economic decisions undertaken by nations, it pointed out, were based on the assumption that past climate conditions were a reliable guide to the future. But the future would not look like the past. Though some warming was inevitable, the scientists wrote, the extent of the disaster could be \u201cprofoundly affected\u201d by aggressive, coordinated government policies. Fortunately there was a new model in place to achieve just that. The balloon could be patched, the eggshell bandaged, the ceiling replastered. There was still time.It was the spring of 1986, and Curtis Moore, a Republican staff member on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, was telling Rafe Pomerance that the greenhouse effect wasn\u2019t a problem.With his last ounce of patience, Pomerance begged to disagree.He had followed the rapid ascension of the ozone issue with the rueful admiration of a competitor. He was thrilled for its success \u2014 however inadvertently, the treaty would serve as the world\u2019s first action to delay climate change. But it offered an especially acute challenge for Pomerance, who after his yearlong hiatus had become, as far as he knew, the nation\u2019s first, and only, full-time global-warming lobbyist. At the suggestion of Gordon MacDonald, Pomerance joined the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit begun by Gus Speth, a senior environmental official in Jimmy Carter\u2019s White House and a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Unlike Friends of the Earth, W.R.I. was not an activist organization; it occupied the nebulous intersection of politics, international relations and energy policy. Its mission was expansive enough to allow Pomerance to work without interference. Yet the only thing that anyone on Capitol Hill wanted to talk about was ozone.That was Curtis Moore\u2019s proposal: Use ozone to revive climate. The ozone hole had a solution \u2014 an international treaty, already in negotiation. Why not hitch the milk wagon to the bullet train? Pomerance was skeptical. The problems were related, sure: Without a reduction in CFC emissions, you didn\u2019t have a chance of averting cataclysmic global warming. But it had been difficult enough to explain the carbon issue to politicians and journalists; why complicate the sales pitch? Then again, he didn\u2019t see what choice he had. The Republicans controlled the Senate, and Moore was his connection to the Senate\u2019s environmental committee.Moore came through. At his suggestion, Pomerance met with Senator John Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island, and helped persuade him to hold a double-barreled hearing on the twin problems of ozone and carbon dioxide on June 10 and 11, 1986. F.Sherwood Rowland, Robert Watson, a NASA scientist, and Richard Benedick, the administration\u2019s lead representative in international ozone negotiations, would discuss ozone; James Hansen, Al Gore, the ecologist George Woodwell and Carl Wunsch, a veteran of the Charney group, would testify about climate change. As soon as the first witness appeared, Pomerance realized that Moore\u2019s instincts had been right. The ozone gang was good.Robert Watson dimmed the lights in the hearing room. On a flimsy screen, he projected footage with the staticky, low-budget quality of a slasher flick. It showed a bird\u2019s-eye view of the Antarctic, partly obscured by spiraling clouds. The footage was so convincing that Chafee had to ask whether it was an actual satellite image. Watson acknowledged that though created by satellite data, it was, in fact, a simulation. An animation, to be precise. The three-minute video showed every day of October \u2014 the month during which the ozone thinned most drastically \u2014 for seven consecutive years. (The other months, conveniently, were omitted.) A canny filmmaker had colored the \u201cozone hole\u201d pink. As the years sped forward, the polar vortex madly gyroscoping, the hole expanded until it obscured most of Antarctica. The smudge turned mauve, representing an even thinner density of ozone, and then the dark purple of a hemorrhaging wound. The data represented in the video wasn\u2019t new, but nobody had thought to represent it in this medium. If F.Sherwood Rowland\u2019s earlier colorized images were crime-scene photographs, Watson\u2019s video was a surveillance camera catching the killer red-handed.As Pomerance had hoped, fear about the ozone layer ensured a bounty of press coverage for the climate-change testimony. But as he had feared, it caused many people to conflate the two crises. One was Peter Jennings, who aired the video on ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight,\u201d warning that the ozone hole \u201ccould lead to flooding all over the world, also to drought and to famine.\u201dThe confusion helped: For the first time since the \u201cChanging Climate\u201d report, global-warming headlines appeared by the dozen. William Nierenberg\u2019s \u201ccaution, not panic\u201d line was inverted. It was all panic without a hint of caution: \u201cA Dire Forecast for \u2018Greenhouse\u2019 Earth\u201d (the front page of The Washington Post); \u201cScientists Predict Catastrophes in Growing Global Heat Wave\u201d (Chicago Tribune); \u201cSwifter Warming of Globe Foreseen\u201d (The New York Times). On the second day of the Senate hearing, devoted to global warming, every seat in the gallery was occupied; four men squeezed together on a broad window sill.Pomerance had suggested that Chafee, instead of opening with the typical statement about the need for more research, deliver a call for action. But Chafee went further: He called for the State Department to begin negotiations on an international solution with the Soviet Union. It was the kind of proposal that would have been unthinkable even a year earlier, but the ozone issue had established a precedent for global environmental problems: high-level meetings among the world\u2019s most powerful nations, followed by a global summit meeting to negotiate a framework for a treaty to restrict emissions.After three years of backsliding and silence, Pomerance was exhilarated to see interest in the issue spike overnight. Not only that: A solution materialized, and a moral argument was passionately articulated \u2014 by Rhode Island\u2019s Republican senator no less. \u201cOzone depletion and the greenhouse effect can no longer be treated solely as important scientific questions,\u201d Chafee said. \u201cThey must be seen as critical problems facing the nations of the world, and they are problems that demand solutions.\u201dThe old canard about the need for more research was roundly mocked \u2014 by Woodwell, by a W.R.I. colleague named Andrew Maguire, by Senator George Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine. \u201cScientists are never 100 percent certain,\u201d the Princeton historian Theodore Rabb testified. \u201cThat notion of total certainty is something too elusive ever to be sought.\u201d As Pomerance had been saying since 1979, it was past time to act. Only now the argument was so broadly accepted that nobody dared object.The ozone hole, Pomerance realized, had moved the public because, though it was no more visible than global warming, people could be made to see it. They could watch it grow on video. Its metaphors were emotionally wrought: Instead of summoning a glass building that sheltered plants from chilly weather (\u201cEverything seems to flourish in there\u201d), the hole evoked a violent rending of the firmament, inviting deathly radiation. Americans felt that their lives were in danger. An abstract, atmospheric problem had been reduced to the size of the human imagination. It had been made just small enough, and just large enough, to break through.Four years after \u201cChanging Climate,\u201d two years after a hole had torn open the firmament and a month after the United States and more than three dozen other nations signed a treaty to limit use of CFCs, the climate-change corps was ready to celebrate. It had become conventional wisdom that climate change would follow ozone\u2019s trajectory. Reagan\u2019s E.P.A. administrator, Lee M. Thomas, said as much the day he signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer (the successor to the Vienna Convention), telling reporters that global warming was likely to be the subject of a future international agreement. Congress had already begun to consider policy \u2014 in 1987 alone, there were eight days of climate hearings, in three committees, across both chambers of Congress; Senator Joe Biden, a Delaware Democrat, had introduced legislation to establish a national climate-change strategy. And so it was that Jim Hansen found himself on Oct. 27 in the not especially distinguished ballroom of the Quality Inn on New Jersey Avenue, a block from the Capitol, at \u201cPreparing for Climate Change,\u201d which was technically a conference but felt more like a wedding.The convivial mood had something to do with its host. John Topping was an old-line Rockefeller Republican, a Commerce Department lawyer under Nixon and an E.P.A. official under Reagan. He first heard about the climate problem in the halls of the E.P.A. in 1982 and sought out Hansen, who gave him a personal tutorial. Topping was amazed to discover that out of the E.P.A.\u2019s 13,000-person staff, only seven people, by his count, were assigned to work on climate, though he figured it was more important to the long-term security of the nation than every other environmental issue combined. After leaving the administration, he founded a nonprofit organization, the Climate Institute, to bring together scientists, politicians and businesspeople to discuss policy solutions. He didn\u2019t have any difficulty raising $150,000 to hold \u201cPreparing for Climate Change\u201d; the major sponsors included BP America, General Electric and the American Gas Association. Topping\u2019s industry friends were intrigued. If a guy like Topping thought this greenhouse business was important, they\u2019d better see what it was all about.Glancing around the room, Jim Hansen could chart, like an arborist counting rings on a stump, the growth of the climate issue over the decade. Veterans like Gordon MacDonald, George Woodwell and the environmental biologist Stephen Schneider stood at the center of things. Former and current staff members from the congressional science committees (Tom Grumbly, Curtis Moore, Anthony Scoville) made introductions to the congressmen they advised. Hansen\u2019s owlish nemesis Fred Koomanoff was present, as were his counterparts from the Soviet Union and Western Europe. Rafe Pomerance\u2019s cranium could be seen above the crowd, but unusually he was surrounded by colleagues from other environmental organizations that until now had shown little interest in a diffuse problem with no proven fund-raising record. The party\u2019s most conspicuous newcomers, however, the outermost ring, were the oil-and-gas executives.It was not entirely surprising to see envoys from Exxon, the Gas Research Institute and the electrical-grid trade groups, even if they had been silent since \u201cChanging Climate.\u201d But they were joined by executives from General Electric, AT&T and the American Petroleum Institute, which that spring had invited a leading government scientist to make the case for a transition to renewable energy at the industry\u2019s annual world conference in Houston. Even Richard Barnett was there, the chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, the face of the campaign to defeat an ozone treaty. Barnett\u2019s retreat had been humiliating and swift: After DuPont, by far the world\u2019s single largest manufacturer of CFCs, realized that it stood to profit from the transition to replacement chemicals, the alliance abruptly reversed its position, demanding that the United States sign a treaty as soon as possible. Now Barnett, at the Quality Inn, was speaking about how \u201cwe bask in the glory of the Montreal Protocol\u201d and quoting Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d to express his hope for a renewed alliance between industry and environmentalists. There were more than 250 people in all in the old ballroom, and if the concentric rings extended any further, you would have needed a larger hotel.That evening, as a storm spat and coughed outside, Rafe Pomerance gave one of his exhortative speeches urging cooperation among the various factions, and John Chafee and Roger Revelle received awards; introductions were made and business cards earnestly exchanged. Not even a presentation by Hansen of his research could sour the mood. The next night, on Oct. 28, at a high-spirited dinner party in Topping\u2019s townhouse on Capitol Hill, the oil-and-gas men joked with the environmentalists, the trade-group representatives chatted up the regulators and the academics got merrily drunk. Mikhail Budyko, the don of the Soviet climatologists, settled into an extended conversation about global warming with Topping\u2019s 10-year-old son. It all seemed like the start of a grand bargain, a uniting of factions \u2014 a solution.It was perhaps because of all this good cheer that it was Hansen\u2019s instinct to shrug off a peculiar series of events that took place just a week later. He was scheduled to appear before another Senate hearing, this time devoted entirely to climate change. It was called by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources after Rafe Pomerance and Gordon MacDonald persuaded its chairman, Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana, of the issue\u2019s significance for the future of the oil-and-gas industry (Louisiana ranked third among states in oil production). Hansen was accustomed to the bureaucratic nuisances that attended testifying before Congress; before a hearing, he had to send his formal statement to NASA headquarters, which forwarded it to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget for approval. \u201cMajor greenhouse climate changes are a certainty,\u201d he had written. \u201cBy the 2010s [in every scenario], essentially the entire globe has very substantial warming.\u201dThe process appeared entirely perfunctory, but this time, on the Friday evening before his appearance that Monday, he was informed that the White House demanded changes to his testimony. No rationale was provided. Nor did Hansen understand by what authority it could censor scientific findings. He told the administrator in NASA\u2019s legislative-affairs office that he refused to make the changes. If that meant he couldn\u2019t testify, so be it.The NASA administrator had another idea. The Office of Management and Budget had the authority to approve government witnesses, she explained. But it couldn\u2019t censor a private citizen.At the hearing three days later, on Monday, Nov. 9, Hansen was listed as \u201cAtmospheric Scientist, New York, N.Y. \u201d \u2014 as if he were a crank with a telescope who had stumbled into the Senate off the street. He was careful to emphasize the absurdity of the situation in his opening remarks, at least to the degree that his Midwestern reserve would allow: \u201cBefore I begin, I would like to state that although I direct the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, I am appearing here as a private citizen.\u201d In the most understated terms available to him, Hansen provided his credentials: \u201cTen years\u2019 experience in terrestrial climate studies and more than 10 years\u2019 experience in the exploration and study of other planetary atmospheres.\u201dAssuming that one of the senators would immediately ask about this odd introduction, Hansen had prepared an elegant response. He planned to say that although his NASA colleagues endorsed his findings, the White House had insisted he utter false statements that would have distorted his conclusions. He figured this would lead to an uproar. But no senator thought to ask about his title. So the atmospheric scientist from New York City said nothing else about it.After the hearing, he went to lunch with John Topping, who was stunned to hear of the White House\u2019s ham-handed attempt to silence him. \u201cUh, oh,\u201d Topping joked, \u201cJim is a dangerous man. We\u2019re going to have to rally the troops to protect him.\u201d The idea that quiet, sober Jim Hansen could be seen as a threat to anyone, let alone national security \u2014 well, it was enough to make him laugh.But the brush with state censorship stayed with Hansen in the months ahead. It confirmed that even after the political triumph of the Montreal Protocol and the bipartisan support of climate policy, there were still people within the White House who hoped to prevent a debate. In its public statements, the administration showed no such reluctance: By all appearances, plans for major policy continued to advance rapidly. After the Johnston hearing, Timothy Wirth, a freshman Democratic senator from Colorado on the energy committee, began to plan a comprehensive package of climate-change legislation \u2014 a New Deal for global warming. Wirth asked a legislative assistant, David Harwood, to consult with experts on the issue, beginning with Rafe Pomerance, in the hope of converting the science of climate change into a new national energy policy.In March 1988, Wirth joined 41 other senators, nearly half of them Republicans, to demand that Reagan call for an international treaty modeled after the ozone agreement. Because the United States and the Soviet Union were the world\u2019s two largest contributors of carbon emissions, responsible for about one-third of the world total, they should lead the negotiations. Reagan agreed. In May, he signed a joint statement with Mikhail Gorbachev that included a pledge to cooperate on global warming.But a pledge didn\u2019t reduce emissions. Hansen was learning to think more strategically \u2014 less like a scientist, more like a politician. Despite the efforts of Wirth, there was as yet no serious plan nationally or internationally to address climate change. Even Al Gore himself had, for the moment, withdrawn his political claim to the issue. In 1987, at the age of 39, Gore announced that he was running for president, in part to bring attention to global warming, but he stopped emphasizing it after the subject failed to captivate New Hampshire primary voters.Hansen told Pomerance that the biggest problem with the Johnston hearing, at least apart from the whole censorship business, had been the month in which it was held: November. \u201cThis business of having global-warming hearings in such cool weather is never going to get attention,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t joking. At first he assumed that it was enough to publish studies about global warming and that the government would spring into action. Then he figured that his statements to Congress would do it. It had seemed, at least momentarily, that industry, understanding what was at stake, might lead. But nothing had worked.As spring turned to summer, Anniek Hansen noticed a change in her husband\u2019s disposition. He grew pale and unusually thin. When she asked him about his day, Hansen replied with some ambiguity and turned the conversation to sports: the Yankees, his daughter\u2019s basketball team, his son\u2019s baseball team. But even for him, he was unusually quiet, serious, distracted. Anniek would begin a conversation and find that he hadn\u2019t heard a word she said. She knew what he was thinking: He was running out of time. We were running out of time. Then came the summer of 1988, and Jim Hansen wasn\u2019t the only one who could tell that time was running out.It was the hottest and driest summer in history. Everywhere you looked, something was bursting into flames. Two million acres in Alaska incinerated, and dozens of major fires scored the West. Yellowstone National Park lost nearly one million acres. Smoke was visible from Chicago, 1,600 miles away.In Nebraska, suffering its worst drought since the Dust Bowl, there were days when every weather station registered temperatures above 100 degrees. The director of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment warned that the drought might be the dawning of a climatic change that within a half century could turn the state into a desert. \u201cThe dang heat,\u201d said a farmer in Grinnell. \u201cFarming has so many perils, but climate is 99 percent of it.\u201d In parts of Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson banned fireworks and smoking cigarettes outdoors, the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers evaporated completely. \u201cAt that point,\u201d said an official from the Department of Natural Resources, \u201cwe must just sit back and watch the fish die.\u201dHarvard University, for the first time, closed because of heat. New York City\u2019s streets melted, its mosquito population quadrupled and its murder rate reached a record high. \u201cIt\u2019s a chore just to walk,\u201d a former hostage negotiator told a reporter. \u201cYou want to be left alone.\u201d The 28th floor of Los Angeles\u2019s second-tallest building burst into flames; the cause, the Fire Department concluded, was spontaneous combustion. Ducks fled the continental United States in search of wetlands, many ending up in Alaska, swelling the pintail population there to 1.5 million from 100,000. \u201cHow do you spell relief?\u201d asked a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service. \u201cIf you are a duck from America\u2019s parched prairies, this year you may spell it A-L-A-S-K-A.\u201dNineteen Miss Indiana contestants, outfitted with raincoats and umbrellas, sang \u201cCome Rain or Come Shine,\u201d but it did not rain. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Democratic presidential candidate, stood in an Illinois cornfield and prayed for rain, but it did not rain. Cliff Doebel, the owner of a gardening store in Clyde, Ohio, paid $2,000 to import Leonard Crow Dog, a Sioux Indian medicine man from Rosebud, S.D. Crow Dog claimed to have performed 127 rain dances, all successful. \u201cYou will see things that you shall believe,\u201d he told the townspeople of Clyde. \u201cYou will feel there is a chance for us all.\u201d After three days of dancing, it rained less than a quarter of an inch.Texas farmers fed their cattle cactus. Stretches of the Mississippi River flowed at less than one-fifth of normal capacity. Roughly 1,700 barges beached at Greenville, Miss.; an additional 2,000 were marooned at St. Louis and Memphis. The on-field thermometer at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where the Phillies were hosting the Chicago Cubs for a matinee, read 130 degrees. During a pitching change, every player, coach and umpire, save the catcher and the entering reliever, Todd Frohwirth, fled into the dugouts. (Frohwirth would earn the victory.) In the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood on June 21, yet another record-smasher, a roofer working with 600-degree tar exclaimed, \u201cWill this madness ever end?\u201dOn June 22 in Washington, where it hit 100 degrees, Rafe Pomerance received a call from Jim Hansen, who was scheduled to testify the following morning at a Senate hearing called by Timothy Wirth.\u201cI hope we have good media coverage tomorrow,\u201d Hansen said.This amused Pomerance. He was the one who tended to worry about press; Hansen usually claimed indifference to such vulgar considerations. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Pomerance asked.Hansen had just received the most recent global temperature data. Just over halfway into the year, 1988 was setting records. Already it had nearly clinched the hottest year in history. Ahead of schedule, the signal was emerging from the noise.\u201cI\u2019m going to make a pretty strong statement,\u201d Hansen said.The night before the hearing, Hansen flew to Washington to give himself enough time to prepare his oral testimony in his hotel room. But he couldn\u2019t focus \u2014 the ballgame was on the radio. The slumping Yankees, who had fallen behind the Tigers for first place, were trying to avoid a sweep in Detroit, and the game went to extra innings. Hansen fell asleep without finishing his statement. He awoke to bright sunlight, high humidity, choking heat. It was signal weather in Washington: the hottest June 23 in history.Before going to the Capitol, he attended a meeting at NASA headquarters. One of his early champions at the agency, Ichtiaque Rasool, was announcing the creation of a new carbon-dioxide program. Hansen, sitting in a room with dozens of scientists, continued to scribble his testimony under the table, barely listening. But he heard Rasool say that the goal of the new program was to determine when a warming signal might emerge. As you all know, Rasool said, no respectable scientist would say that you already have a signal.Hansen interrupted.\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s respectable or not,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I do know one scientist who is about to tell the U.S. Senate that the signal has emerged.\u201dThe other scientists looked up in surprise, but Rasool ignored Hansen and continued his presentation. Hansen returned to his testimony. He wrote: \u201cThe global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause-and-effect relationship to the greenhouse effect.\u201d He wrote: \u201c1988 so far is so much warmer than 1987, that barring a remarkable and improbable cooling, 1988 will be the warmest year on record.\u201d He wrote: \u201cThe greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now.\u201dBy 2:10 p.m., when the session began, it was 98 degrees, and not much cooler in Room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, thanks to the two rows of television-camera lights. Timothy Wirth\u2019s office had told reporters that the plain-spoken NASA scientist was going to make a major statement. After the staff members saw the cameras, even those senators who hadn\u2019t planned to attend appeared at the dais, hastily reviewing the remarks their aides had drafted for them. Half an hour before the hearing, Wirth pulled Hansen aside. He wanted to change the order of speakers, placing Hansen first. The senator wanted to make sure that Hansen\u2019s statement got the proper amount of attention. Hansen agreed.\u201cWe have only one planet,\u201d Senator Bennett Johnston intoned. \u201cIf we screw it up, we have no place to go.\u201d Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana, called for the United Nations Environment Program to begin preparing a global remedy to the carbon-dioxide problem. Senator Dale Bumpers, a Democrat of Arkansas, previewed Hansen\u2019s testimony, saying that it \u201cought to be cause for headlines in every newspaper in America tomorrow morning.\u201d The coverage, Bumpers emphasized, was a necessary precursor to policy. \u201cNobody wants to take on any of the industries that produce the things that we throw up into the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what you have are all these competing interests pitted against our very survival.\u201dWirth asked those standing in the gallery to claim the few remaining seats available. \u201cThere is no point in standing up through this on a hot day,\u201d he said, happy for the occasion to emphasize the historical heat. Then he introduced the star witness.Hansen, wiping his brow, spoke without affect, his eyes rarely rising from his notes. The warming trend could be detected \u201cwith 99 percent confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is changing our climate now.\u201d But he saved his strongest comment for after the hearing, when he was encircled in the hallway by reporters. \u201cIt is time to stop waffling so much,\u201d he said, \u201cand say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.\u201dThe press followed Bumpers\u2019s advice. Hansen\u2019s testimony prompted headlines in dozens of newspapers across the country, including The New York Times, which announced, across the top of its front page: \u201cGlobal Warming Has Begun, Expert Tells Senate.\u201dBut Hansen had no time to dwell on any of this. As soon as he got home to New York, Anniek told him she had breast cancer. She had found out two weeks earlier, but she didn\u2019t want to upset him before the hearing. In the following days, while the entire world tried to learn about James Hansen, he tried to learn about Anniek\u2019s illness. After he absorbed the initial shock and made a truce with the fear \u2014 his grandmother died from the disease \u2014 he dedicated himself to his wife\u2019s treatment with all the rigor of his profession. As they weighed treatment options and analyzed medical data, Anniek noticed him begin to change. The frustration of the last year began to fall away. It yielded, in those doctor\u2019s offices, to a steady coolness, an obsession for detail, a dogged optimism. He began to look like himself again.In the immediate flush of optimism after the Wirth hearing \u2014 henceforth known as the Hansen hearing \u2014 Rafe Pomerance called his allies on Capitol Hill, the young staff members who advised politicians, organized hearings, wrote legislation. We need to finalize a number, he told them, a specific target, in order to move the issue \u2014 to turn all this publicity into policy. The Montreal Protocol had called for a 50 percent reduction in CFC emissions by 1998. What was the right target for carbon emissions? It wasn\u2019t enough to exhort nations to do better. That kind of talk might sound noble, but it didn\u2019t change investments or laws. They needed a hard goal \u2014 something ambitious but reasonable. And they needed it soon: Just four days after Hansen\u2019s star turn, politicians from 46 nations and more than 300 scientists would convene in Toronto at the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, an event described by Philip Shabecoff of The New York Times as \u201cWoodstock for climate change.\u201dPomerance hastily arranged a meeting with, among others, David Harwood, the architect of Wirth\u2019s climate legislation; Roger Dower in the Congressional Budget Office, who was calculating the plausibility of a national carbon tax; and Irving Mintzer, a colleague at the World Resources Institute who had a deep knowledge of energy economics. Wirth was scheduled to give the keynote address at Toronto \u2014 Harwood would write it \u2014 and could propose a number then. But which one?Pomerance had a proposal: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2000.Ambitious, Harwood said. In all his work planning climate policy, he had seen no assurance that such a steep drop in emissions was possible. Then again, 2000 was more than a decade off, so it allowed for some flexibility.What really mattered wasn\u2019t the number itself, Dower said, but simply that they settle on one. He agreed that a hard target was the only way to push the issue forward. Though his job at the C.B.O. required him to come up with precise estimates of speculative, complex policy, there wasn\u2019t time for yet another academic study to arrive at the exact right number. Pomerance\u2019s unscientific suggestion sounded fine to him.Mintzer pointed out that a 20 percent reduction was consistent with the academic literature on energy efficiency. Various studies over the years had shown that you could improve efficiency in most energy systems by roughly 20 percent if you adopted best practices. Of course, with any target, you had to take into account the fact that the developing world would inevitably consume much larger quantities of fossil fuels by 2000. But those gains could be offset by a wider propagation of the renewable technologies already at hand \u2014 solar, wind, geothermal. It was not a rigorous scientific analysis, Mintzer granted, but 20 percent sounded plausible. We wouldn\u2019t need to solve cold fusion or ask Congress to repeal the law of gravity. We could manage it with the knowledge and technology we already had.Besides, Pomerance said, 20 by 2000 sounds good.In Toronto a few days later, Pomerance talked up his idea with everyone he met \u2014 environmental ministers, scientists, journalists. Nobody thought it sounded crazy. He took that as an encouraging sign. Other delegates soon proposed the number to him independently, as if they had come up with it themselves. That was an even better sign.Wirth, in his keynote on June 27, called for the world to reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2000, with an eventual reduction of 50 percent. Other speakers likened the ramifications of climate change to a global nuclear war, but it was the emissions target that was heard in Washington, London, Berlin, Moscow. The conference\u2019s final statement, signed by all 400 scientists and politicians in attendance, repeated the demand with a slight variation: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2005. Just like that, Pomerance\u2019s best guess became global diplomatic policy.Hansen, emerging from Anniek\u2019s successful cancer surgery, took it upon himself to start a one-man public information campaign. He gave news conferences and was quoted in seemingly every article about the issue; he even appeared on television with homemade props. Like an entrant at an elementary-school science fair, he made \u201cloaded dice\u201d out of sections of cardboard and colored paper to illustrate the increased likelihood of hotter weather in a warmer climate. Public awareness of the greenhouse effect reached a new high of 68 percent.At the end of the sulfurous summer, several months after Gore ended his candidacy, global warming became a major subject of the presidential campaign. While Michael Dukakis proposed tax incentives to encourage domestic oil production and boasted that coal could satisfy the nation\u2019s energy needs for the next three centuries, George Bush took advantage. \u201cI am an environmentalist,\u201d he declared on the shore of Lake Erie, the first stop on a five-state environmental tour that would take him to Boston Harbor, Dukakis\u2019s home turf. \u201cThose who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect,\u201d he said, \u201care forgetting about the White House effect.\u201d His running mate emphasized the ticket\u2019s commitment to the issue at the vice-presidential debate. \u201cThe greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue,\u201d Dan Quayle said. \u201cWe need to get on with it. And in a George Bush administration, you can bet that we will.\u201dThis kind of talk roused the oil-and-gas men. \u201cA lot of people on the Hill see the greenhouse effect as the issue of the 1990s,\u201d a gas lobbyist told Oil & Gas Journal. Before a meeting of oil executives shortly after the \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d candidate won the election, Representative Dick Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, warned, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult to fend off some kind of gasoline tax.\u201d The coal industry, which had the most to lose from restrictions on carbon emissions, had moved beyond denial to resignation. A spokesman for the National Coal Association acknowledged that the greenhouse effect was no longer \u201can emerging issue. It is here already, and we\u2019ll be hearing more and more about it.\u201dBy the end of the year, 32 climate bills had been introduced in Congress, led by Wirth\u2019s omnibus National Energy Policy Act of 1988. Co-sponsored by 13 Democrats and five Republicans, it established as a national goal an \u201cInternational Global Agreement on the Atmosphere by 1992,\u201d ordered the Energy Department to submit to Congress a plan to reduce energy use by at least 2 percent a year through 2005 and directed the Congressional Budget Office to calculate the feasibility of a carbon tax. A lawyer for the Senate energy committee told an industry journal that lawmakers were \u201cfrightened\u201d by the issue and predicted that Congress would eventually pass significant legislation after Bush took office.The other great powers refused to wait. The German Parliament created a special commission on climate change, which concluded that action had to be taken immediately, \u201cirrespective of any need for further research,\u201d and that the Toronto goal was inadequate; it recommended a 30 percent reduction of carbon emissions. The prime ministers of Canada and Norway called for a binding international treaty on the atmosphere; Sweden\u2019s Parliament went further, announcing a national strategy to stabilize emissions at the 1988 level and eventually imposing a carbon tax; and Margaret Thatcher, who had studied chemistry at Oxford, warned in a speech to the Royal Society that global warming could \u201cgreatly exceed the capacity of our natural habitat to cope\u201d and that \u201cthe health of the economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other.\u201dIt was at this time \u2014 at a moment when the environmental movement was, in the words of one energy lobbyist, \u201con a tear\u201d \u2014 that the United Nations unanimously endorsed the establishment, by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientists and policymakers, to conduct scientific assessments and develop global climate policy. One of the I.P.C.C.\u2019s first sessions to plan an international treaty was hosted by the State Department, 10 days after Bush\u2019s inauguration. James Baker chose the occasion to make his first speech as secretary of state. \u201cWe can probably not afford to wait until all of the uncertainties about global climate change have been resolved,\u201d he said. \u201cTime will not make the problem go away.\u201d Much of Congress agreed: On April 14, 1989, a bipartisan group of 24 senators, led by the majority leader, George Mitchell, requested that Bush cut emissions in the United States even before the I.P.C.C.\u2019s working group made its recommendation. \u201cWe cannot afford the long lead times associated with a comprehensive global agreement,\u201d the senators wrote. Bush had promised to combat the greenhouse effect with the White House effect. The self-proclaimed environmentalist was now seated in the Oval Office. It was time.After Jim Baker gave his boisterous address to the I.P.C.C. working group at the State Department, he received a visit from John Sununu, Bush\u2019s chief of staff. Leave the science to the scientists, Sununu told Baker. Stay clear of this greenhouse-effect nonsense. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.Baker, who had served as Reagan\u2019s chief of staff, didn\u2019t speak about the subject again. He later told the White House that he was recusing himself from energy-policy issues, on account of his previous career as a Houston oil-and-gas lawyer.Sununu, an enthusiastic contrarian, delighted in defying any lazy characterizations of himself. His father was a Lebanese exporter from Boston, and his mother was a Salvadoran of Greek ancestry; he was born in Havana. In his three terms as governor of New Hampshire, he had come, in the epithets of national political columnists, to embody Yankee conservatism: pragmatic, business-friendly, technocratic, \u201cno-nonsense.\u201d He had fought angrily against local environmentalists to open a nuclear power plant, but he had also signed the nation\u2019s first acid-rain legislation and lobbied Reagan directly for a reduction of sulfur-dioxide pollution by 50 percent, the target sought by the Audubon Society. He was perceived as more conservative than the president, a budget hawk who had turned a $44 million state deficit into a surplus without raising taxes, and openly insulted Republican politicians and the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce when they drifted, however tentatively, from his anti-tax doctrinairism. Yet he increased spending on mental health care and public-land preservation in New Hampshire, and in the White House he would help negotiate a tax increase and secure the Supreme Court nomination of David Souter.Bush had chosen Sununu for his political instincts \u2014 he was credited with having won Bush the New Hampshire primary, after Bush came in third in Iowa, all but securing him the nomination. But despite his reputation as a political wolf, he still thought of himself as a scientist \u2014 an \u201cold engineer,\u201d as he was fond of putting it, having earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. decades earlier. He lacked the reflexive deference that so many of his political generation reserved for the class of elite government scientists. Since World War II, he believed, conspiratorial forces had used the imprimatur of scientific knowledge to advance an \u201canti-growth\u201d doctrine. He reserved particular disdain for Paul Ehrlich\u2019s \u201cThe Population Bomb,\u201d which prophesied that hundreds of millions of people would starve to death if the world took no step to curb population growth; the Club of Rome, an organization of European scientists, heads of state and economists, which similarly warned that the world would run out of natural resources; and as recently as the mid-\u201970s, the hypothesis advanced by some of the nation\u2019s most celebrated scientists \u2014 including Carl Sagan, Stephen Schneider and Ichtiaque Rasool \u2014 that a new ice age was dawning, thanks to the proliferation of man-made aerosols. All were theories of questionable scientific merit, portending vast, authoritarian remedies to halt economic progress.Sununu had suspected that the greenhouse effect belonged to this nefarious cabal since 1975, when the anthropologist Margaret Mead convened a symposium on the subject at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. \u201cUnless the peoples of the world can begin to understand the immense and long-term consequences of what appear to be small immediate choices,\u201d Mead wrote, \u201cthe whole planet may become endangered.\u201d Her conclusions were stark, immediate and absent the caveats that hobbled the scientific literature. Or as Sununu saw it, she showed her hand: \u201cNever before have the governing bodies of the world been faced with decisions so far-reaching,\u201d Mead wrote. \u201cIt is inevitable that there will be a clash between those concerned with immediate problems and those who concern themselves with long-term consequences.\u201d When Mead talked about \u201cfar-reaching\u201d decisions and \u201clong-term consequences,\u201d Sununu heard the marching of jackboots.In April, the director of the O.M.B., Richard Darman, a close ally of Sununu\u2019s, mentioned that the NASA scientist James Hansen, who had forced the issue of global warming onto the national agenda the previous summer, was going to testify again \u2014 this time at a hearing called by Al Gore. Darman had the testimony and described it. Sununu was appalled: Hansen\u2019s language seemed extreme, based on scientific arguments that he considered, as he later put it, like \u201ctechnical garbage.\u201dWhile Sununu and Darman reviewed Hansen\u2019s statements, the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly, took a new proposal to the White House. The next meeting of the I.P.C.C.\u2019s working group was scheduled for Geneva the following month, in May; it was the perfect occasion, Reilly argued, to take a stronger stand on climate change. Bush should demand a global treaty to reduce carbon emissions.Sununu disagreed. It would be foolish, he said, to let the nation stumble into a binding agreement on questionable scientific merits, especially as it would compel some unknown quantity of economic pain. They went back and forth. Reilly didn\u2019t want to cede leadership on the issue to the European powers; after all, the first high-level diplomatic meeting on climate change, to which Reilly was invited, would take place just a few months later in the Netherlands. Statements of caution would make the \u201cenvironmental president\u201d look like a hypocrite and hurt the United States\u2019 leverage in a negotiation. But Sununu wouldn\u2019t budge. He ordered the American delegates not to make any commitment in Geneva. Very soon after that, someone leaked the exchange to the press.Sununu, blaming Reilly, was furious. When accounts of his argument with Reilly appeared in The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post ahead of the Geneva I.P.C.C. meeting, they made the White House look as if it didn\u2019t know what it was doing.A deputy of Jim Baker pulled Reilly aside. He said he had a message from Baker, who had observed Reilly\u2019s infighting with Sununu. \u201cIn the long run,\u201d the deputy warned Reilly, \u201cyou never beat the White House.\u201dIn the first week of May 1989, when Hansen received his proposed testimony back from the O.M.B., it was disfigured by deletions and, more incredible, additions. Gore had called the hearing to increase the pressure on Bush to sign major climate legislation; Hansen had wanted to use the occasion to clarify one major point that, in the hubbub following the 1988 hearing, had been misunderstood. Global warming would not only cause more heat waves and droughts like those of the previous summer but would also lead to more extreme rain events. This was crucial \u2014 he didn\u2019t want the public to conclude, the next time there was a mild summer, that global warming wasn\u2019t real.But the edited text was a mess. For a couple of days, Hansen played along, accepting the more innocuous edits. But he couldn\u2019t accept some of the howlers proposed by the O.M.B. With the hearing only two days away, he gave up. He told NASA\u2019s congressional liaison to stop fighting. Let the White House have its way, he said.But Hansen would have his way, too. As soon as he hung up, he drafted a letter to Gore. He explained that the O.M.B. wanted him to demote his own scientific findings to \u201cestimates\u201d from models that were \u201cevolving\u201d and unreliable. His anonymous censor wanted him to say that the causes of global warming were \u201cscientifically unknown\u201d and might be attributable to \u201cnatural processes,\u201d caveats that would not only render his testimony meaningless but make him sound like a moron. The most bizarre addition, however, was a statement of a different kind. He was asked to argue that Congress should only pass climate legislation that immediately benefited the economy, \u201cindependent of concerns about an increasing greenhouse effect\u201d \u2014 a sentence that no scientist would ever utter, unless perhaps he were employed by the American Petroleum Institute. Hansen faxed his letter to Gore and left the office.When he arrived home, Anniek told him Gore had called. Would it be all right, Gore asked when Hansen spoke with him, if I tell a couple of reporters about this?The New York Times\u2019s Philip Shabecoff called the next morning. \u201cI should be allowed to say what is my scientific position,\u201d Hansen told him. \u201cI can understand changing policy, but not science.\u201dOn Monday, May 8, the morning of the hearing, he left early for his flight to Washington and did not see the newspaper until he arrived at Dirksen, where Gore showed it to him. The front-page headline read: \u201cScientist Says Budget Office Altered His Testimony.\u201d They agreed that Hansen would give his testimony as planned, after which Gore would ask about the passages that the O.M.B. had rewritten.Gore stopped at the door. \u201cWe better go separately,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll be able to get both of us with one hand grenade.\u201dIn the crowded hearing room, the cameras fixed on Hansen. He held his statement in one hand and a single Christmas tree bulb in the other \u2014 a prop to help explain, however shakily, that the warming already created by fossil-fuel combustion was equivalent to placing a Christmas light over every square meter of Earth\u2019s surface. After Hansen read his sanitized testimony, Gore pounced. He was puzzled by inconsistencies in the distinguished scientist\u2019s presentation, he said in a tone thick with mock confusion. \u201cWhy do you directly contradict yourself?\u201dHansen explained that he had not written those contradictory statements. \u201cThe Bush administration is acting as if it is scared of the truth,\u201d Gore said. \u201cIf they forced you to change a scientific conclusion, it is a form of science fraud.\u201dAnother government scientist testifying at the hearing, Jerry Mahlman from NOAA, acknowledged that the White House had previously tried to change his conclusions too. Mahlman had managed to deflect the worst of it, however \u2014 \u201cobjectionable and also unscientific\u201d recommendations, he said, that would have been \u201cseverely embarrassing to me in the face of my scientific colleagues.\u201dGore called it \u201can outrage of the first order of magnitude.\u201d The 1988 hearing had created a hero out of Jim Hansen. Now Gore had a real villain, one far more treacherous than Fred Koomanoff \u2014 a nameless censor in the White House, hiding behind O.M.B. letterhead.The cameras followed Hansen and Gore into the marbled hallway. Hansen insisted that he wanted to focus on the science. Gore focused on the politics. \u201cI think they\u2019re scared of the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re scared that Hansen and the other scientists are right and that some dramatic policy changes are going to be needed, and they don\u2019t want to face up to it.\u201dThe censorship did more to publicize Hansen\u2019s testimony and the dangers of global warming than anything he could have possibly said. At the White House briefing later that morning, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater admitted that Hansen\u2019s statement had been changed. He blamed an official \u201cfive levels down from the top\u201d and promised that there would be no retaliation. Hansen, he added, was \u201can outstanding and distinguished scientist\u201d and was \u201cdoing a great job.\u201dThe Los Angeles Times called the censorship \u201can outrageous assault.\u201d The Chicago Tribune said it was the beginning of \u201ca cold war on global warming,\u201d and The New York Times warned that the White House\u2019s \u201cheavy-handed intervention sends the signal that Washington wants to go slow on addressing the greenhouse problem.\u201dThe day after the hearing, Gore received an unannounced visit from the O.M.B. director, Richard Darman. He came alone, without aides. He said he wanted to apologize to Gore in person. He was sorry, and he wanted Gore to know it; the O.M.B. would not try to censor anyone again. Gore, stunned, thanked Darman. Something about his apology \u2014 the effusiveness, the mortified tone or perhaps the fact that he had come by himself, as if in secret \u2014 left Gore with the impression that the idea to censor Hansen didn\u2019t come from someone five levels down from the top, or even below Darman. It had come from someone above Darman.Darman went to see Sununu. He didn\u2019t like being accused of censoring scientists. They needed to issue some kind of response. Sununu called Reilly to ask if he had any ideas. We could start, Reilly said, by recommitting to a global climate treaty. The United States was the only Western nation on record as opposing negotiations.Sununu sent a telegram to Geneva endorsing a plan \u201cto develop full international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty-negotiating process. The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is essential for the U.S. to exercise leadership.\u201d He proposed an international workshop to improve the accuracy of the science and calculate the economic costs of emissions reductions. Sununu signed the telegram himself. A day later, the president pledged to host a climate workshop at the White House. Rafe Pomerance was unconvinced, telling the press that this belated effort to save face was a \u201cwaffle\u201d that fell short of real action: \u201cWe should be able to complete a treaty by the end of 1990,\u201d he said, \u201cnot be starting one.\u201d But the general response from the press was relief and praise.Still, Sununu seethed at any mention of the subject. He had taken it upon himself to study more deeply the greenhouse effect; he would have a rudimentary, one-dimensional general circulation model installed on his personal desktop computer. He decided that the models promoted by Jim Hansen were a lot of bunk. They were horribly imprecise in scale and underestimated the ocean\u2019s ability to mitigate warming. Sununu complained about Hansen to D. Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist from Yale who, at Sununu\u2019s recommendation, was named Bush\u2019s science adviser. Hansen\u2019s findings were \u201ctechnical poppycock\u201d that didn\u2019t begin to justify such wild-eyed pronouncements that \u201cthe greenhouse effect is here\u201d or that the 1988 heat waves could be attributed to global warming, let alone serve as the basis for national economic policy.When a junior staff member in the Energy Department, in a meeting at the White House with Sununu and Reilly, mentioned an initiative to reduce fossil-fuel use, Sununu interrupted her. \u201cWhy in the world would you need to reduce fossil-fuel use?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause of climate change,\u201d the young woman replied.\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone in this administration without a scientific background using \u2018climate change\u2019 or \u2018global warming\u2019 ever again,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a technical basis for policy, don\u2019t run around making decisions on the basis of newspaper headlines.\u201d After the meeting, Reilly caught up to the staff member in the hallway. She was shaken. Don\u2019t take it personally, Reilly told her. Sununu might have been looking at you, but that was directed at me.Relations between Sununu and Reilly became openly adversarial. Reilly, Sununu thought, was a creature of the environmental lobby. He was trying to impress his friends at the E.P.A. without having a basic grasp of the science himself. Most unforgivable of all was what Sununu saw as Reilly\u2019s propensity to leak to the press. Whenever Reilly sent the White House names of candidates he wanted to hire for openings at the E.P.A., Sununu vetoed them. When it came time for the high-level diplomatic meeting in November, a gathering of environmental ministers in the Netherlands, Sununu didn\u2019t trust Reilly to negotiate on behalf of the White House. So he sent Allan Bromley to accompany him.Reilly, for his part, didn\u2019t entirely blame Sununu for Bush\u2019s indecision on the prospect of a climate treaty. The president had never taken a vigorous interest in global warming and was mainly briefed about it by nonscientists. Bush had brought up the subject on the campaign trail, in his speech about the White House effect, after leafing through a briefing booklet for a new issue that might generate some positive press. When Reilly tried in person to persuade him to take action, Bush deferred to Sununu and Baker. Why don\u2019t the three of you work it out, he said. Let me know when you decide. But by the time Reilly got to the Noordwijk Ministerial Conference in the Netherlands, he suspected that it was already too late.Rafe Pomerance awoke at sunlight and stole out of his hotel, making for the flagpoles. It was nearly freezing \u2014 Nov. 6, 1989, on the coast of the North Sea in the Dutch resort town of Noordwijk \u2014 but the wind had yet to rise and the photographer was waiting. More than 60 flags lined the strand between the hotel and the beach, one for each nation in attendance at the first major diplomatic meeting on global warming. The delegations would review the progress made by the I.P.C.C. and decide whether to endorse a framework for a global treaty. There was a general sense among the delegates that they would, at minimum, agree to the target proposed by the host, the Dutch environmental minister, more modest than the Toronto number: a freezing of greenhouse-gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. Some believed that if the meeting was a success, it would encourage the I.P.C.C. to accelerate its negotiations and reach a decision about a treaty sooner. But at the very least, the world\u2019s environmental ministers should sign a statement endorsing a hard, binding target of emissions reductions. The mood among the delegates was electric, nearly giddy \u2014 after more than a decade of fruitless international meetings, they could finally sign an agreement that meant something.Pomerance had not been among the 400 delegates invited to Noordwijk. But together with three young activists \u2014 Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Stewart Boyle from Friends of the Earth \u2014 he had formed his own impromptu delegation. Their constituency, they liked to say, was the climate itself. Their mission was to pressure the delegates to include in the final conference statement, which would be used as the basis for a global treaty, the target proposed in Toronto: a 20 percent reduction of greenhouse-gas combustion by 2005. It was the only measure that mattered, the amount of emissions reductions, and the Toronto number was the strongest global target yet proposed.The activists booked their own travel and doubled up in rooms at a beat-up motel down the beach. They managed to secure all-access credentials from the Dutch environmental ministry\u2019s press secretary. He was inclined to be sympathetic toward the activists because it had been rumored that Allan Bromley, one of the United States\u2019 lead delegates, would try to persuade the delegates from Japan and the Soviet Union to join him in resisting the idea of a binding agreement, despite the fact that Bush had again claimed just earlier that week that the United States would \u201cplay a leadership role in global warming.\u201d The Dutch were especially concerned about this development, as even a minor rise in sea level would swamp much of their nation.The activists planned to stage a stunt each day to embarrass Bromley and galvanize support for a hard treaty. The first took place at the flagpoles, where they met a photographer from Agence France-Presse at dawn. Performing for the photographer, Boyle and Becker lowered the Japanese, Soviet and American flags to half-staff. Becker gave a reporter an outraged statement, accusing the three nations of conspiring to block the one action necessary to save the planet. The article appeared on front pages across Europe.On the second day, Pomerance and Becker met an official from Kiribati, an island nation of 33 atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. They asked if he was Kiribati\u2019s environmental minister.Kiribati is a very small place, the man said. I do everything. I\u2019m the environmental minister. I\u2019m the science minister. I\u2019m everything. If the sea rises, he said, my entire nation will be underwater.Pomerance and Becker exchanged a look. \u201cIf we set up a news conference,\u201d Pomerance asked, \u201cwill you tell them what you just told us?\u201dWithin minutes, they had assembled a couple dozen journalists.There is no place on Kiribati taller than my head, began the minister, who seemed barely more than five feet tall. So when we talk about one-foot sea-level rise, that means the water is up to my shin.He pointed to his shin.Two feet, he said, that\u2019s my thigh.He pointed to his thigh.Three feet, that\u2019s my waist.He pointed to his waist.Am I making myself clear?Pomerance and Becker were ecstatic. The minister came over to them. Is that what you had in mind? he asked.It was a good start, and necessary too \u2014 Pomerance had the sinking feeling that the momentum of the previous year was beginning to flag. The censoring of Hansen\u2019s testimony and the inexplicably strident opposition from John Sununu were ominous signs. So were the findings of a report Pomerance had commissioned, published in September by the World Resources Institute, tracking global greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States was the largest contributor by far, producing nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, and its contribution was growing faster than that of every other country. Bush\u2019s indecision, or perhaps inattention, had already managed to delay the negotiation of a global climate treaty until 1990 at the earliest, perhaps even 1991. By then, Pomerance worried, it would be too late.The one meeting to which Pomerance\u2019s atmospheric delegation could not gain admittance was the only one that mattered: the final negotiation. The scientists and I.P.C.C. staff members were asked to leave; just the environmental ministers remained. Pomerance and the other activists haunted the carpeted hallway outside the conference room, waiting and thinking. A decade earlier, Pomerance helped warn the White House of the dangers posed by fossil-fuel combustion; nine years earlier, at a fairy-tale castle on the Gulf of Mexico, he tried to persuade Congress to write climate legislation, reshape American energy policy and demand that the United States lead an international process to arrest climate change. Just one year ago, he devised the first emissions target to be proposed at a major international conference. Now, at the end of the decade, senior diplomats from all over the world were debating the merits of a binding climate treaty. Only he was powerless to participate. He could only trust, as he stared at the wall separating him from the diplomats and their muffled debate, that all his work had been enough.The meeting began in the morning and continued into the night, much longer than expected; most of the delegates had come to the conference ready to sign the Dutch proposal. Each time the doors opened and a minister headed to the bathroom at the other end of the hall, the activists leapt up, asking for an update. The ministers maintained a studied silence, but as the negotiations went past midnight, their aggravation was recorded in their stricken faces and opened collars.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Becker shouted, for the hundredth time, as the Swedish minister surfaced.\u201cYour government,\u201d the minister said, \u201cis fucking this thing up!\u201dWhen the beaten delegates finally emerged from the conference room, Becker and Pomerance learned what happened. Bromley, at the urging of John Sununu and with the acquiescence of Britain, Japan and the Soviet Union, had forced the conference to abandon the commitment to freeze emissions. The final statement noted only that \u201cmany\u201d nations supported stabilizing emissions \u2014 but did not indicate which nations or at what emissions level. And with that, a decade of excruciating, painful, exhilarating progress turned to air.The environmentalists spent the morning giving interviews and writing news releases. \u201cYou must conclude the conference is a failure,\u201d Becker said, calling the dissenting nations \u201cthe skunks at the garden party.\u201d Greenpeace called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Timothy Wirth, in Washington, said the outcome was proof that the United States was \u201cnot a leader but a delinquent partner.\u201dPomerance tried to be more diplomatic. \u201cThe president made a commitment to the American people to deal with global warming,\u201d he told The Washington Post, \u201cand he hasn\u2019t followed it up.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to sound defeated. \u201cThere are some good building blocks here,\u201d Pomerance said, and he meant it. The Montreal Protocol on CFCs wasn\u2019t perfect at first, either \u2014 it had huge loopholes and weak restrictions. Once in place, however, the restrictions could be tightened. Perhaps the same could happen with climate change. Perhaps. Pomerance was not one for pessimism. As William Reilly told reporters, dutifully defending the official position forced upon him, it was the first time that the United States had formally endorsed the concept of an emissions limit. Pomerance wanted to believe that this was progress.Before leaving the Netherlands, he joined the other activists for a final round of drinks and commiseration. He would have to return to Washington the next day and start all over again. The I.P.C.C.\u2019s next policy-group meeting would take place in Edinburgh in two months, and there was concern that the Noordwijk failure might influence the group members into lowering their expectations for a treaty. But Pomerance refused to be dejected \u2014 there was no point to it. His companions, though more openly disappointed, shared his determination. One of them, Daniel Becker, had just found out that his wife was pregnant with their first child.She had traveled with Becker to the Netherlands to visit friends before the conference started. One day, their hosts took them on a day trip to Zeeland, a southwestern province where three rivers emptied into the sea. All week in Noordwijk, Becker couldn\u2019t stop talking about what he had seen in Zeeland. After a flood in 1953, when the sea swallowed much of the region, killing more than 2,000 people, the Dutch began to build the Delta Works, a vast concrete-and-steel fortress of movable barriers, dams and sluice gates \u2014 a masterpiece of human engineering. The whole system could be locked into place within 90 minutes, defending the land against storm surge. It reduced the country\u2019s exposure to the sea by 700 kilometers, Becker explained. The United States coastline was about 153,000 kilometers long. How long, he asked, was the entire terrestrial coastline? Because the whole world was going to need this. In Zeeland, he said, he had seen the future.Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., has a habit of asking new graduate students to name the largest fundamental breakthrough in climate physics since 1979. It\u2019s a trick question. There has been no breakthrough. As with any mature scientific discipline, there is only refinement. The computer models grow more precise; the regional analyses sharpen; estimates solidify into observational data. Where there have been inaccuracies, they have tended to be in the direction of understatement. Caldeira and a colleague recently published a paper in Nature finding that the world is warming more quickly than most climate models predict. The toughest emissions reductions now being proposed, even by the most committed nations, will probably fail to achieve \u201cany given global temperature stabilization target.\u201dMore carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the final day of the Noordwijk conference, Nov. 7, 1989, than in the entire history of civilization preceding it. In 1990, humankind emitted more than 20 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. By 2017, the figure had risen to 32.5 billion metric tons, a record. Despite every action taken since the Charney report \u2014 the billions of dollars invested in research, the nonbinding treaties, the investments in renewable energy \u2014 the only number that counts, the total quantity of global greenhouse gas emitted per year, has continued its inexorable rise.Like the scientific story, the political story hasn\u2019t changed greatly, except in its particulars. Even some of the nations that pushed hardest for climate policy have failed to honor their own commitments. When it comes to our own nation, which has failed to make any binding commitments whatsoever, the dominant narrative for the last quarter century has concerned the efforts of the fossil-fuel industries to suppress science, confuse public knowledge and bribe politicians.The mustache-twirling depravity of these campaigns has left the impression that the oil-and-gas industry always operated thus; while the Exxon scientists and American Petroleum Institute clerics of the \u201970s and \u201980s were hardly good Samaritans, they did not start multimillion-dollar disinformation campaigns, pay scientists to distort the truth or try to brainwash children in elementary schools, as their successors would. It was James Hansen\u2019s testimony before Congress in 1988 that, for the first time since the \u201cChanging Climate\u201d report, made oil-and-gas executives begin to consider the issue\u2019s potential to hurt their profits. Exxon, as ever, led the field. Six weeks after Hansen\u2019s testimony, Exxon\u2019s manager of science and strategy development, Duane LeVine, prepared an internal strategy paper urging the company to \u201cemphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions.\u201d This shortly became the default position of the entire sector. LeVine, it so happened, served as chairman of the global petroleum industry\u2019s Working Group on Global Climate Change, created the same year, which adopted Exxon\u2019s position as its own.The American Petroleum Institute, after holding a series of internal briefings on the subject in the fall and winter of 1988, including one for the chief executives of the dozen or so largest oil companies, took a similar, if slightly more diplomatic, line. It set aside money for carbon-dioxide policy \u2014 about $100,000, a fraction of the millions it was spending on the health effects of benzene, but enough to establish a lobbying organization called, in an admirable flourish of newspeak, the Global Climate Coalition. It was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 14 other trade associations, including those representing the coal, electric-grid and automobile industries. The G.C.C. was conceived as a reactive body, to share news of any proposed regulations, but on a whim, it added a press campaign, to be coordinated mainly by the A.P.I. It gave briefings to politicians known to be friendly to the industry and approached scientists who professed skepticism about global warming. The A.P.I.\u2019s payment for an original op-ed was $2,000.The chance to enact meaningful measures to prevent climate change was vanishing, but the industry had just begun. In October 1989, scientists allied with the G.C.C. began to be quoted in national publications, giving an issue that lacked controversy a convenient fulcrum. \u201cMany respected scientists say the available evidence doesn\u2019t warrant the doomsday warnings,\u201d was the caveat that began to appear in articles on climate change.Cheap and useful, G.C.C.-like groups started to proliferate, but it was not until international negotiations in preparation for the 1992 Rio Earth Summit began that investments in persuasion peddling rose to the level of a line item. At Rio, George H.W. Bush refused to commit to specific emissions reductions. The following year, when President Bill Clinton proposed an energy tax in the hope of meeting the goals of the Rio treaty, the A.P.I. invested $1.8 million in a G.C.C. disinformation campaign. Senate Democrats from oil-and-coal states joined Republicans to defeat the tax proposal, which later contributed to the Republicans\u2019 rout of Democrats in the midterm congressional elections in 1994 \u2014 the first time the Republican Party had won control of both houses in 40 years. The G.C.C. spent $13 million on a single ad campaign intended to weaken support for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which committed its parties to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 5 percent relative to 1990 levels. The Senate, which would have had to ratify the agreement, took a pre-emptive vote declaring its opposition; the resolution passed 95-0. There has never been another serious effort to negotiate a binding global climate treaty.The G.C.C. disbanded in 2002 after the defection of various members who were embarrassed by its tactics. But Exxon (now Exxon Mobil) continued its disinformation campaign for another half decade. This has made the corporation an especially vulnerable target for the wave of compensatory litigation that began in earnest in the last three years and may last a generation. Tort lawsuits have become possible only in recent years, as scientists have begun more precisely to attribute regional effects to global emission levels. This is one subfield of climate science that has advanced significantly since 1979 \u2014 the assignment of blame.A major lawsuit has targeted the federal government. A consortium of 21 American children and young adults \u2014 one of whom, Sophie Kivlehan of Allentown, Pa., is Jim Hansen\u2019s granddaughter \u2014 claims that the government, by \u201ccreating a national energy system that causes climate change,\u201d has violated its duty to protect the natural resources to which all Americans are entitled.The rallying cry of this multipronged legal effort is \u201cExxon Knew.\u201d It is incontrovertibly true that senior employees at the company that would later become Exxon, like those at most other major oil-and-gas corporations, knew about the dangers of climate change as early as the 1950s. But the automobile industry knew, too, and began conducting its own research by the early 1980s, as did the major trade groups representing the electrical grid. They all own responsibility for our current paralysis and have made it more painful than necessary. But they haven\u2019t done it alone.The United States government knew. Roger Revelle began serving as a Kennedy administration adviser in 1961, five years after establishing the Mauna Loa carbon-dioxide program, and every president since has debated the merits of acting on climate policy. Carter had the Charney report, Reagan had \u201cChanging Climate\u201d and Bush had the censored testimony of James Hansen and his own public vow to solve the problem. Congress has been holding hearings for 40 years; the intelligence community has been tracking the crisis even longer.Everybody knew. In 1958, on prime-time television, \u201cThe Bell Science Hour\u201d \u2014 one of the most popular educational film series in American history \u2014 aired \u201cThe Unchained Goddess,\u201d a film about meteorological wonders, produced by Frank Capra, a dozen years removed from \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d warning that \u201cman may be unwittingly changing the world\u2019s climate\u201d through the release of carbon dioxide. \u201cA few degrees\u2019 rise in the Earth\u2019s temperature would melt the polar ice caps,\u201d says the film\u2019s kindly host, the bespectacled Dr. Research. \u201cAn inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water.\u201d Capra\u2019s film was shown in science classes for decades.Everyone knew \u2014 and we all still know. We know that the transformations of our planet, which will come gradually and suddenly, will reconfigure the political world order. We know that if we don\u2019t act to reduce emissions, we risk the collapse of civilization. We also know that, without a gargantuan intervention, whatever happens will be worse for our children, worse yet for their children and even worse still for their children\u2019s children, whose lives, our actions have demonstrated, mean nothing to us.Could it have been any other way? In the late 1970s, a small group of philosophers, economists and political scientists began to debate, largely among themselves, whether a human solution to this human problem was even possible. They did not trouble themselves about the details of warming, taking the worst-case scenario as a given. They asked instead whether humankind, when presented with this particular existential crisis, was willing to prevent it. We worry about the future. But how much, exactly?The answer, as any economist could tell you, is very little. Economics, the science of assigning value to human behavior, prices the future at a discount; the farther out you project, the cheaper the consequences. This makes the climate problem the perfect economic disaster. The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus, a member of Jimmy Carter\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, argued in the 1970s that the most appropriate remedy was a global carbon tax. But that required an international agreement, which Nordhaus didn\u2019t think was likely. Michael Glantz, a political scientist who was at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the time, argued in 1979 that democratic societies are constitutionally incapable of dealing with the climate problem. The competition for resources means that no single crisis can ever command the public interest for long, yet climate change requires sustained, disciplined efforts over decades. And the German physicist-philosopher Klaus Meyer-Abich argued that any global agreement would inevitably favor the most minimal action. Adaptation, Meyer-Abich concluded, \u201cseems to be the most rational political option.\u201d It is the option that we have pursued, consciously or not, ever since.These theories share a common principle: that human beings, whether in global organizations, democracies, industries, political parties or as individuals, are incapable of sacrificing present convenience to forestall a penalty imposed on future generations. When I asked John Sununu about his part in this history \u2014 whether he considered himself personally responsible for killing the best chance at an effective global-warming treaty \u2014 his response echoed Meyer-Abich. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he told me, \u201cbecause, frankly, the leaders in the world at that time were at a stage where they were all looking how to seem like they were supporting the policy without having to make hard commitments that would cost their nations serious resources.\u201d He added, \u201cFrankly, that\u2019s about where we are today.\u201dIf human beings really were able to take the long view \u2014 to consider seriously the fate of civilization decades or centuries after our deaths \u2014 we would be forced to grapple with the transience of all we know and love in the great sweep of time. So we have trained ourselves, whether culturally or evolutionarily, to obsess over the present, worry about the medium term and cast the long term out of our minds, as we might spit out a poison.Like most human questions, the carbon-dioxide question will come down to fear. At some point, the fears of young people will overwhelm the fears of the old. Some time after that, the young will amass enough power to act. It will be too late to avoid some catastrophes, but perhaps not others. Humankind is nothing if not optimistic, even to the point of blindness. We are also an adaptable species. That will help.The distant perils of climate change are no longer very distant, however. Many have already begun to occur. We are capable of good works, altruism and wisdom, and a growing number of people have devoted their lives to helping civilization avoid the worst. We have a solution in hand: carbon taxes, increased investment in renewable and nuclear energy and decarbonization technology. As Jim Hansen told me, \u201cFrom a technology and economics standpoint, it is still readily possible to stay under two degrees Celsius.\u201d We can trust the technology and the economics. It\u2019s harder to trust human nature. Keeping the planet to two degrees of warming, let alone 1.5 degrees, would require transformative action. It will take more than good works and voluntary commitments; it will take a revolution. But in order to become a revolutionary, you need first to suffer.Hansen\u2019s most recent paper, published last year, announced that Earth is now as warm as it was before the last ice age, 115,000 years ago, when the seas were more than six meters higher than they are today. He and his team have concluded that the only way to avoid dangerous levels of warming is to bend the emissions arc below the x-axis. We must, in other words, find our way to \u201cnegative emissions,\u201d extracting more carbon dioxide from the air than we contribute to it. If emissions, by miracle, do rapidly decline, most of the necessary carbon absorption could be handled by replanting forests and improving agricultural practices. If not, \u201cmassive technological CO\u2082 extraction,\u201d using some combination of technologies as yet unperfected or uninvented, will be required. Hansen estimates that this will incur costs of $89 trillion to $535 trillion this century, and may even be impossible at the necessary scale. He is not optimistic.Like Hansen, Rafe Pomerance is close to his granddaughter. When he feels low, he wears a bracelet she made for him. He finds it difficult to explain the future to her. During the Clinton administration, Pomerance worked on environmental issues for the State Department; he is now a consultant for Rethink Energy Florida, which hopes to alert the state to the threat of rising seas, and the chairman of Arctic 21, a network of scientists and research organizations that hope \u201cto communicate the ongoing unraveling of the Arctic.\u201d Every two months, he has lunch with fellow veterans of the climate wars \u2014 E.P.A. officials, congressional staff members and colleagues from the World Resources Institute. They bemoan the lost opportunities, the false starts, the strategic blunders. But they also remember their achievements. In a single decade, they turned a crisis that was studied by no more than several dozen scientists into the subject of Senate hearings, front-page headlines and the largest diplomatic negotiation in world history. They helped summon into being the world\u2019s climate watchdog, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and initiated the negotiations for a treaty signed by nearly all of the world\u2019s nations.It is true that much of the damage that might have been avoided is now inevitable. And Pomerance is not the romantic he once was. But he still believes that it might not be too late to preserve some semblance of the world as we know it. Human nature has brought us to this place; perhaps human nature will one day bring us through. Rational argument has failed in a rout. Let irrational optimism have a turn. It is also human nature, after all, to hope.An earlier version of this article misstated the type of solar panels installed by President Jimmy Carter on the White House roof.

{"Headline": "The Metamorphosis of the Western Soul", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE Big ideasHumans want to get along and get ahead. And they will become whoever they need to be in order to do so.Mr. Storr is a journalist and novelist. Between 1965 and 1985, the Western self was transformed. We turned from anti-materialistic, stick-it-to-the-Man hippies into greed-is-good yuppies. We would be surprised if an individual went through such an extreme metamorphosis. But an entire culture did. What could have caused such a dramatic shift? While the origins of such changes cannot be reduced to a single source, I believe we can point to a dominant one: the economy. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rewrote the rules by which we had once lived. And that, with stunning rapidity, changed who we were. Psychologists attest to the enormous power of environment over culture. Many focus on differences between the individualistic West and the collectivist East. The story goes something like this: The Western self was born in Greece, a pointillist realm of around 1,000 city-states, where the land was poor for farming. Getting by meant hustling \u2014 tanning hides, making olive oil, fishing. This individualistic economy created an individualist ideal of self. The Greeks sought singular fame and glory. They gave birth to the Olympics, that celebration of individual competition, and an astonishing era of democracy. Compare that with ancient China, an undulating landscape in which getting by meant being part of a large farming community. Survival depended on the group rather than the individual. For Confucius the \u201csuperior\u201d person \u201cdoes not boast,\u201d preferring instead \u201cthe concealment of his virtue\u201d \u2014 nothing like the glory-seeking Greek. A different landscape made a different kind of human with different values. One prioritized the individual, the other the group. One saw reality comprising individual objects, the other a web of forces.Cultural differences such as these run deep.Humans are born incomplete. The brain absorbs huge amounts of essential information throughout childhood and adolescence, which it uses to carry on building who we are. It\u2019s as if the brain asks a single, vital question: Who do I have to be, in this place, to thrive? If it was a boastful hustler in ancient Greece and a humble team-player in ancient China, then who is it in the West today? The answer is a neoliberal. After the economic chaos of the 1970s, it was decided that the United States and Britain had become too collective. Previous decades had seen the introduction of the New Deal, which included the Social Security Act, strict regulations on banking and business, and the rising power of the unions. This collectively tilted economy sired a collectively tilted people: monkey-suited Corporation Man and his children, the hippies. For Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, saving ourselves meant rediscovering our individualist roots. They cut taxes and regulations; they battled unions; they shrunk the welfare state; they privatized assets and weakened the state\u2019s safety nets. They pursued the neoliberal dream of globalization \u2014 one free market that covered the earth. As much of human life as possible was to become a competition of self versus self.In 1981, Margaret Thatcher said, \u201cWhat\u2019s irritated me about the whole direction of politics in the last 30 years is that it\u2019s always been toward the collectivist society.\u201d She then made a comment that bordered on the sinister. \u201cEconomics are the method: The object is to change the soul.\u201d And that\u2019s precisely what happened.The global financial crisis in 2008 did not help. Interestingly, narcissism, which was increasing during the 1990s and 2000s, has reportedly started to fall. Although the reasons are murky, I wonder about the psychological aftermath of this economic shock. Before 2008, it felt as if neoliberalism was basically working for most people. But since the crash, millions have come to see the system as broken. First there came the Occupy movement and then the identity politics of alt-left and alt-right. The feeling is, variously, that the system has been stitched-up by bankers and corporations or is hostile to women, people of color or the white working class. We also have seen the neoliberal Hillary Clinton falter and the antiglobalist Donald Trump triumph. Britain\u2019s Brexit was secured by antiglobalist arguments, while support for the anti-neoliberal left-winger Jeremy Corbyn surged. The perception of a broken, rigged economy has left us angry and increasingly tribal, which might explain this recent trend toward \u201cus\u201d over the narcissistic \u201cme.\u201d It might even help explain recent rises in the grim ramifications of perfectionism.

{"Headline": "Trump Approach on Nafta Relieves Automakers\u2019 Worst Fears", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Trump administration sought trade concessions from Mexico in recent weeks, automakers and their suppliers feared that manufacturing costs could increase by billions of dollars. Now, they are breathing a sigh of relief.But analysts and consultants say most companies would be able to comply with the conditions in the agreement with Mexico that have been disclosed so far. Many of the changes that automakers would have to make \u2014 like hiring more workers in the United States \u2014 were in their plans anyway. But other changes, like requiring automakers to use more parts made in North America and an agreement to cap imports from Mexico, could raise costs and hurt some companies.Companies \u201care glad they now have some certainty on what the new requirements are,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of the industry and automotive practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cNow they can plan around them and go forward.\u201dAutomakers would also have to use more local steel, aluminum, glass and other parts. In addition, 40 to 45 percent of vehicles would have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour \u2014 a provision meant to preserve and create jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are much higher than in Mexico.These terms would force automakers to buy more parts made in the United States \u2014 and possibly Canada. That should modestly increase employment at suppliers like Delphi Technologies and Johnson Controls, analysts said.\u201cThe main takeaway so far is there is no giant influx of jobs coming into the U.S.,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.The auto industry has been adding jobs in the United States for several years. In July, more than 972,000 people worked for car and parts companies, 40,000 more than a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manufacturers have added more than 300,000 jobs since 2009, when General Motors and Chrysler needed a government bailout to survive.And while a half-dozen auto plants have been built in Mexico in the last decade, new plants are going up in the United States, too. Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, is building a factory in South Carolina that the company says will employ 4,000 people by 2021. Toyota and Mazda recently agreed to jointly build a plant in Alabama.\u201cIn some ways,\u201d said Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive, the new trade rules amount to \u201ca solution in search of a problem.\u201dBut some industry associations are not as sanguine. The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents parts makers, is worried about a side agreement that the Trump administration reached with Mexico that could be used to cap duty-free auto imports from that country in the future.The Mexican government has said about 30 percent of the cars now exported to the United States do not meet the requirements of the new agreement. They include popular compact models like the Honda HR-V, the Volkswagen Jetta and Golf, the Nissan Sentra, and the Ford Fiesta and Fusion.If manufacturers can\u2019t find enough North American parts for those Mexican-made cars, they could still import them into the United States by paying a 2.5 percent tariff. That would force companies to either raise prices or accept smaller profit margins, or some combination of the two.Another option is to stop selling those noncompliant vehicles in the United States. Some small cars are already set to go away.\u201cThe HR-V is doing really well for us,\u201d said Adam Silverleib, vice president of Silko Honda, a dealership in Raynham, Mass. Losing the model \u201cwould definitely hurt.\u201dWhile fears about the scrapping of Nafta have eased somewhat, automakers are still concerned about Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for higher tariffs on cars and car parts. The president has argued that auto imports pose a threat to national security, a rationale he used to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.Ms. Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research said those higher tariffs would significantly increase costs and would thus be much more damaging than the terms of the preliminary agreement with Mexico. Even vehicles made in the United States would be affected because many include imported parts.Her firm estimates that a 25 percent tariff on imported cars \u2014 excluding those made in Mexico and Canada \u2014 would increase prices of vehicles made in North America by $1,135; imported models would cost $3,980 more.As a result, the center estimates, annual auto sales would fall by 1.2 million vehicles and the industry would lose 197,000 jobs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gold Trader in High-Security Jail Was Smuggled Booze, Cell Phones and More by Guard", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new inmate in Unit 11-South caught the guard\u2019s eye.In late 2016, Mr. Casado had another inmate slip Mr. Zarrab a note with his phone number and offered his services to the gold trader in exchange for cash.A driver working for one of Mr. Zarrab\u2019s Turkish lawyers paid an initial $5,000 to Mr. Casado, and the prison guard proceeded to smuggle alcohol, cellphones, food and vitamin C packets to Mr. Zarrab. Over time, Mr. Casado received at least $50,000 in bribes, prosecutors said.Mr. Casado was arrested in April, and on Friday afternoon, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to smuggle everything from alcoholic spirits to cold medicine to Mr. Zarrab in exchange for at least $25,000 that the government was able to document.Dressed in a short sleeved white button-down shirt and gray pants with his hair cropped close, Mr. Casado gripped the side of his chair and often rocked forward on the balls of his toes while seated. He told the court that he had visited the emergency room two days earlier because of serious muscle cramps.As a result of his plea agreement, Mr. Casado will forfeit $26,500. He remains free on bond and will return for a sentencing hearing on Jan. 11. The government is requesting a prison sentence of 36 to 46 months.The guard\u2019s conduct was so blatant that inmates informed Mr. Casado\u2019s colleagues about the contraband he was providing to Mr. Zarrab. One fellow guard admonished Mr. Casado. When Mr. Zarrab was moved to another facility, a search of his cell turned up contraband and the handwritten note from Mr. Casado offering his services in exchange for money.Aside from Mr. Casado, two other inmates have already pleaded guilty to charges in this case, and a third has pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Casado send thousands of dollars to a paralegal with whom he was having a romantic relationship, according to court records.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ohio Special Election Too Close to Call, as Republican Holds Slim Lead", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Republicans spent millions of dollars on scorching television ads, pried a reluctant endorsement from Ohio\u2019s moderate governor, used the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as a foil and enlisted President Trump in a last-minute turnaround effort in a special election for Congress in Ohio.And after all that, in a conservative-leaning district outside Columbus, the Republican candidate clung to the narrowest of leads on Tuesday night.National Republicans declared victory before midnight, but it could be days or weeks before there is a conclusive result in the race. And regardless of the outcome, Mr. Balderson and Mr. O\u2019Connor will face each other again in three months, in the regularly scheduled November election.But already, Republicans\u2019 brush with catastrophe in Ohio has deepened the party\u2019s gloomy mood, highlighting the massive political mobilization among Democrats and the comparative demoralization of the Republican base. The district that Mr. Balderson may have barely won voted for Mr. Trump by 11 points less than two years ago, and routinely elected Republicans to Congress by landslide margins before that.And on the Democratic side, the Ohio vote is likely to reignite debate about the cost of keeping Ms. Pelosi as party leader, and whether her declared intention to try to become House speaker again could limit their gains in November \u2014 or even cost them a chance to win the majority.Mr. Trump claimed credit for Mr. Balderson\u2019s apparent survival, pointing out that the former auto dealer had trailed badly in early voting and fared better on Election Day, just days after the president visited the district. \u201cAfter my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better,\u201d he boasted on Twitter.Even as Mr. O\u2019Connor appeared to fall short, however, he significantly improved upon Hillary Clinton\u2019s performance in the district\u2019s suburban precincts, and he overwhelmed Mr. Balderson in the sort of high-income enclaves Republicans must perform better in to hold their 23-seat majority in the House.As ominous for Republicans was the sizable gap in turnout between the most heavily populated suburban counties and the more rural reaches of the district. A higher percentage of voters from Franklin and Delaware Counties, the two largest jurisdictions, cast ballots than in the other, far smaller five counties.See full results and maps from the special election for Ohio's 12th District.\u201cWe are in a tied ballgame,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said at his election night party, refusing to concede. He then repurposed his speech into an appeal for the general election in November; he and Mr. Balderson have both been nominated to face off again then.\u201cWe\u2019re not stopping now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must keep fighting through November.\u201dMr. Balderson spoke for only about three minutes in a Doubletree Hotel ballroom filled largely with men, who briefly broke into a couple of chants of \u201cTrump, Trump\u201d that soon died out. Mr. Balderson alluded just briefly to Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to support him.\u201cOver the next three months I\u2019m going to do everything I can to keep America great again,\u201d he said. \u201cDanny O\u2019Connor ran a hard race and I look forward to campaigning against him again this fall.\u201dIn Missouri, Josh Hawley, the Republican state attorney general, will face off against Senator Claire McCaskill, a vulnerable Democrat.And while Mr. Trump crowed about lifting Mr. Balderson in Ohio, his ability to propel a much-closer ally in the Republican primary for Kansas governor appeared uncertain Wednesday morning. One day after he received an endorsement from Mr. Trump that he had aggressively lobbied for, Secretary of State Kris Kobach was clinging to a very slim lead over Gov. Jeff Colyer with almost all precincts reporting. However, Mr. Colyer was enjoying an advantage in Kansas\u2019s most populous jurisdiction, Johnson County, where nearly all the remaining votes were to be counted.If Mr. Kobach, who has made a national name for himself for devising crackdowns on immigration and voting rights, were to lose, it would snap Mr. Trump\u2019s streak of success in Republican primaries. The president has crowned Republican nominees from Georgia to South Carolina to Alabama in recent nominating contests. In the case of Kansas, though, Mr. Trump defied White House aides and other high-level Republican officials who urged him to stay out of a race involving a sitting governor. Many Republican leaders, and most all Democrats, believe Mr. Kobach would be a weaker general election candidate for the G.O.P. and perhaps imperil their grip on the state\u2019s governorshipBut it was the Ohio congressional race that transfixed Democrats and Republicans as one of the marquee midterm battles of the summer. The Republican Party\u2019s tactics that helped Mr. Balderson are now likely to be reproduced across the country this fall, as Republicans defend their congressional majority in similar districts stocked with the right-of-center suburbanites who proved so elusive in the special election.Republicans prevailed in Ohio by wielding a set of divisive issues \u2014 including gun rights, immigration restriction and taxes \u2014 that mobilized just enough voters on their side, particularly in the exurban and more rural reaches of the district. And they invoked Ms. Pelosi at every opportunity.Mr. Trump attacked Mr. O\u2019Connor in a weekend rally as an agent of Ms. Pelosi, even though Mr. O\u2019Connor pledged he would not vote to make her speaker of the House.Yet Mr. Trump, in a characteristic moment of thinking aloud, also ruminated on the difficulty of the midterm environment. Pleading with Ohio Republicans to show up for Mr. Balderson, he identified the dynamic that made the race so taxing for his party: Republican lethargy and disillusionment.\u201cWhoever has the White House, that party tends to lose the midterms,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. Maybe it\u2019s complacency. Maybe you all fight so hard for the presidency and you win and you\u2019re a little complacent.\u201dMr. O\u2019Connor, whom Mr. Trump dubbed \u201cDanny Boy,\u201d was somewhat handcuffed by the nature of the district. It includes high-income and well-educated voters close to Columbus who revile Mr. Trump, as well as a more pro-Trump rural element toward the seat\u2019s outer boundaries. So the Democrat studiously avoided training fire at the president, taking care to note in an interview Monday that he had been \u201cat Mass\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit.Asked about his reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s intervention, Mr. O\u2019Connor insisted he was \u201cindifferent\u201d and shifted to safer topics that he said voters wanted to discuss when he knocked on their doors: Social Security and the cost of college.Mr. Balderson and his allies also fought apathy among hard-core conservatives and disaffection among Republicans closer to the political center, fearing up to the end that they would be swamped by overwhelming turnout among Democrats and independents.Ambivalence about Mr. Trump was on display across the district on Election Day, as enthusiasm for the state of the economy mingled with misgivings about the president\u2019s record and personal conduct.John Begley, 43, an insurance executive who voted for Mr. Balderson, said he did so to send a message of support for Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s important that we stand behind what we voted for in the general election,\u201d said Mr. Begley. Asked what he was happy with about the president\u2019s record, Mr. Begley answered: \u201cMy investment accounts.\u201dFor some voters, economic prosperity was not enough to allay a deeper sense of unease. Pam Moore, 57, said that even though \u201cmy stocks are doing well,\u201d she voted for Mr. O\u2019Connor. She said Mr. Trump scares her.\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to make some crazy decision that could turn us around in the wrong direction,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who works in the loan department of a bank.Josh Wickham, 38, a community college administrator, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 but for Mr. O\u2019Connor on Tuesday. He said he wanted a Democratic-majority House to be a check on the president, especially over some conservative social positions the White House has promoted. A sister of Mr. Wickham\u2019s is married to another woman and is \u201cterrified,\u201d he said, of a conservative Supreme Court reversing same-sex marriage.The special election was set in motion earlier this year by the resignation of Pat Tiberi, a nine-term incumbent who quit midway through his term to take over a business association back in the state capital. Republicans initially believed they could hold the district with relative ease, so long as they nominated a mainstream candidate. And so the party worked aggressively to steer Mr. Balderson, 56, through a contested primary that he barely won.But Mr. O\u2019Connor, the 31-year-old county recorder in Franklin County, which includes Columbus and is the most Democratic-leaning part of the district, proved unexpectedly formidable as a challenger, collecting more money for his campaign than Mr. Balderson and assailing the Republican as a threat to popular health care and retirement-security programs. And Mr. O\u2019Connor aligned himself in his rhetoric with Gov. John R. Kasich, Ohio\u2019s Republican chief executive who is an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, and who withheld his endorsement from Mr. Balderson until the last week of the race.Mr. Balderson struggled to raise money and kept a modest campaign schedule, forcing Republican outside groups to bail him out with expensive independent advertising campaigns. And despite fears about unsettling swing voters, Republicans ultimately called on Mr. Trump to help stir up support for Mr. Balderson among conservatives who were mostly tuned out of the race.Mr. O\u2019Connor may have handed Mr. Balderson a decisive gift in the final stages of the race when he seemed to soften his pledge to oppose Ms. Pelosi in a television interview. The brief fumble gave Republicans a valuable opening to attack Mr. O\u2019Connor as a conventional Democratic partisan in a district that leans well to the right.Jonathan Martin reported from Westerville, Ohio, and Alexander Burns from New York.

Both books belong to one of today\u2019s most important genres: the Not-About-Trump-But-Also-Sort-Of-About-Trump, or N.A.T.B.A.S.O.A.T., book. There is a hunger to understand this moment, but from a remove.And both books help explain so much more than Trump. #MeToo. White nationalism. Hindu nationalism. Black Lives Matter. Campus debates about privilege and appropriation. Syria. Islamism. The spread of populism and retreat of democracy worldwide. The rise of the far right in Europe. The rise of the far left in the United States. All these phenomena throb with questions of identity, of \u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cTo what do I belong?\u201d Appiah and Fukuyama seek out answers.Appiah believes we\u2019re in wars of identity because we keep making the same mistake: exaggerating our differences with others and our similarities with our own kind. We think of ourselves as part of monolithic tribes up against other tribes, whereas we each contain multitudes. Fukuyama, less a cosmopolitan and more a nation-state guy, has greater sympathy for people clinging to differences. He thinks it a natural response to our age \u2014 but also seems to believe that if we don\u2019t find a way to subsume narrow identities into national ones, we\u2019re all going to die.Appiah begins \u201cThe Lies That Bind\u201d by observing that he, a man of ambiguous identity, is constantly asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d His book is an exploration of why people feel a need to pin identities down \u2014 to essentialize \u2014 and how to escape the pinning.Appiah\u2019s project is to point out our most common errors in thinking about five types of identity, all conveniently beginning with the letter \u201cc\u201d: creed, country, color, class and culture. (This gimmick lends proof to his cosmopolitan idea: A British-born philosopher can also be an American salesman.)Among the errors we make: On \u201cc\u201d No. 1, creed, we tend to think of religions as \u201csets of immutable beliefs\u201d instead of as \u201cmutable practices and communities.\u201d We make religion a noun when it should really be a verb, which gives rise to fundamentalism.

But just as people on the left finish clapping at that, he decries the left\u2019s complaints about \u201ccultural appropriation,\u201d because culture is too complex to have a clear chain of title and, he says, because \u201cthose who parse these transgressions in terms of ownership have accepted a commercial system that\u2019s alien to the traditions they aim to protect.\u201dAppiah\u2019s writing is often fresh, even beautiful: 19th-century scientists who tried to make the non-thing of race a thing were being \u201crecruited to give content to color.\u201d Fair warning, however: This book also traffics in a disconcerting amount of philosopher-speak \u2014 both the signposting tics of \u201cI aim to persuade you that\u2026\u201d and substantive sentences like \u201cScholarly exegesis can also run athwart older ecclesiastic interpretations,\u201d which risk turning away many who need this book.Fukuyama is more sympathetic to that need in \u201cIdentity.\u201d The assertion of particular identities, and the insistence that respect be paid to them, is a hallmark of our age. And it is, in his telling, not because people are bad at reasoning or narrow, but because of how discombobulating our age has been.Globalization, the internet, automation, mass migration, the emergence of India and China, the financial crisis of 2008, the rise of women and their displacing of men in more service-oriented economies, the civil rights movement and the emancipation of other groups and the loss of status for white people \u2014 these are just some of what we have lived through of late. Yes, the world has gotten better for hundreds of millions. But Fukuyama reminds us that across much of the West, people have suffered dislocation and elites have captured the fruits.Amid these changes, Fukuyama writes, identity politics has come to the fore, and it has become our common culture, no longer the province of a party or side. In American politics, for example, the left used to focus on economic equality, he argues, and the right on limited government. Today, the left concentrates on \u201cpromoting the interests of a wide variety of groups perceived as being marginalized,\u201d whereas the right \u201cis redefining itself as patriots who seek to protect traditional national identity, an identity that is often explicitly connected to race, ethnicity or religion.\u201dFukuyama suggests that we are living in an era in which the sense of being dismissed, rather than material interest, is the locomotive of human affairs. The rulers of Russia, Hungary and China are driven by past national humiliations. Osama bin Laden was driven by the treatment of Palestinians. Black Lives Matter has been driven by the fatal disrespect of the police. And a large swath of the American right, which claims to loathe identity politics, is driven by its own perception of being dissed.Unlike many avuncular critics of identity politics, Fukuyama is sympathetic to the good such politics does \u2014 above all, making the privileged aware of their effect on marginalized groups. \u201cOutsiders to those groups often fail to perceive the harm they are doing by their actions,\u201d he writes.Fukuyama does have his criticisms, however. He fears identity politics \u201chas become a cheap substitute for serious thinking about how to reverse the 30-year trend in most liberal democracies toward greater socioeconomic inequality.\u201d Fukuyama worries that the \u201cwoker\u201d the left gets on identity issues, the weaker it gets on offering a critique of capitalism.Unlike Appiah, Fukuyama doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s possible or desirable for humans to see themselves as human before all else. He is a believer in the nation-state as a healthy unit of human affairs, and he spends the final part of his smart, crisp book exploring how countries can cultivate \u201cintegrative national identities\u201d that are rooted in liberal and democratic values \u2014 identities large enough to be inclusive, but small enough to give people a real sense of agency over their society.A low-key shortcoming of Fukuyama\u2019s book is that, like Appiah\u2019s, it is a book about books about books. On the one hand, theorists gotta theorize. On the other, with an issue so fraught and a world so full of rage, each author could have made good use of a rental car and the Voice Memos app. For all their strengths, both books lack the earth and funk and complexity of dreaming, hurting human beings.We need more thinkers as wise as Appiah and Fukuyama digging their fingers into the soil of our predicament. And we need more readers reading what they harvest.Anand Giridharadas is the author of \u201cWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats See an Opening in Kansas if Trump Ally Wins Primary", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOPEKA, Kan. \u2014 The evolution of the Kansas Republican Party mirrors that of the national party, a rightward shift from the moderation of Dwight D. Eisenhower to the mainstream conservatism of Bob Dole to the small-government absolutism of former Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita-based Koch Industries.Now the party appears to be shifting once more: toward the hard-line nationalism of President Trump. And that has delighted Democrats who see an opening to make significant gains in a conservative-leaning state.A crucial moment will come in Tuesday\u2019s primary election when Kansas\u2019 secretary of state, Kris Kobach \u2014 a Trump ally who has become a national lightning rod for his views on immigration and voting rights \u2014 could snatch the nomination for governor from the incumbent, Gov. Jeff Colyer.If Republicans select a candidate as polarizing as Mr. Kobach, it could have profound political implications for both local and national Democrats. Not only could they take back a Great Plains state governorship \u2014 winning veto power in the next round of redistricting \u2014 but they could also pick up a pair of House seats, making Kansas as pivotal to the battle for control of the House as more traditional, and more liberal, battleground states.The potential for such pickups, turning Bleeding Kansas several shades bluer, has alarmed Republican officials in Topeka, the state capital, and in Washington.The schism here is playing out in other Republican primaries, where firebrand candidates, mimicking the president\u2019s inflammatory style and focus on immigration and identity-related issues, are unsettling other party leaders who worry that nominating provocateurs could undermine their prospects in November.Sitting in his state office with a view of Kansas\u2019 imposing capitol, and an array of flattering magazine and newspaper clippings on his lobby wall, Mr. Kobach simply smiled broadly earlier this week when asked whether the president may offer his blessing in the primary. But he did allow that he had talked to Mr. Trump the day before and that the president was aware of his strength in the polls.A Kobach candidacy, while pleasing to his party\u2019s most conservative core, would energize liberals and moderates in the two House districts up for grabs.In an interview, Mr. Colyer, the current governor, warned that nominating \u201cKris would bring a lot of risk\u201d because of his unpopularity with the general electorate, citing polls that show Mr. Kobach behind the potential Democratic nominee while trumpeting his own \u201cvery broad appeal.\u201d And, without prompting, he cited the importance of protecting the two House seats.But Mr. Kobach argued that midterm elections are determined by which candidate can most effectively motivate the ideological base of the party, and he said that was him.\u201cColyer can\u2019t motivate anybody to turn out,\u201d said Mr. Kobach. \u201cThat\u2019s not his forte.\u201dThe intraparty clash here illustrates the divisions between those Republican Party leaders who may have been more comfortable in the pre-Trump era \u2014 such as Mr. Colyer, a well-to-do and mild-mannered plastic surgeon \u2014 and those suited for the incendiary and racially-tinged politics of the moment, like the hard-charging Mr. Kobach.But Kansas Republicans have been practicing fratricide since long before Mr. Trump descended an escalator at Trump Tower to declare his candidacy. The moderate-versus-conservative split, once rooted in a divide over abortion rights, has allowed Democrats to win the governorship over the years even as the state\u2019s voters have sent an unbroken line of Republicans to the Senate since 1932.\u201cKansans like balance, particularly at the state level,\u201d said former Governor Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat who was elected to two terms during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency and has returned to the state after serving as secretary of health and human services under former President Barack Obama.Democrats have an opportunity to win again this year, and not just because Mr. Trump is mobilizing liberals and Mr. Kobach could frighten moderates.Mr. Brownback, who is now the United States ambassador at large for international religious freedom, left Topeka with unsightly approval ratings. And he has left his one-time lieutenant in something of a political no man\u2019s land. Not wanting to be cast as representing a third Brownback term, Mr. Colyer said people don\u2019t confuse him \u201cwith Sam.\u201d But given his ties to the former governor, and the relative scarcity of moderate Republicans in a statewide primary, Mr. Colyer cannot abandon his predecessor entirely.Compounding Mr. Colyer\u2019s challenge, he is not the only Republican alternative to Mr. Kobach. Ken Selzer, the state insurance commissioner, and Jim Barnett, a former state senator, are also seeking the nomination.Mr. Barnett is especially problematic to Mr. Colyer. He is running as an unambiguous moderate and therefore drawing Republican voters who may otherwise side with the governor in an effort to block Mr. Kobach from the nomination. But Mr. Barnett, who was the Republican nominee when Ms. Sebelius was re-elected in 2006, said he would not withdraw from the race, saying \u201ca vote for Colyer is a vote for Brownback.\u2019\u2019He criticized his rivals for \u201ccrawling all over each other to be the most anti-illegal immigration, anti-abortion, pro-gun candidate.\u201dMr. Barnett denied Republican claims that he had been offered a cabinet post by Democrats. But he said he and Mr. Colyer met privately at a Topeka coffee shop in the spring and that, since then, one of the governor\u2019s donors had repeatedly asked him to leave the race, offering a job in the cabinet in return. Mr. Colyer said he was not aware of any such deal-making but stressed there would be opportunities for the \u201ctalented people in the race,\u201d even invoking Abraham Lincoln\u2019s team of rivals.But what worries Republicans is that some from their centrist wing are already siding with the Democrats, even though Mr. Kobach has yet to even win the nomination.One of them is State Senator Barbara Bollier. She is the sort of voter the G.O.P. cannot afford to lose, a woman bearing a graduate degree who hails from populous and prosperous Johnson County, the well-manicured Kansas City suburb that Mr. Colyer also calls home.But Ms. Bollier has endorsed her colleague and the likely Democratic nominee for governor, State Senator Laura Kelly.\u201cShe\u2019s a moderate and Kansas is in general a moderate state,\u201d said Ms. Bollier, noting that bipartisan majorities in the legislature voted to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, only to see Mr. Brownback veto the bill.The challenge for Kansas Democrats, though, is that Ms. Kelly is not the only alternative for dissident Republicans or unaffiliated voters uneasy with Mr. Kobach and Mr. Colyer.Greg Orman, a wealthy businessman who ran as an independent against Senator Pat Roberts in 2014, is also seeking the governorship this year, again as an independent. Having already spent $650,000 of his own money, Mr. Orman threatens to siphon votes away from Democrats, potentially allowing Mr. Kobach or Mr. Colyer to win the governorship with only a plurality.His candidacy has angered Democrats, who are stung in part because they effectively undid their nominating process in 2014 to let Mr. Orman serve as their de facto standard-bearer against Mr. Roberts.\u201cIt\u2019s all about ego,\u201d Ms. Sebelius said of Mr. Orman\u2019s candidacy. She said there had been \u201ca whole lot of people approaching Greg saying, \u2018Do not do this\u2019 and \u2018All you can do is be a spoiler.\u2019\u201dMs. Sebelius said the effort to push Mr. Orman out of the race would intensify, but if he does not leave, Democrats would have to \u201cJill Stein him\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Green Party presidential nominee who drained votes from Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 and warn that \u201ca vote for him is just a vote for Kobach.\u201dAsked about the criticism that he would simply assure a Republican victory, Mr. Orman said, \u201cVotes aren\u2019t the property of the parties, they belong to the people.\u201dAt least one Republican seemed confident about the source of Mr. Orman\u2019s support.\u201cA liberal independent jumping in?\u201d said Mr. Kobach, with evident delight. \u201cI think he will probably take votes from the Democrats.\u201dAs for his state\u2019s \u201cthrow the bums out\u201d impulse, Mr. Kobach said he would be even more of a conservative than Mr. Brownback. \u201cIt is time for a change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the time for a change doesn\u2019t have to be in a leftward direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Warn More China Tariffs Will Cripple Them and Hurt Consumers", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States and China prepare to resume fractious trade talks this week, executives from American companies flocked to Washington on Monday to warn the Trump administration that imposing tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would cripple their businesses and raise prices on everything from bicycles to car seats to refrigerators.While the companies appearing before the government panel varied widely, their concerns struck a similar theme: The United States is no longer equipped to produce many materials that they depend on for their products. The rise of global supply chains has shifted the bulk of manufacturing and production outside the United States, leaving companies no choice but to rely on foreign materials, including those from China.Jim Day, a vice president at the \u201947 Brand hat company, said it would take at least a decade for the United States to develop the manufacturing capacity to produce the hats he sells because such facilities were shuttered many years ago. If President Trump\u2019s tariffs move ahead, Mr. Day said, it will mean job cuts at his Massachusetts-based business.\u201cWe\u2019re supportive of the president\u2019s desire to protect U.S. businesses, continue economic growth and bring jobs to the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Day said. \u201cOur position is this proposed tariff increase would do the opposite.\u201dMr. Trump has said his tariffs are a negotiating tactic to compel China to lower its trade barriers, stop the theft of intellectual property and open its markets to businesses from the United States. His trade policy, which includes tariffs on steel and aluminum from countries across the globe, is also aimed at lifting American manufacturing by making it less cost-effective to outsource production overseas.But companies that rely heavily on Chinese imports say that approach will destroy many of the American businesses the president has said he is trying to help.Jennifer Harned, the president of Bell Sports, which makes helmets for cyclists and skaters, said the tariffs her company would face on pads and straps from China could send costs soaring, potentially nudging cyclists to go helmet-free.\u201cWe fear consumers could forgo utilizing products altogether, choosing to ignore safety laws perhaps by not buying a bike light and getting hit by a car because a driver does not see them or not wearing a helmet and dying from an impact to their skull,\u201d said Ms. Harned, whose Illinois-based company employs 500 workers.Others suggested that national health care costs could be inflated by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs if the price of fitness products put that $600 treadmill out of reach or made even basic sporting goods unattainable.Tom Cove of the Sports and Fitness Industry Association said 10 to 25 percent tariffs on plastic youth baseball gloves could discourage children from taking up the game and getting involved with exercise activities generally. He argued that raising the cost of getting in shape would be detrimental to the United States economy in the long term.\u201cIt makes no sense to drive up the price of products that otherwise contribute to lowering the national expenditure on health care,\u201d Mr. Cove said.And, he added, finding alternatives to China or producing such products domestically is not the answer for companies that have been depending on Chinese manufacturing for decades.\u201cChina remains a vital and not easily replaceable link in our industry\u2019s supply chain,\u201d Mr. Cove said. \u201cShifting manufacturing to other countries is simply not feasible in real time or to scale.\u201dThe White House is \u201cunwavering in their view that the U.S. will \u2018win\u2019 this trade war and that the Chinese government will have to capitulate,\u201d Henrietta Treyz, the director of economic policy research at Veda Partners, an investment advisory firm, said in a note to clients. \u201cWe do not have evidence to suggest that China is preparing to capitulate in such a manner and do not see an end to the tariffs in the near term.\u201dAt the hearing at the United States International Trade Commission building on Monday, business leaders said that they understood Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to negotiate a more favorable trade deal with China, but that tariffs were a misguided approach.Some officials there represented businesses not yet on the tariff list, but feared they could be next. Among them was Stephen Lang, the president of the American Bridal and Prom Industry Association, who said it is impossible to find people in the United States to do the intricate beading and sewing necessary to make prom and wedding dresses on a large scale.\u201cWe can\u2019t make wedding gowns and prom dresses in the United States,\u201d said Mr. Lang, who said he feared what would happen if his industry was the next to face tariffs. \u201cNobody wants to do this work.\u201dMr. Lang, who is the chief executive of Mon Cheri Bridals in New York, said he had to change banks this year because his lender thought tariffs posed a risk to his business.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be put out of business because of an ill-placed attempt to balance the books between these two countries,\u201d he said.Not every company represented at the hearing is expected to oppose the tariffs. On Friday, Michael Korchmar, the owner of Korchmar, a leather specialty company, is scheduled to testify about the pain China has inflicted on his business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Overtourism\u2019 Worries Europe. How Much Did Technology Help Get Us There?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtOver the summer, my wife and I traveled with our two young kids on a two-week vacation through Europe.It wasn\u2019t as highfalutin as it sounds. In London, our Airbnb had ample skylights \u2014 which rendered the place all but uninhabitable during Europe\u2019s heat wave. In Paris, our charming home-share had a cavernous hole in the ceiling of the entryway, revealing load-bearing beams that appeared to have been rotting since Napoleon\u2019s reign. And in Amsterdam, our Airbnb advertised a kids\u2019 bedroom stocked with toys \u2014 but failed to mention the mosquitoes and mice.I\u2019m not complaining. If travel mishaps are the stuff of memory, my vacation was unforgettable. And without home-sharing services like Airbnb, review sites like TripAdvisor and conveniences like Uber, OpenTable and Expedia, the trip would have been far more expensive, less accessible and, in a strange way, less authentic.But my tech-abetted trip was illuminating, too, because it provided a firsthand look into a vexing problem that has gripped much of Europe lately \u2014 the worry of \u201covertourism,\u201d and the rising chorus that blames technologies like Airbnb, Uber and other internet-enabled travel conveniences for the menace.This growth might once have been considered unambiguously good news. But the world\u2019s most popular destinations cannot expand to accommodate an infinite flood of visitors. Advocates of curbing tourism say too many visitors are altering the character of historic cities, and making travel terrible, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a level of tourism which is degrading the enjoyment that residents have, but it\u2019s also degrading the tourist experience, because the tourist who is endlessly queuing behind backpacks of hundreds of other tourists is not discovering the real or the authentic place,\u201d said Justin Francis, the chief executive of Responsible Travel, a company that arranges \u201csustainable\u201d travel for customers.What\u2019s to blame? In addition to broad prosperity, there\u2019s technology, defined very broadly.Finally, as in almost every other issue these days, there is the influence of social media.\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about overtourism without mentioning Instagram and Facebook \u2014 I think they\u2019re big drivers of this trend,\u201d Mr. Francis said. \u201cSeventy-five years ago, tourism was about experience seeking. Now it\u2019s about using photography and social media to build a personal brand. In a sense, for a lot of people, the photos you take on a trip become more important than the experience.\u201dThat so many different forces play into overtourism highlights the difficulties of doing much about it. Managing a tourist destination is something like managing a natural resource, like a mine or a fishery; a sustainable level of tourists brings widespread gains to the local economy, but too many ruin it for everyone. Cities that are looking to tame the number of tourists must manage a delicate balance \u2014 to gently discourage some forms of travel without appearing unwelcoming to others.That brings us to the hand-wringing over Airbnb, which has been singled out by lawmakers across Europe as a primary driver of overtourism. In Amsterdam, the authorities are pushing to slash the number of nights that residents can rent their homes to 30 from 60. Several other cities, including London and Barcelona, Spain, have also instituted stringent home-sharing rules.The measures reflect Airbnb\u2019s jaw-dropping growth. In just a few years, the company has become a significant force in the tourism economies of many cities. In Amsterdam, according to the company, Airbnb accounted for 12 percent of all overnight bookings in 2017. In Barcelona, Airbnb had an 18 percent market share. And in Kyoto, Japan, it was 22 percent.Airbnb said that because it offered lodging across a city \u2014 rather than only in the tourist hot spots where hotels typically congregate \u2014 it could distribute crowds more evenly.In an interview, Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s vice president for public affairs, also argued that the site benefited local economies more directly than hotels did.\u201cOur local hosts make 97 percent of the money that they list their homes for,\u201d Mr. Lehane said. \u201cOur guests stay longer than a typical hotel guest, and they\u2019re spreading the economic gains across a whole community in a way that doesn\u2019t happen with hotels.\u201d He said that while there was some friction with cities over the company\u2019s huge growth, he had seen signs of a more recent thaw.\u201cAmsterdam is an outlier right now,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the most part, we are generally in the ballpark in our discussions with cities.\u201dThese challenges are unlikely to remain fixed for long, because the technology that exacerbates it is always changing. One recent problem is the rise of a more professional class of home-sharers \u2014 people who buy up properties to rent out full time on home-sharing sites, often in violation of local rules.Airbnb said it tries to crack down on rule-breaking hosts, but even some of its nominal allies wonder how diligently.\u201cThe issue for Airbnb, and I\u2019ve said this to them, is that there are listings that are not home-sharing \u2014 the people who buy up multiple flats and list them all, which really changes the character of a city,\u201d said Jonathan Tourtellot, the founder of the Sustainable Stewardship Center, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable tourism. Airbnb commissioned Mr. Tourtellot to write the foreword of its report.Another issue is that Airbnb has faced more competition from newer home-sharing services \u2014 and the authorities have had trouble policing some of its competitors.The more general problem is nonstop growth everywhere.\u201cAt the end, this story is just a numbers problem,\u201d Mr. Tourtellot said. He noted that in 1960, when the jet age began, around 25 million international trips were taken. Last year, the number was 1.3 billion.As for the cities that are the major destinations? They are \u201cthe same size they were back in 1959, and they\u2019ll probably stay that way,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

There were certainly more than just two employees. But you could see, as the boxes flew down the conveyor belts, the beginnings of this trend toward fewer and fewer people doing the work. In that sense, there was nothing surprising to me in the look or feel of this \u201cfuturistic\u201d distribution center.Maybe the reason Ms. Cao wanted to shoot there is that its lack of hustle and bustle is so jarring. China is a country with 1.4 billion people, and my own experience in visiting a manufacturing or distribution site was to be awed by the sheer mass of humanity you encounter. Everything is the biggest, with the most people. Now, though, China is undergoing a big demographic shift, with a steadily declining population of young people. In some parts of the country, there are already shortages of migrant labor.An excerpt from \u201cAsia One,\u201d in which a robot-operated factory floor becomes a stage for one of China\u2019s leading young artists. In \u201cAsia One,\u201d China is no longer the back office but the main stage. The factory is gleaming \u2014 cardboard boxes dance across the screen as if they were in a Busby Berkeley musical \u2014 but no one is there. These two workers appear to be middle-class, and they\u2019re managing this hugely complex set of logistical operations. Yet they might as well be the last people on earth, and they are under constant surveillance.China is also going full steam ahead with facial recognition technologies, mobile payments and mass surveillance. There are cameras everywhere, CCTV everywhere. At lots of the factories I visited, companies had installed fingerprint recognition to better track and authenticate who was visiting the site. And Ms. Cao is playing with that \u2014 the female worker has a bar code tattooed on her wrist, as if she were the product rather than the employee.Probably 90 percent of these delivery workers are migrants from elsewhere in China, and in Ms. Cao\u2019s project you see the delivery men shoving odd-shaped packages into a van, racing through the alleyways of Beijing. And she takes you home with some of these people, where several generations live in a one-room apartment.When you put the two films together, you have this portrait of a Chinese economy with a lot of automation, but still a lot of heavy lifting and arduous tasks. And she shows you the challenges for the human worker in 2018, and the coming challenges of isolation, loneliness and perhaps joblessness \u2014 or the absence of jobs. And of technological control.In the U.S. we think of shipping and robotics as economic questions, but of course they are deeply political in China. And this gets to why I think \u201cAsia One\u201d is such a monumental work: Ms. Cao somehow convinced one of China\u2019s most valuable companies, with deep government ties, to let her shoot this tragic portrait of China\u2019s future \u2014 our future, too \u2014 right inside its flagship warehouse.And in \u201cAsia One,\u201d Ms. Cao invests this empty factory with this romantic, heroic, Cultural Revolution-style rhetoric. You\u2019re really working for the benefit of the company and its shareholders, but you have to fuse that with national priorities and ambitions.

It is likely, Vanguard says, that the long stretches of sizzling stock markets since 2009 \u2014 bouts that have made investing a winner\u2019s game for those lucky enough to afford a seat at the table \u2014 will become much rarer.Vanguard tracks data to predict the likelihood of a recession at certain points in the future. In recent years, the company has put the probability of a recession six months out at close to 10 percent. Now, Vanguard says the chances of one by late 2020 are between 30 and 40 percent. That\u2019s Vanguard\u2019s highest-ever estimate for that time frame, Mr. Davis said. (A six-month forecast reported a greater than 40 percent probability before the recession that started in December 2007.)If the facts change \u2014 with, say, the Federal Reserve delaying anticipated interest-rate hikes in response to a weaker economy \u2014 the recession forecast will change, too, Mr. Davis said. To be clear, Vanguard isn\u2019t predicting a recession; it is merely saying that the odds of one have risen.The forecast suggests opportunities, not just problems, Mr. Davis said. The 10-year outlook, for example, includes lower projected annualized returns, but still positive ones, for these two stock categories:\u25a0 United States stocks, an expected 10-year return of 3.9 percent, annualized, down from a projection of an 8 percent annualized return, made in March 2013;\u25a0 Stocks from markets outside the United States, 6.5 percent, annualized, down from 8.7 percent in 2013.Non-United States stocks are more attractive for equity investors, on a relative basis, than they were five years ago. (That is partly a reflection of the out-performance of domestic stocks, making them far pricier than they were before.) What\u2019s more, Vanguard projects improved 10-year annualized returns for these asset classes:\u25a0 A diversified portfolio of United States bonds, 3.3 percent, annualized, up from 1.7 percent in March 2013;\u25a0 Bonds from outside the United States, 2.9 percent, up from 1.8 percent;\u25a0 Commodities, 5.9 percent, up from 4.2 percent;\u25a0 United States Treasury bonds, 3 percent, up from 1.3 percent;\u25a0 And cash, held in United States money market funds, savings accounts or other instruments, 2.9 percent, up from 1.5 percent. Short-term cash is becoming more attractive \u2014 with greater liquidity and, often, lower risk \u2014 compared with holding bonds.Experienced investors who are \u201csophisticated enough to focus on these numbers and act on them themselves\u201d can benefit by making their own adjustments, Mr. Davis said. Tried-and true investments like balanced funds and target date funds (which become more conservative as a given date nears) can make basic adjustments for you. Advisers can do this as well.Tweaking investments can make it easier to live with them \u2014 and not panic \u2014 if markets fall, Mr. Kinniry said. At the moment, though, many Americans appear to be setting themselves up for trouble.By the start of this year, the stock portion of investment portfolios swelled to 63 percent, the highest level in decades, according to a Vanguard analysis. That reflects the rising value of stocks after one of the greatest bull markets in history.American portfolios had the same high proportion of stocks in September 2007. People bailed out as the market crashed a decade ago \u2014 taking huge losses after prices had already fallen \u2014 and reducing the equity proportion of their portfolios to only 38 percent in January 2009.Dividing a portfolio between stocks and bonds is a personal decision. If you can afford to ride out a major stock market decline, and truly don\u2019t need to touch your money for a decade or two, you might be fine with a broadly diversified portfolio that holds only stocks, Mr. Kinniry said.After all, he said, it took only 3 years for such a portfolio to recover all of its losses after the roughly 50 percent stock market decline of the last crash. But withstanding losses like those without selling any holdings took extreme fortitude. That\u2019s why it was easier to live with a broadly diversified portfolio, with 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds. Such a portfolio recovered all of its losses in just one year, not three, according to data provided by Mr. Kinniry.Doing a serious gut check and realistically assessing how you will behave if a major downturn occurs can prevent a lot of pain later. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that you don\u2019t have enough car insurance or home insurance until after an accident happens,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cYou\u2019re better off if you do the inventory now.\u201dAnd if the markets do turn out to provide lower returns in the next decade than in the last one, it may be possible to compensate by taking measures that you can at least partly control, perhaps by working more, increasing savings or reducing spending.The odds have worsened. Surely it\u2019s better to be prepared.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As \u2018Lula\u2019 Sits in Brazil Jail, Party Nominates Him for President", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u2019s face was everywhere at the Workers\u2019 Party national convention: T-shirts featured him as a young metalworker, posters showed him as a seasoned politician wading through crowds and hundreds of supporters donned cardboard \u201cLula\u201d masks.Only Lula himself, as Mr. da Silva is popularly known, was missing from the kickoff of his presidential candidacy on Saturday.\u201cI am Lula!\u201d the crowds shouted as they nominated Mr. da Silva with a show of hands.The two-time president, who left office in 2011 with a record-high approval rating, now sits in a jail cell serving a 12-year sentence for corruption. The Supreme Electoral Court is widely expected to bar him from running for a third term in the October election.But the charismatic leader could still be the deciding factor in this year\u2019s splintered race.The Workers\u2019 Party insists Lula is the only name they will put on the ballot. Their aim is to generate enough popular support to force the courts to set him free and allow him to campaign. The party even delayed announcing a running mate until a day after the convention, keeping the spotlight on Mr. da Silva.\u201cLula is innocent, so we won\u2019t accept any other candidate,\u201d Gleisi Hoffmann, a senator and the party\u2019s national president, said in a recent interview. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is political persecution.\u201dMany of his die-hard supporters agree. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s convention, party faithful went on a hunger strike and vowed to march on Bras\u00edlia later this month when parties will officially register their candidates with the top electoral court.In the southern city of Curitiba, where he is imprisoned, Mr. da Silva has hosted a stream of high-profile visitors in his 161-square-foot cell on Thursdays, when friends and family are allowed to enter.As part of their Lula-or-bust strategy, several leading members of the Workers\u2019 Party changed their names on social media accounts after he was jailed, adding Lula to their handles. Ms. Hoffmann was among them.\u201cThe judiciary, the elite, the media, they have done everything to try and impede him,\u201d Ms. Hoffmann said. \u201cThey thought the only way to stop Lula was to physically remove him, to put him in jail. But far from stopping him, it has just made people more supportive.\u201dThat is an impressive showing for someone who has not made a public appearance since April, who can\u2019t record videos, grant interviews to journalists or weigh in on Twitter in real time \u2014 although the party updates his social media accounts frequently.That loyalty is a testament to his devoted following among poor and middle-class Brazilians, especially in the northeast.\u201cPolitics are ugly, but Lula is the only politician who has ever done anything for poor people,\u201d said Josu\u00e9 Eduardo, a gardener from Recife, in Mr. da Silva\u2019s home state of Pernambuco. \u201cThanks to Lula, my mom\u2019s village got electricity for the first time and my daughter got a house. If he tells me to vote for someone, I will.\u201dPolitical analysts say that Mr. da Silva is quietly working with the Workers\u2019 Party, or PT, on a Plan B candidate who could be endorsed at the last minute, but that keeping the former president in the race as long as possible is crucial to the party\u2019s strategy of promoting him as a martyr.\u201cThe only way the PT remains relevant in Brazilian politics is if they have a really united front on Lula,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, the director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThe PT is Lula.\u201dLike other political lions of the Latin American left, Mr. da Silva has so far not leveraged his popularity to groom a younger generation of successors. Leaders like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia were transformational, but critics argue that instead of creating sustainable political movements, their success was built on the cult of personality.Still, betting on Mr. da Silva has its risks. Many supporters have turned against him, holding him responsible for the rampant corruption and bribery scheme revealed by the continuing Lava Jato, or Car Wash, investigation. While 30 percent of Brazilians say they would vote for him, he now has a 36 percent rejection rate.Critics say Mr. da Silva and his party would have been better off supporting other left-wing leaders who have not been tainted by the corruption scandal instead of dividing the base.This election could be a test of the Workers\u2019 Party power without Mr. da Silva as the headline act.For now, he still seems to be calling the shots from prison.Although no cellphones or electronic equipment are permitted, Mr. da Silva can receive visits from lawyers five days a week. These have become his main means of communicating with the party, his base and the public. Through his lawyers, he has released handwritten notes and even a couple of op-eds, circumventing the prohibition on press interviews.Even before his nomination, Mr. Haddad took the lead in promoting the party\u2019s platform for the coming election and was widely considered Mr. da Silva\u2019s most likely heir, although he vehemently denies any talk of a Plan B.\u201cOur insistence on Lula wasn\u2019t the result of an electoral calculation, but of moral necessity,\u201d Mr. Haddad said during a recent interview at his home in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cBut it has ended up working out that way, because he just keeps climbing in the polls.\u201dMr. Haddad has been making the rounds presenting the \u201cfive axes\u201d of Mr. da Silva\u2019s government plan. These include general guidelines to revive the economy with public investment, an expansion of a program that deployed doctors in underserved areas and the promise to impose taxes on banks that refuse to lower interest rates on credit, which are some of the highest in the world.Mr. Haddad says party leaders hope that once the candidacies are officially registered on Aug. 15, Mr. da Silva will be allowed to exercise his political rights, recording ads for the free television campaign time allotted to parties and possibly participating in debates.But legal experts say the situation is unprecedented \u2014 and complicated.\u201cLula will have the same political rights in a broad sense, at least for now, but he will face the limitations of a criminal conviction,\u201d said Savio Chalita, a professor of electoral law. This means a criminal judge would have to grant the former president permission to leave the prison to go on the campaign trail or bring recording equipment into his cell, Mr. Chalita said.And then, there is the very likely scenario that the electoral court will rule him ineligible for office as a result of his corruption conviction. In that case, the party would have until 20 days before the vote to put forward another name.The longer the party waits, the less time it will have to promote a stand-in. It also raises the possibility that the country could face the first election of disputed legitimacy since the end of a military dictatorship in 1985.\u201cWhen you prevent the most popular leader in the country from running for election, the risk for Brazilian democracy is very high,\u201d Ms. Hoffmann said.Manuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Trade Truce Could Add Almost $2 Trillion to the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States stock market might be worth nearly $2 trillion more if not for the trade war.Consider that the cost that investors appear to be ascribing to President Trump\u2019s efforts to upend decades of trade relationships.Typically, it\u2019s hard to know why stocks are up or down over short periods. And the 5.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year might seem to be one of those inscrutable moves. But a closer look at the factors that usually drive the stock market suggests that the escalating trade tensions are holding stocks back.Two things happened at the start of the year that worried investors. First, soon after the S. & P. 500 hit an all-time high on Jan. 26, stocks plunged on fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more quickly than expected. Then, at the end of February, the Trump administration announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, the first clear shot in the trade war.Since then, neither the economy nor the Federal Reserve has sprung any nasty surprises. When investors dumped stocks in February, they were reacting to an unexpectedly strong number for wage growth. Since then, though, the economy has grown, adding on average 215,000 jobs per month, without an acceleration in wage growth, which investors track to gauge inflationary pressures. Friday\u2019s jobs report for July showed annual growth in wages of 2.7 percent, in line with the monthly average this year.And the Fed does not appear to be a threat right now to the stock market. Investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates twice more this year rather than once, which hardly constitutes a slamming of the brakes. In fact, the Fed said Wednesday that its monetary policy was still set to ensure that the economy remained buoyant.What is more, the bond market seems to agree that the economy can keep growing without a breakout in inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was expected to trade at 3 percent or higher in the second half of this year as the economy picked up, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Economic Forecasting Survey. But it has mostly traded below that threshold all year.On their own, a steadily growing economy and relatively supportive Fed policies would normally provide a springboard for stocks. But investors have had another reason to bid stocks higher: Corporate earnings have been coming in stronger than expected.So far, second-quarter earnings have exceeded Wall Street analysts\u2019 estimates for all 11 industry sectors of the S. & P. 500, according to researchers at BofA Merrill Lynch. Sales have surpassed estimates in nine sectors.So to what degree have Mr. Trump\u2019s trade battles tainted the bullish stock market conditions?One way to tell is to look at valuations, which reveal the underlying mood of investors. Right now, the S. & P. 500 is trading at 16.6 times what analysts expect its companies to make over the next 12 months, according to data from FactSet. But in the three months before the trade tensions really heated up at the end of February, the S. & P. 500 on average traded at 17.8 times earnings.Applying that higher multiple to stocks today would take the index over 3,000 points. Such a rise \u2014 7.5 percent from Friday\u2019s level \u2014 would add $1.8 trillion to the value of the stock market. The higher-than-expected corporate earnings would arguably support a higher valuation.What happens next? While Mr. Trump appeared willing to forge some sort of trade truce with the European Union, his metals tariffs are still in place and the actions against China are escalating. A big test for investors comes next month, when the Trump administration might impose $200 billion of extra tariffs on China. Given their size, the stock market may actually fall if those go ahead.If the Trump administration blinks and delays putting the tariffs into effect, it will signal a retreat from its plans to radically recast the United States\u2019 trade relations. But there could be a consolation prize: American investors may get to enjoy the nearly $2 trillion of gains that the trade war has apparently so far denied them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waiting for Caesar", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill the Trump White House start testing the limits of its power?Opinion ColumnistIn the eight years of the Obama presidency, there were three cycles of policymaking. First came the attempt to pass an ambitious liberal agenda through a Democratic-controlled Congress, which ended with the Republican House takeover in 2010. Then came the attempt to strike bargains, grand and otherwise, with John Boehner and congressional Republicans, which petered out early in Barack Obama\u2019s second term. And finally came the imperial phase, in which activists appealed to the president to claim powers that he had previously abjured, and override or sidestep congressional gridlock on immigration, climate policy and health care through the power of the presidential pen.Under Donald Trump the imperial phase might arrive much sooner. The possibility for further ambitious conservative legislation seems to have died away already; it's hard to imagine Trump successfully making deals with Democrats if his party loses the House in November, and so two years may stretch ahead of us in which literally nothing passes Congress except the necessary budget deals.These kinds of collisions are common in other presidential systems, especially Latin American governments that imitated our constitutional arrangements. And the drift of American institutions lately \u2014 the celebrity status of the presidency and the increasing powers claimed by presidents of both parties, the abdication and ineffectiveness of Congress, the tendency for policy disputes to be tacitly negotiated between the White House and the Supreme Court \u2014 is arguably creating some of the preconditions for a Latin American-style breakdown.But at the same time, the legacy of Obama\u2019s foray into Caesarism offers some reasons to think that our system will limp along without a crisis for a while. That\u2019s because one of the essential preconditions for such a crisis would be a feeling, in an ambitious White House, that going the full Caesar on some disputed issue would make them dramatically more popular. And in our environment of stark polarization, equally balanced parties and presidents who struggle to keep their approval ratings above water once the policymaking starts, it\u2019s hard to chart a course from constitutional aggression to clear political success. Certainly that was the case with the Obama White House. It wasn\u2019t just that Obama\u2019s more imperial forays on immigration were quickly tied up in the courts. It was that the imperial Obama was a politically unsuccessful Obama, whose party lost the Senate and then the White House during its imperial phase \u2014 ushering in a Republican presidency that set about unilaterally reversing much of its predecessor\u2019s unilateralism, from DACA to the Paris and Iran deals.In the same way but more so given his worse-than-Obama poll numbers, it\u2019s very hard to see how the imperial forays being urged on Trump by immigration restrictionists or supply-siders would make him more popular, or less likely to suffer a repudiation at the polls. (Maybe the capital gains cut would juice the economy enough to compensate for the awful optics of yet another tax cut weighted to the rich \u2026 but those of us who aren\u2019t sworn to the supply-side catechism should be doubtful.) By contrast, in countries where an imperial presidency transitions to an authoritarian one, the transition often happens precisely because the imperial president has strong popular support. The original Caesar was dangerous because he was beloved, and a country like Venezuela is where it is today because Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was able to win thumping-big electoral victories throughout his constitutional aggressions, on a scale that no recent American president has been able to achieve or sustain.So long as that kind of popularity eludes our chief executives, their unilateralism is more likely to be a driver of dysfunction \u2014 encouraging wild swings from presidency to presidency, impeding policy certainty and follow-through \u2014 than a greased slope to presidential tyranny. For that to change you would need a different correlation of forces than our polarized landscape currently produces \u2014 with a significantly more popular president pushing against a clearly unpopular Supreme Court or Congress, under conditions (a terror campaign, an economic crash) where the stakes in the big policy debates seem more immediate and dire.

Now, an Artist Is Rethinking One of His Houses.", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Set against the dramatic hills of Rio de Janeiro, Adriana Varej\u00e3o\u2019s recently renovated home brings the architect\u2019s vision to startling new life.Supported byBras\u00edlia is also where Varej\u00e3o spent the beginning of her childhood. The artist was born in Rio, but her parents moved to the city when she was 2 years old. Her father was a pilot in the air force. Her mother worked in public health as a nutritionist in Sobradinho, one of the several satellite cities ringing Bras\u00edlia\u2019s perimeter. Accompanying her on hospital visits, Varej\u00e3o witnessed firsthand the inequality Bras\u00edlia created. \u201cThe future never happened,\u201d Varej\u00e3o tells me, \u201cBras\u00edlia left us with some very nice buildings \u2014 I\u2019m not saying they aren\u2019t important \u2014 but it was at a very high cost.\u201dAt Varej\u00e3o\u2019s urging, I visit the S\u00e3o Bento Monastery, a Benedictine abbey completed in 1671, located across the city in downtown Rio. Inside, its Baroque details \u2014 ornate gold-leaf gilding and Rococo painted tiles \u2014 are transportive, delivering one to a much older Brazil. But after witnessing the violence rendered by Varej\u00e3o\u2019s brush, I cannot help but see this other Brazil as tainted with the complicity of colonialism\u2019s brutality. The strange geometry of Bras\u00edlia is a world apart. Niemeyer\u2019s idealism \u2014 his belief that architecture could create a world that was post-race and post-class \u2014 was na\u00efve, perhaps, but understandable. How else can a nation propel itself forward after having been so carelessly used \u2014 stripped and mined, bought and sold, without any consideration for anything but profit? The clean lines and syncopated curves of Niemeyer\u2019s architecture seem necessary compared to Baroque\u2019s dense hierarchy.TODAY, THE CARMEN Baldo house is no longer a relic. In a dramatic reconfiguration, Varej\u00e3o and Buarque decided to move the garage underground, which required digging deep into the hill. Even more flamboyantly, they purchased the property next door and demolished it, which allowed them to build a pool, a lush outdoor living space, a patio and a larger garden. They cut a large circular window into the living room so that it would overlook the pool, providing a sense of continuity between the two spaces. There are smaller touches as well: Though they kept the original color of the marigold yellow Formica in the kitchen, they knocked down the back wall, echoing the fluidity between the living room and the front terrace. Niemeyer understood the beauty of Modernism in Brazil\u2019s climate, and his open-air plans integrated perfectly with the textured scenery of the tropical outdoors. Lastly, all of the ceramic flooring as well as the terrace railing was replaced with Brazilian soapstone, its dark mossy green jagged with electric white stripes.Instead, the next day, I go to the house Niemeyer built for himself in Rio in 1953. It is past Leblon, the wealthy beachside neighborhood, in Barra de Tijuca, another wealthy beachside neighborhood. On my winding drive there, I glimpse the favelas. This is Rio, too, where immense poverty abuts immense wealth. Niemeyer was disdainful of money, even if he worked with those who had it. He rarely wrote about the private residences he designed, and he allowed only a handful to be illustrated or listed \u2014 as is the case with many prominent architects, he largely considered these designs exceptions, favors or one-offs. But his own house, with its views of both the mountains and the ocean, is canonical for its elegant curves and its cloudlike roof that sweeps across the horizon. To Niemeyer, light was a form of pleasure.Advertisement"}

Good thing the cliffs are dramatic, the flowers vivid and the penguins friendly.Supported byOr so I thought.And so I hit the road from Cape Town with my father on a mild October morning, on a mission to watch some whales. Our first stop was the surfing town of Muizenberg on False Bay, known for its rows of seaside changing huts in a riot of primary colors. You\u2019re more likely to spy sharks than whales in these waters, but I saw neither: just hordes of surfers and families heralding the first proper summery day in months. We grabbed croissants and cappuccinos from a cafe and strolled along the promenade to find a bench to take it all in.\u201cFlag\u2019s up!\u201d squealed a little boy, running out of the water and toward his parents. Suddenly, swimmers receded from the sea en masse. Shark spotters dot the hills around Muizenberg, on the lookout for any possible signs of nefarious marine activity. Different flags are raised to signify various scenarios \u2014 good visibility, bad visibility, suspected sighting, confirmed sighting. The flag being hoisted right then, featuring a menacing black shark against a white background, meant there had been a confirmed sighting \u2014 surf at your own risk, in other words. Judging by the number of swimmers still in the water, many deemed it worth that risk. Lifeguards on Jet Skis zipped through the waves, shooing stragglers back to shore. The last confirmed sighting was two months ago, someone told me, so I was witnessing the first bit of shark excitement in awhile.I took this flurry of action in the water as a good omen, and we got back into the car. Slopes clad in electric-green fynbos with bursts of vivid violet and yellow flowers rippled toward the ocean, and the mountains rising up in the distance looked more like painted backdrops to a play than anything found in nature. Suddenly, a garish digital sign interrupted the scenic splendor, flashing \u201cHigh-crime area \u2014 don\u2019t stop,\u201d reminding drivers that danger often looms beyond the bucolic watercolor peaks.botswananamibiaPretoriaJohannesburglesothosouthafricaIndianOceanAtlanticOcean200 miles1Cape Townsouth africaMuizenbergGordon\u2019s BayFalseBaySimon\u2019s TownR44Betty\u2019s BayBouldersBeachHermanusRooi-ElsBientang\u2019sCaveWalkerBay20 milesBy The New York TimesBut it's a drive I'd done many times before, so this time I was focused on whales. There are plenty of lookout points helpfully scattered along the way, many marked with a whale illustration, indicating the best vantage points. We pulled out over a cliff above Dappat se Gat beach, a scenic cove framed by mountains, next to a shark-spotting hut where a black flag \u2014 low visibility, poor spotting conditions \u2014 was rippling in the breeze. Surfers still dotted the waters below. These lookouts are famed for some of the best land-based whale watching on the planet, but despite it being a sunny day, the horizon was hazy and the visibility was not favorable. Plenty of others had also taken this pullout, peering out from the edge of the cliffs with binoculars; I began to wish that I had a pair, but immediately dismissed the thought. I was promised whales by the dozens, plain as day, seen from land. No binoculars necessary.Just as we walked back toward the car, my friend Eric called me with bad news from Hermanus: no whales out today. \u201cBut maybe you\u2019ll see some tonight?\u201d he added hopefully. I was disquieted, but not prepared to give up, so onward to Hermanus we went.Numbers have rebounded a bit since 2016: Last year\u2019s aerial survey yielded 183 cow-calf pairs \u2014 \u201cmore than 2016, but still below numbers of 2015 and very much below normal numbers, which should be more than double,\u201d said Dr. Els Vermeulen, a research manager at the Mammal Research Institute Whale Unit, via email. \u201cPossibly a strong aftereffect of El Ni\u00f1o or some other climatological effect which may have affected the whale\u2019s food resource. Very simple, if they have no energy, females will not be able to reproduce in normal numbers, and whales will cease to migrate. We are not sure what this year will bring.\u201dBut I didn\u2019t know any of these stats or explanations when I awoke the next morning to hit the cliff path before breakfast, again with no results. It was time to take to the sea: The charter boats that ply Walker Bay have permits allowing them to get within 50 meters of the whales, so I knew we were in for guaranteed sightings.Back ashore, I sought out the town whale crier. Ricardo Andrews was just three months into his tenure. \u201cThe whale crier proclaims the good news that the whales are here,\u201d he described his role proudly. But the news had not been good this weekend.In consolation, Mr. Andrews posed for a picture with my father and showed off his horn, a vuvuzela fashioned from seaweed and kelp, but declined my requests for a practice hoot. \u201cIt would be a false alarm,\u201d he said solemnly. It appeared Mr. Andrews had not had to work too hard that season. (It wasn\u2019t his fault, of course. The role has since been taken over by Bravo Sobazile.) Walking to the car to begin the drive back to Cape Town, we passed a woman on the phone trying to score a whale fix: \u201cDo you have any whales out there at the moment?\u201d I heard her ask. I felt her desperation. But I didn\u2019t wait for the answer.I guess there\u2019s no such thing as a sure thing anymore.Advertisement"}

Yet he understood that millions of people were still hurting and refused to adopt the self-congratulatory tone that is in Mr. Trump\u2019s DNA.Even if Mr. Obama had been a more successful self-promoter, people receiving their \u201cnews\u201d from Fox or other conservative news sources would still believe Mr. Trump\u2019s lies that the economy was ruinous under Mr. Obama and \u201camazing\u201d under his leadership.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Full-Spectrum Corruption of Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone and everything he touches rots.Mr. Wehner served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.There\u2019s never been any confusion about the character defects of Donald Trump. The question has always been just how far he would go and whether other individuals and institutions would stand up to him or become complicit in his corruption. For decades, Republicans, and especially conservative Republicans, insisted that character counted in public life. They were particularly vocal about this during the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal, arguing against \u201ccompartmentalization\u201d \u2014 by which they meant overlooking moral turpitude in the Oval Office because you agree with the president\u2019s policy agenda or because the economy is strong. Senator Lindsey Graham, then in the House, went so far as to argue that \u201cimpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\u201dIt is a stunning turnabout. A party that once spoke with urgency and apparent conviction about the importance of ethical leadership \u2014 fidelity, honesty, honor, decency, good manners, setting a good example \u2014 has hitched its wagon to the most thoroughly and comprehensively corrupt individual who has ever been elected president. Some of the men who have been elected president have been unscrupulous in certain areas \u2014 infidelity, lying, dirty tricks, financial misdeeds \u2014 but we\u2019ve never before had the full-spectrum corruption we see in the life of Donald Trump. For many Republicans, this reality still hasn\u2019t broken through. But facts that don\u2019t penetrate the walls of an ideological silo are facts nonetheless. And the moral indictment against Mr. Trump is obvious and overwhelming. Corruption has been evident in Mr. Trump\u2019s private and public life, in how he has treated his wives, in his business dealings and scams, in his pathological lying and cruelty, in his bullying and shamelessness, in his conspiracy-mongering and appeals to the darkest impulses of Americans. (Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, refers to the president\u2019s race-based comments as a \u201cbase stimulator.\u201d) Mr. Trump\u2019s corruptions are ingrained, the result of a lifetime of habits. It was delusional to think he would change for the better once he became president. Some of us who have been lifelong Republicans and previously served in Republican administrations held out a faint hope that our party would at some point say \u201cEnough!\u201d; that there would be some line Mr. Trump would cross, some boundary he would transgress, some norm he would shatter, some civic guardrail he would uproot, some action he would take, some scheme or scandal he would be involved in that would cause large numbers of Republicans to break with the president. No such luck. Mr. Trump\u2019s corruptions have therefore become theirs. So far there\u2019s been no bottom, and there may never be. It\u2019s quite possible this should have been obvious to me much sooner than it was, that I was blinded to certain realities I should have recognized. In any case, the Republican Party\u2019s as-yet unbreakable attachment to Mr. Trump is coming at quite a cost. There is the rank hypocrisy, the squandered ability to venerate public character or criticize Democrats who lack it, and the damage to the white Evangelical movement, which has for the most part enthusiastically rallied to Mr. Trump and as a result has been largely discredited. There is also likely to be an electoral price to pay in November. But the greatest damage is being done to our civic culture and our politics. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party are right now the chief emblem of corruption and cynicism in American political life, of an ethic of might makes right. Dehumanizing others is fashionable and truth is relative. (\u201cTruth isn\u2019t truth,\u201d in the infamous words of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.) They are stripping politics of its high purpose and nobility.That\u2019s not all politics is; self-interest is always a factor. But if politics is only about power unbounded by morality \u2014 if it\u2019s simply about rulers governing by the law of the jungle, about a prince acting like a beast, in the words of Machiavelli \u2014 then the whole enterprise will collapse. We have to distinguish between imperfect leaders and corrupt ones, and we need the vocabulary to do so. A warning to my Republican friends: The worst is yet to come. Thanks to the work of Robert Mueller \u2014 a distinguished public servant, not the leader of a \u201cgroup of Angry Democrat Thugs\u201d \u2014 we are going to discover deeper and deeper layers to Mr. Trump\u2019s corruption. When we do, I expect Mr. Trump will unravel further as he feels more cornered, more desperate, more enraged; his behavior will become ever more erratic, disordered and crazed.Most Republicans, having thrown their MAGA hats over the Trump wall, will stay with him until the end. Was a tax cut, deregulation and court appointments really worth all this? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Bailout Is Ending. The Pain Is Far From Over.", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 When Dimitris Zafiriou landed a coveted full-time job two months ago, the salary was only half what he earned before Greece\u2019s debt crisis. Yet after years of struggling, it was a step up.\u201cNow, our family has zero money left over at the end of the month,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou, 47, a specialist in metal building infrastructure, said with a grim laugh. \u201cBut zero is better than what we had before, when we couldn\u2019t pay the bills at all.\u201d\u201cAny society that lost a quarter of its economy will have severe social problems,\u201d Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview. \u201cBut things are improving, and people can see that they are improving.\u201dA newly stable economy has prompted a return to hiring at the Greek construction company where Mr. Zafiriou recently landed work. But his monthly pay of \u20ac800 is far below the \u20ac1,500 he used to earn, at a construction firm where he was employed for 20 years. When the crisis hit, that firm delayed paying employees, first by two months, then four \u2014 a practice that became common at many businesses.His wife, Sotiria, went unpaid for almost a year in 2013, after the Greek supermarket chain where she worked declared bankruptcy. Another company bought it, and her monthly salary of \u20ac1,100 was cut to \u20ac800. She was eventually paid about half of what she was owed. But Mr. Zafiriou said he never received nearly \u20ac13,000 in back pay from his old firm.The family\u2019s bills quickly became insurmountable. They could no longer pay for electricity or a loan on their modest two-bedroom apartment in Keratsini, a working-class suburb of Piraeus, near Athens. The only thing shielding them from eviction \u2014 along with thousands of Greeks in similar straits \u2014 was a law forbidding banks from repossessing most borrowers\u2019 primary homes.The family slashed spending on clothing and groceries, and halted therapy for their daughter, Anamaria, 13, who has dyslexia. Low on cash, Mr. Zafiriou sold all of their gold jewelry, except for the cross used at Anamaria\u2019s christening.With his new job, things are looking up. The couple has rehired a tutor for Anamaria, and Mrs. Zafiriou no longer needs to shop for the very cheapest produce or meat. The primary aim is to pay down all the family\u2019s debts as quickly as possible, even if that leaves nothing at the end of the month.\u201cGreece is getting better,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean things have turned around.\u201dThat outlook has lent a sense that the crisis may at last be fading.Other jobs are being created as manufacturers shift sales outside the Greek market, stoking a rise in exports, which now make up a third of economic activity, up from a quarter before the crisis.Mr. Vasiliou said he turned a profit last year for the first time since the crisis, and added 25 employees to his 143-person work force. All but 10 are on permanent contracts, averaging \u20ac1,100 a month \u2014 a decent salary in today\u2019s economy.Yet for the vast majority of workers, Greece\u2019s labor market remains a rough-and-tumble landscape.Today, a growing share of jobs are minimum wage. At least half involve temporary or part-time contracts. While that helps lower unemployment figures, many private-sector employees now earn less-than-poverty wages, according to the O.E.C.D., as do nearly half of Greek households with two children. Others work even more precariously with no contract at all, as employers seek to evade paying overtime and social security charges.It is a sign of the uneasy nature of Greece\u2019s recovery that, even with a coveted full-time contract, Mr. Zafiriou, the construction worker, remains wary. He has been working since June, but many companies have shed employees just before their one-year work anniversary, after which they would have become harder to fire.For those who fell further during the crisis, even getting to that point seems out of reach.Mrs. Pavlioti, a former supervisor at a Greek polling company, never dreamed she would need social assistance. Her daughter was born at the start of the crisis, but by the time her maternity leave ended, the company had downsized and she could not find other work. Her husband lost his job as a security guard. The financial loss strained their marriage, and she filed for divorce \u2014 something increasing numbers of Greeks are resorting to since the crisis began.Eventually, she found informal work cleaning houses and caring for the elderly, including changing their adult diapers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I had fallen so far,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said, fighting back tears. \u201cIt shook my self-image and confidence.\u201dPraksis offers job counseling, as well as psychological and financial support. It still is not enough. As a single mother, Mrs. Pavlioti needs state-financed child care, but does not qualify because her divorce is pending.The longer she stays out of the formal job market, the harder it is to get back in. Recently she took a job as a babysitter with flexible hours, earning \u20ac450 a month \u2014 enough to pay the rent and bills, though not much else.\u201cThe end of the bailout makes no difference in our lives,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said. \u201cWe are just surviving, not living.\u201dMaria Louka and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

Back then, Greenwood, which the famous black scholar Booker T. Washington renamed the Negro Wall Street, was booming with more than 600 black-owned enterprises, including hotels, theaters and restaurants. \u201cAnd then, on that hill, around sunrise,\u201d Ms. Watkins said, her finger tracing a horizontal line in the air, \u201cmen gathered with machine guns and they started killing people from up there. White women and children gathered up there and took pictures, like a spectacle.\u201d The killing spree, one of the bloodiest episodes of racial violence in American history, ended with, according to various historical accounts, as many as 300 black Tulsans dead and Greenwood, the wealthiest black community in the country, reduced to rubble.

(I relocated to the last of these a year ago, from Charlotte, N.C., to work as a journalism professor at University of Missouri, my alma mater.)For my travels, I plotted a simple route: I would drive counterclockwise from central Missouri into Kansas, and then head into Oklahoma, and lastly north into the southwest corner of Missouri, stopping along the way at selected trail sites and a few others. Setting out on a hot weekday morning, I drove hours along peaceful highways, the mostly flat and infinitely green, serene farmland punctuated by rolling pastures sloping toward streams and lakes rushing past me.Starting in the early 1700s, Missouri began trading slaves to work in an economy fueled by farms rather than the large cotton or rice plantations in the South. In general, most Missouri masters held only one or two slaves, according to historical records. In 1860, for example, enslaved people accounted for some 10 percent of the state\u2019s population, compared to, say, South Carolina\u2019s 57 percent. Missouri\u2019s slaves were deployed for a variety of tasks, from minding livestock to laying brick to blacksmithing, often laboring jointly with their masters and family. Still, they were viewed as property rather than human beings and their treatment was as brutal as in the South. Ultimately, as Diane Mutti Burke, an associate professor of history at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, writes: \u201cThe many contradictions and tensions inherent in the small-scale system of slavery practiced in Missouri resulted in the institution\u2019s rapid collapse during the violent years of the Civil War.\u201d John Noland, one might conclude, died on the wrong side of history. Far more inspiring is the story of Hiram Young, a freed slave who became a wealthy manufacturer of freight wagons in Independence in the mid-1800s. Historians are uncertain about the circumstances that led to Young\u2019s freedom; what\u2019s clear is that, after purchasing his wife\u2019s freedom and upon his arrival in Missouri from Tennessee, Hiram Young & Company made a small fortune building and selling thousands of high-quality wagons and yokes to westward-bound 49ers. By 1860, Young\u2019s 50 to 60 employees, both hired hands and slave labor (many slaves purchased their freedom and continued working for him), were cranking out thousands of yokes and some 900 wagons a year. Young was so exalted throughout Independence that when he died in 1882, he was buried in the white section of Woodlawn Cemetery.The United States Civil Rights Trail is heavy with tales of blacks struggling to gain access to an adequate education, but the theme crescendos in Topeka, Kan., a designated trail site, where Oliver Brown, the father of a black schoolgirl, challenged the nation\u2019s \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine and changed the course of history. The most natural next step in my journey, I suppose, would have been to visit Little Rock, Ark., where nine black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, enrolled at Central High School under National Guard protection, in a momentous test of Brown v. Board. The story, though, felt familiar to me. I found myself instead on a four-hour trek south across long barren stretches of highway until I reached Tulsa, where for years I had heard vague and conflicting stories about the massacre of affluent blacks around the turn of the century. No wonder: Even as blacks rebounded to successfully rebuild Greenwood, remarkably becoming even more prosperous, then-mayor T.D. Evans discouraged Tulsans from talking publicly about the episode, according to a Tulsa Race Riot Commission Report, published in 2001. In her play, Tara Brooke Watkins takes on the white community\u2019s response to the massacre, which she said amounted to sweeping it under the rug. \u201cThe fact that a city official, the mayor, encourages the entire city not to talk about what happened is key to understanding the trauma in Tulsa because that moment represents a worldview that silence is the way to move forward.\u201dOff the trail, with the sun fading \u2014 and a year-old N.A.A.C.P. travel advisory warning black drivers about the risks of driving through Missouri still in effect \u2014 I headed home exhausted, Taney\u2019s words echoing across darkening highways and the nation\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d lurking always close in my rear view.Ron Stodghill, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Missouri, is the author of \u201cWhere Everybody Looks Likes Me: At the Crossroads of America\u2019s Black College and Culture.\u201d He has written numerous travel stories on black culture and history for The New York Times, from the Underground Railroad to rice plantations in South Carolina.An earlier version of this article misstated when President Harry Truman signed an order to desegregate the U.S. military.

{"Headline": "Uber and the False Hopes of the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig CityHow many will be lured? The passage of extensive legislation by New York\u2019s City Council on Wednesday, curtailing the previously unchecked powers of Uber and other ride-hailing services, suggests the extent to which the false promises of the sharing economy are becoming better understood and, how much more aggressively they still could be counteracted.From the beginning, Uber appealed to drivers on the premise that partnering with the company would allow them to do what they really wanted to do, which was not ferrying 24-year-olds to beer halls or actuaries to the airport as a means of full-time employment.Nine out of 10 drivers are immigrants and approximately 54 percent are responsible for providing more than half of their family incomes. Beyond that, the study found, the number of drivers for ride-hailing services grew 10 times faster than the rate of blue-collar employment, or employment in the city overall.The gig, in effect, was the lifeline and the lifeline was insufficient. One of the bills passed by the Council is intended to ease the financial hardship of drivers for Uber, Lyft and other similar companies in a saturated market, where jobs for uneducated workers are hardly in abundance. A minimum wage of $17.22, after expenses, has been set, which would increase driver earnings by about 22.5 percent on average.But this figure must be considered within the context of the broader economics of a city where just to live affordably (which is to say, spending a third of your income on rent) in any of its five cheapest neighborhoods \u2014 all of them in the Bronx, all of them with median listed rents of $1,500 to $1,600 a month \u2014 you need to earn between $54,000 and $58,000 a year. The minimum wage does not get you there.What is astonishing about the current legislation is how tepid so much of it actually is, and how ferociously it was fought by the companies involved. The cornerstone of the Council\u2019s work caps, for just one year, the number of cars that can operate in the city. Currently there are approximately 100,000 \u2014 an increase of 37,000 just since 2015. During the year the cap is effective, the city plans to study the economic and environmental impact further and it is allowing the various services to add wheelchair-accessible cars and vans in the meantime.The cap does absolutely nothing to address the crisis at the heart of professional driving in the city \u2014 the devolution into poverty of so many conventional yellow-cab drivers whose livelihoods have been devastated by ride-sharing. Some who owned medallions and were paying them off saw an enormous devaluation of those medallions. Six professional drivers killed themselves during the past several months, most recently, Abdul Saleh, a Yemeni immigrant who was found dead in a rented room in a Brooklyn apartment in June. He had been struggling for months to make payments on a leased cab.At some point preceding the passage of the legislation there had been discussion, led primarily by Lyft, of a hardship fund to be set up by the various ride-hailing companies to alleviate some of the suffering conventional drivers have experienced, but that was only going to go forward if the city agreed not to impose a cap. When I asked a spokesman for Lyft if that idea might be resurrected, he said that the industry could not make such a promise with little sense of how regulation would affect its revenues. And yet regulation does not change the current status quo much at all.If rates for ride-hailing apps were to increase, as Uber has suggested as a possibility, then perhaps this would give yellow cab drivers a bit of a competitive edge.The city and state could also, theoretically, create their own fund to aid drivers \u2014 just as they could create more good jobs by adding more bus lines to areas underserved by public transportation, which would reduce a reliance on Uber. In Queens Village, to cite one example, only 9 percent of houses and apartments are within a half mile of a subway station. But an arcane state law about gifts, which prevents the doling out of money to particular sets of people, makes such a fund very hard to establish.We are a long way from figuring out how to disrupt disruption.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Goods May Face 25% Tariffs, Not 10%, as Trump\u2019s Anger Grows", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump escalated his trade war with China on Wednesday, ordering his administration to consider more than doubling proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, as talks between Washington and Beijing remain at a standstill.Mr. Trump instructed the United States trade representative to look into increasing tariffs on Chinese imports like fish, petroleum, chemicals, handbags and other goods to 25 percent, a significant step in a dispute that is beginning to take a toll on industries and consumers in both countries. A final decision on the size and scope of the tariffs is not expected before September.The effort to further punish China is being led by hard-line advisers to Mr. Trump, who believe inflicting painful measures on Beijing is the best way to force it back to the negotiating table on trade. But that approach is once again creating fissures within Mr. Trump\u2019s own team, with his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, adamantly opposed to ratcheting up the tariffs and Peter Navarro, a key trade adviser, advocating the higher duties, people with knowledge of the discussions said. Stephen K. Bannon, who left the White House last August, has also been counseling the president to pursue tougher tariffs, according to people familiar with his thinking.\u201cWe have been very clear about the specific changes China should undertake,\u201d Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cRegrettably, instead of changing its harmful behavior, China has illegally retaliated against U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses.\u201dSince formal talks between Beijing and Washington broke down in May, Mr. Trump has doubled down on his threats, saying he is prepared to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports. Beijing has promised to retaliate with its own measures, and both countries have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other\u2019s products.\u201cChina\u2019s position is firm and clear: Pressure and blackmail from the U.S. won\u2019t work,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing on Wednesday in Beijing in response to reports about the 25 percent tariffs. \u201cIf the U.S. takes a further and upgraded move, China would definitely retaliate to safeguard our legal rights.\u201dMr. Trump privately told advisers this week that he was intent on staying the course to punish China with additional tariffs. Mr. Mnuchin has been advising against such a move, preferring to try to engage with his Chinese counterparts to resolve their differences.But his hand has been weakened by a recent and rapid depreciation in China\u2019s currency, which helps to make Chinese goods cheaper in foreign markets and buoys exports. That has given hard-liners inside and outside the administration an opening to advocate even higher penalties.The Chinese currency fell to a 13-month low against the dollar this week. The move came partly because of market forces, but also because China has been allowing the heavily managed value of its currency, the renminbi, to slide in currency markets in recent weeks.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that ratcheting up tariffs to 25 percent would put substantial pressure on Chinese leaders to devalue their currency even more, to help offset any further losses to exporters. \u201cWe can expect further depreciation and vigorous internal debates about a one-off devaluation,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.The message from the White House is \u201cwe can raise tariffs faster than you can devalue,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.The 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports would come on top of the existing penalties on $34 billion worth of products and an additional $16 billion that are scheduled to go into effect soon. China has vowed to respond to any trade measures in kind, and it has already imposed its own tariffs on $34 billion worth of American soybeans, pork, electric vehicles and other goods.The administration\u2019s trade moves are aimed at forcing China to end what it calls unfair trade practices, including improperly obtaining American intellectual property. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers argue that past administrations have failed to sway China with diplomacy and that the United States must be prepared to take a tough stance to change its course, even if it hurts American businesses and customers in the short term.On Wednesday, Congress passed legislation that will strengthen national security-related checks on Chinese investment in the United States, a move that is also aimed at curbing China\u2019s ability to capture valuable American technology.The Americans and the Chinese have been carrying out back-channel talks over how to resolve their differences, but both sides remain hesitant to embrace more formal negotiations. At present, the discussion is mostly centered on whether more formal talks should resume.China has been looking for solutions that would end the trade fight without requiring the country to make policy concessions that might limit the country\u2019s economic growth, according to people familiar with Chinese economic policymaking, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Geng said on Wednesday that China remains eager to find a resolution to the dispute. \u201cChina has always been suggesting to use dialogue to resolve trade issues \u2014 our efforts and our sincerity are clear to be seen by the international world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we have to emphasize, our dialogue must be based on mutual respect and equality, on rules and on credibility. Unilateral threats and pressure will only lead in the opposite direction from what we wished.\u201dWhile the tariffs are aimed at hurting China, they are also having an impact on American consumers and businesses that rely on products from China\u2019s factories. Farmers and manufacturers, in particular, have complained that they are bearing the brunt of the trade war as China raises the price on imported soybeans and other agriculture products that it typically buys from farms and on materials and products imported by manufacturers to make machinery, clothes and other products.\u201cIncreasing the size of the tariffs is merely increasing the harm that will be done,\u201d said Matthew Shay, the president of the National Retail Federation. \u201cTariffs are an unacceptable gamble with the U.S. economy, and the stakes continue to rise with no end in sight.\u201dA public hearing about the $200 billion list is scheduled for late August, when American companies and individuals will be able to tell the United States trade representative which products they think should be on or off the list.Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.

Glosser, Mr. Miller\u2019s uncle, argues that the family would have been turned away if the immigration policies currently backed by Mr. Trump and Mr. Miller were in place at the time.The article was a notable rebuke by a family member to Mr. Miller, who is one of the most fervent public defenders of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u2014 the ban on travelers to the United States from several Muslim countries, the separation of families crossing the border illegally and the drastic reduction in the number of refugees admitted to the United States.In the article, Mr. Glosser related in detail the story of Wolf-Leib Glosser, who arrived on Ellis Island in 1903 from the village of Antopol in Eastern Europe, fleeing persecution and forced conscription. Wolf-Leib Glosser was Mr. Miller\u2019s great-grandfather on his mother\u2019s side, writes Mr. Glosser.Had Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies been in effect at the time, Mr. Miller\u2019s uncle writes in the article, \u201cI shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda insist that it makes no sense to compare the immigration system today with the one that existed at the turn of the 20th century. They argue that the level of education among immigrants is much lower now and that the type of workers seeking to come into the United States have less to offer the current American economy.Those views have made Mr. Miller a valuable and powerful part of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House as the administration has repeatedly pushed to overhaul the country\u2019s immigration laws.

Here Are 2 Emerging Endgames.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China have sparred repeatedly over trade, in a tit-for-tat skirmish that has shown little sign of abating. High-level talks have stalled, while both sides have been threatening further tariffs in recent days.But beneath the acrimony, two potential paths for China seem to be emerging, according to participants in the trade negotiations and their advisers. Both would deliver trade wins for President Trump and his more moderate advisers, while also letting President Xi Jinping of China push ahead with his ambitious industrial plan to build national champions in cutting-edge technologies.A stalemate appears the most likely endgame, with new American and Chinese tariffs staying in place for months or even years. So far, the United States has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese technology goods and $3 billion of Chinese steel and aluminum, with another $16 billion in the offing. China has responded in kind, outlining its own plan on Wednesday for measures on $16 billion of American goods.China\u2019s stance now is that a resolution of trade tensions must not block its further economic progress, but adjustments to Made in China 2025 could happen. The latest trade figures, which came out Wednesday, show that Chinese exports continue to surge, giving Beijing some confidence. \u201cThe red line is China\u2019s right to develop, not the concrete industrial policies and measures regarding Made in China 2025,\u201d said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official who remains one of China\u2019s top trade experts.To Mr. Trump and his aides, China is trade enemy No. 1. In making their case, they point to large, persistent trade deficits, as well as state-owned banks funding potential rivals to American giants in high tech and advanced manufacturing. They also worry that China is engaged in a rapid military buildup that would give Beijing ever more heft in Asia and around the world.The tariffs address part of the president\u2019s concerns, mainly by reducing American companies\u2019 dependency on Chinese suppliers.Hundreds of Western companies already have been reconsidering China\u2019s role in their supply chains, according to several people involved in such decisions. Executives are increasingly looking for ways to transfer the final assembly of goods to factories outside China, mainly in low-wage countries elsewhere in Asia or in Mexico.Doing the final assembly outside of China will allow companies to bypass the new American tariffs. It could also start to cut the deficit with China over the next couple years.But these moves may not do much to the overall trade deficit of the United States, rearranging it instead to other countries. Companies are just relocating the last steps in production plans to places like Indonesia and Taiwan rather than bringing them back to the United States, where blue-collar labor is costly. Beijing will also retain a lot of leverage, given that the manufacturing of a long list of components, from wires and screws to electric motors and digital controls, will most likely remain in China.Star Rapid, a company in Zhongshan, China, makes prototypes of products for more than 400 American companies in sectors like electronics, auto parts and medical devices. It has noticed that while many companies are looking at ways to change locations for final assembly, not one seems to be moving the production of entire supply chains. The components typically account for much if not most of the value in products.\u201cThey\u2019re not looking at taking it out of China,\u201d said David Hunter, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at where can they do the final transformation.\u201dDuring second-quarter conference calls by 192 American and European companies that mentioned tariffs, 17 percent of them said that they had already begun switching suppliers, according to an analysis by Panjiva, a trade data consulting firm. About 14 percent had begun moving some of their own operations.The Trump administration can afford to stand firm. The American economy has been strong. And the tariffs that American companies face are more than offset by new tax cuts.Washington may find it has other headaches if tariffs persist. Some China experts worry that the administration\u2019s trade stance could antagonize Chinese policymakers, pushing them toward a more confrontational approach on other issues.They point out that President Xi has assigned the task of defusing a trade war to a team of fairly moderate, Western-educated officials. Failure to reach a deal could weaken these moderates and further embolden hard-liners who advocate continuing China\u2019s broad military buildup and its deployment of ever-harsher domestic security.\u201cWe really need to find a way to embrace China, and encourage the moderate voices here,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a Beijing lawyer and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.While China is not willing to go nearly that far, it could offer some concessions that might provide an ostensible victory.China has expressed a willingness to change parts of its industrial policy that violate global trade rules. But China\u2019s program falls into some gray areas.While the World Trade Organization has many rules to prevent governments from subsidizing companies directly, the rules are more vague on whether a state-run banking system can provide preferential loans. Such loans have been the core of Chinese industrial policy for many years, and continue to be under Made in China 2025.China has also begun exploring ways for Made in China 2025 to finance more research and development, instead of paying for the immediate construction of a lot of factories. World Trade Organization rules allow research subsidies.The dilemma is whether any of these tweaks to Made in China 2025 would make much of a difference and appease the Trump administration.China may also be signaling a willingness to compromise on tariffs. For much of the trade war, Beijing has matched Washington dollar for dollar on retaliatory measures. The United States and China will each have tariffs in place soon on roughly $50 billion of goods. For the United States, it amounts to a little less than one-tenth of imports from China. For China, it is about one-third of imports from the United States.Last week, China shifted tack. Faced with American threats of tariffs on two-fifths of China\u2019s exports to the United States, or $200 billion a year, Beijing responded with a threat of tariffs on two-fifths of American exports to China, or $60 billion a year. The change raised the question of whether China might be willing to accept a compromise on tariffs linked to the share of total trade that is taxed in each direction.China has not yet made any such offer, and on Wednesday the country\u2019s commerce ministry announced that it would keep pace with the Trump administration\u2019s next round of tariffs \u2014 on $16 billion of imports a year that are to take effect on Aug. 23.Beijing\u2019s more cautious approach to the greater threat, of tariffs on another $200 billion in annual imports, was also just practical: China does not even import that amount of goods from the United States annually.\u201cIt\u2019s just not a game changer,\u201d Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm, said of the trade dispute. \u201cThe trade war, as currently constituted, can go on for some time, and both economies can muddle through it without even strong effects.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

In Australia, an indoor ski slope is going up near the beaches of the Gold Coast. In the Czech Republic, a spa with Chinese medicine is under construction in the southern wine country.All three projects fall under Beijing\u2019s ambitious effort to build geopolitical and economic ties around the world \u2014 and all three stray from its original mission.But five years in, smaller, less impactful projects are finding cover under the umbrella of Belt and Road, using the program to slip past restrictions on foreign investment. Beijing has discouraged, and in some cases blocked, deals in the real estate and entertainment industries, part of a broader crackdown on profligate spending by Chinese companies overseas.That hasn\u2019t discouraged some companies.\u201cThere are wacky deals that occur under the banner of Belt and Road because this is how every entrepreneur signals that they are in line with the leadership\u2019s political objectives,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an independent economic research firm.\u201cIt certainly is a very capacious arena for opportunists, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mr. Kroeber added.In addition to straying into entertainment venues, the Belt and Road mission is sprawling geographically. Initially focused on countries along the ancient trade route that once carried travelers including Marco Polo east, the program\u2019s official scope has been extended to Africa and South America.Australia, however, has yet to be included. That is not stopping Songcheng Performance Development, the company building the indoor ski slope, part of a huge amusement park and entertainment complex on about 100 acres of land along the eastern Gold Coast.\u201cWe will offer local cultural park performances such as the story of how Captain Cook discovered Australia,\u201d Zhang Xian, the chief executive of Songcheng, recently told investors.China\u2019s Ministry of Culture, though, has named Australia Legend Kingdom a top priority.The company had long harbored ambitions to expand into Australia, according to Roland Evans, Songcheng\u2019s representative there. It spotted an opportunity when President Xi announced the Belt and Road plan in 2013.Songcheng\u2019s plans for the park have not been finalized, but an early proposal includes condominiums for as many as 2,000 residents, and theaters to accommodate musicals and shows about Chinese and Australian history. The company wants the indoor ski hill to be the world\u2019s biggest.Supporters of the myriad cultural projects that fall under the Belt and Road umbrella \u2014 and there are many such proponents in China \u2014 argue that amusement parks and theaters can underpin China\u2019s diplomatic push much as ports and infrastructure do.\u201cOne of the goals is cultural exchange along the Belt and Road to improve our soft power,\u201d said Chen Shaofeng, vice dean of the Institute for Cultural Industries at Peking University. \u201cIt also provides a strategic support for economic cooperation.\u201dThose are lofty goals for what critics say is basically big-ticket spending overseas.Some companies involved in the initiative have said that they receive preferential financing from state-backed banks. Others say they are getting government support to help train employees and promote the new business ventures overseas.Betop Entertainment, which is building the sense-of-flight theater in Thailand, has been successful in getting political buy-in for its project.Its new theater will be in the beach resort town of Pattaya and will feature scenes of Thailand.

Some Chinese companies have begun to face hurdles with their projects overseas.RiseSun Real Estate Development has been trying to build a sprawling spa and Chinese-medicine complex in Pasohlavky, a small town in the South Moravia region of the Czech Republic. A government mock-up of the plans, first announced during a state visit to China by the Czech president, Milos Zeman, in 2015, shows more than two dozen buildings along the banks of the Nove Mlyny reservoirs.But the project has come under local scrutiny.The publicly listed Chinese company has said that while construction for the spa had not yet started, it was \u201cdefinitely in the process of being approved.\u201d Officials in Pasohlavky offer a different account, saying that RiseSun is only one of multiple groups of investors interested in buying the land.The local authorities say they have yet to make a final decision. Some residents have expressed unease about a Chinese investor, said Martina Dominova, the town\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe town hall even received hateful messages,\u201d Ms. Dominova said. \u201cThey have accused us of selling off the republic to the Chinese.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bordoff is an author of the 2017 study \u201cCan Coal Make a Comeback?\u201d for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. It has been a bad month for the fight against climate change. Amid heat waves, wildfires, droughts and Arctic ice melt, President Trump has taken aim at the two central pillars of his predecessor\u2019s ambitious efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. After proposing in early August to freeze a scheduled increase in fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, the Trump administration on Tuesday said it would seek to significantly weaken the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. So why does this proposed rollback of power sector climate regulations matter if it won\u2019t change the carbon emissions trajectory much? First, firm policy direction from the government provides investors and utilities with certainty about the investment outlook and ensures emissions reductions even if the market shifts. Just as few predicted the collapse in natural gas prices a decade ago, there is a wide range of uncertainty about what energy prices will look like in the future. Second, the right way to assess whether a policy makes sense is not just to look at its emissions impacts but also to compare its costs with its benefits. Even by the current E.P.A.\u2019s own analysis, which makes assumptions that play down the climate benefits and increase the implementation costs, the Clean Power Plan delivered far more net benefits for the American people than the proposed replacement. That is because reducing coal use in the power sector not only delivers carbon emission reductions but also lower levels of local pollutants like particulate matter.The damage done by the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies is less a sharp rise in carbon emissions than it is the loss of American leadership and missed opportunity to save future generations from climate change\u2019s severe impacts.

{"Headline": "Colleges and Universities Woo Once-Overlooked Transfer Students", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTransfer students \u2014 whose challenges have often been ignored in higher education \u2014 are feeling a surge in popularity as colleges and universities are increasingly wooing them.\u201cThis was a group that was always taken for granted,\u201d said Todd Rinehart, vice chancellor for enrollment at the University of Denver.That is because of a demographic shift as the number of high school graduates is projected to decline over the next decade, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. In addition, when the economy improves, the job market becomes more attractive to some high school graduates than college.But the data only reflected traditional students who entered as freshmen and stayed at the same higher education institution during their entire college career.\u201cThe biggest problem is no one claims accountability for transfer students because there is no federal accountability for transfer students,\u201d Dr. Marling said. Last year, the Education Department expanded the type of information it gathers from colleges and universities to include more nontraditional students, a move she called a good first stepOne of the major stumbling blocks for transfer students, especially those going from a community college to a four-year institution, is finding out in an understandable and timely manner whether the course they already took will be accepted as credit not only toward graduation but also toward their chosen major.To address this issue, more and more universities now have articulation agreements \u2014 partnerships \u2014 with community colleges that explain and align credits that are needed for a specific academic program or degree. They are also offering advisers who concentrate largely on easing the way for transfer students and offering clearer and more transparent information online.Adelphi University on Long Island, for example, has become focused on the transfer students who make up just under 40 percent of its incoming class.It has invested in software to help students better figure out online how their credits will transfer and split its director of undergraduate admissions into two positions a few years ago, with one director focused on first-year students and the other on transfers.\u201cThis ensures each group is getting the attention it deserves,\u201d said Kristen Capezza, Adelphi\u2019s associate vice president of enrollment management.In addition, Adelphi has instant decision and registration days, where students can apply, be admitted and registered in one day; last year the university experimented with summer \u201ctransfer Tuesdays\u201d, which have continued this summer; about 20 to 30 students attend each session, Ms. Capezza said.Nandy Brijlal, a 21-year-old from Queens, never considered going anywhere but the City University of New York when she graduated from high school, and she never thought about transferring.But in her sophomore year she toured Adelphi with a cousin and was instantly wowed by the place and the idea of going to a much smaller institution.\u201cI made an appointment with the admissions officer to find out about which credits would transfer, within one week I had my transfer credit evaluation, and I was enrolled as a junior in the fall,\u201d she said. Although she had some early trepidation about making friends, a job in the admissions office helped, and now she plans to get her masters in biology at Adelphi.Cost and financial aid are other serious barriers for transfer students, many of whom are low-income. Universities typically have not offered them scholarships and grants available to first-year students. Now, many institutions are increasing the money available; for example, Texas Christian University, whose incoming class last year was about one-fifth transfer students, the highest number in its history, now gives full-tuition scholarships for transfer students, something not available in the past, said Heath Einstein, the university\u2019s dean of admission.The University of Central Florida, the second-largest university in the country, has more transfer students in its incoming class than first-year freshmen. Last fall, 62 percent of its incoming class consisted of transfer students.Last year, the university also created 27 \u201csuccess coaches\u201d who work with students planning to transfer and academic advisers to make sure the students have the skills and credits necessary before and after transferring.\u201cA freshman has four years to engage with our institution. A transfer student only has two years with us,\u201d said Jennifer Sumner, the executive director for U.C.F. Connect, which oversees the DirectConnect program. \u201cWe want to work with students so they feel a part of the university culture, and reduce the lag time to get them acclimated to the institution.\u201dAnother reason for welcoming transfer students is that many colleges realize that a high portion of the students they turn away are just as good as the ones they accept.\u201cTransfer students are seen as much stronger than in the past,\u201d Mr. Einstein of T.C.U. said, and as his university has become more selective, \u201cwe now don\u2019t have space for students we\u2019d love to have.\u201d In addition, he said, the high cost of four-year colleges also meant that more students chose to do their first two years at a community college to save money.While credits and money are important, so are other aspects of college living, such as residential life and extracurricular activities. Besides raising the merit aid it offers transfer students, the University of Denver last year created a dedicated dormitory that can house 36 transfer students. And last year, the school\u2019s student government, for the first time, developed a position for a transfer student representative.Increasingly, Mr. Einstein said, colleges are realizing that \u201cit\u2019s really unethical to bring in transfer students and not support them in the same way you do other students.\u201dThis is the third of four new Learning sections being published this year.

The Fairbanks Senior Center had to eliminate cookie treats from its Meals on Wheels program. And Benny Lin, owner of the Pagoda Restaurant, got a shock when the price of salt tripled just about overnight.Sam\u2019s Club, the discount bulk retailer, closed down more than 60 of its stores this year, from Baton Rouge to Cincinnati, and much of America shrugged it off in the midst of an economic boom. But in Alaska, and especially in Fairbanks, Sam\u2019s exit was a thunderclap and a symbol of an anxious new economic chapter for the state.\u201cWhat comes next?\u201d said Christina Wright, who runs a business, Cakes by Christina, from her Fairbanks home and saw the price of ingredients increase by 30 percent. In a place where huge distances and a tough climate make buying in bulk essential, the departure of Sam\u2019s meant people suddenly were dependent on traditional grocery stores with higher prices.Stretching back to Alaska\u2019s days as a territory and through its boom years of oil production, the powerful mythology of this state has been that open-ended opportunity came with the vast landscape and traditions of limited government.But the Year Without a Sam\u2019s, as some people are calling it, has exposed new rifts in the identity Alaska has cultivated, as the economy has sunk amid a drop in oil prices and production. Unemployment, at 7.1 percent, is the highest in the nation. Even the state\u2019s secret demographic weapon \u2014 its romantic appeal as a place to start afresh \u2014 seems to have ebbed, with more people moving out over the last five years than moving in, for the first time since at least World War II.Against this backdrop, Alaskans will go to the polls next week in a primary election for governor that could set up a stark discussion of the state\u2019s future, as Gov. Bill Walker, an independent seeking a second term, faces challenges this fall from his left and his right.Mr. Walker \u2014 whose first term was shaped by recession, as the drop in oil prices and production dragged down the state budget \u2014 portrays himself as a tested leader willing to make hard decisions and take decisive action.But in some ways, the election has become a referendum on taking action at all. Mr. Walker repeatedly proposed new taxes to fix a multiyear shortfall in the state budget, including the restoration of an income tax, which was abolished decades ago when oil money made it unnecessary. The State Legislature \u2014 Republican-led in the Senate, but divided in the House with a Democratic-led, two-party coalition \u2014 thwarted those plans. It instead cut education funding and local aid to cities like Fairbanks, where many public buildings, constructed in the 1970s as the oil boom hit, have started to crumble.Mike Dunleavy, a former state senator who led much of the charge against Mr. Walker\u2019s ideas in the Legislature, has been seen as the leading candidate in a Republican primary that includes Mead Treadwell, a former lieutenant governor.On the Democratic side, Mark Begich, a former United States Senator and mayor of Anchorage, also has pledged to reverse decisions that have come out of Juneau, the capital, in recent years. He has promised to diversify the economy with more renewable energy and job training, and make the state a global center for climate change research and science.As the election has approached, new challenges have emerged for Alaska. When oil and construction jobs faded, for example, Alaskans noted that commercial fishing, like tourism, was still strong. Then came a trade war with China.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a gang tackle at the Seahawks game and then somebody piles on,\u201d Joe Morelli, the chief executive at Seafood Producers Cooperative. Mr. Morelli said a 25 percent tariff on seafood exports to China could rip through his company\u2019s biggest growth market \u2014 black cod. (Love for Seattle\u2019s professional football team, the Seahawks, is part of Alaskan life, too. Though the team plays 1,500 miles from Fairbanks, it\u2019s the closest thing to a home team for a state spread over an area four times the size of California.) \u201cThe last thing Alaska needs right now is another hit,\u201d Mr. Morelli said.Alaska\u2019s 740,000 residents have found that outside forces are leaving their mark on a place that thrives on self-determination. The state has reeled as decisions came from the board of Walmart, Sam\u2019s owner, from tariff policymakers in Washington and Beijing on matters that threaten the nation\u2019s biggest commercial fishing fleet, and from the big oil companies that have shed thousands of jobs. Alaska remains a place of ambition and hope, but many residents seem unsure what the next chapter will look like, and who will write it.For all the storm clouds, Alaska is nowhere near economic collapse. The $65 billion Permanent Fund, a savings account built from taxes collected on oil, was bolstered as oil prices boomed during the Great Recession, even as the rest of the nation suffered; it still spits out annual dividends to residents. The United States Air Force is promising to move thousands of troops and their families to the Fairbanks area starting next year, with a buildup of the F-35 jet program. Oil prices have risen from their lows, a crucial boost to the state budget. Amazon, delivering almost anything almost anywhere, has eased the pain of Sam\u2019s departure for some.And Costco, a competitor to Sam\u2019s Club, has told residents it will move into Sam\u2019s old space in Fairbanks later this year.Still, the effects of the Sam\u2019s demise have lingered, especially in remote villages that are off the road system reachable only by air or water. There, bulk-buying runs to Sam\u2019s to fill larders and freezers, and stock the shelves of village stores, were part of life.\u201cEvery person I know, in every village, had a Sam\u2019s card,\u201d said Larry Bredeman, who lives about four hours up a partly gravel road from Fairbanks, and said that almost everything he wore and ate came from Sam\u2019s.Mr. Bredeman, 67, and his brother in law, Ray Woods, have now made two trips \u2014 about 1,000 miles round trip by car \u2014 to pick up supplies in Anchorage from a Costco there, including hundreds of pounds of dog food for Mr. Woods\u2019s 17-dog sled-racing team.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy Bridge Collapse Leaves 37 Dead", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENOA, Italy \u2014 A bridge in the heart of Genoa collapsed on Tuesday, killing 37 people as dozens of vehicles and tons of concrete and steel plunged onto city streets below in a disaster that prompted an emergency review of Italy\u2019s aging infrastructure.Adriano Scimpioni said he had just finished his shift at the city\u2019s garbage collection company when \u201cI heard something like an explosion and a screech of iron, and in a second we were all covered by a cloud of dust.\u201d\u201cI immediately thought of the victims; I held my tears, with difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were impotent, we didn\u2019t have the means to help those who remained underneath.\u201d He said two of his colleagues had been killed.The cable-stayed Morandi Bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed on Tuesday. This bridge uses very few stays, which were constructed from pre-stressed concrete instead of steel cables. The collapse occurred at one of the trestles, a vertical framework of upside-down V\u2019s used for support.CONCRETE STAYTRESTLECONCRETE STAYTRESTLECONCRETE STAYTRESTLEBy The New York Times. Before photo by Davide Papalini; After photo by Reuters.The highway bridge fell by as much as 148 feet just before noon, taking about three dozen cars and three trucks with it, according to Angelo Borrelli, chief of the Civil Protection Department.Giuseppe Conte, who took over as prime minister in June, traveled to the scene of the disaster. The office of the city\u2019s public prosecutor said it would open a criminal inquiry, examining whether the collapse was because of negligence, and federal authorities indicated that they, too, would investigate.Mr. Conte\u2019s deputy prime minister and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who is a powerful populist skeptic of the European Union, said that the bloc\u2019s budget rules might have to be lifted so Italy could overhaul its infrastructure. \u201cWhen they tell us that we can\u2019t spend our money because some E.U. constraints don\u2019t permit it, I wonder whether these constraints make any sense,\u201d he said.Danilo Toninelli, the transportation minister, said the government had ordered a comprehensive safety review of Italy\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 including viaducts and bridges built in the 1950s and 1960s during the country\u2019s postwar boom. Much of the infrastructure, he warned, was showing signs of age. \u201cThis is what Italy needs to do, now,\u201d he said.In a phone interview, Antonio Occhiuzzi, director of the Institute for Construction Technology for Italy\u2019s National Research Council, said that most of the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u201cneeds to be carefully re-examined\u201d because much \u201cwas at the end\u201d of its useful life span. He added, \u201cIn some cases it can be reinforced, in other cases it will have to be demolished and rebuilt completely.\u201dMr. Occhiuzzi said that civil and structural engineering projects in Italy were complicated by a national patrimony that dates to antiquity. \u201cOur position, typically, is to try and conserve rather than demolish and rebuild, as happens in other countries,\u201d he said.The collapse of the Genoese bridge was a serious alarm, he said, \u201cbecause it is not an isolated case \u2014 in the last three years, a number of bridges have collapsed in Italy, and they are all around 50 years old.\u201dFrancesco Faccini, a lecturer at the University of Genoa and an expert on floods and landslides, said \u201csignificant urbanization\u201d of the city\u2019s flood plains along with, at times, irrational urbanization, led to channels being narrowed and streams diverted. The result, he said, was a situation where flooding became more common, especially as the intensity of downpours has grown in recent years.In the Sampierdarena neighborhood under the fallen bridge, gas and electricity were shut off as workers scrambled to check on the security of buildings. The electricity was later restored.Giovanna Santacroce, a 25-year-old ice cream vendor who lives a few hundred yards from the bridge, said she heard what sounded like thunder. \u201cThen the light went off for a second and I peeked out of the window and couldn\u2019t see the bridge anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the street people were crying, debris was everywhere. They ordered us to leave the house, and we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to return.\u201dPietro Marzullo, a 31-year-old elder care attendant who was driving in the area when the disaster occurred, said he helped a woman in shock get away moments later. \u201cSmall concrete blocks were scattered everywhere, rolling down the street and around us,\u201d he said.The national police noted that there was a \u201cviolent cloudburst\u201d about the time the section fell, and some witnesses said the bridge was struck by lightning just before it collapsed, though it was not clear whether the storm contributed to the failure.Mr. Rixi said the entire bridge would be demolished, \u201cwith serious repercussions on traffic, and problems for citizens and companies.\u201dSurvivors marveled that the toll was not higher.One motorist, Corrado Cusano, told the Italian channel Rai News that he had just driven across the bridge when \u201cI turned around and saw the bridge collapsing.\u201d\u201cWe were stuck in traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a long line of cars, and I only saw the bridge collapsing behind me and then I couldn\u2019t see any cars anymore.\u201dA stretch of the road, estimated by some witnesses to be more than 300 feet long, fell to earth in a huge dust cloud. Remarkably, some people driving on the bridge walked away unharmed.Cars and trucks were abandoned on the road, just short of the new chasm; their occupants had fled on foot.Firefighters with rescue baskets were hoisted by cranes onto the piled wreckage to pull people from the rubble. Others loaded the injured into paramedic helicopters, or picked their way across the mounds of debris with dogs trained to sniff and listen for people.\u201cI drive on that bridge four times a day and I know that they do maintenance work on that bridge every single night,\u201d said Edoardo Serra, a pharmacist in Genoa who was to return to the city center an hour after the bridge collapsed. \u201cThey normally closed one direction to traffic and allowed double circulation on the other.\u201d\u201cIt was a bold structure, designed for a volume of traffic that was much lower than it is today,\u201d said Diego Zoppi, a Genoese architect. The bridge, he said, required constant maintenance because it was an essential traffic hub for the city, connecting Genoa\u2019s eastern and western suburbs with highways to major cities in the north, like Milan.Mr. Morandi designed several major bridges using similar designs and materials, primarily in Italy but also in Libya, Colombia, Ecuador and elsewhere.Autostrade per l\u2019Italia and Atlantia did not respond to emails requesting comment, and their media offices were closed on Tuesday. Atlantia shares fell by 5.39 percent on the Milan stock market on Tuesday.Autostrade\u2019s director for the area of Genoa, Stefano Marigliani, told the Italian news agency ANSA that the collapse of the bridge \u201cwas unexpected and sudden with respect to the monitoring that the bridge was subject to.\u201d\u201cThere was no forewarning,\u201d he said.The bridge carried the A10 highway \u2014 a major east-west artery through the port city that extends west along the coastline to the border with France \u2014 across the Polcevera River. It was one of two just major highway bridges that span that waterway, in the western part of the city, and officials warned that the loss of the crossing could significantly affect the movement of people and goods.The impact of the collapse \u201cwill be devastating for the local economy,\u201d and the city would be paralyzed for years, said Enrico Musso, an economics professor at the University of Genoa, and a center-right politician. A long contested project to build a new highway had only recently been approved after years of fierce debate, in part because of concerns about the Morandi Bridge had intensified. \u201cWe knew it was not eternal,\u201d Mr. Musso said.As night fell, the only audible sound was that of rescue workers drilling through the concrete blocks to look for more vehicles buried under the rubble, illuminated by large rescue lights.Gaia Pianigiani reported from Genoa, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London.

{"Headline": "\u2018A Dress Is Like a Passaporto, No?\u2019 Welcome to Pierpaolo Piccioli\u2019s Valentino", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "The newish, low-profile creative director of the storied fashion house has managed to honor its legacy while making it completely, and refreshingly, his own.Supported byTHE HISTORIES OF the great fashion houses can feel a bit like myths themselves: the Icarus-like reaching for the pinnacles of beauty followed by plummets into debt or drugs; the forefathers cast aside to make way for the new generation.All fashion sells a narrative, but these were clothes that touched the imagination while also appearing to be an extension of the wearer. There\u2019s a sense of uncanny intimacy when you see something of yourself in a designer\u2019s work, and Piccioli has set out to deepen that relationship between designer and wearer by following the philosophy that a truly contemporary definition of beauty is expansive enough to appeal to both rap stars and princesses, an ing\u00e9nue at a premiere and a mother marking the occasion of her daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah. Individuality, in clothing terms, means collections that are filled not just with dream dresses (though oh \u2014 the dresses!), but also pieces for the hours before dusk. Real life is composed of not just big events, after all, but also daily ceremony, and whatever the distance between our fantasy selves and actual selves, the confidence one wants to feel in one\u2019s skin \u2014 in one\u2019s clothes \u2014 is real and universal. Piccioli\u2019s designs are distinguished in part by their generosity: They are otherworldly in their ambition but magnanimous in their wearability and multigenerational appeal. This isn\u2019t a coincidence; Piccioli, a low-key father of three, lives a very earthbound existence. \u201cToday, beauty is about diversity, it\u2019s about the freedom to express yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what I want to stand for.\u201d\u201cMy job as a designer is to reflect an idea of the times we live in,\u201d says Piccioli. \u201cAnd in Valentino, I feel that I\u2019m in the right place, because the values of the house are my personal values. I\u2019m Italian, I\u2019m Roman, and so Valentino is part of my own culture, my own story. This idea of craft, of beautiful tradition, is expressed through the human touch. A couture house means people. It means a personal approach. And that\u2019s as important now as it was in the \u201960s.\u201dROMANS MAY SIMPLY be better than the rest of us at remaining on nodding terms with the past. Living in the shadow of the Colosseum, it\u2019s hard not to cultivate a sense of history lightly worn, a respect for old rituals that give shape to the day: a late-morning espresso, an early-evening passeggiata. Valentino\u2019s story began in Rome in 1960, before ready-to-wear exploded in Milan; these days, the city remains somewhat apart from both the industry and pop culture, making it an ideal place to explore fashion\u2019s superconsciousness of time, which in Piccioli\u2019s solo collections, as in Garavani\u2019s, has found its expression less in iconography \u2014 say, the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel re-created on a skirt \u2014 than in deeper archetypal coding, with silhouettes and colors that echo the religion and culture in which they were born. Visiting the Palazzo Valentino, the brand\u2019s headquarters on Piazza Mignanelli in Rome, can induce rapid-transit time travel. A recent renovation has left the space airy and monasterial, revealing 16th-century frescoes on the ceilings. Warhols depicting the face of Garavani and a half-century\u2019s worth of magazine covers line one hallway. Piccioli, who radiates a warm intelligence and quiet authority, is dressed in a black Valentino tracksuit, an item the designer, a dreamer described as passionate and simpatico by those who work with him, has turned into one of the brand\u2019s unlikely totems. Prominent on his office shelves are books on Pier Paolo Pasolini and Fra Angelico, and hanging on opposing walls is a 1988 Francesco Clemente painting titled \u201cNever-Ending Tale,\u201d and an entirely black, intricately stitched canvas by Brazilian artist Sidival Fila, a friend of Piccioli. In the adjoining room, photographs \u2014 John Lennon with David Bowie, Henry Clarke\u2019s 1968 portrait of Marisa Berenson in a Valentino minidress with a white parrot \u2014 share space with mood boards covered with images from Greek mythology; Maria Callas; and the anti-Versailles, the palace belonging to Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, the revolutionary Bourbon.The fantasy of fashion tends to land best when it is grounded in the genuine, and Piccioli has sensitive antennas for anything that feels superannuated or overly decorative: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in beautiful dolls or peacocks. Being yourself, I think, is the coolest thing you can do.\u201d To that end, Piccioli has redefined Valentino-style luxury as artisanal and personal \u2014 aspirational, yes, but not in the way of yachts-and-jets exclusivity; he finds the idea of \u201clifestyle\u201d especially dated. Part of making Valentino a touch more democratic was his renewed focus on daytime. A New York-inspired collection of glam leisure \u2014 variations on that now-iconic tracksuit in jewel-toned hammered silk, with refined, Spirograph-like topstitching, technical Jersey hoodie dresses and studded pool slides and sneakers \u2014 has been his most overtly \u201cstreet\u201d work to date, prompting some of us to envision a parallel, mythic life in which we might exist exclusively in silk sweats and evening wear. \u201cI think if you work on daywear pieces and give them a different perception, your message can be delivered more strongly,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople can relate. Otherwise, you are just talking to the niche.\u201dPICCIOLI GREW UP in the seaside town of Nettuno, about 40 miles outside the capital, dreaming of that mythic elsewhere. Cinema and books were his passports \u2014 the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, the novels of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez \u2014 but drawing was his talent. His parents (his mother ran a small boutique with her sisters, his father worked in the office of a local business) were puzzled but supportive when he applied to Rome\u2019s Istituto Europeo di Design, where, on the strength of his sketches, he was selected in his second year to interview for a prized internship as a design assistant. When he won the position, beating out third- and fourth-year students, he said that he would only take it if he were paid. \u201cMaybe I was rude to ask for this,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now I know it was because I wanted to demonstrate to myself that it could be a profession and not just a hobby.\u201dToday, Piccioli still lives in Nettuno, where he met his wife, Simona, in high school; they\u2019ve been married for 25 years and have three children, Benedetta (21), Pietro (20) and Stella (12), as well as a new puppy, Miranda. According to him, they\u2019re unmoved by his position as the creative director of a billion-dollar fashion house; at home, he is simply husband, father. (Simona, he notes, has never asked him what she should wear.) He bounces ideas off them, and Stella gives him ideas of what to listen to (Troye Sivan, one of her favorite musicians, has become the face of the men\u2019s wear campaign). Work nights run late, but when Piccioli isn\u2019t traveling, he likes to spend the morning with his family and commute by train. They are, he implies, what saves him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget how my dreams were as a kid, because I think they allow me to work with the same kind of passion and to not feel the pressures that are a kind of stereotype in fashion,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel lucky to do what I was dreaming to do with my life, and maybe going back every day to that place, and to my family, allows me to be exactly who I am.\u201dChiuri\u2019s departure, drama-free, prompted a big shift in his approach. \u201cWhen you work together, you don\u2019t compromise if you respect one another, but you do discuss everything, and so the process becomes more rational,\u201d Piccioli says. \u201cBeing alone, I learned to allow myself to be more intuitive, more free.\u201d He made changes to his design team, and when I meet them \u2014 they\u2019re in jeans and T-shirts, busy behind computers \u2014 I\u2019m struck by how young they are. They inspired him to play with a Valentino logo for men\u2019s wear; now, a bold VLTN appears on everything from handbags to a limited-edition yoga mat.For the Rome-inspired resort 2019 collection, all breezy day dresses and colorful \u201970s-style separates, he riffed on a vintage Valentino logo in psychedelic black-and-white silk prints. The looks were insouciant but also classically glamorous, belying the notion that youthfulness should be synonymous with slouchiness or sex.These are clothes, hundreds of hours in the making, that defy fashion\u2019s ephemerality. A cashmere coat of elongated proportions provokes a desire to take off my clothes right there and fold myself naked in it: It is a forever coat. Even the more fantastical moments in Piccioli\u2019s couture collections tend to be defined by a sort of cleanliness, and the quietest details can be the most astonishing: The fine pleats of a simple emerald chiffon skirt are lined with the tiniest of bird feathers; the white cotton shirt he holds out for me to examine is actually hand embroidered throughout in all-white stitching. \u201cThe most humble material, cotton. But even the most luxurious fabric is cheap compared with the value of the labor,\u201d he says.Overhead, a cloaklike dress of carmine silk, more Umberto Eco than \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d is suspended from the frescoed ceiling like a glamorous portent from the future. \u201cVery Italian, no? Not like in France,\u201d says Piccioli of the lively, buzzing space, smiling when I emerge. \u201cI started this collection with the idea of romanticism as a strength,\u201d he explains. \u201cI asked my older daughter if she could remember any myths that have a happy ending. And she said no, there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s like, if you follow your heart you will have to renounce something, you will have to make a sacrifice. And so, I think it\u2019s time to turn the finale: If you follow your heart, it can be good.\u201dModel: Adut Akech Bior / The Society Management. Hair by Gary Gill at Streeters.

{"Headline": "China Threatens New Tariffs on $60 Billion of U.S. Goods", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China threatened on Friday to tax an additional $60 billion a year worth of imports from the United States if the Trump administration imposes its own new levies on Chinese goods.Beijing and Washington imposed matching tariffs last month on $34 billion apiece of each others\u2019 products, and have plans to add another $16 billion worth of goods to their lists. Previous rounds of tariffs cover a lengthy list of products from steel and aluminum to washing machines and even dried fruit.China\u2019s decision to threaten $60 billion of American goods is the first time this year that Beijing has not tried to match Washington\u2019s tariffs dollar for dollar. China instead is threatening roughly two-fifths of its purchases from the United States after President Trump threatened two-fifths of China\u2019s much larger exports to the United States, said Tu Xinquan, the executive dean of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\u201cIt\u2019s more proportionate,\u201d Mr. Tu said.China wants to find a negotiated solution to the two sides\u2019 trade policy differences, but also could not simply ignore President Trump\u2019s threat earlier this week, Mr. Tu added.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.Mr. Trump ordered the Office of the United States Trade Representative on Wednesday to consider the possibility of 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion a year worth of Chinese goods. The 25 percent tariffs could be imposed in place of 10 percent tariffs that are already under discussion. Those tariffs have not taken effect, and a final decision on their size and scope is not expected until next month.But Chinese officials have suggested in recent weeks that if the United States proceeds with tariffs on a very wide range of Chinese goods, then Beijing may also retaliate against the Chinese-owned operations of big American companies. From Apple to General Motors, a long list of large American enterprises have transferred extensive operations to China and could be vulnerable to any response from Beijing.The iPhones, Chevrolets and other products manufactured and sold in China by American companies are mostly designed in the United States, and the Trump administration has declared various Chinese industries to be threatening American national security, illegally copying foreign intellectual property or causing widespread job losses in the United States. China has denied violating international trade norms.China\u2019s latest threat on trade came at the end of a day during which Beijing also allowed its currency, the renminbi, to slide further against the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The currency is allowed to trade in a daily range set by the central bank.By adding the option of 25 percent tariffs, however, the Trump administration would have an extra weapon in case the renminbi falls further and gives Chinese exporters an added advantage.The Chinese commerce ministry\u2019s statement appeared to anticipate possible tariff levels that the Trump administration might impose, with the ministry saying that it was mulling tariffs at four possible levels on the $60 billion in goods, ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent.China sold $505.6 billion worth of goods to the United States last year and purchased $130.4 billion. The United States did run a $38.5 billion trade surplus last year with China in services, like banking and insurance. But part of this sum may have represented efforts by worried Chinese families and households to move money out of the country, as opposed to actual purchases of services provided by American companies and individuals.Keith Bradsher reported from Beijing and Cao Li from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Syria, an Ugly Peace Is Better Than More War", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Carter is a former president of the United States.Beginning in 2011, Western and Middle Eastern powers rallied around the slogan \u201cAssad must go.\u201d This singular focus on the fate of Syria\u2019s president hardened positions on all sides and made it much more difficult to explore other options. The calls for regime change have diminished since then, but there are still some voices in Western policy circles that demand a full transition of power from the Assad government. A better approach at this point would be to test the Syrian government\u2019s ability to embark on a new course that has the potential to bring the war to a close. Western countries, including the United States, should re-engage incrementally with the Syrian government. They can start by reopening their embassies in Syria, since Western diplomats\u2019 absence from Damascus has led to missed opportunities. The West should also abandon the goal of regime change and temper expectations of democratic transition in Syria in the short-to-medium term. Instead, the focus should be on patiently building democracy. In exchange for this re-engagement, Damascus should be required to enact reforms, though the West must keep its demands moderate. Additionally, the West should be prepared to contribute to the reconstruction of Syria, perhaps selectively by sector. Humanitarian assistance alone will remain a bottomless pit as long as enterprising Syrians are unable to revive the country\u2019s economy and create jobs, particularly for young people. Syria\u2019s economy cannot be revived while the country remains under sanctions that hurt ordinary citizens. Lifting sanctions will be crucial to solving the huge challenges of reconstruction, unemployment and economic revival. Otherwise, a generation of Syrian children coming of age in the next few years and idle young men now in their 20s will be susceptible to insurgent and extremist recruiters and could resume the war in the next decade. To begin addressing these many challenges, all concerned must engage in a political process to wind down the war. Undermining of the Geneva peace process by Syria or European indifference to the situation will only lead to greater instability and suffering. Despite these gains, much of Syria remains outside the government\u2019s control, including, according to Carter Center research, 27 percent of the country\u2019s territory in the north and east that is held by Syrian Kurds with the help of an international coalition led by the United States. Opposition groups, some with close ties to Al Qaeda, control the northwestern province of Idlib. And Turkey has established along its border a protectorate in northwest Syria.For these complex measures to come to fruition, the Syrian government must accept the inevitability of reforms and implement confidence-building measures, including the release of detainees and accountability for their treatment. Immense violations of the laws of war and human rights have been committed in Syria, including the use of chemical weapons. Some such violations continue today. As a result, half the country\u2019s people have been displaced, and their homes and livelihoods destroyed. The international community has been a helpless witness to these violations, except in 2013, when a joint Russian-American effort removed from Syria the bulk of the country\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile. Assigning responsibility for the catastrophe in Syria would be an important part of postwar healing, but the priority now should be to end the war.

The alternative is a failed state for decades ahead in the heart of the Middle East.

{"Headline": "The Ephemeral Soundtrack of a New York Summer", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "Listening in on the background music in spaces around the city: a climbing gym, Bemelmans Bar, an electronics store in the Bronx.Supported byMost of the time, you probably don\u2019t notice background music. But occasionally, you\u2019ll be sitting in a coffee shop and a song comes on that reminds you of your first kiss. Or you\u2019ll be in a restaurant where it\u2019s too loud to talk, so you\u2019re forced to listen. Or you\u2019ll be on the sidewalk and a song you love drifts from the window of a passing car. Mostly, though, background music fades into the general mood. It\u2019s like light or temperature, part of the atmosphere of daily life. It is, by its nature, ephemeral; you would be unlikely to hear the same sounds at Grand Central Terminal from one day to the next. But this is an attempt to capture passing instants of background music, a sonic portrait of the city in summer.Background music often plays in the spaces between \u2014 waiting areas, transport terminals, elevators. It\u2019s the soundtrack of being on the way from here to there. \u201cI know that people kind of are affected by it,\u201d Mr. Swafford said. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t say anything to me or give me any money, they still feel something.\u201d (Some do stop; he met his wife when she missed her train and heard his violin down the platform.)The notes of \u201cEidelweiss\u201d are piercing as commuters file on and off trains. Overhead, track announcements blare. Someone drops a few dollars in Mr. Swafford\u2019s velvet case. He begins to play \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d and the familiarity of the song is like a jolt.On a Sunday near the 149th Street-Grand Concourse subway station, the background music is both an advertisement and an outdoor show. The store is showing off a model of portable electronic speakers, and the music pulsates down the block \u2014 competing with strains from other open-air speakers around the South Bronx.At this climbing gym in Gowanus, the background music is laid-back. The typical workout music has a pounding techno beat, but at Brooklyn Boulders the soundtrack has the kind of chill that\u2019s almost synonymous with the sport. Here, the workers select the music. The only real requirement is that it\u2019s kid-friendly, said the general manager, Carina Finn, but they also try to get the youngsters into oldies. \u201cWe\u2019ll put on the Velvet Underground playlist when we have kids around,\u201d she said. They play a lot of classic \u201970s and \u201980s rock. On Mondays, they\u2019ve instituted Vinyl Night, encouraging climbers to bring in their own records, which they play on a turntable. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t come here to work out and then leave,\u201d Ms. Finn said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an atmosphere that promotes being able to have a conversation and do things other than just work out.\u201dIn some spaces, the background music is the point. Beatstro, a new bar and restaurant in Mott Haven, is built around experiencing old-school hip-hop. \u201cI\u2019m from the Bronx originally,\u201d said Alfredo Angueira, a Beatstro owner. \u201cWe were developing the concept and we said, \u2018Let\u2019s focus on hip-hop.\u2019 You can\u2019t get more Bronx than that.\u201d The entrance is built to look like a record store, stocked with vinyl from X Clan, the Spinners, Donna Summer and others. You enter through a curtain, a homage to speakeasies. The walls are covered in graffiti murals by local artists \u2014 and the back of the restaurant is given over to D.J.\u2019s and musicians on the weekends. Sometimes a little jazz gets thrown into the mix. At around 4 p.m. on a Sunday, \u201cNever Too Much\u201d by Luther Vandross is playing, then George Benson\u2019s \u201cGive Me The Night.\u201d A music video plays on the back wall while the music thrums.If background music is the sound of waiting, it is also, not coincidentally, the sound of capitalism. The relationship between music and labor is an old one: In the late 19th century and early 20th, some factory owners hired orchestras to play for workers over the din of machines. In 1940, the BBC began a live radio program called \u201cMusic While You Work\u201d that ran twice a day featuring a \u201chalf-hour\u2019s music meant specially for factory workers to listen to as they work,\u201d mostly even-tempo, upbeat music.Now, in the urban creative gig economy, music has made its way into co-working spaces. At WeWork, with nearly 50 locations just in New York City, work spaces are generally quiet, save for the sounds of typing. But music plays in all the shared areas \u2014 like the lounges where beer is often served on tap. It\u2019s the bathrooms, though, that really have the feel of a high school dance. The overall vibe isn\u2019t so different from \u201cMusic While You Work\u201d; a WeWork spokeswoman said the company wanted music that \u201cencourages collaboration and keeps people energized.\u201d At one of the Midtown locations, punctuated by flushing and running faucets, you can hear indie-pop like the Temper Trap\u2019s \u201cSweet Disposition.\u201dThis landmark in the Carlyle Hotel is famous for its live piano music at night. But midday, when the bar is quiet and the piano stands empty, there\u2019s instrumental jazz playing. It\u2019s not quiet, per se, but it melds seamlessly with the surroundings: murals and lampshades painted in the 1940s by the writer and illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans, the author of the \u201cMadeline\u201d books, in exchange for lodging at the hotel. The walls feature whimsical scenes from Central Park in all four seasons \u2014 ice-skating elephants and picnicking rabbits \u2014 and 12 little girls in two straight lines. It\u2019s a little world within a world at Bemelmans in the afternoon, amid painted lamplight and jazz rising and falling.Open-air music is perhaps the most evocative of all background music, especially in the summer. It\u2019s also the most transitory. On basketball courts; from the windows of passing cars; in the parks; between two subway stops \u2014 you catch a fragment and then it disappears. Food stands all over the city blast music, creating a sonic atmosphere in the absence of walls and tables. In Jackson Heights, this brightly-colored juice and smoothie stand has a striped rainbow umbrella open, and underneath it, a portable speaker, set to a Spanish-language radio station playing sunny, soulful songs. The music drifts down the street, an outdoor soundtrack for the sidewalk in summer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flying With Dietary Restrictions? Increasingly, That\u2019s Not a Problem", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateWhen it was time for dinner on my July flight from Lisbon to New York, a flight attendant brought me my special request gluten-free meal. I was diagnosed with celiac disease almost three years ago, and this sort of request for what airlines describe as a special meal \u2014 in this case, steamed sea bass with vegetables, gluten-free bread and fruit salad \u2014 has been a constant on my frequent air travels ever since. Russ Brown, American\u2019s director of in-flight services, said that the airline decided to offer more kinds of special meals because passengers were repeatedly asking for them. \u201cPeople are a lot more specific with their diets today and try to be healthier overall and kept requesting meals that we didn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. In 2010, United went from offering five kinds of special meals to nine for passengers on long-haul international flights. And last year, that number increased to 10 when vegetarian meals were added. The airline has seen a 10 percent increase in special meal requests each year for the past 10 years, according to Rob Bradford, the airline\u2019s managing director of global product design and delivery, and that number has gone up \u201csignificantly\u201d in the last two years, he said.Mr. Berry said that nearly four percent of Delta\u2019s customers ordered a special meal last year, compared to two percent the year before. International airlines, though, tend to have a more robust selection of special meals and have expanded them even more in the past several years. On Turkish, fliers can now order not only a vegetarian or vegan meal, they can request a raw food vegan meal, or seafood- or fresh fruit-only meals. The airline has more than 10 menus for each meal type. In its gluten-free category, entrees include lamb with saut\u00e9ed spinach and rice, prawns with ratatouille, and herbed chicken with eggplant salad. Warm gluten-free rolls and olive oil accompany every dish. According to a company spokesman, special meal requests have increased significantly across all categories in the past few years. In 2012, for example, the carrier served about 16,000 gluten-free meals, but that number jumped to about 60,000 in 2017. Historically, fliers have ordered special meals because of religious or medical reasons. So why are they asking for them more today than they did before?Airline experts say that it now may be a matter of personal taste and also because the current generation of travelers adhere to diets that have proliferated in popularity. SmartFlyer sells around 25,000 tickets each year, and in 2017, a few thousand of these came with special meal requests, Mr. Holtz said, compared with a few hundred in previous years.But one flight attendant, who has worked for a major United States airline for more than three decades and requested anonymity to protect her job, said that special meals aren\u2019t a step up from regular meals and are definitely not healthier.Also beware, she said, that you\u2019re not going to get another meal if you don\u2019t like your special order because airlines only load on one meal per passenger. \u201cIf you have a genuine allergy or diet you have follow for a medical reason, it\u2019s best that you pack your own food,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, you might go hungry.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Korea Pushes Ahead With Diplomatic Office in North Korea", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea said on Wednesday that it would press ahead with its plan to open a diplomatic \u201cliaison office\u201d in North Korea this year, dismissing concerns that it was too quickly making overtures to the North Koreans, who have yet to begin dismantling their nuclear weapons program.But the conservative political opposition and the conservative news media in the South have since raised fears that Mr. Moon\u2019s government is creating a rift with Washington by advancing inter-Korean relations when North Korea has taken no clear steps toward denuclearization. They also questioned whether fuel oil and electricity, which the South plans to supply the office, would violate United Nations sanctions.South Korea says the liaison office would not violate sanctions because it would provide no economic benefits for the North Korean government and would only help facilitate communications for denuclearization efforts. Washington has so far said only that it wants inter-Korean relations to improve in tandem with efforts to denuclearize the North.On Wednesday, Mr. Moon\u2019s office characterized those concerns as mere \u201cquibbling,\u201d given that 24 nations, including Britain and Germany, operate embassies in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital.\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a big obstacle blocking the mighty stream\u201d of diplomatic efforts engaging North Korea, said Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for Mr. Moon.South Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, said on Tuesday that Seoul was still waiting for a \u201csatisfactory\u201d endorsement of the plan from Washington. Local news media interpreted her comment as an indication that there were differences between the allies over opening the liaison office.Mr. Moon has emphasized that he will coordinate closely with Washington on any effort to improve relations with the North and rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. Mr. Moon met with Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, twice this year to help lay the groundwork for Mr. Kim\u2019s historic summit meeting with President Trump in Singapore in June.At the June meeting, Mr. Kim committed to working toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But talks between Washington and Pyongyang have since stalled over how to denuclearize North Korea.Since the summit meeting in April, Mr. Moon\u2019s government has kicked off a series of inter-Korean projects aimed at easing tensions and building trust.He envisions integrating the two Korean economies, should the North denuclearize. Mr. Moon said that the joint liaison office in Kaesong would help expedite these plans and others.This week, Defense Minister Song Young-moo of South Korea said that both countries\u2019 militaries had discussed removing 10 of their guard posts within the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula.Both armies operate dozens of heavily armed guard posts within the DMZ, although they are banned from doing so under the 1953 armistice that halted the war.Gen. Vincent Brooks, the top American military commander in South Korea, said on Wednesday that he supported any initiative to reduce military tensions along the border.But General Brooks also warned that withdrawing the posts involved some risk \u2014 though \u201cnot an excessive amount\u201d \u2014 in terms of American and South Korea\u2019s abilities to defend against the North.Advertisement"}

The tax plan, congressional leaders said, would turbocharge the American economy and provide a much-needed helping hand to working-class families.So, more than six months since President Trump signed the tax cut into law, is it delivering on the promises Mr. Ryan and other leaders made?By spending a big chunk of their tax windfall on buying back shares, businesses are boosting demand for and, thus, the price of their stock. It is no wonder then that the S&P 500 stock index is trading near its high.By far, Apple conducted the largest buybacks, totalling nearly $45 billion in the first six months of the year.Q1 2018Trump\u2019s tax planintroducedshare buybacks, by quarter$23BApple, Inc.02006200820102012201420162018Q1 2018Trump\u2019s tax planintroducedshare buybacks, by quarter$23BApple, Inc.02006200820102012201420162018Capital expenditures, by quarterAmong companies in the S&P 500Four-quartermoving average$150B100B50B02006200820102012201420162018Capital expenditures, by quarterAmong companies in the S&P 500Four-quartermoving average$150B100B50B02006200820102012201420162018With so much of firms\u2019 focus on buying back stock, a key Republican prediction \u2014 that tax cuts would encourage spending on equipment and factories \u2014 has not come to fruition.

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco Is Said to Postpone Its Potentially Record-Breaking I.P.O.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant has suspended its plans to go public, a decision that puts on hold what would have been by far the biggest initial offering on record \u2014 or perhaps signals its cancellation.The company, Saudi Aramco, and its advisers are instead focusing on buying a stake in Sabic, a huge Saudi chemical producer, people briefed on the matter said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The shift in focus to a deal for Sabic, one of the people added, means the earliest that work could resume on a Saudi Aramco stock sale will be late next year.The delay cast more doubt on the future of what is meant to be not just a landmark deal for financial markets but one of the biggest milestones in Saudi Arabia\u2019s history.The kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had hoped to use the billions of dollars the I.P.O. would raise to finance his Vision 2030 plan, an ambitious effort to wean his country off its dependence on oil. Among the plan\u2019s expensive elements is the creation of a $500 billion city called Neom, meant to run entirely on clean energy and be serviced by robots.But the plans to take the state-owned oil monopoly public have been bedeviled by the sheer complexity of the undertaking. Though Prince Mohammed had hoped for a $2 trillion market value for Saudi Aramco, oil industry experts called that too high. And legal advisers have grappled with potentially thorny issues, including the possible pitfalls that could arise from choosing a foreign exchange on which to offer shares.In a statement, Khalid Al Falih, the Saudi energy minister and the company\u2019s chairman, said the I.P.O. had not been called off.\u201cThe government remains committed to the I.P.O. of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,\u201d he said. \u201cThis timing will depend on multiple factors, including favorable market conditions.\u201dThe statement also suggested that an important acquisition would come first.Buying part of Sabic, a giant in its own right, could make Saudi Aramco a more valuable company while the petrochemical industry is growing around the world. That, in turn, could help the oil company draw even more interest in a public offering.Sabic, which earned a net profit of nearly $5 billion in 2017, produced more than 70 million tons of petrochemicals and five million tons of steel last year, according to Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, which tracks the industry.Saudi Aramco has been trying to move into the sector, which it believes could provide a hedge against an eventual decline in demand for oil as a fuel. This month, Saudi Aramco\u2019s board approved $14 billion in petrochemical projects and project expansions, including a large refinery in Texas and a joint venture with the French giant Total in Saudi Arabia.The two companies have grown closer recently, including by starting plans for a joint chemicals plant in 2025. And Sabic would give Saudi Aramco invaluable expertise in the petrochemicals sector.\u201cSaudi Aramco has been quite deliberate in adding refineries, terminals and, more recently, chemical plants,\u201d said Osmar Abib, a managing director at Credit Suisse who has been closely following the proposed public offering. \u201cIt is all with the key objectives of securing more access to markets and enhancing overall returns.\u201dBut skeptics of a Sabic transaction worry that Saudi Aramco would be taking on a financial burden by paying tens of billions of dollars for a stake in the chemical company. And adding on a big petrochemical business might reduce the overall profitability of Aramco, which is believed to enjoy among the world\u2019s lowest costs for extracting the oil it produces.In any case, any eventual listing of Saudi Aramco shares will now have to wait until the Sabic acquisition is completed.But the decision to pause planning for a public offering of Saudi Aramco \u2014 and the pivot toward the transaction with Sabic \u2014 prompted some analysts to suggest that a public listing may be doomed.Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University, said he still suspected Prince Mohammed \u201cdreams of a diversified Saudi economy.\u201d\u201cAramco is still likely to play a big role in this goal, but Aramco might not do this through an I.P.O.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certainly other ways to raise capital.\u201dStanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Obama officials and Congress clearly made a big mistake early in the recession by focusing more intently on saving banks \u2014 and, thus, bankers and investors \u2014 and much less on directly helping families facing foreclosures and layoffs. Later in the recovery, the decision by Republican leaders in Congress to oppose every Obama proposal prevented the government from doing much to help people regain what they had lost or to heat up the tepid recovery with infrastructure spending and other stimulus measures. This is because as workers\u2019 incomes have stalled, corporate profits have shot up, especially for a small number of what some experts call \u201csuperstar firms,\u201d including technology giants like Apple; Alphabet, which owns Google; and Facebook.

{"Headline": "War Without End", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "At WarThe Pentagon\u2019s failed campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan left a generation of soldiers with little to fight for but one another.Supported byHe was 19, but at 160 pounds and barely needing to shave, he could pass for two years younger. He was nobody\u2019s archetype of a fighter. A high school drama student, he joined the Army at 17 and planned to become an actor if he survived the war. Often he went about his duties with an enormous smile, singing no matter what anyone else thought \u2014 R. & B., rap, rock, hip-hop, the blues. All of this made him popular in the platoon, even as he had become tenser than his former self and older than his years; even as his friends and sergeants he admired were killed, leaving him a burden of ghosts.After a few hours, Second Platoon reached the crest, high above the valley. The soldiers inhaled deeply, taking in the thin air. Away from the outpost\u2019s burning trash, the air tasted clean.A few soldiers went forward to check the trail before the rest of the platoon moved to the ambush site. With little more than whispers, the soldiers arranged themselves in a triangle astride a mountain footpath. Second Lt. Justin Smith, their platoon leader, put Molano at one corner and a second man with an M240 at another, with their machine guns angled back toward each other so their fire could create an interlocking zone of flying lead. Other soldiers set claymore mines on small stands.Everything was ready before dark. The air was chilly and the ridge raked by gusts. Soto was shivering. He pulled a dry undershirt and socks from his pack, changed clothes, ate a protein bar and washed it down with water. He saw his company\u2019s outpost below, across the open space, and realized this must be what it looked like to militants when they attacked. A distant call to prayer floated on the mountain air.More than three million Americans have served in uniform in these wars. Nearly 7,000 of them have died. Tens of thousands more have been wounded. More are killed or wounded each year, in smaller numbers but often in dreary circumstances, including the fatal attack in July on Cpl. Joseph Maciel by an Afghan soldier \u2014 a member of the very forces that the United States has underwritten, trained and equipped, and yet as a matter of necessity and practice now guards itself against.On one matter there can be no argument: The policies that sent these men and women abroad, with their emphasis on military action and their visions of reordering nations and cultures, have not succeeded. It is beyond honest dispute that the wars did not achieve what their organizers promised, no matter the party in power or the generals in command. Astonishingly expensive, strategically incoherent, sold by a shifting slate of senior officers and politicians and editorial-page hawks, the wars have continued in varied forms and under different rationales each and every year since passenger jets struck the World Trade Center in 2001. They continue today without an end in sight, reauthorized in Pentagon budgets almost as if distant war is a presumed government action.As the costs have grown \u2014 whether measured by dollars spent, stature lost or blood shed \u2014 the wars\u2019 architects and the commentators supporting them have often been ready with optimistic or airbrushed predictions, each pitched to the latest project or newly appointed general\u2019s plan. According to the bullhorns and depending on the year, America\u2019s military campaigns abroad would satisfy justice, displace tyrants, keep violence away from Western soil, spread democracy, foster development, prevent sectarian war, protect populations, reduce corruption, bolster women\u2019s rights, decrease the international heroin trade, check the influence of extreme religious ideology, create Iraqi and Afghan security forces that would be law-abiding and competent and finally build nations that might peacefully stand on their own in a global world, all while discouraging other would-be despots and terrorists.Aside from displacing tyrants and leading to the eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, none of this turned out as pitched. Prominent successes were short-lived. New thugs rose where old thugs fell. Corruption and lawlessness remain endemic. An uncountable tally of civilians \u2014 many times the number of those who perished in the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 \u2014 were killed. Others were wounded or driven from their homes, first by American action and then by violent social forces American action helped unleash.The governments of Afghanistan and Iraq, each of which the United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to build and support, are fragile, brutal and uncertain. The nations they struggle to rule harbor large contingents of irregular fighters and terrorists who have been hardened and made savvy, trained by the experience of fighting the American military machine. Much of the infrastructure the United States built with its citizens\u2019 treasure and its troops\u2019 labor lies abandoned. Briefly schools or outposts, many are husks, looted and desolate monuments to forgotten plans. Hundreds of thousands of weapons provided to would-be allies have vanished; an innumerable quantity are on markets or in the hands of Washington\u2019s enemies. Billions of dollars spent creating security partners also deputized pedophiles, torturers and thieves. National police or army units that the Pentagon proclaimed essential to their countries\u2019 futures have disbanded. The Islamic State has sponsored or encouraged terrorist attacks across much of the world \u2014 exactly the species of crime the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d was supposed to prevent.Almost two decades after the White House cast American troops as liberators to be welcomed, large swaths of territory where the Pentagon deployed combat forces are under stubborn insurgent influence. Areas once touted as markers of counterinsurgency progress have become no-go zones, regions in which almost no Americans dare tread, save a few journalists and aid workers, or private military contractors or American military and C.I.A. teams.Across these years, hundreds of thousands of young men and women signed on in good faith and served in the lower and middle ranks. They did not make policy. They lived within it.His urge to understand what happened was irresistible. A few months later, Soto sneaked away from the Bronx with an 11-year-old friend. The two rode the 4 train to Lower Manhattan and walked to the rubble at Ground Zero, where the towers had been. Soto made up his mind standing there. He would protect the United States. When he was old enough, he would enlist.The neighborhood outside his home was rough, and Soto was already carving out his place on the street \u2014 since age 8, he had been selling AA batteries on the curb. As his childhood passed, he watched friends drift into crime. Some joined Dominicans Don\u2019t Play, a Latino gang in a violent rivalry with another, the Trinitarios. His father, who worked as a doorman in Manhattan, had custody of him and his brother. The family shared an apartment with Soto\u2019s grandmother, Haydee Madera-Soto, who moved to New York from Puerto Rico in 1962 and lived in the same building on Morris Avenue for decades. She watched from her second-story window as if hovering above him, calling him inside when she sensed trouble. When he tried evading her, she learned his routes over rooftops and down staircases into other buildings on the block, and knew which staircases to charge up to intercept him and lead him home. Soto did not want to disappoint her. In eighth grade, he played Iago in a school production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cOthello.\u201d The role helped him enroll at the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan in September 2003, not long after the United States invaded Iraq.Soto never quite fit in. Most of his classmates were neither skirting gang involvement nor inclined toward military service. They were almost all bound for college and seemed to be able to dissociate themselves from the memory of New York being attacked. Soto felt as if he were from another world and moving in a different direction. He graduated in 2007 and enrolled in summer classes at Lehman College, but something did not feel right. America was fighting two wars. Each was going badly. What was he doing sitting around? He walked out of math class and into an Army recruiting office, where he told the first soldier he saw that he wanted to sign up. He volunteered for the infantry \u2014 his sense of the hardest, most dangerous job. His grandmother was visiting her village in Puerto Rico when he took his oath. She was despondent when she heard. \u201cIf I had been here, I wouldn\u2019t have let him go,\u201d she said.In August, when Soto arrived at Fort Benning, Ga., for One Station Unit Training, a pipeline to combat divisions, he was given as simple a label as a human being can have: Roster No. 242, written on tape on his plain green helmet. Several sergeants who trained him had been to Iraq and Afghanistan; he regarded them as the most impressive people he had ever met. Soto returned home for the holidays with orders to report in January 2008 to Fort Hood, Tex., and join the First Infantry Division, which was bound for a rotation in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq had entered a less violent phase. The Pentagon was shifting attention to defeating the Taliban, which had reasserted itself after being forced from Kabul in 2001. It had cut off remote outposts and was challenging the American-backed government across much of the country.At Fort Hood, Soto was greeted by a Viper Company squad leader, Staff Sgt. Nathan Cox. At 32, Cox was older than is typical for his rank. He had a deeply furrowed brow, a hint of graying hair, a college education and an aura of confidence rooted in previous tours in Bosnia and Iraq. He welcomed Soto in a straightforward manner, with a politeness that reflected his Catholic-school years in Iowa. Soto immediately liked him. Cox was a tattooed bookworm with a pensive side. After working under the tutelage of drill sergeants, with their outsize personas, Soto was drawn to his quieter, more composed and reflective demeanor. The platoon sergeant, Sgt. First Class Thomas Wright, assigned Soto as an ammunition bearer in a machine-gun team, a position for an F.N.G. \u2014 \u201cfucking new guy\u201d \u2014 on a fast track to war.The company was busy readying for Afghanistan and spent weeks in the field, conditioning with long marches under heavy rucksacks and training with weapons. The more Soto came to know Sergeant Cox, the more fortunate he felt to work for him. Cox served in the Army in the \u201990s, then returned to civilian life and studied for his bachelor\u2019s degree. Like Soto, he was deeply affected by the terrorist attacks in 2001, and he began talking of serving again. But he was raising two stepchildren and an infant daughter with his wife-to-be, Annie, and did not want to disrupt their family while they had teenage children in school. He waited until 2005, as his stepdaughter was graduating from high school, to take his oath for a second time, returning, like Soto, to the Army as an infantry volunteer. Cox did a tour in Iraq before reporting to Fort Hood with Annie and their toddler, where he became a squad leader. In this role, he was expected to shape a new batch of soldiers into a fighting team. Like Soto, he was also an artist. Soto sang. Cox drew. Sometimes he sketched officers as they gave briefings, filling pages of his tactical notebooks with renderings in real time.Late that spring, Cox hosted several young soldiers at the home on Fort Hood he shared with his family. It was one-half of an Army-managed duplex, a place in such poor condition that Annie and he referred to it as a government slum, the \u2019hood of Fort Hood. The battalion\u2019s soldiers were being granted leave before flying away for a year, and the party, on a concrete patio outside their back door, was a chance to gather away from work and relax. Annie prepared food and welcomed her husband\u2019s charges into her life. Cox grilled meat and served drinks and offered his out-of-uniform human side, impressing on his squad that each soldier was part of a team, and that he needed them, and that soon they would all need one another in profound ways.There were things he did not share. Although few of his fellow soldiers knew it, Cox did not have to deploy to Afghanistan; he had been recruited to serve as a PsyOps soldier, and there was a position for him in the PsyOps field. He turned down the opportunity, confiding in Annie that he could not let his squad go to Afghanistan without him. He had been telling his soldiers they had to be there for one another. He intended to live by his words.On the flight from the United States in July, Cox got his soldiers seated, then tried to relax. He ate and read part of a book but felt his wartime self settling over him, that blend of exhaustion and intensity, as he headed into his third war. \u201cSaying goodbye was hard, took it out of me emotionally,\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cFlight gives way to deployment mind-set + compressed brain.\u201dViper. The name sounded impressive. They were F.N.G.s now.At the moment Soto and his fellow soldiers arrived in the valley, the United States had been in Afghanistan almost seven years \u2014 longer than America\u2019s Civil War and involvement in World War I combined. The war\u2019s objectives and the military\u2019s roles had shifted across the years. The rush into the country to punish the perpetrators of the 2001 attacks had evolved into something else: an open-ended occupation. Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban\u2019s leader, were at large, and elite counterterrorism units remained in the country, fighting a shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies. But larger conventional American units were engaged in a war that swapped urgency for a mesh of military, development and political aims. Combat tours to Afghanistan now blended military and civil assignments, including holding down remote outposts, organizing infrastructure projects, helping Afghan ministries with tasks like registering voters and training and outfitting Afghan soldiers and police officers, to whom the Pentagon insisted security would one day be entrusted.No one had a firm idea of when that day might be, and hope for decisive momentum on any of these propositions had been undercut by the campaign in Iraq, which began diverting Pentagon attention soon after Bin Laden escaped over the mountain passes near Tora Bora in late 2001. In mid-2008, as Cox\u2019s squad arrived, the United States had more than 140,000 troops in Iraq and about 33,000 in Afghanistan. Many lived in an archipelago of small rural positions, around which the Taliban had long ago established ambush points and planted hidden bombs. This encirclement made ground patrols perilous and in some places rendered resupply by road impossible. These positions were kept alive by replenishments dropped with parachutes or carried by helicopters, themselves in short supply. All the while, the United States, pitted against enemies adept at terrorist attacks and guerrilla warfare, was field-testing a reboot of Western counterinsurgency doctrine, with an emphasis on protecting civilians and providing services while tightening rules that dictated how troops could fight. A phrase from Vietnam was circulating anew \u2014 \u201cwinning hearts and minds\u201d \u2014 even as units of hard-helmeted conventional troops spent large fractions of their time guarding their outposts and keeping themselves provisioned in distant, rugged terrain. A darker slang developed in the lower ranks. Afghanistan was the \u201cwelfare war.\u201d Forlorn outposts, often built near villages resentful of foreign occupiers, were \u201cbullet sponges.\u201dAmericans occasionally ventured up the Korengal\u2019s banks in the first years of the war, and they often met armed resistance. But the valley did not gain larger notoriety until 2005, when three Navy SEALs were killed in an ambush and a helicopter rushing to their aid was shot down, claiming 16 more lives. In 2006, an Army brigade situated the outpost on a low ridge with a gently sloping crest, beginning the phase of the American effort that Soto\u2019s platoon was cycling through. On a tactical level, establishment of the outpost could seem to make sense. The place was defensible, in an officer-school way \u2014 a position overlooking the river and lower trails with enough space for helicopters to land. On a social level, it could not have been much worse. It was an unforced error of occupation, a set of foreign military bunkers built on the grounds of a sawmill and lumber yard formerly operated by Haji Mateen, a local timber baron. The American foothold put some of the valley\u2019s toughest men out of work, the same Afghans who knew the mountain trails. Haji Mateen now commanded many of the valley\u2019s fighters, under the banner of the Taliban.Military minds had chosen the place. Standard military tactics would have to defend it. Troops built smaller posts so their occupants could watch over more of the riverbed and support one another with machine gun and mortar fire. NATO officials spoke of forging alliances between government and people. The American presence in the Korengal felt more crude fortress than diplomatic expedition, out of sync with ideas of protecting populations or courting hearts and minds.At first Soto found the valley breathtaking. The riverbed formed a green stripe of cropland. Terraces of stacked stone climbed the lower hills. Villages clung to ledges. Farther up the mountains rose escarpments of stone, buffeted by wind. This was not the arid steppe or brown hills that dominate much of the Afghan landscape. It was ancient forest bisected by cascading mountain streams that fed a river with a haunting name, a place beyond the imagination of a teenager from the Bronx.Soto soon saw the ground through another lens. Using aerial photographs, the Americans had charted every building in every village. The valley no longer seemed to him a land that time forgot. It was as intricately mapped as almost any place on earth. Hilltops, ridges, livestock sheds. Each was a precise spot that American weapons were ready to hit, a number on a targeting template overwritten on homes, ready for retaliation against any place from where an attack might emerge. Many attacks followed patterns. The outpost was reachable by a single dirt road from the Pech Valley. The Army had used this overland path for more than a year, sending cargo trucks accompanied by helicopters and armored Humvees. Often a route-clearance platoon led the slow drive, looking for bombs. These practices were well known by all sides and allowed the Taliban hours to prepare. Without irony, the Army had given its dirt track a name: Route Victory.Soon after his arrival, Soto was in a Humvee turret on the road, looking over the river to a village called Donga when incoming fire struck the dirt beside his truck, smacking it with shrapnel and rocks. He shouted to the driver \u2014 \u201cMove!\u201d \u2014 and opened up, aiming .50-caliber bullets just below dust he spotted rising on the far side. He fired an entire can, then half of another. Sergeant Cox was beneath him in the truck. \u201cHey, man, you O.K.?\u201d he asked Soto after, watching for his response. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said; he was adjusting to the place.Several times at night, Soto looked across the valley at flashlights bobbing in forests. He was sure these were Taliban moving ammunition and weapons. He found it maddening. They could fight as they pleased, but American soldiers were bound by rules limiting their ability to enter homes, rules governing when they could use their weapons, rules governing whether and how firepower could be applied. Soldiers were drilled in manners and restraint. As Soto saw it, Viper was like a boxer forbidden to use fists, reasoning with a foe who was allowed to punch first. It was a death lottery, with medals for the losers and talking points on the news.On Sept. 6, Second Squad walked across the river and up the steep hill to Donga, while other soldiers set up a position on the west side. Militants opened fire, trying to hit the soldiers on the west bank. When the gunfire stopped, Cox hunched over the radio with another sergeant. They shook heads and swore and told everyone to get ready for the return walk. Soto was a student of Cox\u2019s body language. He knew something was wrong.Helicopters circled overhead. After Second Squad crossed the river and climbed to the road, Soto was angry. There was a lot going on, and they weren\u2019t hearing it. He thought he knew why. When the squad reached an Afghan Army position, his anger surged to fury. He confronted a sergeant. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho got hit?\u201d\u201cIt was Knight,\u201d the sergeant said.Specialist Marques Knight was an experienced soldier, with a tour in Iraq. He was killed in a vehicle turret when a sniper\u2019s bullet hit his head. Soldiers beneath him in the truck saw his legs go instantly limp.The sky opened up, splattering the valley with rain and hail. Soto strode forcefully along the last leg of the walk to the outpost, soaked and cold, alternating between numbness and lucidity. Knight\u2019s body lay in the mechanics\u2019 bay, where soldiers paid last respects. Late that night, Viper gathered for a ceremony in the darkness. A mortar crew fired two illumination rounds. Each was a bright flare beneath a fluttering parachute. They ignited brilliantly and descended, whistling softly and casting shadows that spun and danced. They burned for about a minute. Then the valley was black again.The idealism that propelled Soto to Afghanistan was being scoured away. In his journal, Cox recorded one of Soto\u2019s questions. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d Cox wrote, \u201cthat pieces of crap go on living lives that mean nothing and good men die in places like this?\u201d Soto thought Cox agreed, but he was careful in his reply. He didn\u2019t know that fatalism had seeped into his sergeant\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cHave a bit of humor with death,\u201d Cox wrote. \u201cAt the funeral just say, \u2018I guess I had it coming.\u2019 \u201d His entry that night was littered with the titles of songs. \u201cSeven Nation Army,\u201d \u201cAway From the Sun,\u201d \u201cHere Without You.\u201dHe ended with a lyric from one more: \u201cLove me when I\u2019m gone.\u201dAfter Knight was killed, Sergeant Wright, the platoon sergeant, told Soto that Third Squad was heading to an observation post and that Soto would leave Second Squad temporarily to join them there. Soto did not want to go. Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday was at the end of the month, and Soto had ordered a gift \u2014 a copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d He had noticed how much Cox read. Even when there was time for only a few hours of sleep, Cox would often spend part of it with a book. It was fiction as sanctuary. The two men had talked about reading, and Soto had learned that Cox had never read J.D. Salinger. He intended to fix that, just as he intended to remain with Second Squad for its next patrols. He sought out his squad leader and asked to stay in his job.Cox told him he had already spoken with Wright and the brief reassignment would stand. The observation post needed a medic, a role Soto had trained to perform. Cox was occupied with leading the rest of his squad. Some of the soldiers were calling certain patrols suicide missions; one griped to him about taking what he considered unnecessary risks. Cox was incredulous. \u201cWhat?\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cEverything we do is an unnecessary risk. It is our job!\u201dSoto moved with Third Squad to Observation Post Dallas, a small position above the valley, where soldiers took turns on radio watch and behind machine guns, defending their peers below. The place was primitive to an extreme, a set of sandbagged fighting holes cut into stone and sunbaked earth. Soldiers slept in folding cots on uneven ground, camping near a barrel of their own waste. The bunkers were infested with fleas, and the air was swarmed by flies, which moved between excrement and everything else. But some of the soldiers liked their days there. At Dallas they were unhassled by the rules and routines of the larger outpost, alone atop a ridge where bird song filled the air each dawn. Cox, on an earlier rotation, had seemed especially pleased. \u201cMy 1st command,\u201d he wrote, \u201cof a fort.\u201dOn Sept. 20, Second Squad drove north on Route Victory toward the Pech Valley to sweep an area where patrols were attacked so frequently that troops called it Ambush Alley. Soto listened to their progress while on radio watch at Dallas. He heard gunfire chatter, then a rocket-propelled grenade boom and echo. Over the radio came the reassuring sound of Cox\u2019s voice. The patrol radioed that it had crossed through the most dangerous stretch.An explosion rocked the valley. Soto guessed what it meant. A Humvee had been hit by a bomb.He waited anxiously, monitoring the back-and-forth transmissions between outpost and patrol. Multiple voices came on the radio. Cox\u2019s was absent. Soto assumed Cox was busy at the blast site, assessing what had happened, helping any wounded, organizing the squad\u2019s reaction. Other soldiers reached the crater and described what they saw. The I.E.D. had knocked the last Humvee off the road, scattering its armor, roof and doors downslope. Two soldiers had been wounded. Two more were dead. The gunner, Pvt. Joseph F. Gonzales, had been killed instantly. So had Sergeant Cox.High on the mountain to the south, Soto\u2019s eyes welled with tears.Soto usually sat directly behind Cox in the truck. If Wright had not sent him to Dallas, if Soto had won his argument over being reassigned, he would have been in his seat with his first-aid bag when the blast blew the truck apart.Barack Obama was the president-elect. The Afghan war was soon to be new again. But political wheels turned slowly, and whatever changes were in store for the war would be unlikely to happen soon enough to matter to his platoon, which was still engaged in pitched firefights. Sitting at home, looked after by his grandmother, Soto felt guilty for being away. He was relieved when it was time to return to the valley.He landed to more bad news. Three more soldiers in his platoon were shot while he was gone, and a helicopter was hit by a missile or rocket and crashed. Most of those inside scrambled out, but a sergeant was killed. The downing exposed another weakness in American plans for Afghanistan: the reluctance of the Afghan forces. After the helicopter slammed into the earth, Marines mentoring Afghan soldiers tried to rally them to the aid of passengers and crew. The Afghans refused. The patrol, they said, was not on their schedule.Soto\u2019s views of the war were hardening further, and he was unwilling to suppress what he knew. American soldiers were not going to win over Korengalis with counterinsurgency sweet talk or development projects, and they were not going to defeat militants by hanging around the outpost and trying to visit villages by day. In the news he read about the war, senior officers said what they needed to say \u2014 about Americans coaching Afghan forces, about winning over the Afghan population, about the Taliban losing ground. The brass didn\u2019t mention what he saw: that most Afghans in the valley were not interested in getting along, that Afghanistan\u2019s Army survived only under American protection and that units like his spent most of their time just trying to stay supplied and alive.Then came the order for the ambush patrol high on the ridge.Smith\u2019s plan called for the scouts to find a position up the slope and watch the trail, ready to give warning if anyone approached. They departed in single file. Soto figured a night of boredom was ahead. Near the center of the patrol base, the radio operator sat with the handset, monitoring transmissions. He had spread a poncho liner and opened an M.R.E. ration, expecting an easy run of hours.Smith rushed toward him, whispering fast. \u201cDudes are coming down the trail,\u201d he said. The radio operator asked if the scouts were coming back.\u201cNo,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Taliban.\u201d He dashed away.Soto heard movement behind him. Smith crouched between him and Specialist Molano, practically hissing. Scouts had just reported gunmen walking this way, he said, 10 or 15 people in all.Soto entered a peculiar mind-set that can settle over a combatant in the seconds before battle, a feeling of absolute, intoxicating clarity. Roles in the valley had been reversed. This time someone else was heading into a trap. He flipped his rifle\u2019s selector lever off safe. His world shrank to what rehearsals had drilled him for: peering into his sector, ready to kill. His job now was to wait. Smith alone was to decide whether the people approaching were combatants. If he decided they were, then he decided when to begin shooting. Only he could initiate fire.Soto\u2019s eye was pressed close to his night-vision device. His heart thumped in his ears.Into the dim green glow of his eyepiece stepped the shape of a man. He was carrying a rifle. Another man emerged behind him. He carried a rifle, too. Two more men stepped into view. They were about 35 yards away. The first man paused. He pointed a flashlight at the ground, switched it on and quickly switched it off.Soto felt vindicated. The Taliban fighters were ghosts no more. He had been right all along when he saw flashlights and suspected the Taliban moved openly at night. Calm settled over Soto. The approaching men were about to die.The lead man was perhaps 20 yards away.Lasers had already settled on the first two men. A green line stopped on the forehead of the first; another traced a figure-eight pattern on his chest. The second man was similarly marked.Soto moved his weapon toward the man with the machine gun and rested his aiming laser between straps on his tactical harness.The gunmen drew inside of 15 yards, then inside of 10. More fighters filled in behind them.Smith pressed the switch on the claymore. An explosion shook the forest. Steel balls slammed into the Taliban patrol. His voice sounded in the dark. \u201cFire!\u201d he said. \u201cFire! Fire!\u201dSoto fired several times into the chest of the man carrying the machine gun. The man dropped to his knees. Soto kept shooting as the man crumpled to the ground. He scanned a pandemonium made visible through his night-vision monocular. A few Taliban fighters had fallen in place. Others staggered and scattered. Tracers skipped off rocks, spinning over the ridge in hot arcs. Soto fired at the fleeing men. He thought he hit them but wasn\u2019t sure.The man Soto shot first rose. He was upright. Soto fired again. The man dove into brush. A grenade shook the forest. Soto heard familiar voices. He yelled that he was fine as he changed his rifle\u2019s magazine. The shooting stopped. A voice called out. \u201cGet ready for a counterattack!\u201dSergeants moved through the patrol base, checking their soldiers. Someone said none of the Americans had been hurt. A sergeant led Soto and two other soldiers into the kill zone to search the dead. Soto found the body of the machine-gunner he had killed. Up close, under a flashlight, he looked 16 years old. More bodies were spread through the woods. The sergeant donned latex gloves and turned the dead men\u2019s heads to photograph each face for an intelligence report. Second Platoon had killed more than 10 Taliban fighters. Now it had to get back to avoid suffering casualties of its own.The platoon filed downhill with scouts in the lead. Gunfire broke out again. Soto was farther back; he and the soldiers near him slid downhill, grabbing brush to break their falls. They found the scouts standing over three more Taliban bodies.The platoon shuffled on. Inside the column, Soto let his mind wander. He felt proud. He and his friends had killed men who had been killing them. Vengeance was satisfying, in a primal way. And this night, he thought, might have brought more than revenge. The Taliban\u2019s losses could hurt its ability to fight.Viper 2 waded back across the river before dawn and weaved uphill to the outpost\u2019s gate. The waiting soldiers were cheering. Soto heard people say that what his platoon did was monumental. Cooks prepared a hot meal, and the soldiers, back within the relative safety to their base, talked hurriedly, loudly, surging with what they had done.Soto drifted away. His legs quivered with cramps. He had been working in gore, searching the warm, bloodied bodies of Taliban fighters ripped apart by bullets and claymore mines. He washed himself by standing naked and dumping bottles of drinking water over his head. His adrenaline had ebbed, allowing him to reconsider what had happened. He realized he had been wrong about one thing. Smith was legit. He\u2019d led them through the most successful operation of their tour. But now he doubted the killing would change the company\u2019s circumstances. The valley did not work that way.Earlier, elders had appeared at the outpost\u2019s gate and asked to speak with Viper\u2019s commander, Capt. Jimmy Howell. In ordinary circumstances, their long faces might command others to hush. But the outpost was ebullient. Viper\u2019s morale had been buoyed by the settling of a score. Soldiers grinned. An awkward meeting followed. Howell took a seat among his visitors, who said the Americans had made a mistake. A child had gone missing while gathering food on the mountain, they said, and villagers sent a search party to find her. These were the men, they said, that Viper killed.Howell waited until the last elder had spoken. Then he replied. The elders\u2019 tale, he said, was one of the most ridiculous lies he had ever heard.After the ambush, Soto became Smith\u2019s radio operator, and the platoon was assigned to visit Laneyal, across the river from Aliabad, a village that served as a de facto front line, beyond which was Taliban turf. Getting there involved multiple risks. The soldiers would walk along the western side of the river, which the Taliban often raked with gunfire, and where Knight was killed. Then they would pick their way downslope to a river fork. The path was narrow, and the river was swollen with snowmelt and rain. There the soldiers would cross on wooden footbridges. The first was perhaps two feet wide. The second was a timberlike plank. First Lt. John Rodriguez, Viper\u2019s executive officer, walked with Smith, who was still learning the ground.The platoon departed in drizzle. Sheets of mist drifted across the valley. The mud was slick like grease. The valley dropped before the soldiers like a gorge. On the way down, the soldiers met an elder, Zarin, coming up. Rodriguez knew him. The two men chatted in the rain. Zarin said the path would be safe.After crossing the bridge over the western fork, the soldiers moved in single file to the plank. Laneyal loomed overhead as Soto crossed.An explosion detonated before him, heaving a cone of dirt in the air, blowing him to the ground. In the moment after, all was still. Soto\u2019s ears rang.Bullets snapped down, part of a crescendo of fire. Soto pushed himself to his feet and dashed downstream, leaping over boulders. He saw a pile of logs ahead and headed there, his radio antenna swinging from his back. He reached the logs, knelt, aimed his M4 upward and fired.\u201cStay there!\u201d Smith shouted. \u201cStay! There!\u201dSoto couldn\u2019t hear him. Rushing water and gunfire drowned out other sound. He thought Smith needed the radio. He ran down the bank and jumped into the cold water, feeling the weight of his pack and radio as his feet struck bottom. A stone building stood across the river, about 100 feet away. Gunfire tore through the air. Soto pushed himself across the stream, struggling to stay upright. He cleared the water, scrambled upright and ran to the soldiers at the building.An Air Force bomb whooshed in and exploded, sending a mushroom cloud rising where another building had been. Smith told the soldiers under Laneyal to be ready to withdraw. Now was their chance. The soldiers threw smoke grenades and retraced their steps, contracting into Aliabad, where they clustered in alleys and went through the ritual of a head count. Squad and team leaders tallied ammunition. The mood lightened. They had survived another ambush and were exhilarated to be alive.A voice called out. \u201cDewater?\u201dThere was no answer. Pfc. Richard Dewater was not in Aliabad.Nausea swept over Soto. He radioed to the outpost, in case Dewater had walked back. Dewater was not there. Nightfall was near. The soldiers moved across the bridges. The platoon spread through wheat fields to the blast hole.\u201cI found him,\u201d a voice said. Soto spun around. A sergeant was there. Dewater was not. \u201cLook up,\u201d the sergeant said, and swung a flashlight beam into the canopy of a tree. Dewater\u2019s lifeless body hung from a branch. His helmet was on. He was missing a leg.Another sergeant climbed the tree and pushed Dewater free. The soldiers placed him on a litter. Slowly they made their way across the river, panting, struggling to carry their friend.On the staircase, Afghan soldiers watched. One raised a camera. Something in Soto snapped. He stepped before the lens. \u201cWhat the fuck you doing, man?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re taking a picture of? We don\u2019t take pictures of you. Put that camera down.\u201d He shoved the man. The Afghan soldiers parted. The processional reached the road and turned north, walking in darkness and cold rain.Unknown to most of the younger soldiers, officers in Viper Company and their battalion commander were advocating a different approach. One linchpin of American strategy had been to fight away from population centers, from outposts the military sometimes called blocking positions. The troops understood the assumptions in this thinking were weak. On May 1, Taliban fighters overwhelmed a mountaintop outpost overlooking the Kunar River, killing three Americans, two Latvians and three Afghan soldiers, and taking other Afghan soldiers prisoner. In the aftermath, Lieutenant Rodriguez talked with an intelligence sergeant who had concluded, as did others who were tracking the violence, that many Korengali fighters were fighting elsewhere, at least for now, including in the Kunar Valley. This challenged American thinking about blocking positions. Taliban fighters were not blocked. They had little trouble leaving the valley at will.That month, Viper\u2019s commander, Captain Howell, sent a letter via the elders to Nasrullah, the Taliban\u2019s local leader, proposing measured withdrawal in exchange for a Taliban commitment to reconcile with the Afghan government and not to use the Korengal to stage attacks. A letter came back, saying perhaps the parties could work out a deal if the Americans would convert to Islam. Until then, Nasrullah said, New York and London would have to burn.Soto felt anxious in his last weeks in the valley. A photograph of him seconds after Dewater was killed had appeared in The New York Times. Word rushed through his circles in the city. In her apartment in Morris Avenue in the Bronx, his grandmother stared at the photo and cried. Friends wrote him on Facebook and email, urging him to keep safe. The attention was jarring. Soto had shrunk his world to a grunt\u2019s regimen and assumed a fatalistic view. Expecting to be killed had made his job easier. Now he felt pressure not to die.By mid-June, all that was left was a helicopter ride to Bagram by darkness. He and a small group of troops sat on the landing zone, on gravel and dust, backs pressed against stuffed rucksacks. They were near the mechanics\u2019 bay, where the remains of men they knew had waited in body bags for their own flights home. His tour was minutes from being over.The first sergeant appeared. Dust swirled as the aircraft descended. He grabbed Soto and shouted. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cSoto!\u201d he shouted back.\u201cSoto?\u201d The first sergeant pressed a coin-shaped medallion with the company logo into his hand, a keepsake for having served his tour. \u201cMan, you really deserve this.\u201dIn 2011, his unit was sent to Iraq to help with another American withdrawal. Now he was a sergeant and team leader on a third deployment. He had gained muscle and experience, skepticism and tattoos. Soto\u2019s time in Iraq was nothing like his Afghan tour. He and his team were part of a perimeter security force that guarded airfields as planes carried away whatever the Pentagon wanted to keep. The insurgents appeared to have decided to let them go. Soto saw no direct action; he spent more time in the gym than on patrol. But he had learned to doubt official military narratives. When he flew to Kuwait late that year, among the last Americans to leave (before the collapse of Iraqi forces in the face of an Islamic State offensive would draw the Pentagon back), he did not feel as if peace had been assured. The violent contest for Iraq was not over.By then the war in Afghanistan had absorbed the Obama administration\u2019s campaign to turn it around. The American and NATO troop surge that followed Viper Company\u2019s tour had crested, bringing more news of fighting in places few Americans had heard of before. An influx of money, equipment and advisers had swelled Afghan Army and police numbers and distributed fresh forces over the ground. The latest plan was for the Americans to secure the country, usher in government services and then hand over the countryside to Afghan troops.But ministries and armies are not remade in a few years, and many American units were dispatched into lightly populated areas and the same sort of hard-to-maintain positions that previous commanders decided were ineffective, risky and not worth their cost. It was as if one cycle of senior officers had not learned from the previous round. Moreover, several regions were also engines of opium-poppy production, where a foreign military presence threatened an established local economy and provoked armed interests with no intention of losing it. The thinking behind the offensive could sound good in the general officers\u2019 suites. At the lower ranks, Marines and soldiers were fighting small, brutal and frustrating actions, protected from being overrun by air power while losing lives and legs on ground, like the Korengal Valley, that the Pentagon did not intend to keep and had few viable proxies to pass off to.The Taliban showed no sign of folding. Its bombs grew more sophisticated, even as its spokesmen taunted the Americans and their proxies on Twitter. Many American soldiers and lower-level officers saw that the Afghan surge was not succeeding, and that the Taliban would wait for the drawdown. Some of them, after a decade of war, in command of an array of fire support unmatched by any military in the world, adopted cautious tempos and spoke to their troops in knowing euphemisms, including \u201ctactical patience,\u201d a concept at odds with the aggressive ethos of infantry units but in line with an understanding that the plan was flawed. Roughly translated, it meant: \u201cDon\u2019t let your people be the last soldiers killed in this war.\u201dSoto and his fellow veterans from the Korengal watched from afar, clustered on social media, memorializing their own list of dead: David Paquet, Michael Dinterman, Marques Knight, John Penich, Joseph Gonzales, Ezra Dawson, Richard Dewater, Nathan Cox. A list including the wounded showed that the cost was larger; after a Marine who worked with them committed suicide and a postwar motorcycle accident claimed a forward observer, some of them wondered if it was larger still.And then it was someone else\u2019s turn. Sgt. Robert Soto left the Army with an honorable discharge in 2012, driving home to New York in a U-haul truck towing a red Camaro he kept almost as clean as the rifle he left behind. War had come to his city when he was a child. Now he was ready to try peace. He moved in with his grandmother in the Bronx and used his G.I. Bill benefits to enroll at Monroe College. Except for occasional visits to the nearby V.A. center for treatment for anxiety and insomnia, he mostly kept his status as a veteran to himself.In 2014, he transferred to Columbia University, where he avoided the vocal veterans\u2019 group on campus and rarely flashed the visual signals \u2014 the caps, T-shirts, bags and Velcro patches \u2014 that can convey recent service to the larger tribe. Sometimes to sleep he drank, enough that friends and his grandmother were concerned, but he was also making grades, working out, staying socially active. He landed a role in a musical and in 2017 performed at the war museum on the decommissioned U.S.S. Intrepid. That summer he graduated with a degree in political science. The Ivy League\u2019s imprimatur had been bestowed upon him, but he did not want to wear it. Apprehensive about having his life taken over by a conventional career, he still had dreams of being an artist. He worked part time \u2014 in construction, installing and removing scaffolding, in child care \u2014 while trying to break into the music industry. He had grown up on the street and then at war. Writing and recording music was the resumption of his long dream of becoming a performer, and felt like the childhood he never had. Much of what he wrote was about life in New York, but he recorded other tracks, like one he called \u201cGala,\u201d with a refrain that called back to the war:No more pain for all my guysJust ChampagneLet\u2019s taste the sky.Still he wondered: Was there no accountability for the senior officer class? The war was turning 17, and the services and the Pentagon seemed to have been given passes on all the failures and the drift. Even if the Taliban were to sign a peace deal tomorrow, there would be no rousing sense of victory, no parade. In Iraq, the Islamic State metastasized in the wreckage of the war to spread terror around the world. The human costs were past counting, and the whitewash was both institutional and personal, extended to one general after another, including many of the same officers whose plans and orders had either fizzled or failed to create lasting success, and yet who kept rising. Soto watched some of them as they were revered and celebrated in Washington and by members of the press, even after past plans were discredited and enemies retrenched.On that point Soto\u2019s views were unsparing. Good people paid in blood and sorrow, sent to graves or subjected to suffering for which there was no reckoning. It fit a pattern he now could see. Viper\u2019s war was the Korengal Outpost, for four years a showcase of American resolve only to become the subject of an Al Jazeera report of Taliban fighters strolling through its remains. Soto did not see himself as special. Many others served there, and he knew countless combat veterans could name emptied outposts across Afghanistan and Iraq that were also mostly forgotten, except among those who fought from them, told, in their time, that it mattered.Some days he accepted it. Others he could not square what he heard with what he and his fellow veterans had lived. The dead were not replaceable, and they had been lost in a place the Army did not need them to be. Sometimes, when he was awake in the restless hours between midnight and dawn, his memories of lost friends orbiting his mind, Soto entertained the questions. What befell those who sent them? Did generals lose sleep, too? \u201cThey just failed as leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should know: They failed, as leaders. They let us down.\u201dLate this spring, before a recording session in a rented sound studio near Times Square, Soto visited his grandmother on Morris Avenue. He and his father looked through a closet that held old uniforms and keepsakes from his enlistment. In the collection was a small Amazon delivery box. Soto had received the package when a helicopter brought mail to the Korengal Outpost in 2008. Its tape had been torn open, but its contents remained undisturbed \u2014 a paperback book gift-wrapped in green. Its gold ribbon was pristine. It was the copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d he had ordered for Sergeant Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday. It had arrived after Cox\u2019s death.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pause in Military Drills, Ordered by Trump, Leaves South Koreans Uneasy", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For six decades, joint exercises held by the militaries of South Korea and the United States have been the most visible and celebrated display of the alliance. Each year, their Marines storm South Korean beaches together, their tanks spew orange-red flames and their warplanes run mock bombing raids on imaginary North Korean nuclear targets.Such scenes, broadcast on prime-time television, have been a frequent reminder for South Koreans of how much the country depends on the alliance for its security.\u201cWe sometimes wonder, \u2018Is he really the president of our ally?\u2019\u201d said Moon Seong-mook, a retired general affiliated with the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, a conservative think tank in Seoul. \u201cHe is so confusing. Is he really the shrewd negotiator he says he is, with us missing the method behind his madness, or is he just plain impulsive?\u201dSouth Korean officials say the suspension, which President Moon Jae-in supported, was needed to reduce tensions with the North and to coax it into negotiating about giving up nuclear arms. Both the South Korean and American militaries say the suspension will not affect their readiness to respond to a threat from the North.But not everyone is convinced. About 60 percent of the officers of the combined South Korean-United States Forces Command, which coordinates the joint drills, are set to leave for other posts in a year because of routine rotations, according to Kim Min-seok, a former Defense Ministry spokesman who is now a columnist on military affairs at the JoongAng Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper.At the same time, American negotiators have begun demanding that South Korea contribute much more to the cost of the United States military presence, citing the expense of the drills as a major factor, according to officials familiar with the continuing talks.There has been no definitive estimate of how much the drills cost. But South Korean news media have put the combined figure at $72 million a year, rising sharply if more aircraft carriers or long-range bombers than usual are deployed, as they were last year.Both Seoul and Washington have said they will restart the joint drills if North Korea fails to follow through on its vague commitments to denuclearization.Conservative South Koreans, in particular, worry that Mr. Trump, eager to strike a nuclear deal with Mr. Kim, might bargain away joint military drills permanently, weakening the rationale for keeping American troops in South Korea. That outcome would leave South Koreans feeling extremely vulnerable, given the North\u2019s conventional weapons pointed at Seoul, and its 1.2-million-strong army, which analysts say is one of the world\u2019s largest.Cheon Seong-whun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said that Mr. Trump, in his negotiations with North Korea, was making the mistake of treating the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program and Washington\u2019s alliance with South Korea as bargaining chips of \u201cequal value.\u201d\u201cEven if North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons \u2014 I doubt it will \u2014 what about the North\u2019s other weapons of mass destruction, like biological and chemical weapons, and its massive standing army?\u201d Mr. Cheon said. \u201cThe ending of joint exercises is an integral part of North Korea\u2019s strategy to weaken the South Korea-U.S. alliance and drive out the American troops from South Korea.\u201dThe American military currently has 28,500 troops in the country. Some of its joint exercises with South Korea are conducted largely through computer simulations. For others, thousands of American military personnel based in Japan and the United States, as well as American aircraft carriers and submarines, join the forces based in South Korea to rehearse a counterattack against a North Korean invasion.North Korea has long insisted that it would not relinquish its nuclear weapons program unless the United States ended its \u201chostile policies.\u201d It has cited the joint military drills as a prime example of such American hostility, calling them rehearsals for invasion and using them as a pretext for bolstering its totalitarian control of its people.North Korea has often responded to the joint exercises with its own massive military drills. But Pyongyang has found it increasingly difficult to do so, especially since the economic collapse and famine endured the North in the 1990s. Its military, like the rest of the country, is plagued by a lack of spare parts and fuel.Some analysts in South Korea say that ending the drills could help Mr. Kim persuade his people, especially hard-line generals, to accept denuclearization and focus on rebuilding the North\u2019s economy.\u201cWhenever there was a major joint military exercise in South Korea, the North Korean economy was virtually paralyzed for two or three months, as people and factory workers were mobilized for civic defense drills,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Claims Are Overblown", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.Yes, the economy is continuing to expand nicely, which all Americans should celebrate. But no, there\u2019s nothing remarkable in the overall results since Mr. Trump took office. Most importantly, there is little evidence that the president\u2019s policies have meaningfully improved the fortunes of those \u201cforgotten\u201d Americans who elected him.Let\u2019s start with the jobs numbers. While the latest figures are certainly positive, the United States has been adding jobs since well before Mr. Trump took office. And the rate of job growth during Mr. Trump\u2019s first 19 months in office (194,000 jobs per month) is slightly less than the rate at which jobs were added during President Barack Obama\u2019s final 19 months (205,000 per month). So the good news on jobs is the same good news Americans have been hearing for the last three years.Monthly totals, in thousands.300Obama average:205,000Trump average:194,0002001000201620172018JULY300Obama average:205,000Trump average:194,0002001000201620172018JULYBy The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsWith each month\u2019s jobs figures, the Labor Department also releases the latest wage data, which often gets short shrift in the news accounts. That\u2019s unfortunate because for a majority of the roughly 150 million Americans who have jobs, the income picture is harsh and not improving.After adjusting for inflation, wages have barely increased during the Trump presidency. When July\u2019s Consumer Price Index is reported next week, it is likely to show that whatever modest increase workers are getting in their wages continues to be eaten up by rising prices.Over the first 18 months since Mr. Trump took office, real earnings, which reflect earnings after accounting for inflation, rose at an annual rate of just 0.3 percent.Rising prices have been eating up most of the modest increases in workers\u2019 pay. Real average hourly earnings, year over year percent change.+4%+2Obama average: 0.8%0Trump:0.3%\u2013220102012201420162018+4%+2Obama average: 0.8%Trump average: 0.3%0\u20132201020112012201320142015201620172018By The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsThen there\u2019s the matter of the seemingly stellar second-quarter increase in gross domestic product of 4.1 percent. That also requires context. For one thing, quarterly numbers can be volatile, and the most recent figure includes an unusual number of special factors.Another one-time event propping up growth is the rush by farmers to export more soybeans, particularly to China, before July 6, the date when tariffs on soybeans went into effect. That accounted for about 0.6 percent of the growth in the second quarter, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm.Without these extraordinary interventions, the underlying rate of economic expansion in the second quarter of this year was about 2.7 percent, according to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal policy research and advocacy group.That\u2019s the key lesson from all these numbers: Whatever claims Mr. Trump may make about the economy as the midterm elections approach, most Americans have yet to experience any improvement in their economic well-being. And there\u2019s little sign of that sorry situation changing. In fact, it could even get worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018A Wound to the Heart of Genoa\u2019: Italy Buries Victims of Bridge Collapse", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy mourned those killed in the collapse of a bridge in the northern city of Genoa with a state funeral on Saturday as the country struggled to come to terms with a tragedy that government officials, families of victims and some experts say could have been prevented. But some families of the victims boycotted the event.Flags flew at half-staff across the country on a day of national mourning. Stores shut their doors or draped black ribbons on their windows. And a solemn ceremony was held in Genoa for 19 of the victims of the Aug. 14 collapse.The death toll rose to 40 on Saturday when one of the 10 wounded people still in hospital died and another victim was found, according to local officials. At least three people are still missing and a car matching the description of their vehicle was discovered on Saturday morning. But no bodies were found with the car.\u201cThe wound is deep, created above all by the boundless pain for those who have lost their lives and for the missing, for their family members, the injured, the many who have lost their homes,\u201d he said.The ceremony, which was broadcast live on Italian television, was interrupted by applause when Cardinal Bagnasco read the first name of each confirmed victim. Most were Italian, but others were Albanian, Chilean or French.Dozens of firefighters attended the ceremony, and they were met with applause and handshakes, an acknowledgment of their tireless efforts \u2014 more than 100 uninterrupted hours so far \u2014 to the dead and help the wounded.The funeral followed the Roman Catholic ritual, but the families of two Muslim victims attended and an imam led a prayer after the Catholic rite.He prayed that \u201cour Genoa,\u201d \u201cbeautiful Genoa,\u201d would be able to lift itself up.Cardinal Bagnasco spoke of suffering and the solidarity that the city had shown and received.\u201cThe highway that collapsed, as is known, was not just an important piece of highway, but a necessary route for the daily life of many, an essential artery for the development of the city,\u201d the cardinal said.He urged the city not to give up.\u201cWe can build new bridges and walk together,\u201d he said.In contrast, tempers flared on Friday in Torre del Greco, near Naples, at the funeral of four young men. The four friends in their 20s died on their way to Barcelona, Spain.But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not right to die because of negligence, carelessness, irresponsibility, superficiality, bureaucracy or boredom.\u201dOutside the church, friends of the young men hoisted a bedsheet scrawled with a condemnation: \u201cThere is no forgiveness without justice.\u201dCalling the deaths \u201cabsurd,\u201d he told reporters that he would not rest until those responsible for the collapse of the bridge were found.Another person listed among the missing had contacted relatives, the official said, calling it \u201cthe only good news.\u201dLuca Cari, a spokesman for Italy\u2019s firefighters, said that their work would continue until all the rubble has been cleared. Only then would they be certain that no one else had been killed by falling debris.Some of Italy\u2019s top officials, including President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, also attended the state funeral on Saturday.Before the ceremony, Mr. Mattarella spoke to the families of the victims, huddled along a line of dark coffins. At the center was the small, white coffin of Samuele Robbiano, 8, who died with his parents on the way to catch a ferry to Sardinia.\u201cThis tragedy that involved our entire country is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Mattarella said after the funeral. He added that he had pledged to support the families of the victims, the injured and the homeless; to find the causes of the collapse \u201crigorously and quickly\u201d and to ensure the safety of Italy\u2019s roads and transportation.Though Saturday was meant to be a day of mourning, hostilities continued between the government and Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, which had been responsible for maintaining the highway that included the Genoa bridge.The government started a formal procedure to revoke the concession held by Autostrade.A government statement said that it held Autostrade responsible for the \u201cgrave disaster\u201d because it had the \u201cobligation to look after the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the highway.\u201d The government said Autostrade had 15 days to present its defense.In their first public appearance since the collapse, the company\u2019s top executives pledged to build a new bridge in record time, and said that funds had been set aside to assist the families of the victims.\u201cWe will do whatever we can to alleviate their suffering, and also that of Genoa, which was wounded,\u201d Fabio Cerchiai, Autostrade\u2019s chairman, said during a televised news conference.Giovanni Castellucci, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Autostrade felt for the victims and their families and would cooperate with an investigation, but stopped short of accepting responsibility for the collapse.\u201cThe bridge,\u201d he noted, \u201cwas considered safe for good reasons, but something happened, that\u2019s clear.\u201dThe company said it was willing to build a new steel bridge at the site, in about eight months, and that Autostrade was already at work on a project, \u201cto give a response to the needs of the city.\u201d\u201cWe know we can give much and do much for Genoa,\u201d Mr. Castellucci said. \u201cWe are here.\u201dBut Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister, rejected the company\u2019s overtures, writing on Facebook that the government \u2014 which on Saturday allocated more than $32 million to the city in emergency funds \u2014 \u201cwon\u2019t accept charity from Autostrade.\u201d\u201cWe demand credible compensation, and there won\u2019t be any trade off,\u201d he wrote. \u201cApologies don\u2019t help much and there is no way to alleviate the suffering of a city destroyed by grief.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Follow the Money (Then Take a Picture)", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "With \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d the filmmaker Lauren Greenfield looks back at 30 years of chronicling the rich \u2014 and predicting our cultural future.Supported byPerhaps because she has spent her career watching the rich, the photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield is herself rich to watch. At a party after the New York premiere of her new documentary \u2014 \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d about the perils of capitalism \u2014 Ms. Greenfield was wired, welcoming and constantly working. She snapped pictures of the well-heeled crowd as she hugged her way around the room, occasionally misplacing a glass of white wine, in a churn of compliments and gossip.Ms. Greenfield, 52, paused to note that one prominent guest had left the festivities early: Jacqueline Siegel, the star of her best-known documentary, \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d about the construction of a $100 million house amid last decade\u2019s financial crisis. Ms. Greenfield observed that in the intervening years, Ms. Siegel\u2019s bosom seemed to have grown inexplicably, much like the national economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said, \u201cfor the excess of the new American dream.\u201d (Through a spokesman, Ms. Siegel, a self-professed patron of cosmetic procedures, denied that she has recently augmented her breasts.)Over the last 30 years, Ms. Greenfield has become America\u2019s foremost visual chronicler of the plutocracy, and those who hope to join its ranks. Her ultra-saturated, up-close, unsparing images have appeared in the pages of The New York Times Magazine, GQ and The New Yorker, as well as museum exhibitions and theatrical documentaries. Ms. Greenfield\u2019s lens has fallen on affluent teens playing hooky, rappers and the strippers they shower $100 bills on, investors in exile, hedge-funders in denial, Iceland\u2019s teetering banking system, abandoned mansions in Dubai and countless other icons of the world\u2019s mounting financial inequality.In an interview in July, Ms. Greenfield noted that critics have occasionally dismissed her work as marginal. And yet her fascination with materialism has often placed her ahead of the cultural curve. In 1992, she photographed bored teenagers at a fancy Los Angeles school dance; two of them were the then-unknown Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. In 2007, Ms. Greenfield began work that eventually led to \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d putting her in an ideal position to document the global housing crash.Even the election of a reality-show celebrity as commander-in-chief is a \u201cweird validation of what I\u2019ve been looking at and why it\u2019s important,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cWhen Kim Kardashian was photographed with Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d she added, referring to an Oval Office meeting that took place in May, \u201cit looked like it could have been an ad for my movie.\u201dArriving in theaters nationwide on Aug. 3, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is a 105-minute collage of a documentary that weaves together still images, news clips, original interviews and footage of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s own family. It argues that the unceasing pursuit of fame and fortune has \u201cbecome the new American dream\u201d (it\u2019s a favorite phrase), replacing the Horatio Alger allegory of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.Ms. Greenfield is well aware that she didn\u2019t invent this notion. In a gold-hued, 503-page monograph also titled \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d that Phaidon published in 2017, Ms. Greenfield quotes the writer Fran Lebowitz: \u201cOh please, Americans do not hate the rich; they want to be them. Every American believes that they are the impending rich, and that will never change.\u201dMs. Greenfield began work on the documentary in 2014 after performing \u201can archaeological dig into my own work\u201d \u2014 re-examining more than 500,000 images and 650 hours of audio/video footage archived at her Venice, Calif., home. She and her husband-slash-co-producer, Frank Evers, pitched the project to Amazon Studios. \u201cLauren had all of this material, so they saw a through line from the Reagan \u201980s to Trump, with her as our narrator and guide,\u201d Mr. Evers said.Amazon turned out to be a cosmically appropriate partner. On the same day that \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d had its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in July, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, became \u201cthe richest man in modern history,\u201d according to Bloomberg, with an estimated net worth of $150 billion.Ms. Greenfield herself isn\u2019t particularly rich, and she seems determined not to absorb the aspirational codes she has spent her life decrypting. Over lunch in July at Freds, the restaurant on the top floor of Barneys New York (not her idea, she\u2019d like to note), she ordered a salad with canned tuna in lieu of fresh. She dressed straightforwardly in a black T-shirt, her Gucci eyeglasses the only suggestion of status. When her salad arrived, Ms. Greenfield apologized and used her fingers to flick a garnish of raw onions directly onto the table.She had brought her Canon camera, which she plunked down next to her plate; a luxury department store is basically her Serengeti. But she decided not to photograph anyone that day. She hadn\u2019t gotten permission, so the security guards would have likely intervened. Despite being a sly documentarian of strangers at times, Ms. Greenfield doesn\u2019t easily fade into the background. With her minimalist black wardrobe, giant smile and short stature, she\u2019s like a version of her profession out of \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d: a slightly glamorous, vaguely academic photographer-mom.Ms. Greenfield grew up in communes on the West Side of Los Angeles. Her mother, a psychologist, leaned into the counterculture of the 1970s, joining an \u201ceating collective\u201d and refusing to buy Ms. Greenfield brand-name clothes. She appears in \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d telling her daughter, \u201cThe things you didn\u2019t have were the things that I didn\u2019t believe in.\u201dWhat the family valued was education, and when Ms. Greenfield was in the 11th grade, she enrolled at the private Crossroads School in nearby Santa Monica, where she befriended some of the city\u2019s wealthiest teens. That ignited her obsession with \u201cmaterialism and class,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my parents had rejected it so much.\u201dIn 1983, Ms. Greenfield matriculated at Harvard, where her parents had studied, and where she encountered both Mr. Evers and a student body of immense privilege. While traveling around the world her junior year, studying film and anthropology, Ms. Greenfield met the pioneering French photographer Jean Rouch, who is credited with helping invent the style known as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and after returning to Cambridge she changed her major to visual studies.Ms. Greenfield then trained under Barbara Norfleet, who in the mid-1980s released \u201cAll the Right People,\u201d a book of reportage photography focusing on East Coast elites. At the time, such creatures would mostly appear in staged portraits or respectfully edited party pictures, but Ms. Norfleet wanted to capture them and their rituals in the wild. \u201cI realized the rich were, in many ways, this undercover group,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s hugely important, because they have so much influence.\u201dEncouraged by Mr. Evers, who had been hired at Columbia Pictures, Ms. Greenfield applied to film schools a few years after graduation, but she wasn\u2019t admitted anywhere. She concentrated on still photography, earning assignments with National Geographic. Her first project, about a Mayan tribe in Mexico that her mother was studying, was spiked. But after rereading \u201cLess Than Zero,\u201d Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s 1985 novel of California excess, she pursued an idea about her own native culture: a portfolio chronicling Crossroads and other deluxe schools, where students attended five-figure bar mitzvahs, drove Range Rovers and cavorted with celebrity progeny like Kate Hudson.Ms. Greenfield turned the resulting images into her first monograph, \u201cFast Forward,\u201d which earned her gallery representation and the attention of magazine photo editors. She traveled to the wealthy suburb of Edina, Minn., to record popular cliques enamored with Abercrombie & Fitch; and to Milan, where white teenage boys had co-opted the bandannas, baggy jeans and aesthetics of American gang culture. One fellow photographer told Ms. Greenfield that she ran the risk of pigeonholing herself, but she ultimately decided to \u201ckeep peeling back that onion,\u201d she said.Her pictures, relying on candy colors, awkward compositions and voyeuristic access, synced with the work of other rising photographers in the 1990s, including David LaChapelle and, a bit later on, Ryan McGinley. They also drew the attention of Sheila Nevins, the former HBO documentary president. In 2002, she hired Ms. Greenfield to make her first feature-length film, \u201cThin,\u201d an unrelenting account of four patients at an eating-disorder treatment center in Coconut Creek, Fla.To call any of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s portrayals flattering would be inaccurate. (Ms. Siegel\u2019s husband sued the director for defamation after the \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, but the director won $750,000 in legal fees after an arbitrator ruled that everything in the film was true.) And she seems to have a knack for convincing people to be radically, unappealingly honest. Her subjects must find that cathartic. Many have agreed to sit with her repeatedly over the years, including for \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d and Ms. Greenfield has stayed close with several of them, even those she\u2019s captured in harsh light.One of them, a Las Vegas party host named Tiffany Masters, flew to New York to attend the \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d premiere. Sipping an espresso martini at the after-party, she described how Ms. Greenfield has caught her in various unfavorable ways: in the act of pulling her skirt down, for example, or recording a fatty \u201cflap over the bra.\u201d Nonetheless, Ms. Masters said, she doesn\u2019t fault the artist. \u201cLauren has the ability to shoot the truth,\u201d she said.Long pause. \u201cNo.\u201dWhy not?Another long pause. \u201cThey\u2019re unfiltered,\u201d Ms. Masters said. \u201cThey\u2019re raw. They\u2019re uncensored. But they\u2019re human.\u201dMs. Greenfield joined the ranks of prominent documentarians in 2012, after \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d grossed $2.4 million in ticket sales. The movie centered on Ms. Siegel and her husband, David, a time-share tycoon, as they attempted to build one of the largest houses in America. During filming, the couple halted construction when Mr. Siegel became a victim of the real estate bubble. \u201cHe\u2019s been to Donald Trump\u2019s office a couple of times trying to get help,\u201d Mr. Siegel\u2019s son says in the movie. In \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d Ms. Siegel returns to claim she once dated Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the one percent for their own sake,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we\u2019re all engaged, like Jackie and David, in wanting a little bit more.\u201d Ms. Greenfield is convinced that few people learned their lesson in the 2008 crisis, and she has spent a decade worrying about a modern-day version of the Fall of Rome. In the film, Chris Hedges, a former New York Times journalist, warns that \u201csocieties accrue their greatest wealth at the moment they face death.\u201dRather than lampoon the rich, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d attempts to examine how avarice has destroyed lives across economic strata. The film intercuts a history of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s career with the stories of more than a dozen characters, as they reveal in broad strokes the ways in which the desire for more (money, beauty, attention, success) has tainted society. There\u2019s an Icelandic fisherman who becomes a banker and installs a waterfall in his home, only for the country\u2019s economic collapse to send him back to the seas; an adviser who charges outrageous sums to teach aspirational Chinese how to pronounce luxury brand names in English; an adult film actress, once paid $30,000 by Charlie Sheen, who\u2019s had three nose jobs in attempt to escape her past. Much of the footage is wealth porn. Some is actual porn.Another character, Florian Homm, sobs on camera about the ways greed isn\u2019t good. (A former financier, he was accused of defrauding his investors, causing $200 million in losses, and was wanted by the F.B.I.) \u201cIt\u2019s light finance, with heavy repercussions,\u201d Mr. Homm said in an interview. \u201cBut Lauren leaves the viewer to make their own assessments.\u201dAfter \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, one of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s Harvard film professors, Robb Moss, told her that all of her work \u201cwas actually about addiction.\u201d But an inherent challenge in chronicling any form of addiction is the risk of glorifying it. If \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is Ms. Greenfield\u2019s effort to decry incessant capitalism, it also puts the behavior on a podium.Her editors encouraged Ms. Greenfield to add her own story to the film. She interviewed her parents and her two teenage sons, Noah and Gabriel, about her own compulsion: working too much. The \u201cgeneration\u201d in the title is a reference to these scenes, which tie the movie together and provide emotional heft. Ms. Greenfield, who often interviews her subjects for hours at a time, doesn\u2019t shy from emotional inquiries into her own inadequacies as a mother. In one clip, a 16-year-old Noah tells Ms. Greenfield that because she was so often away on assignments, Mr. Evers did the bulk of raising him, and that \u201cthe damage has already been done.\u201dBoth Mr. Evers and Ms. Greenfield were initially reluctant to include her story in the film. \u201cBut Lauren realized that she herself was very much a part of this wealth culture,\u201d Mr. Evers said. \u201cShe wanted audiences to realize they were complicit, too.\u201d Ms. Greenfield became more comfortable with appearing in her own work after trying it in a 2014 ad she created for the feminine-care brand Always. The spot featured the director interviewing children about gender stereotypes, showing how the phrase \u201clike a girl\u201d \u2014 as in \u201crun like a girl\u201d or \u201cfight like a girl\u201d \u2014 transforms into an insult as kids age. The campaign has become Ms. Greenfield\u2019s most-watched product, after airing during the 2015 Super Bowl and amassing more than 200 million views.\u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d which Ms. Greenfield has also turned into a traveling museum exhibition, doubles as a retrospective and a farewell to her focus on still photography. \u201cPrint is dying,\u201d she said, and magazines are commissioning fewer shoots, unable to finance the weeks of travel that her style of reportage requires. In the future, she said, she will concentrate on documentaries. Her next project is with Showtime; Ms. Greenfield would reveal only that it is set in Asia.Her current film ends with a dose of unexpected brightness, returning to characters who have forsaken their love of money for actual, human love. But ultimately, the takeaway from Ms. Greenfield\u2019s decades of work seems to be that it\u2019s up to future generations to decide how to spend their money \u2014 and if you ask her son Noah for his take, the kids are not all right.\u201cThat\u2019s what I realized from the film,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are spending like nobody cares, and that\u2019s exactly how it was in 2008.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now they are a striking symbol of a strong economy.The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma fell to 5.1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported Friday, the lowest since the government began collecting data on such workers in 1992. At the economy\u2019s nadir in the summer of 2009, the unemployment rate for high school dropouts hit 15.6 percent, more than three times the peak unemployment rate for college graduates.Buffeted by technological change and seemingly out of place in an economy where skills and credentials are in ever more demand, this cohort struggled while more educated workers scored jobs and promotions and rose on the economic ladder.High school dropouts make up 7.2 percent of the labor force, and some experts doubted they and other low-skilled workers would ever fully recover from the effects of the recession, said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.\u201cAs economists, we worried these workers would be shut out forever,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the long duration of the recovery has pulled them back in. As the economy adds more jobs, employers have had to dig a little deeper.\u201dUnemployment among the least educated, the group hit hardest in the recession, has been cut by two-thirds since its peak of almost 16 percent in 2010.16%1412Less thanhigh school10865.1%422.2%Bachelor\u2019s degreeor higher0\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u20191816%14Less than high school1210865.1%Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher422.2%0\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics | By The New York TimesThe improvement in the fortunes of less-educated workers was a highlight in a jobs report that showed continuing gains across a broad variety of sectors.Over all in July, employers increased payrolls by 157,000, while the unemployment rate edged downward to 3.9 percent, near the 18-year low achieved in May.The data echoed other positive economic news recently, including a report last week showing the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter.And the headlines about President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum and a widening trade war with China seem to have done little to put a damper on hiring. The manufacturing sector, which is particularly sensitive to exports, was robust, adding 37,000 jobs.Although the payroll increase in July was slightly below what Wall Street was expecting, upward revisions for May and June alleviated fears of a slowdown.Other indicators suggest the recovery is finally extending its reach. The Labor Department\u2019s broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time positions are unavailable, fell to 7.5 percent in July, the lowest since 2001.All this has translated into better economic opportunities for workers without a college degree, who account for a majority of the work force. It is a contingent that was championed by Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign, and one that both parties want to appeal to in the midterm elections in November.The White House was quick to note that the economy is in the midst of the longest monthly streak of job growth in history.And after 94 consecutive months of job creation, bosses and human resource departments are recalibrating their requirements.\u201cYou definitely get the sense that employers are willing to look at workers they haven\u2019t looked at in the past,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed.com, the employment website.Unemployed Americans who might not have put feelers out in the past are also venturing back into the hunt for a job, she said. On Indeed\u2019s search engine, much of the growth in queries lately has been for positions like full-time cashier, mobile home park manager, maintenance person and fulfillment associate.\u201cThis is an indicator that low-skilled workers are seeing opportunities for themselves in the labor market,\u201d Ms. Gimbel said.Until recently at Steel Ceilings in Johnstown, Ohio, the company\u2019s president, Rick Sandor, insisted on a couple of years\u2019 experience in metal fabrication before considering applicants. But he\u2019s had a harder time lately finding workers for his company, where shifts run from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. and temporary positions start at $14 per hour.He now settles for candidates who show mechanical skills, like carpentry or heating and cooling repair. Mr. Sandor is willing to waive the requirement for a high school diploma as well and has even hired applicants with what he terms \u201cminor\u201d prison sentences.\u201cIf a person was truly trying to get their life back together, we thought it would be helpful to offer them a job,\u201d he said.Unemployment for less-skilled workers has been dropping for several years, with a pickup in hiring in sectors like manufacturing, construction and parts of health care. And to be sure, the month-to-month figures for unemployment among high school dropouts are volatile.But the long-term trend is clear, as is hiring among the sectors responsible for it. Last month, the leisure and hospitality field recorded a 40,000 gain in positions, with half of that coming from restaurants.For example, Buffalo Wings & Rings, a restaurant chain with 60 locations in 13 states, has been stepping up hiring and opening new restaurants.Many outlets have seen double-digit sales growth over the past year, and some are up as much as 40 percent, said Nader Masadeh, the company\u2019s chief executive. The tax cuts that took effect in January are playing a role, Mr. Masadeh said \u2014 most families may have gotten a relatively small tax cut, but it is enough to fuel a few more nights out.\u201cPeople feel good. They\u2019re going out and spending more money,\u201d he said. \u201cIn our segment, $50 feeds you and your family.\u201dStill, the hot economy brings challenges of its own. At an annual gathering of the company\u2019s franchisees in June, Mr. Masadeh said, he was bombarded with questions about how to retain talent when workers can readily walk out the door and find another job. And costs are rising throughout his business.\u201cRight now the economy is great, but we\u2019re also seeing higher construction costs, higher commodity items, shortages of labor, so there\u2019s always something that counterbalances something else,\u201d he said.That pressure, however, has not resulted in much fatter paychecks for most workers. The Labor Department said average hourly earnings ticked modestly higher in July, putting the annual rise at 2.7 percent. That\u2019s below the pace of inflation in recent months.One reason for the lack of big raises is that a substantial number of workers remain on the sidelines, including the less-skilled ones who are now gradually coming back, said Simona Mocuta, senior economist with State Street Global Advisors.\u201cWe are bringing unemployment way below 4.5 percent, which the Fed considers full employment,\u201d Ms. Mocuta said. \u201cBut we are getting very modest wage inflation. This is an issue not just for the U.S., but in every other developed market.\u201d\u201cBecause the labor market is tight, less-educated workers have more of a chance of getting hired,\u201d she added. \u201cFor people with the highest level of education, it\u2019s easier to find jobs even when the economy isn\u2019t doing well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Gird for House Battle as Ohio and Kansas Races Remain Close", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlarmed by the tight race for a congressional seat in Ohio, Republicans are steeling for a 90-day campaign of trench warfare as they fight to keep control of the House, pinning their hopes on well-funded outside groups and a slashing negative message about Democrats.Voting across the Midwest and West laid bare the party\u2019s precarious situation on Wednesday: Ohio\u2019s special election exposed deep vulnerabilities in the historically conservative suburbs of Columbus, and the Republican candidate there held a slim lead over his Democratic challenger.In Kansas, a nomination fight for governor also remained too close to call the day after the primary, with a hard-right candidate threatening to topple the state\u2019s Republican incumbent and splinter the party down ballot.And in primaries from suburban Detroit to Seattle, Democrats selected hard-charging candidates in districts long held by the Republican Party.Republicans say they can keep a thin grip on the House by propping up incumbent lawmakers in red-tinged districts and branding the Democrats as wildly left-wing. But senior party strategists have concluded that over a dozen districts held by Republicans may already be unwinnable, most in metropolitan areas where President Trump has alienated moderates and stirred volcanic resistance on the left.\u201cEvery white, suburban district in the country will be a swing district in November, that\u2019s the takeaway\u201d from the Ohio election, said Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who is being targeted by Democrats.The Republicans can afford to lose only 22 seats over all to maintain even a one-seat majority. That leaves them with little room for error over the remaining three months of the campaign.See full results and maps from the Kansas primaries.Veteran party lawmakers have an increasingly bleak view of their prospects in the House, and some fear that Democrats could seize the chamber by a solid margin.\u201cThere\u2019s a real likelihood that they not only win the House, but they win it by 10 or 12 more seats than they need,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, voicing publicly what many Republican officials have begun to acknowledge privately this summer.Mr. Graham said a Democratic takeover was no sure thing, noting that \u201cin the era of Trump, things can change in 24 hours, for good or bad.\u201d But he said any Republican in a remotely competitive district could face a difficult general election. \u201cWe\u2019re bleeding among women and the enthusiasm factor for Democrats is worth 7 or 8 points, and sometimes more,\u201d he said, using political jargon to describe just how deep into Republican territory the battlefield might stretch.\u201cIf I was a House guy in an R+10 or less seat I\u2019d be getting on the phone and raising money and putting a sign on my dog.\u201dIn Kansas, Republicans faced uncertainty Wednesday not only about their candidate for governor this fall, but also whether they were creating a political opportunity for Democrats to win the office in November. Should the party ultimately nominate Kris W. Kobach, its hard-right candidate for governor, it could also undermine Republicans in congressional races down ballot.In Ohio, the Republican candidate for Congress, Troy Balderson, was ahead by 1,754 votes out of more than 202,000 ballots cast \u2014 a lead of nearly 1 percentage point. But 3,435 provisional ballots have yet to be counted. Ohio law provides for an automatic recount if the two candidates are ultimately separated by less than half a percentage point.The Democratic candidate in Ohio, Danny O\u2019Connor, has not conceded the race \u2014 he called it \u201ca tied ballgame\u201d on Tuesday night \u2014 and is set to face Mr. Balderson again in the November general election.Illustrating the aggressive approach the Republican Party is taking to reinforcing its candidates in conservative-leaning districts, the Congressional Leadership Fund, the principal \u201csuper PAC\u201d dedicated to House Republicans, has already begun airing attack ads against Democratic challengers in three traditionally red seats in Kansas, Kentucky and upstate New York. Mr. Trump carried all three districts in 2016 but Democrats are pursuing all of them ferociously.Corry Bliss, the group\u2019s chief strategist, said Republicans needed to wage a national campaign to disqualify Democrats as a political alternative in the eyes of voters.\u201cThis is a tough environment and we have to give voters a choice in November,\u201d Mr. Bliss said. \u201cOne party has cut your taxes and helped create the best economy in decades. The other party says: \u2018We will raise taxes, we will abolish ICE and we will put Nancy Pelosi in charge of it all.\u2019\u201dBut Mr. Bliss also sent a stern message to lawmakers in his own party who may not be bracing adequately for a fall onslaught by Democrats. The Congressional Leadership Fund spent millions of dollars in Ohio to salvage the campaign of Mr. Balderson.While Republicans are expected to hold a financial advantage in the fall campaign over all, the party is unlikely to be able to fund similarly expensive rescue missions in dozens of vulnerable districts \u2014 many of which have more forbidding demographics than the Ohio seat.\u201cWe have to have members who raise money, run good campaigns and provide a good contrast for November,\u201d Mr. Bliss warned.What alarms Congressional Republicans, though, is what is out of their hands \u2014 not just Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct but also some of the controversial candidates leading their tickets. In addition to Kansas, should Mr. Kobach prevail, House Republicans are burdened with unpopular standard-bearers in Illinois (Gov. Bruce Rauner) and Virginia (a Senate candidate, Corey Stewart) who together could drag down at least a half-dozen lawmakers.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.In the Ohio race, some former Republican loyalists defected to Mr. O\u2019Connor while other right-of-center voters may simply have stayed home, producing a close outcome in a lopsidedly Republican area. Mr. Balderson may have prevailed because just enough conservative voters remain satisfied enough with Mr. Trump.\u201cI wish he would quit tweeting at night, but I think he has made a lot of changes that people voted for him to do,\u201d said David Haid, 70, who operates oil and gas wells in Ohio.But voters like Mr. Haid are less plentiful in many other suburban districts. And in Ohio, Jennifer Kramer, a small-business owner, gave voice to the unease of women in these areas who have recoiled most sharply from the president.\u201cI don\u2019t feel things are better now because of the divisiveness,\u201d said Ms. Kramer, 42, blaming Mr. Trump for sowing discord. \u201cYou have people who feel they can be more vocal about their hatred. Trump is not the type of leader I respect.\u201dThe Ohio results were not the only ominous signal for Republicans on Tuesday night. The party\u2019s suburban slump showed up in districts far beyond Ohio.In Washington State, where candidates from all parties compete in nonpartisan open-primary elections, Republican candidates posted limp results in three congressional districts, including an open seat in the Seattle suburbs and the seat in Eastern Washington held by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republicans\u2019 leadership team in the House.And in a sign that they are already preparing for substantial losses, Republican officials are contemplating political triage, weighing which districts may be beyond hope and determining where money can be saved.Among the seats that Republicans see slipping out of reach are those held by Representatives Rod Blum of Iowa and Jason Lewis of Minnesota, along with more than half a dozen open seats currently held by Republicans in New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania and Arizona.The news may imperil Mr. Collins\u2019s seat, in a development the party can ill afford. More broadly, the specter of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal supporters being arrested on insider trading charges may hand Democrats an opportunity to tar the Republican majority as corrupt.Democrats, for their part, appear increasingly emboldened even in districts tilting well to the right of center. In Ohio alone, three or four other Republican-held seats could be up for grabs in November, if the political dynamics of the moment hold for the next few months.And Democrats see the same political sluggishness, on the part of a number of Republican incumbents, that has G.O.P. strategists so anxious about the general election.Ken Harbaugh, a Democrat and former Navy pilot seeking a solidly Republican seat in Northeast Ohio, said voters in his area sensed the disengagement of the sitting lawmaker there, Bob Gibbs, a Republican in his fourth term. Mr. Harbaugh is running on some of the same themes \u2014 championing affordable health care and attacking entrenched politicians in Washington \u2014 that Mr. O\u2019Connor put at the center of his campaign.\u201cThe story writes itself when you\u2019ve got an incumbent who\u2019s never gotten a bill passed into law, who hasn\u2019t looked his constituents in the eye in years, hasn\u2019t done a real town hall in years,\u201d Mr. Harbaugh said Wednesday morning. \u201cAnd people are sick and tired of paying someone to do nothing.\u201dMr. Harbaugh pointed to the special election as a sign that voters in Ohio are hungry for change and focused on health care most of all. \u201cThey are just sick and tired of a political class that isn\u2019t working for them,\u201d he said.Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Topeka, Kansas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Reaches Revised Trade Deal With Mexico, Threatening to Leave Out Canada", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Monday that the United States and Mexico had reached an accord to revise key portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and would finalize it within days, suggesting he was ready to jettison Canada from the trilateral trade pact if the country did not get on board quickly.Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump promoted the preliminary agreement with Mexico as a deal that could replace Nafta and threatened to hit Canada with auto tariffs if it did not \u201cnegotiate fairly.\u201d\u201cThey used to call it Nafta,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement,\u201d adding that the term Nafta \u2014 which he has called the \u201cworst\u201d trade deal in history \u2014 had \u201ca bad connotation\u201d for the United States.Yet while Mr. Trump may try to change the name, the agreement reached with Mexico is simply a revised Nafta, with updates to provisions surrounding the digital economy, automobiles, agriculture and labor unions. The core of the trade pact \u2014 which allows American companies to operate in Mexico and Canada without tariffs \u2014 remains intact.Now, the question becomes whether a trilateral pact becomes a bilateral deal \u2014 or Mr. Trump\u2019s threats pressure Canada to return to the negotiating table and accede to many of the United States\u2019 demands.The president\u2019s apparent willingness to move on without Canada prompted confusion and concern among lawmakers \u2014 who said it may not be legally permissible, let alone smart \u2014 and businesses whose supply chains depend on a deal encompassing all three countries.\u201cBecause of the massive amount of movement of goods between the three countries and the integration of operations which make manufacturing in our country more competitive, it is imperative that a trilateral agreement be inked,\u201d Jay Timmons, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement.Mexican officials said on Monday that they wanted to have Canada back in the process and were working toward a trilateral deal by the end of the week. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, who joined the White House announcement via phone, said, \u201cIt is our wish, Mr. President, that now Canada will also be able to be incorporated in all this.\u201dBut later in the day, Luis Videgaray Caso, Mexico\u2019s foreign minister, signaled that Mexico might be willing to move forward without Canada.\u201cThere are things that we don\u2019t control, particularly the political relationship between Canada and the U.S., and we definitely don\u2019t want to expose Mexico to the uncertainty of not having a deal,\u201d Mr. Videgaray said in an interview. \u201cNot having a trade agreement with the U.S., that\u2019s a substantial risk to the Mexican economy. Literally millions of jobs in Mexico depend on access to the U.S. market.\u201dBoth the Mexicans and the Americans have been eager to reach a fully revised deal by the end of August, a date that would give the Trump administration enough time to notify Congress that a deal had been finalized and still have that deal be signed by the outgoing Mexican administration of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\u201cIdeally we\u2019ll have the Canadians involved,\u201d said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, adding that the administration planned to officially inform Congress by Friday of its intent to sign a new deal, a step required before Congress votes on a trade pact. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have Canada involved, we will notify that we have a bilateral agreement that Canada is welcome to join.\u201dChrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, will travel to Washington on Tuesday to continue negotiations, said her spokesman, Adam Austen, on Monday.\u201cWe will only sign a new Nafta that is good for Canada and good for the middle class,\u201d Mr. Austen added. \u201cCanada\u2019s signature is required.\u201dThe revised deal with Mexico makes significant alterations to rules governing automobile manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico. Those changes are being watched carefully by the United States auto industry, which has built its global supply chain around Nafta and expressed concern that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to rewrite it could raise prices of American-made cars and trucks. Automakers like General Motors and Ford have set up plants in Canada and Mexico, and American automakers routinely import car parts from other countries.Under the changes agreed to by Mexico and the United States, car companies would be required to manufacture at least 75 percent of an automobile\u2019s value in North America under the new rules, up from 62.5 percent, to qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs. They will also be required to use more local steel, aluminum and auto parts, and have 40 to 45 percent of the car made by workers earning at least $16 an hour, a boon to both the United States and Canada and a win for labor unions, which have been among Nafta\u2019s biggest critics.\u201cAutomakers urge the U.S. and Mexico to quickly re-engage with Canada to continue to build on this progress,\u201d the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, which represents most carmakers that sell vehicles in the United States, said in a statement. \u201cThe industry is hopeful that any changes to Nafta auto rules of origin continue to strike the right balance by incentivizing production and investment in North America while keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans.\u201dIn a briefing Monday, administration officials said the United States and Mexico had also reached an agreement over a \u201csunset clause,\u201d proposed by the Trump administration, that would cause Nafta to automatically expire unless the three countries voted to extend it.The two countries agreed to a review of the trade pact every six years that would extend its lifetime for 16 more years, officials said. That longer time horizon would give lawmakers a chance to review the pact\u2019s progress, while giving businesses certainty for the near future.The countries also agreed to limit the kinds of legal challenges that investors can make against foreign governments under Nafta. The oil and gas, infrastructure, energy generation and telecom industries are exempted from these more restrictive rules, and will operate under the previous terms, Mr. Lighthizer said \u2014 a win for those industries.One contentious issue that remains unresolved is whether the administration will exempt Mexico from its steel and aluminum tariffs. Mr. Trump hit Mexico, along with Canada, the European Union and other nations, with 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum, in part to force concessions on other trade issues. Mexican officials said they expected the tariffs to be addressed down the road.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was necessary to address them now,\u201d Mr. Videgaray said. \u201cWe\u2019d like those to be addressed alongside Canada. It would be great if we could have a trilateral agreement on lifting those and our retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\u201dAny agreement that does not involve Canada is likely to face legal challenges and intense opposition from Congress, which had granted the Trump administration authority to renegotiate Nafta as a trilateral deal.\u201cNafta is a trilateral agreement. It requires legislation and a change to Nafta requires legislation,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cI\u2019ve told them any change has to go through Congress. There is not necessarily complete agreement about that.\u201dSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said no one \u201cis envisioning\u201d a revised Nafta that does not include Canada.\u201cModernizing it is a good thing, but I hope the president takes whatever agreement he has with Mexico and gets one properly with Canada and we get back to business,\u201d Mr. Alexander said.Industry groups also said a final agreement must include Canada.\u201cComing to terms with Mexico is an encouraging sign, but threatening to pull out of the existing agreement is not,\u201d said Matthew Shay, the chief executive of the National Retail Federation. \u201cThe administration must bring Canada, an essential trading partner, back to the bargaining table and deliver a trilateral deal.\u201dThe president, flanked by advisers including Mr. Lighthizer and Jared Kushner, hailed the preliminary agreement as \u201ca big day for our country,\u201d adding that \u201cmany people\u201d had thought that no one could make a deal with Mexico.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who has at times exchanged harsh words with Mr. Trump as the two countries have squabbled over Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed wall along their border, added a moment of praise on Monday.\u201cI recognize your political will,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said, \u201cand your participation in this.\u201dCatie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Carrier, the Factory Trump Saved, Morale Is Through the Floor", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "Twenty months after the president-elect reached a deal to keep blue-collar jobs from leaving the country, absenteeism plagues the Indiana plant.Supported byBy the time the sun comes up, Nicole Hargrove knows if it\u2019ll be a struggle to meet her quota at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis. Six days a week, she\u2019s on the assembly line by 6 a.m., when a buzzer sounds and starts a shift that is supposed to conclude with 1,100 newly built units. But lately, the line sometimes grinds to a premature halt, as supervisors wait for employees to straggle in \u2014 or give up and pull people off forklifts to fill in for no-shows. At the end of shifts like that, Ms. Hargrove and the others who bothered to come in have only 800 furnaces to show for their efforts.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t coming to work, which is sad because we really need these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for 15 years. \u201cThey had a chance to prove that staying was good, but this is ruining it for everybody. It\u2019s killing us. It\u2019s pushing us out the door that much sooner.\u201dWhat\u2019s ailing Carrier isn\u2019t weak demand. Furnace sales are strong, and managers have increased overtime and even recalled 150 previously laid-off workers. Instead, employees share a looming sense that a factory shutdown is inevitable \u2014 that Carrier has merely postponed the closing until a more politically opportune moment.In some ways, the situation is a metaphor for blue-collar work and life in the United States today. Paychecks are a tad fatter and the economic picture has brightened slightly, but no one feels particularly secure or hopeful.\u201cPeople still don\u2019t trust Carrier,\u201d said Paul Roell, a group leader who has worked at the plant for 19 years. \u201cThey still have the warehouses and the factory in Mexico, and they can move down whenever. We all know that Carrier has the money to do whatever they want.\u201dSeveral times in late July and early August, so many workers were missing that the furnace line had to shut down in midday \u2014 even more disruptive than an early-morning halt. That hadn\u2019t happened in years, employees said. Some workers cite illness, while others claim days under the Family and Medical Leave Act, saying they are taking care of sick relatives.On a Facebook page open only to Carrier union members, there have been several posts a week complaining about the absenteeism and occasionally attributing it to abuse of family medical leave. \u201cBoggles my mind that there are complaints about the company shutting down because people aren\u2019t coming to work,\u201d reads one from Aug. 3. \u201cWhen they shut the doors, guess who will be crying the most, the ones who don\u2019t come to work,\u201d says another post, from July 18.Robert James, the president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents Carrier employees, said he had heard about the absenteeism from union members. \u201cNone of us are sure what\u2019s going to happen with Carrier staying, and I don\u2019t know if we will ever be sure again or have a positive attitude towards the company,\u201d he said.On the worst days, according to one group leader, up to one in five workers are out. It\u2019s true that the company has been running the factory hard \u2014 up to 60 hours a week with mandatory overtime, six days in a row \u2014 and some absenteeism could be due to sheer exhaustion, Mr. Roell allowed. But \u201cbad blood,\u201d as he put it, is at least as much to blame. \u201cWorkers feel like Carrier is going to leave,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether we come to work or not.\u201dAccording to Carrier, absenteeism has not increased. In a statement, the company said it was \u201cproud of the great work being done by our Carrier employees at our Indianapolis plant.\u201d Moreover, the company said, \u201cwe recently added a new gas furnace production line and continue to make investments in the facility, including skills training for our employees and product improvements.\u201d Carrier declined to comment further.Mr. Trump made the incident a staple of his stump speeches. In his telling, Carrier was thriving and its factory was profitable, yet it was still planning to send jobs to Mexico \u2014 an injustice that he alone could stop. Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Carrier paid off when industrial workers in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan helped him prevail over Hillary Clinton.One was Robin Maynard. With more than two decades at Carrier, he had enough seniority to avoid the layoffs. In July, I spoke with him and his wife, Candi, at the kitchen table of their 1,350-square-foot home; they recently relocated from a larger place to save money. Mr. Maynard described Mr. Trump\u2019s intervention as a valuable insurance policy. \u201cAs long as Trump is in office,\u201d he said, \u201cI will have a job.\u201dIt\u2019s not just any job, either. At 54, he earns $24.83 an hour, a third more than is typical for most local jobs available to workers without a college degree. Last year, Mr. Maynard earned $55,000 with overtime, enough to give him and his wife a tenuous hold on middle-class life and help their youngest daughter with her college tuition. She hopes to become a pediatrician \u2014 a goal the family can support only as long as Robin Maynard is employed at Carrier. If he were forced to take a lower-paying job at, say, an Indianapolis warehouse, he pointed out, his daughter\u2019s dream wouldn\u2019t come to pass.These days, more than on my previous visits, the Maynards feel anxious about the factory\u2019s future. \u201cHe\u2019ll come home and say, \u2018If people don\u2019t start showing up to work, they\u2019ll close it down,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Maynard said. A former teacher, she had to give up classroom work for health reasons, making the Maynards even more dependent on Carrier.\u201cWe always planned on going on a cruise to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary,\u201d Ms. Maynard said. \u201cInstead, we went to northern Indiana for the weekend in June.\u201dAt Carrier, Mr. Maynard supervises a part of the line where control boards are attached to furnaces, making sure there are enough components and troubleshooting when machines break down. Several times a week, though, one of his 14 workers doesn\u2019t show up, and Mr. Maynard has to cover. He dons a special vest, puts straps on his shoes to prevent sparks, and takes a spot on the line.\u201cThere have been a few days when three people don\u2019t show up and I\u2019ve had to work on the line all day,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cThe attitude, the demeanor \u2014 they\u2019re not grateful that they have a job. The absenteeism is real bad. A lot of us need our jobs. Others look at it and they don\u2019t really care anymore.\u201dThe bad vibes can be catching. \u201cIt makes it so depressing you don\u2019t feel like going in,\u201d he added. \u201cI need the job, but some days you just want it to be over with.\u201dYes, Mr. Hayes said, the company would invest in the Carrier facility, as it had promised Mr. Trump. But those funds were earmarked for automation, and would ultimately mean fewer jobs in Indianapolis, not more. Assembly-line positions there were not ones \u201cthat people really find all that attractive over the long term,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. There were \u201cgreat, great people\u201d there, he added, \u201cbut the skill set to do those jobs is very different than what it takes to assemble a jet engine.\u201d The Carrier faithful didn\u2019t appreciate the slights.Some, like Ms. Hargrove, remain committed to the factory, even if the love doesn\u2019t seem to always be requited from the executive suite. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m hurting and I\u2019m tired but when I walk through that door, I\u2019m going to give 100 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Bible says an honest day\u2019s work for an honest day\u2019s pay, and I try to live by that.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re paying you to do a job,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying you to be happy.\u201d Her work is physically exhausting yet precise. Standing on her feet for the entire shift, Ms. Hargrove inserts tweezer-like strips of metal thousands of times a day into a tube that forms part of the heat exchanger in each furnace.Mr. Roell, the group leader, is also loyal, despite having to fill in frequently on the line. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay until I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said over coffee at the cheerfully retro Oasis Diner, not far from his home in Plainfield, Ind. Mr. Roell, 37, said he was grateful that when he deployed to Kuwait for a year in 2010, as a member of the Indiana National Guard, Carrier made up the shortfall between what he earned at the base and his regular salary at the plant.Something is amiss, though, despite the fact that he\u2019s making $23.88 an hour and last year cleared $70,000 with overtime, a solidly middle-class wage. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy it as much as I used to,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cI used to look forward to doing my job and seeing co-workers. But I don\u2019t have as much trust as I used to.\u201dEven before the closure announcement, he said, supervisors gathered people from the lines and pointed out, ominously, that their counterparts in Mexico missed fewer days. \u201cI\u2019m worried they will use the absenteeism as an excuse to shut the factory,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t doing anything to improve morale.\u201dA few years ago, Carrier would treat workers to a meal before Christmas \u2014 a big spread of Kentucky Fried Chicken mains and sides. Now employees bring most of the food, potluck style. The company contributes only the meat.When Carrier began a round of layoffs in early 2018, Kelli Rowan figured she was senior enough to survive. She had joined the company six years earlier (after losing a job at a nearby Ford factory, which closed), but in the end she was among those let go. \u201cI was depressed, I was so bored,\u201d Ms. Rowan said. \u201cI thought I was too old to find something.\u201d A 56-year-old mother of two, she shook off her funk and began applying for other factory positions.Although statistics suggest that the local economy is booming, few positions that pay more than $15 an hour are available for the laid-off Carrier workers. Nothing Ms. Rowan found came close to her previous pay of $17 an hour plus overtime. Eli Lilly offered $14.50 an hour, while Roche paid $13 and change.Ms. Rowan eventually landed a position scanning documents at an acceptable salary, but it was temporary. And she received just two days off per month, forcing her at one point to work 13 days in a row. So when Ms. Rowan came home one day in June and found a message on her answering machine from the human resources department at Carrier, she immediately returned the call. Like an on-again, off-again boyfriend, Carrier suddenly needed her.Ms. Rowan had to put aside the hurt and rejection, but it was a small price to pay for a union job with full benefits, vacation and the possibility of overtime. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a tough old cookie.\u201dAs fortunate as she feels to go back, Ms. Rowan is like many other blue-collar workers in that her earning power has diminished over time. Her top hourly rate at Ford, where she worked for 18 years, was $28.24 an hour, and with overtime, her annual salary peaked at $86,000. During her best year at Carrier, she earned half that.How long the new job will last is something Ms. Rowan is trying not to think about. Carrier has hired seasonally in the past, adding people in the spring or summer and letting them go by the end of the year.\u201cSome may get laid off in January, just like they got laid off last January,\u201d said Jacque Williams, a former Carrier worker who is determined not to go back. At 56, he has returned to school to earn a certificate as a technician for heating and cooling equipment. The course is being paid for by a federal program called Trade Adjustment Assistance, which helps workers, businesses and farmers who can show they\u2019ve been hurt economically by imports.\u201cI\u2019ve never had an opportunity to go to school for free,\u201d he said. Mr. Williams is upbeat about his prospects, and unlike many Carrier workers, he bears no ill will toward the company. \u201cI don\u2019t have a gripe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me an opportunity. God didn\u2019t bring me this far to leave me. I\u2019m going to get a better job.\u201dYet even the most loyal Carrier employees aren\u2019t optimistic about their future or that of the broader sector where they\u2019ve chosen to spend their working lives. \u201cI come from a long line of people who worked with their hands,\u201d said Mr. Roell, the group leader, noting that his father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all mechanics. \u201cWhen my son was a toddler, the pediatrician noticed how he used his hands and asked me if I was a mechanic.\u201dMr. Roell doesn\u2019t want his son, 10, or his daughter, 15, to follow him into factory work. \u201cWe tell them all the time to go to college or trade school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not stable working in manufacturing. One day, the factory is going to go to another state or country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democratic Party Picked an Odd Time to Have an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan its unruly coalition take shape against Trump without one wing predominating?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The Democratic Party is a traditional political organization dedicated to winning elections. It is also a social justice movement, the political home of societal change. The party has often been further out front on these issues than the public at large \u2014 and than many of its own voters. This has empowered the Republican Party, from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, to capitalize on opposition to a range of liberal Democratic initiatives on immigration, busing, women\u2019s rights, abortion, crime, gay rights, gun control, affirmative action and so on. The Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to newly ascendant \u2014 and often assertive \u2014 constituencies has alienated some middle and working class voters who see their own values and interests downgraded. The Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation\u2019s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over American citizens\u2019. Many citizens can simultaneously take a liberal position on one or more individual cultural issues and still believe more generally that the liberal vision requires changing the country too much or too quickly.Hopkins noted that it is only natural that such massive social changes have caused anxiety, alienation, or anger among a significant proportion of the population \u2014 and liberals who fixate on the elements of their agenda that remain unfulfilled can sometimes be insensitive to the substantial degree of change that has already occurred over what is, historically speaking, a short amount of time.While both parties are penalized for their internal divisions, there is some evidence that cultural and economic strains present particular challenges for Democrats. The NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll has regularly asked a random selection of all voters whether Democratic and Republican candidates \u201care generally in the mainstream of most Americans\u2019 thinking, or are generally out of step with most Americans\u2019 thinking.\u201d Percentage of all registered voters who said each party\u2019s candidates were out of step with most Americans or in the mainstream.DemocraticcandidatesRepublicancandidatesOUT OF STEPMAINSTREAM575654484538OUT OF STEP3333MAINSTREAM201220162018201220162018Democratic candidatesRepublican candidatesOUT OF STEP60%575654IN THE MAINSTREAM484540%38OUT OF STEP3333IN THE MAINSTREAM20%201220162018201220162018By The New York Times | Source: NBC News/Wall Street Journal SurveyFrom 2016 to 2018, the percentage of voters describing Democratic candidates as \u201cin the mainstream\u201d fell from 48 percent to 33 percent. The percentage describing Democratic candidates as \u201cout of step with most Americans\u2019 thinking\u201d rose from 42 percent to 56 percent.Over the same period, the evaluation of Republican candidates remained virtually unchanged, 59 percent \u201cout of step\u201d in 2016 and 56 percent in 2018; 31 percent \u201cin the mainstream\u201d in 2016, 33 percent in 2018. In other words, over the past two years voters have become substantially more distrustful of the Democratic Party. I asked political scientists who study political parties for their evaluation of the dual function of the Democratic Party. Their responses varied widely.Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, wrote back to say that one \u201cproblem the party seems to have is that it can\u2019t accommodate all social justice demands at once.\u201dIn the 1960s and 1970s, the party became \u201can advocate for urban areas and racial minorities,\u201d Enos argued, but thenslowly, over time, it has become less of an advocate for rural areas, union members, and other things associated with the white working class. This left a portion of the social justice agenda on the table for another party to capture and part of that capture was the election of Trump.that making so many policy issues into matters of rights and taking them to the courts was counterproductive. It put opponents in the position of denying other people their rights. The latter are more difficult to compromise because if it\u2019s a right, compromise is an abrogation of it.Fiorina pointed tothe anger my working class steelworker friends expressed about the concept of \u201cwelfare rights.\u201d Welfare is charity; no one has a right to it was their view. This was the transformation of an issue that previously would have been seen as an economic redistribution issue into what would be considered a social justice issue.Fiorina\u2019s example shows how what can be seen as \u201crights\u201d for one constituency can be seen as \u201ccosts\u201d for another. The Voter Study Group identifies 15 percent of voters who fit into what it calls the Democratic-Independent Liberal Elite category. This is the cohort that has often provided leadership for the social justice movement within the Democratic Party. Members of this group have generally been younger, more liberal, better educated and more affluent than average voters.When asked to rank issue priorities, there were some striking differences between these more liberal Democrats and the average voter.According to the survey, issues that the Democratic elite gave much higher priority to than the electorate at large included gay rights, 61.0 to 34.3; gender equality, 68.7 to 35; and racial equality, 65.7 to 38.8.Conversely, the issues given much higher priority by all voters than by Democratic elites included terrorism, 58.2 percent to 11.6 percent; crime, 57.4 to 18.2; taxes, 56.9 to 18.9; budget deficit, 50.7 to 5.3; religious liberty, 48.5 to 21.7; and immigration, 46.1 to 16.7.To put it bluntly, there is a huge gulf between the priorities of the Democratic elite, which exercises significant influence over party policymaking, and the general public. I would describe the evolution of the Democratic Party a little differently. From the 1930s to the early 60s, I think Mike Dukakis once described it best as the party of the workingman, families and the neighborhood.This, Glendon wrote, \u201cwas the Party when my father became the first Irish Catholic to be elected chairman of the board of selectmen in Dalton, Mass.\u201dThen, in the 1960s,came the Party dedicated to ending segregation and affording equal opportunities to all. That was the Party to which I enthusiastically belonged. I would also say it was the party of true liberals, men and women who were tolerant, open, and not too sure they were right. Soon, however,the party left all three of those features behind: it became the party of the radically autonomous individual, the party of top-down solutions, and sadly a party that would not even listen to dissent on certain issues.The overreliance on rights and courts to solve disputes has encouraged a focus on the individual at the expense of investment in the social fabric, and a winner-takes-all attitude at the expense of tolerance and compromise.The result, she and Kaplan argue, is that \u201cthe social ecosystem comprising the social capital, social networks, experiences in self-governance, and democratic norms upon which a free society depends has suffered.\u201dThese have been consistent themes in Glendon\u2019s work. Back in 1991, in \u201cRights Talk,\u201d she wrote:A tendency to frame nearly every social controversy in terms of a clash of rights (a woman\u2019s right to her own body vs. a fetus\u2019s right to life) impedes compromise, mutual understanding, and the discovery of common ground. A penchant for absolute formulations promotes unrealistic expectations and ignores both social costs and the rights of others.Under political siege, Democratic liberalism became unreceptive, if not hostile, to new, contradictory and sometimes frightening information. The public repudiation of racism and the stigmatization of overtly racist expression was a groundbreaking achievement of the 1960s and 1970s. The repudiation of racist expression had an unintended consequence, however, for liberalism and for much of the Democratic Party: an almost censorious set of prohibitions against discussion of family structure among the black poor, absent fathers, crime, lack of labor force participation, welfare dependency, illegitimacy and other contentious race-freighted issues.But Grossmann went on to acknowledge,It is nonetheless true that Democrats are likely to be pushing for lots of individual social changes at once, many of which are individually popular but collectively look to the right and to the middle like a project to remake society, undermine traditions, subordinate domestic strength to global concerns, and make American culture less unique.Because Democratshave trouble prioritizing the laundry list of goals and don\u2019t realize that individually popular goals \u2014 spur the economy, provide health coverage to those who need it \u2014 can become quite unpopular once they are combined and attacked as a big government project by liberal elitists.Despite this, Theodoridis believes that the Republican Party has a bigger problemreining in the fringes. Perhaps because the G.O.P. is a proxy for an ideological dimension, rather than a coalition of diverse interests, it is more likely pulled to the edge of the ideological spectrum.While Republicans have clearly been pushed well to the right of center by their activist wing, the results of House and Senate elections in recent years suggest continued public reluctance to give Democrats control of Congress. Since 1995, Republicans have held the majority in the Senate 15 years to the Democrats\u2019 9. Over the same period, Republicans have controlled the House 20 years to the Democrats\u2019 4.There is no way the Democratic Party would jettison the party\u2019s social justice wing nor should it. The record does suggest, however, that Democrats need to do a better job of managing the conflict between the centrist corpus of the party and both of its activist left wings \u2014 one cultural, one economic \u2014 if it expects to fully capitalize on the opportunities that President Trump and his allies have bestowed on them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Consumption Downgrade: Skip Avocados, Cocktails and Kids", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldChen Siqi doesn\u2019t eat out so much anymore. Li Keli cut down on travel and takes her son to a public playground instead. Wang Jiazhi stopped dating.Welcome to China\u2019s \u201cconsumption downgrade\u201d culture, a potentially worrisome development for Beijing and the world.For years, the conversation in China was about \u201cconsumption upgrades.\u201d As the economy took off, China\u2019s middle class \u2014 now more than 400 million strong and still growing \u2014 decided to spend those bigger paychecks. It traded up from local brands to Nikes, from cheap phones to iPhones, from tea to $5 Starbucks lattes.Today, China\u2019s economy is slowing, and shopping has slowed with it. The stock market is slumping. China\u2019s currency has lost some of its value. The trade war with President Trump has left many Chinese feeling pessimistic.China\u2019s consumer culture has by no means ground to a halt. But in the streets and on the Chinese internet, the talk is about cutting back in ways big and small.A post headlined \u201cThis Generation of Young Chinese, Brace for the Bitter Days Ahead,\u201d by Ming Na, a blogger, received more than 300,000 views on the social media platform WeChat last weekend. She advised young people to stop going to shopping malls and nightclubs.\u201cThe age of the consumption downgrade,\u201d Ms. Na wrote, \u201chas arrived with a big crashing sound.\u201dChen Siqi hears the message. A 30-year-old accountant in Beijing, she recently bought a garbage bin on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app focused on cheap, sometimes iffy goods that initially enjoyed appeal only in rural areas. She makes about $1,400 a month after taxes, but nearly half of it goes to the rent on her one-bedroom apartment.Ms. Chen said she had reached the age when she wanted to live in her own apartment instead of sharing with others. To save money, she now cooks at home a few times a week and buys clothes mostly from cheap online vendors and the Japanese basics brand Uniqlo.\u201cI would like to have a nicer lifestyle but don\u2019t know how I can afford it,\u201d she said.A Chinese consumption downgrade could be felt around the world. Chinese spenders have been a key driver of their country\u2019s economic growth in recent years. China, in turn, has played a major role in global growth. Chinese consumers help global companies like Apple, General Motors, Volkswagen and many others. A consumption downgrade could also embolden Mr. Trump in his trade fight with China, as he gambles that Beijing can\u2019t take much more economic damage.Long-term factors are driving down spending among young people in particular. The cost of education is going up. Housing in rich cities like Beijing has become unaffordable for many.Housing is so expensive that Wang Jiazhi moved out of his own home. A 34-year-old semiconductor engineer in the southern city of Shenzhen, he bought a one-bedroom apartment in 2016. In addition to a mortgage of more than $700 a month, he needs to pay his relatives back for the money he borrowed for the down payment. So he rents his apartment and shares a four-bedroom apartment with nine other men. This way, Mr. Wang \u2014 who makes about $2,000 a month after taxes \u2014 saves $160 a month.Like many Chinese men, Mr. Wang believes he needs an apartment in order to find a wife. But he is under so much pressure with his mortgage and debt, and with supporting his aging parents in the countryside, that he has had to postpone his plan for marriage. His prospects weren\u2019t good anyway: To save money, he has stopped dating.\u201cI work long hours every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me feel occupied.\u201dSo the consumption downgrade is in. Even as China\u2019s stock market has sputtered, shares in companies that make affordable staples like erguotou, a cheap hard liquor, and pickled vegetables have bucked the trend.\u201cDrink erguotou with pickled vegetables,\u201d said Ms. Na, the blogger, quoting popular Chinese internet memes. \u201cTake a ride with Mobike,\u201d she added, naming a bike-share company that offers two-wheeled rides for pennies.Even the only children of middle-class families, a group that is largely financially secure, can feel anxious about their future.Wu Xiaoqiong, 28, is the only child of a civil servant and a doctor in the eastern province of Anhui. She works at a big internet company in Beijing with monthly pay of $1,500 after taxes.When she got married last year, her parents and her husband\u2019s parents each put in half of the down payment for a one-bedroom apartment \u2014 a typical arrangement for many Chinese middle-class families. Nearly two-thirds of the couple\u2019s monthly income goes to the mortgage and toward the rent of a small apartment in Shanghai, where her husband works at a state-owned bank.Her consumption downgrade plan is to remain childless.\u201cWe have almost no savings and no retirement plans,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents have been supporting me financially. How can I afford a child?\u201dOthers are saying no to bigger households \u2014 a problem for a Chinese government worried about the country\u2019s aging population.When asked whether she would consider having a second child, Li Keli, an accountant at an electronics maker in the southern city of Huizhou, said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Her factory laid off two-thirds of its workers in June when the United States-China trade war escalated. Her monthly pay of $500 was cut by 10 percent. She used to take her son, 7, to visit nearby cities on weekends. Now she takes him to the playgrounds of big residential complexes because they\u2019re free.Many high earners feel anxious as well. Chen Ying, 33, an architect in Shanghai, said her consumption downgrade plan involved not shopping in department stores.Ms. Chen said she did not expect her pay to rise too much. Her younger colleagues do not make as much as when she first started four years ago, and her pay now is lower than that of older colleagues with similar experience four years ago.She used to get pay raises of 15 percent to 20 percent a year \u2014 rates that weren\u2019t uncommon at fast-growing industries in China in the past decade. Now she expects the raises to be 5 percent, if she gets them at all. She has started to think about retirement, but doesn\u2019t know where to begin.\u201cIn the past we had many inflated expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t expect so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the province Wu Xiaoqiong is from. It Anhui, not Hefei. Hefei is the capital of Anhui province.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Partisanship, Parasites, and Polarization", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre direct-marketing scams destroying the republic? A serious question.Opinion ColumnistAnd lately I\u2019ve been wondering if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to America. How much of our political sickness is the result of a parasitic infection? What I have in mind specifically is an infestation of direct-marketing scams that exploit and reinforce political partisanship, largely on the right, basically to sell merchandise. I\u2019ll come back to that. First, some notes on political economy.As Olson pointed out, the same goes for political action. Just because a political candidate\u2019s victory would be good for, say, farmers doesn\u2019t mean that farmers will give him or her money; each individual farmer will have an incentive to free ride on everyone else\u2019s contributions. So political action is normally undertaken by individuals or small, organized groups that stand to benefit directly. Either that, or it\u2019s a byproduct of other activities that are advantageous for their own reasons and can also be harnessed for political action, like memberships in trade associations or unions.So a lot of political action is driven by people trying to shape policy in a way that benefits them personally. But what the Shapiro/brain pills story drives home to me is that there\u2019s another important factor in our current political scene: the use of political action as a marketing ploy, by people out to make a buck selling stuff that has little to do with politics per se. Dear Reader, I\u2019m going to tell you something, but you must promise to keep it quiet. You have to understand that the \u201celite\u201d would not be at all happy with me if they knew what I was about to tell you. That\u2019s why we have to tread carefully. You see, while most people are paying attention to the stock market, the banks, brokerages and big institutions have their money somewhere else . . . [in] what I call the hidden money mountain . . . All you have to know is the insider\u2019s code (which I\u2019ll tell you) and you could make an extra $6,000 every single month. And some of the most influential voices on the right haven\u2019t just sold advertising space to purveyors of snake oil, they\u2019ve gotten directly into the snake-oil business themselves.Thus:  Why should marketing scams be linked to political extremism? It\u2019s all about affinity fraud: once you establish a persona that appeals to angry, aging white guys, you can sell them stuff that will supposedly protect their virility, their waistline, and their wealth. Now, normally we think of individuals\u2019 views and interests as the forces driving politics, including the ugly polarization increasingly dominating the scene. The commercial exploitation of that polarization, if we mention it at all, is treated as a sort of surface phenomenon that feeds off the fundamental dynamic. But are we sure that\u2019s right? The Alex Joneses, Ben Shapiros, and Fox Newses of the world couldn\u2019t profit from extremism unless there were some underlying predisposition of angry old white guys to listen to this stuff. But maybe the commercial exploitation of political anger is what has concentrated and weaponized that anger. In other words, going back to where I started this essay, maybe the reason we\u2019re in a political nightmare is that our political behavior has, in effect, been parasitized by marketing algorithms. Anyway, I think it\u2019s really important to realize the extent to which peddling political snake oil, whether it\u2019s about the economy, race, the effects of immigration, or whatever, is to an important extent a way to peddle actual snake oil: magic pills that will let you lose weight without ever feeling hungry and restore your youthful manhood.

{"Headline": "Paul LePage Was Saying Whatever He Wanted Before That Was a Thing", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLEWISTON, Me. \u2014 Maine just ended its fiscal year in the black, with a healthy surplus of $176 million, a far cry from a few short years ago when it was hemorrhaging red ink.Other governors might spend weeks boasting about such an accomplishment. But Gov. Paul LePage, Maine\u2019s two-term Republican governor \u2014 who is barred by term limits from seeking re-election \u2014 is an irascible, combative showman and tends to step on his own good news.With all that, there was little time to hail the surplus \u2014 even as critics said he had balanced the budget by slashing services for Maine\u2019s least fortunate.As his tenure as governor comes to a close, Mr. LePage \u2014 who may be best known nationally for speaking bluntly, sometimes crudely, from his gut \u2014 has done a pretty good job over his eight years in office of distracting attention from his achievements.Among his most noted acts: He signed the largest tax cut in state history, curbed welfare benefits and oversaw strong job growth.On the November ballot to replace Mr. LePage are a Republican, Shawn Moody, who shares many of Mr. LePage\u2019s views but not his confrontational style, and a Democrat, Janet Mills, the state attorney general, who has vowed to take a different tack. Two independents are also running.With Mr. LePage, 69, having dominated the state for almost eight years, the election is shaping up as a referendum on him. It may also signal how Maine views President Trump, who has much in common with Mr. LePage and who in 2016 beat Hillary Clinton in one of the state\u2019s two congressional districts.\u201cI was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,\u201d Mr. LePage boasted after endorsing Mr. Trump for president. Indeed, Mr. LePage has been every bit as disruptive in Augusta as Mr. Trump has been in Washington.One reason may be Mr. LePage\u2019s lack of a verbal filter.\u201cHe\u2019s conservative, I\u2019m conservative,\u201d said Karen Jordan, 61, a housekeeping aide and registered Republican in Lewiston, where Mr. LePage grew up. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t like his mouth.\u201dA onetime millworker with an origin story out of Dickens \u2014 the oldest of 18 children of an abusive, alcoholic father, he ran away from home at 11 \u2014 Mr. LePage wears his rough-and-tumble \u201ctell it like it is\u201d persona as a badge of honor.But his outsize personality has often overshadowed Maine\u2019s progress.Mr. LePage\u2019s supporters credit his fiscal policies. He reduced the top individual income tax rate to 7.15 percent from 8.5 percent and doubled the estate tax exemption to $2 million from $1 million. He has cut the size of government, reduced welfare cases by 41 percent, overhauled the state\u2019s pension system and overseen the creation of more than 36,000 nonfarm jobs.Mr. LePage declined to be interviewed for this article. His spokeswoman said he was not prepared to discuss his legacy now because he believed he had more to do. But allies offered glowing assessments.\u201cPeople are working good-paying, private sector jobs with record-high wages, averaging $43,500 in pay,\u201d said Terry Brown, communications director for the conservative Maine Heritage Policy Center.Critics do not dispute that Maine\u2019s economy has improved, but they say it was buoyed by a robust national economy and that not everyone has benefited.\u201cNo one is representing the people who are being hit the hardest by these cuts,\u201d said Melissa Newbury, director of the Bangor Ecumenical Food Cupboard. She said 82 families used her food pantry each week as of June, compared with 14 families a week in 2012.In 2011, when Mr. LePage took office, Maine had the 14th lowest rate of poverty in the nation, according to the census; last year, it fell to 21st.As for education, Mr. LePage famously derided the state\u2019s public schools shortly after taking office, saying, \u201cIf you want a good education, go to private schools.\u201dSince then, state funding for public schools has climbed, though much of that increase was a result of legislative overrides of Mr. LePage\u2019s vetoes.While those amounts increased, they did not keep up with the cost of education under Maine\u2019s school funding formula, said James Myall, a policy analyst at the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a liberal research group. With the state paying a smaller share, towns have had to increase property taxes to fill the gap.As the November election approaches, Mr. LePage may not be on the ballot, but his actions of the last eight years are at the center of the debate.\u201cHis legacy will be the incredible acrimony you see in the statehouse,\u201d said L. Sandy Maisel, a political scientist at Colby College. \u201cAnd it\u2019s as acrimonious as it has ever been.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Imran Khan\u2019s First Test: Pakistan\u2019s Troubled Economy", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The economic mess awaiting Pakistan\u2019s new leader could take the thrill out of his election victory.So what\u2019s a new prime minister to do?But the task will be made more difficult because Pakistan has sandwiched itself between two financial powers: China, from which it has borrowed heavily, and the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund, which might be its short-term savior.Pakistan has taken out billions in Chinese loans and run up a huge import tab bringing in bulldozers, train carriages and building materials as part of a Chinese-funded master plan to revamp its ports, roads and railways.Economists agree that for Pakistan\u2019s economy to develop beyond rice and textiles, its main exports, it needs new infrastructure \u2014 a lot of it.But in the meantime, the Chinese plan is pushing Pakistan\u2019s deficits to unsustainable levels. The country\u2019s debt is rising rapidly and it is running out of hard currency to pay its bills. Pakistani economists say that Mr. Khan\u2019s team will have no choice but to beg the monetary fund for a multibillion-dollar bailout, one of more than a dozen that Pakistan has received since the late 1980s.That prospect doesn\u2019t make the United States super happy.Mr. Pompeo objected to the idea of money from the fund being used by Pakistan to pay back Chinese loans.\u201cThere\u2019s no rationale for I.M.F. tax dollars \u2014 and associated with that American dollars that are part of the I.M.F. funding \u2014 for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,\u201d he said.Pakistan\u2019s economy, it seems, has become yet another battlefield between the United States and China.Despite its troubles, last year the Pakistani economy grew at more than 5 percent, faster than most Western economies.But things could change quickly if Mr. Khan\u2019s government doesn\u2019t get a rescue package soon, experts said. Among the concerns are soaring inflation, bank runs, capital flight and new import controls that would make it more difficult to buy items like computers and spare auto parts.But how he handles the cold, hard numbers of Pakistan\u2019s up-and-down economy, more than anything else, will determine his success.This past week, Mr. Khan has continued his quest to win over enough independent lawmakers and those from smaller parties to form a coalition government.That is going to be hard to deliver if Pakistan goes hat in hand to the monetary fund, as many expect. Considered the lender of last resort, it can be a stern taskmaster.In return for lending Pakistan upward of $10 billion, the fund would most likely require more fiscal discipline. That could mean Pakistan would have to reduce public spending and increase the amount of taxes it collects. Both could be a drag on growth and are not exactly the moves a populist prime minister would like to make during his first days in office.Pakistani economists say Mr. Khan faces a tightrope in trying to reconcile the fund\u2019s demands with the goals of China\u2019s infrastructure plans.\u201cThese are our two masters,\u201d said Turab Hussain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. \u201cHow do you serve both?\u201dThough China is a member of the monetary fund and one of its biggest contributors, it has a different philosophy when making its own loans. Getting paid back is not its only, or maybe even primary, goal.As it seeks new markets for its construction companies and new pathways to ship its goods, China is financing ambitious infrastructure projects across Central and South Asia. Beijing also views these projects as a way to project its power and secure allies.The goal of the monetary fund, by contrast, is to stabilize distressed economies and help countries avoid unsustainable financial imbalances. It structures loans with strict conditions to increase the chances the country will clean up its finances and be able to pay back its loans.While Chinese loans don\u2019t have the same strings attached, they still have strings. In Pakistan, much of the profit from new power plants and roads goes straight back to Chinese companies.\u201cPakistan is clearly falling to the China side,\u201d said Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist for Oxford Economics, a global research firm.Even with a bailout from the monetary fund, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing.\u201dMeher Ahmad contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan, and Peter Goodman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Unveils Its Plan to Relax Car Pollution Rules", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday put forth its long-awaited proposal to freeze antipollution and fuel-efficiency standards for cars, significantly weakening one of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policies to combat global warming.The administration\u2019s plans immediately faced opposition from an unusual mix of critics \u2014 including not only environmentalists and consumer groups but auto-industry representatives as well as individual states \u2014 who are now launching efforts to change the plan before it is finalized.That Obama-era rule, which aimed to cut the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions while reducing oil consumption, was opposed by automakers who said it was overly burdensome. However, Thursday\u2019s proposal goes much further than many major automakers wanted, and manufacturers are now worried that years of legal challenges and regulatory uncertainty could complicate their business.The governor of California, Jerry Brown, said his state was prepared to fight. \u201cFor Trump to now destroy a law first enacted at the request of Ronald Reagan five decades ago is a betrayal and an assault on the health of Americans everywhere,\u201d he said.Their proposal would freeze the increase of average fuel economy standards after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon. It would also revoke a legal waiver, granted to California under the 1970 Clean Air Act and now followed by 13 other states, that lets those states set pollution standards that are more stringent than the federal government\u2019s.Administration officials have said that, by promoting lighter cars, the Obama-era standards could lead to about 12,700 more auto fatalities over the coming 13 years.\u201cThis rule promises to save lives,\u201d said Heidi King, the Transportation Department\u2019s acting administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, during a Thursday conference call. \u201cIt could save up to a thousand lives annually by reducing these barriers that prevent consumers from getting into newer, safer cars,\u201d said Ms. King, who was also an author of the proposal and pushed the new traffic safety analysis.William Wehrum, the E.P.A.\u2019s Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, added, \u201cThere is a tension between calling for ever-increasing efficiency standards on one hand, and the obligation to have safe vehicles on the road.\u201dThat conclusion forms the basis of the current administration\u2019s reasoning on rolling back the rule. However, it clashes with the Obama administration\u2019s analysis of the same rule, which found that improving fuel-economy standards would actually lead to about 100 fewer auto-related casualties over the next 13 years.Because the proposal would revoke states\u2019 rights to set their own pollution standards, a group of 19 state attorneys general announced their plans to sue the administration if it finalizes the rule. The attorneys general said they expected to focus on the claim that cleaner cars would lead to more crash fatalities.\u201cThe case we\u2019ll make is that the data and science do not back up what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, which follows the more stringent California clean-air rules.Allies of the Trump administration cheered the plan, but few industries spoke up in its favor, even among those that the proposal might benefit. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil business \u2014 which stands to gain if the rule change creates a greater demand for gasoline \u2014 did not put out a public statement on the proposal.The announcement \u201cis good news for consumers,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who directs the energy and environment program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group, and who advised the Trump administration\u2019s E.P.A. transition team. \u201cIt means that the federal government will have slightly less control over the kinds of cars and trucks people can buy. It might even cause car prices to stop increasing so rapidly.\u201dMr. Ebell went on to describe the move to revoke California\u2019s right to set its own standards as \u201ceven better news.\u201d\u201cLetting one state make decisions for people in other states makes a bad program even worse, especially since the state is California, which has been pursuing an anti-car agenda for decades,\u201d Mr. Ebell said.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.This week\u2019s publication of the proposed rule in the federal register marks a significant legal step in the process of weakening the Obama rule. The administration will next ask the public to formally submit comments before issuing a final version of the rule, most likely this year.The government\u2019s ideas have met with criticism even from some of the automakers that Mr. Trump has said he wants the plan to help. While the chief executives of auto companies last year asked Mr. Trump to loosen the Obama-era rules, they have since asked him not to pull them back quite so far.Their concern is that any lawsuit by the states could ultimately tangle the rules in litigation for years, leaving automakers caught in regulatory uncertainty.Furthermore, if the administration ultimately lost the court battle, it could split the nation\u2019s auto market in two, with the federal government enforcing one set of emissions standards and a group of major states including California enforcing their own separate and stricter rules. Automakers have called that a worst-case scenario.Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, said, \u201cOnce again, the E.P.A. has handed decision-making to fossil fuel lobbyists and climate change deniers, while sticking the American people with the bill. Together with California, and 19 other states, my office will be suing to stop this terrible proposal.\u201dThat legal threat is what worries the nation\u2019s automakers, who will now urge the Trump administration to go back to the table and find a way to strike a deal with California and the other states before issuing a final proposal.\u201cWith today\u2019s release of the administration\u2019s proposals, it\u2019s time for substantive negotiations to begin,\u201d Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge California and the federal government to find a common sense solution that sets continued increases in vehicle efficiency standards while also meeting the needs of America\u2019s drivers.\u201dSpeaking to a Senate panel on Wednesday, Mr. Wheeler, the acting head of the E.P.A., said he would like to find a way to avoid a legal showdown with California. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to come up with a 50-state solution that does not necessitate pre-empting California.\u201dBehind the scenes, Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Wehrum have sought to distance themselves from the auto-fatality analysis put forth by Ms. King, out of concern that the numbers might be susceptible to legal challenge, according to 12 people familiar with the internal deliberations.Mr. Wehrum acknowledged Thursday that the two agencies had had \u201clong and spirited conversations\u201d while drafting the rules, and expressed hope that a final deal could eventually be reached with California. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to get together again and try to find a middle ground,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants a two-car world where there are one set of cars on one side of the country and one on the other. That makes no sense.\u201dAlso urging the Trump administration to go back to the drawing board will be the nation\u2019s manufacturers of auto parts and components. Those companies say that the uncertainty of a protracted legal battle would freeze investment and innovation in the high-tech auto-parts sector.\u201cIt\u2019s our hope now to prevent a dramatic weakening of the federal standard and further erosion of regulatory certainty, so we can continue to innovate and invest in the United States and cut harmful pollution in a timely fashion,\u201d said Chris Miller, executive director of the Advanced Engine Systems Institute, a trade association of companies that develop pollution-control technology.Meanwhile, environmentalists will open a campaign to generate public comments opposing the rollback. At the same time, some industry interests are expected to try to negotiate behind the scenes to temper the proposed rules in order to minimize the prospects of the California legal showdown.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Specter of Trump\u2019s Car Tariffs Forces Allies to Give Ground in Talks", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 President Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on imported cars is working, sending foreign leaders from Mexico to Japan racing to the negotiating table to make deals. But their offers may not satisfy a president who has shown a willingness to embrace trade tensions in an effort to extract more from American trading partners.The European Union on Thursday made one of the most significant concessions, saying it would cut its existing penalties on automobiles to zero, provided the United States dropped its own tariffs. Although the president has called for something similar, Mr. Trump said he wanted Europe to go even further.\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cTheir consumer habits are to buy their cars, not to buy our cars.\u201dIf deals do not get done, the president\u2019s combative approach to trade is risky, leaving American companies vulnerable to both tariffs in the United States and retaliatory measures by other countries. Car manufacturers like General Motors and Ford depend heavily on a global supply chain. Tariffs could raise sticker prices and cost jobs.But the cudgel, 25 percent levies on foreign-made cars, is a powerful one. Compared to the measures on steel and aluminum, they have the potential to do significant damage to a big, global industry that helps drive many economies.Mr. Trump is betting that the United States has a stronger position that will force trading partners to blink. Europe is facing a slowdown, while the American economy is surging ahead.Against that backdrop, the European Union\u2019s top trade official on Thursday said that the bloc would be willing to remove all tariffs on cars and other industrial products as part of a limited trade deal with the United States, if the United States did the same. Europe had previously expressed a willingness to eliminate tariffs on industrial goods, but excluded cars, and said any deal had to be part of a broad free-trade agreement.The offer will require Mr. Trump to decide whether he is willing to eliminate American tariffs, like a 25 percent tax on imported trucks, as he has previously said he is willing to do. If it\u2019s not enough as he has said, Europe would have to call his bluff \u2014 or come up with other concessions.Mr. Trump could be angling for an offer that would more directly reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficits. Although economists have criticized his use of the measure as a scorecard for trade, he has often criticized the European Union for selling more goods, especially cars, to the United States than it purchases. In the interview with Bloomberg News, Mr. Trump likened the European Union to China, which also runs a trade surplus with the United States.Mexico, too, has been willing to deal. On Monday, the Mexican government agreed to effectively cap exports of cars, sport utility vehicles and auto parts into the United States, subjecting any exports above those levels to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs if they go into effect.Mexico, Canada and the European Union initially insisted that they would not negotiate about trade \u201cwith a gun to the head.\u201d But existing tariffs on steel and aluminum, and the specter of tariffs on automobiles, helped change their minds.\u201cThe European Union\u2019s original position was that they would not negotiate with the United States about anything to do with trade policy until the U.S. removed those tariffs,\u201d said Joanna Konings, a senior economist at the Dutch bank ING who specializes in trade.In the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiation, the tariffs \u2014 existing and threatened \u2014 have given officials another thorny issue to resolve. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he had struck a deal with Mexico, while threatening to leave Canada behind and hit it with auto tariffs.\u201cI think with Canada, frankly, the easiest thing we can do is to tariff their cars coming in,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Canadian officials responded by cutting short a trip to Europe and rushing to Washington, where they are working to reach an agreement.Auto tariffs could affect roughly $350 billion worth of foreign automobiles and auto parts, more than three times the value of the foreign products currently subject to import taxes. The measure would fall heavily on United States allies: Roughly 98 percent of American car imports come from the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea.Wielding the auto tariffs as a threat may also undermine the administration\u2019s rationale for imposing the levies. The administration argues that imported automobiles threaten American national security because they are degrading the industry. But critics say that the argument rings hollow, if those tariffs can be lifted for other concessions.Still, the president appears convinced that the strategy is working. At a rally in West Virginia last week, he recounted how the threat of auto tariffs had brought the Europeans to the negotiating table.\u201cWe\u2019re going to put a 25 percent tax on every car that comes from the European Union into the United States,\u201d the president said.\u201cThat\u2019ll take one little signature, Donald J. Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I got a call. Mr. President, when can we meet? We\u2019d like to see you. And they came in very respectfully; we\u2019re working on a deal.\u201dEurope\u2019s willingness to compromise reflected the danger that car tariffs pose, in particular to Germany, the Continent\u2019s largest economy and a major automotive exporter.On Thursday, Mr. Trump again threatened to pull out of the W.T.O. if it does not \u201cshape up,\u201d saying the international body has not treated the United States fairly.\u201cIf they don\u2019t shape up, I would withdraw from the W.T.O.,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview with Bloomberg.Some analysts interpreted the agreement between Mr. Juncker and Mr. Trump as an attempt to reopen talks on a comprehensive free-trade deal, which stalled in the closing days of the Obama administration and died after Mr. Trump\u2019s election.But Ms. Malmstrom\u2019s comments on Thursday signaled that the European Commission was willing to pursue a less ambitious pact to avoid further escalation of the trade war.\u201cWe are not restarting T.T.I.P.,\u201d she said, referring to the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the pact that foundered.In Japan, the threat of auto tariffs is causing more severe anxieties.Japanese government officials continue to resist the administration\u2019s invitation to enter bilateral trade talks or offer any concessions. But Japanese auto industry leaders are increasingly concerned about the fate of the 1.7 million cars that the country exports to the United States annually.Analysts say that if the administration imposes a 20 percent tariff on Japanese auto exports, manufacturers\u2019 costs could go up by $8.6 billion. SMBC Nikko Securities estimated that if automakers passed on such costs to customers, Japan\u2019s car exports would decline by 200,000 units, cutting profits by about 2.2 percent.After visiting Washington earlier this month to speak with Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, Japan\u2019s minister of economic revitalization, Toshimitsu Motegi, told Japanese reporters in Washington that \u201cthe discussions will continue, and there are individual areas to be discussed further.\u201dAs part of that pact, South Korea agreed to give American carmakers more access, while the United States was able to extend a tariff that it charges on foreign trucks. But those pledges have been thrown into question by the threat of new measures on Korean automakers. The deal has not yet been authorized by South Korean lawmakers.South Korea thought it had put trade tensions with the United States behind it with the conclusion of its agreement, said Troy Stangarone, senior director of trade at the Korea Economic Institute. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t turned out to be the case,\u201d Mr. Stangarone said.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, Ana Swanson from Washington, and Motoko Rich from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Nafta Is Suddenly in Doubt, and Canada Reels", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, President Trump has gone behind Canada\u2019s back and negotiated what he calls a trade deal with Mexico, leaving Canada on the sidelines. He has also threatened to impose hefty tariffs on cars, one of Canada\u2019s most important exports.The power play has sent the country reeling, with trade lawyers trying to gauge how much of Mr. Trump\u2019s threat was negotiation bluster versus directive, and economists sorting through what a world without the North American Free Trade Agreement would mean for Canada.Most conclude that an end to Nafta in itself would not severely harm the country\u2019s economy, although it could chill international investment \u2014 but that Mr. Trump\u2019s threatened 25 percent auto tariff would be disastrous.\u201cThis would be enough to throw us into a recession because the auto industry is so important to Canada,\u201d said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory here.\u201dIt\u2019s the biggest rift yet in the relations between the two nations, and one that could have the biggest practical import. In recognition of the stakes, Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, cut short a visit to Europe and rushed to Washington to shoulder her way back into the bargaining room, although her spokesman said that the government\u2019s position had not changed, and that it would only sign a deal that was good for Canada.At the same time many leaders in Congress, which must approve any trade pact, have expressed reservations about leaving Canada out. And if Mr. Trump intends to partner only with Mexico, he will also need congressional approval to bring Nafta to a close.That Mexico has seemingly usurped Canada\u2019s place as the primary trading partner with the United States struck many in Canada as deeply offensive.Only a year ago, the debate in Canada was whether to abandon Mexico at the negotiation table. In the end, Canadian politicians insisted that any deal would need to involve Mexico, even though it was then the focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire over trade and immigration.The first iteration of Nafta was the Free Trade Agreement, signed between the United States and Canada in 1988, six years before the accord was expanded to include Mexico. Since then, the Canadian economy has become so intertwined with its larger American neighbor to the point that three-quarters of Canadian exports go across the border.But times have changed since Nafta abolished the high tariffs of 30 years ago. The later agreement that created the World Trade Organization has reduced tariffs to the point that even without Nafta, the majority of goods crossing the Canadian-American border would not face significant price increases.However, the true strength of Nafta for Canada\u2019s economy has been the international investment it draws. That is why Canadian negotiators have always been insistent on maintaining the deal\u2019s procedures for appealing American trade actions against Canada, and why Prime Minister Trudeau has called Mr. Trump\u2019s demand that any new agreement contain an expiration date an absolute deal-breaker for his country.\u201cThat gives international businesses assured market access, which is key to making Canada an attractive place to invest to serve the North American market,\u201d said Dan Ciuriak, the former deputy chief economist in Canada\u2019s foreign affairs and trade department. \u201cFor business, uncertainty is a cost.\u201dIn the tentative deal announced Monday, both the United States and Mexico agreed to a type of expiration clause, reviewing the pact every six years that would extend its lifetime for 16 more years, officials said.Whether the extension of an expiration date will appease Canadian negotiators is unclear. Trump administration officials said the tariff appeals process had been removed from the tentative trade agreement with Mexico. Canada is highly unlikely to accept that omission because its creation was the dealmaker for the original Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of a 25 percent duty on Canadian-made cars and auto parts is a powerful one, however, as the overwhelming majority of Canadian production ends up in American showrooms.The United States and Mexico have said they would like to sign a deal by Friday, but many Canadian trade lawyers argue that the deadline is untenable, given that many of the chapters in the phonebook-sized agreement remain in limbo.Lawrence L. Herman, a Toronto trade lawyer and former Canadian diplomat, said Canada\u2019s only strategy this week is to essentially buy time \u2014 showing a willingness to negotiate more aggressively \u2014 making it unlikely that Congress would accept any request from the Trump administration to accept a trade agreement without Canada.While both the American and Mexican presidents want to complete a deal quickly, Canada has a federal election in just over a year from now.That means Mr. Trudeau will have to balance whether a trade deal full of Canadian concessions is better than an end to Nafta and heavy tariffs on the country\u2019s important auto industry.\u201cThe best option is Canada kicks the can down the road, shows the deadline is artificial and calls Trump\u2019s bluff,\u201d said Mr. Cross, the former government economist who is now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group in Ottawa. \u201cBut that\u2019s very, very risky.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable negotiating tactics might have given him the upper hand this week, but in the long run, this same quality could undermine Nafta\u2019s potential relevance to Canada.\u201cI hope Minister Freeland leaves Washington without signing a deal,\u201d said Mr. Ciuriak, who is now a senior fellow with the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario.\u201cIf you are not prepared to follow the rules, signing onto an agreement hardly gives you any protection,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Tweet can undo anything you just signed.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Heated conversations around the price of gold filled the museum courtyard.\u201cI guess it is not the best time to get married,\u201d my friend, the bride, said, sighing.\u201cIt is an O.K. time to get married,\u201d a friend responded. \u201cIt is just the worst time to be a wedding guest.\u201dAug. 10 had been dreadful in Istanbul, where I work at an international construction, development and investment firm. I walked into the office to find all my colleagues fixed on their computer screens, scrolling on Twitter and refreshing the pages of news websites to check if the lira had plunged even further than it had the last time they checked. The landline phones, which rang relentlessly in my office, had gone silent.Every face in the building was ashen, tight-lipped, stiff. I thought of the weight and the dread I had felt riding the subway to work in New York the day after Donald Trump was elected. People didn\u2019t even pretend to work.Like Mr. Trump, Turkey\u2019s economic crisis did not come out of nowhere. Economists, financial analysts and ordinary Turks have been speculating about a looming economic crisis for the last two years. The fear of a worsening economic climate was the primary reason Recep Tayyip Erdogan held the parliamentary and presidential election in June, more than a year ahead of schedule.Although Turkey\u2019s primary business relationship continues to be with Europe, the trigger for the latest crisis was the spat between the Trump administration and the Turkish government over Andrew Brunson, the American preacher who was arrested after the coup attempt and is now under house arrest in Turkey. In face of these multiple crises, a sense of my country clamming up is visible in our everyday life. Buying records, cosmetics or vintage clothes online from websites in the United States is far from easy. Customs have grown increasingly tight, and tracking updates stagnate once an item arrives in Turkey. We are beginning to see echoes of the old practice of asking friends traveling abroad to bring back electronics, clothes and even books, as we did in the 1980s, when Turkey was yet to liberalize its economy and a pack of Marlboro Reds was considered a generous gift. In upscale Istanbul neighborhoods that used to be the traditional bastions of Europeanized Turkish secularists, the reconfiguration toward Arab and other Muslim tourists is visible in hookah lounges and halal steak restaurants. Small businesses in Istanbul have come to rely heavily on these tourist inflows. \u201cAnyone who says the Arab tourists help us get by is lying,\u201d explained Ersin Camsari, a hairstylist who has been running his store at Taksim Square for 11 years. \u201cThey don\u2019t just help; they are the reason we can keep our shops open.\u201d I have felt the chilling effects of the crisis: On a recent morning an acrobatic thief shimmied his way into my apartment and made off with my MacBook as I slept in the next room. I went to the police station to report the burglary and met three people from my neighborhood reporting break-ins by thieves looking for cash. \u201cOh, don\u2019t fret,\u201d a cheery officer said. \u201cThese guys come in droves every time there is an economic crisis. Just make sure you lock up.\u201d Busra Erkara is a writer based in Istanbul.Advertisement"}

As a result, I am disturbed by the unequal distribution of wealth that has resulted from our capitalistic system. However, that makes me somewhat of a centrist democrat who believes in social programs, but is concerned about the emergence of politicians who call themselves democratic socialists.There has to be someone in this great country of ours who could help us all by speaking up and making that distinction clear.

{"Headline": "Life in Turkey Now: Tough Talk, but Fears of Drug Shortages", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "The lira\u2019s plunge, exacerbated by a dispute with the U.S. over a detained pastor, has exposed growing economic pressures that some economists say could be near a breaking point. Supported byTurkish banks are pulling back on credit to consumers and businesses. Power plants have shut down because of the soaring cost of imported fuel. Building projects in Istanbul stand half finished after their backers ran out of money.Mr. Sarialioglu, who is also president of the Istanbul chamber of pharmacists, said he has been getting calls from other pharmacists concerned that wholesalers will cut off supplies of crucial medications because they can no longer make a profit. Drug prices are set in Turkey, so the sharp drop in the lira has made it costly to import pharmaceuticals.\u201cStarting in September, we may have problems,\u201d Mr. Sarialioglu said. \u201cAn urgent solution is needed.\u201dIt has never been easy doing business on the edge of the war zone, in a country with its own rough politics, eye-popping inflation and volatile currency.But in recent weeks the challenges facing Turkish banks and businesses have acquired a new level of intensity that is visible from the streets of Istanbul to the global financial markets. After losing a quarter of its value in a matter of days this month, the currency had recovered some ground before falling again on Friday. Its latest decline came as other emerging market currencies, like the South African rand and the Indian rupee, lost ground as well.The lira\u2019s plunge in value, exacerbated by a dispute with the United States over a detained pastor, has exposed economic pressures that have been gathering for years. And some economists say that they could be reaching a breaking point. Over the past decade, businesses gorged on cheap debt, which is harder to pay back as the lira falls, while banks handed out credit cards like party favors. \u201cA recession is inevitable,\u201d said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. \u201cThe question is whether it\u2019s going to be a soft landing or a hard landing.\u201dTurkey\u2019s problems are so acute, Professor Demiralp said, that only drastic measures would stabilize the lira and contain official inflation of almost 16 percent. She said that the central bank would need to raise the official interest rate to around 28 percent, from 17.75 percent. But the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is widely perceived as controlling the central bank, has shown no willingness to allow even a more modest rate increase or to curtail government spending on public works.In a conference call with investors Thursday, Berat Albayrak, the Turkish finance minister, insisted that the banking system was healthy and promised measures that would bring inflation down to single digits. Mr. Albayrak offered few specifics, according to reports in Turkish and international media. And he ruled out assistance from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 a step many analysts say will be essential to stabilize the economy.Yet there is no sign that Mr. Erdogan is ready to allow measures that would restore investor confidence. Nafez Zouk, chief emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics in London, said he did not think the lira\u2019s recent rally would last.\u201cAs soon as the next big thing hits the headlines,\u201d Mr. Zouk said, \u201cwe are going to be back to square one.\u201dA recession would bring to an end nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth in Turkey. Most young people don\u2019t remember the last serious downturn in 2001. Since then, the country has cut poverty in half, brought millions of people into the middle class and, until recently, been embraced as a darling of international investors. But the growth was built largely on a construction boom fueled by easy credit and government spending. The success story is looking increasingly unsustainable.Even for Turks used to double-digit inflation and wild currency swings, the latest crisis has an ominous feel.On a street called Nur-u Osmaniye, steps from Istanbul\u2019s famous grand bazaar, Arthur Kosaryan nodded toward a large empty storefront opposite the jewelry shop where he works. The space once housed one of Istanbul\u2019s finest antiques shops, Mr. Kosaryan said. But the landlord demanded the rent in dollars.First a wave of terrorist bombings and an aborted coup in 2016 drove away tourists. Then, the lira began a slide early this year that wiped out nearly half its value. The shop owner could no longer afford to pay the rent and went out of business.\u201cIn this volatility people stopped buying things,\u201d Mr. Kosaryan said. \u201cThey are waiting for prices to calm down.\u201dMr. Dalbeler did not say, but some Turkish managers may also be wary that expressions of pessimism would be perceived as unpatriotic in a country where the government has been known to seize assets of people considered disloyal.Even by Turkish standards the steel industry is in a tough spot, as Mr. Dalbeler conceded. President Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on Turkish steel after talks broke down to win the release of the detained pastor, Andrew Brunson.\u201cThere is no way in the steel business you can compete when you have such a disadvantage,\u201d said Mr. Dalbeler, who is also a board member of the Turkish Steel Exporters\u2019 Association, an industry group.Years ago, Mr. Dalbeler said, Iraq was the Turkish steel industry\u2019s biggest market. But the Arab Spring \u2014 seen here as the consequence of American policy \u2014 led to civil war in Syria and severely undercut the Middle East as a market for steel. Turkish steel producers, who specialize in the reinforcing bars used in construction as well as pipes used by the oil industry, adapted in part by increasing sales in the United States.Now they will adapt again, said Namik Kemal Ekinci, head of a separate industry group that represents steel exporters. \u201cWe will be able to find new markets,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump and his advisers, he added, imposed tariffs because they were \u201cjealous of our steel industry.\u201dOn Thursday Istanbul was noticeably calmer than late last week. The lira traded at 5.75 to the dollar, compared with 7 to the dollar at the beginning of the week.In a narrow shop in Istanbul where he trades gold and silver, Gabriel Saglamoglu was defiant. \u201cThe Turkish economy is not going to be destroyed by a single tweet,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement last week on Twitter that he would impose higher steel tariffs.Business was frenzied a few days earlier, Mr. Saglamoglu said, as Turks bought precious metals as a hedge against the turmoil. But things have calmed down in part because of a pledge by Qatar to invest $15 billion in the Turkish economy, he said.But economists considered Qatar\u2019s show of solidarity insignificant in proportion to Turkey\u2019s problems. Loans taken out in dollars are the main source of concern, since a falling lira makes them more expensive.The country\u2019s companies will require $200 billion in financing from foreign banks and investors during 2018 to roll over existing debt, according to estimates by Oxford Economics. Lenders\u2019 willingness to provide that financing is in serious doubt. On paper the number of bad loans in Turkey has not reached alarming levels. But several large Turkish companies have already asked banks for help restructuring their debts in recent months. Economists worry that others could run into trouble and banks may not be able to offer a lifeline.The currency crisis has already begun to reveal the economic weaknesses that had been concealed by breakneck growth. Several Turkish power plants have shut down temporarily because of the soaring cost, in lira terms, of imported fuel, though there have not yet been any blackouts. Companies are finding it more difficult to afford factory machinery and hospitals have been forced to buy cheaper X-ray machines.The pharmacist, Mr. Sarialioglu, who remembers when Ivanka Trump visited the Trump-branded complex in Istanbul several years ago, said he worried about shortages of cancer drugs. They are almost always imported. The Turkish government regulates the cost of drugs, leaving no room for suppliers to raise prices.An earlier version of this article misstated Ugur Dalbeler's position with the Turkish Steel Exporters' Association, an industry group. He is a board member, not the president.Advertisement"}

The State Department says it intends to redirect funds that were meant for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to higher-priority projects elsewhere.During a visit to Israel this week, John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said there were no decisions yet about the details of the American peace plan or when it would be unveiled.Referring to the American plan, Mr. Netanyahu, who heads a right-wing government, many of whose ministers oppose a Palestinian state, said during a visit to Lithuania on Friday, \u201cIt may come, even though I don\u2019t see any urgency on the matter.\u201dPalestinian officials said the aid withdrawal could affect many programs of the United States Agency for International Development, the principal body administering American foreign assistance in the West Bank and Gaza. The agency oversees support for a wide range of issues in the Palestinian territories, including debt relief, economic growth, water and sanitation, education, health and governance.Washington provided about $290 million to the Palestinians in 2016 through the agency and has provided about $5.2 billion in total since 1994.The United States also supplies funds for security assistance, public diplomacy and mine clearance operations.European Union support to the Palestinians amounted to nearly 359 million euros, or about $416 million, in 2017. As well as humanitarian assistance, that money helps fund the salaries of Palestinian Authority employees.Omar Shaban, a Gaza-based analyst on political economy and director of PalThink for Strategic Studies, an independent group, said the aid cut would affect American bodies that have partnerships with local Palestinian nongovernmental organizations. He said it will lead to layoffs and deal a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to local and international groups working on infrastructure projects like road-building.Daniel B. Shapiro, who served as the United States ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, said that successive Israeli governments had seen \u201cgreat value\u201d in the American humanitarian assistance, in part because it saved Israel from shouldering the cost and also because it provided a more secure environment.In an additional blow to the Palestinians, FIFA, the global soccer governing body, on Friday banned Jibril Rajoub, the head of the Palestinian Football Association, from all soccer-related activity for a year for \u201cinciting hatred and violence\u201d over a planned exhibition match between Israel and Argentina that was canceled in June.Iyad Abuheweila contributed reporting from Gaza City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What if the Economy and Markets Are Even Better Than They Look?", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesYou won\u2019t lose much money if you\u2019re prepared for the worst.But what if the good times that are evident in important sectors of the markets and the economy just keep rolling, at least for a while?That bullish possibility has arguably been underplayed, given the strength of the current numbers. And there is a strong, contrarian case that failing to appreciate the power of the current economy and markets will have serious implications that transcend finance and affect politics, too, generally helping Republicans and hurting Democrats.Consider, first, that after months of setbacks, the American stock market reached new highs repeatedly over the last few weeks. In fact, it was one of the best Augusts the stock market has had in years.That statistical snapshot depicts a stock market and an economy that are prospering. Barring an unexpected event, the simplest prediction is that we\u2019ll have more of the same. Why, then, are so many people worried that bad times are coming?In addition, the risk that the markets and economy will be derailed by a truly major political, constitutional, military or trade crisis during the Trump administration, while difficult to quantify, cannot be easily dismissed. There are many potential calamities to choose from. Any one of them could lead to an economic disaster.But timing is everything. Even if you are convinced that disaster is coming, deciding exactly when to take risk out of your portfolio matters tremendously.From a purely financial standpoint, staying on the sidelines in the current bull market has been excruciatingly costly. From the beginning of this year through Thursday, for example, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 9.9 percent. If the market keeps powering ahead, and you avoid stocks entirely because you are afraid of a crash, you will fall further behind.There are political implications, too. There are already ample reasons to suspect that the current strength of the market and the economy is hurting Democrats in their efforts to regain control of Congress in the November midterm elections.Using only economic variables and data from elections over the last century, Professor Fair projects that the Democratic Party is likely to win 50.74 percent of the two-party popular vote for the House. \u201cIt is probably less than what the Democrats need to gain control of the House, although I do not have an equation that translates the vote share into House seats,\u201d he said on his website.In an interview, Professor Fair explained: \u201cI don\u2019t attempt to convert the popular vote into an actual forecast, state-by-state, with all the gerrymandering and other factors that are so important. I leave that to the political scientists.\u201dThe second quarter G.D.P. growth \u2014 a variable in his equation that captures the good feelings generated by the economy and the stock market \u2014 had the effect of subtracting about 1 critical percentage point from the Democratic share in his projection. Another strong showing in the current quarter, which he defines as an annual growth rate of at least 3.2 percent, would move the Republicans ahead in the popular vote in November, according to his algorithm.But he is the first to admit that his equations don\u2019t capture the inimical style of President Trump. For the last presidential election, for example, Professor Fair\u2019s algorithm indicated that economic as well as political factors strongly favored the Republican Party. His projections said Republicans would capture 56 percent of the popular vote, giving its presidential candidate a landslide victory. Professor Fair was off by 7.1 percentage points (though he did project a Trump victory, unlike most forecasters).\u201cHad the Republicans nominated a more mainstream candidate, they may have done much better \u2014 much closer to what the equation was predicting,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d and combative approach to politics could reduce the Republican tally again in the midterm elections, according to Professor Fair, and swing the vote to the Democrats. \u201cI just have no way of capturing that,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s unconventional approach to the presidency is undoubtedly making it more difficult, as well, to accurately assess the trajectory of the markets and the economy themselves.Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst, made that point in a series of reports in August. Mr. Yardeni, who describes himself as \u201ca conservative-leaning fellow,\u201d said that on contentious issues, from tax cuts to trade disputes to deregulation, financial markets have been \u201cgiving quite a bit of weight to the possibility that this all will lead to less protectionism and greater global prosperity\u201d \u2014 and to a rising stock market.That\u2019s not my baseline assumption, but it could happen. What if the stock market keeps ascending, the economy continues to grow, and Mr. Trump and a flock of Republicans do their utmost to take credit for it?I\u2019m hedging my bets.An earlier version of this article misstated the return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index from the beginning of the year through Aug. 30. It was 9.9 percent, not 15.5 percent.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venezuela Is in Crisis but Its President Might Be Stronger for It", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOGOT\u00c1, Colombia \u2014 The widely circulated videos seemed to capture a presidency in free fall.One shows President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela chased by a hungry mob brandishing pots and pans in 2016. In another, Mr. Maduro enters a plaza before Election Day in May to drum up a crowd \u2014 but finds the square practically empty. Then there are the images from this past week: As the president\u2019s stage shakes from an explosion on Saturday, hundreds of troops break ranks and flee in panic.This portrait of vulnerability comes as Venezuela faces the biggest economic crisis in its modern history.And yet, Mr. Maduro has remained in power. Many are now wondering whether he hasn\u2019t only held on in spite of the disasters, but perhaps, by some measure, because of them.\u201cThere\u2019s an area between democracy and outright dictatorship in which economic crises can actually help the leader consolidate power,\u201d said David Smilde, a sociology professor who studies Venezuela at Tulane University.Mr. Maduro has gone to great lengths to court those who might topple him, like Venezuela\u2019s military, which observers have long seen as the most powerful group that could turn on him.As the economy collapsed, leaving the country short of food and medicine and the currency worthless, Mr. Maduro has offered the military the lucrative prizes that remain. Military leaders run the food and oil industries and control the region where gold, diamonds and coltan are mined. So far, the arrangement has secured loyalty, analysts say, as generals calculate that it is more profitable to remain aligned with the current government than to return to democracy, where their future is uncertain.Mr. Maduro could still face the threat of street protests like those that raged in Caracas and other cities for months last year, and left more than 100 dead after the president\u2019s bloody crackdowns. Yet these days, the unrest has petered out. The rallies that still occur are less political now, and often have to do with putting pressure on local officials to restore services like water and electricity. A power failure left 80 percent of Caracas, the capital, without electricity for hours last week, and such shortages are becoming common in other cities.Hebert Garc\u00eda Plaza, a former general who fled the country after the Maduro government accused him of corruption, said Venezuela\u2019s security agencies now shut down protests as soon as they were planned, to prevent another outbreak of demonstrations like those in 2017.\u201cThey remove the tumor at its source,\u201d he said, saying spy agencies now make arrests at any sign of \u201csocial unrest or attempt to rise up.\u201dThe circumstances are reminiscent of some of Latin America\u2019s strongmen of the 20th century. But there are stark differences: If then, generals stood stone-faced in dark sunglasses as military formations stood at attention, Mr. Maduro appears in constant crisis, as was on display Saturday when his national guardsmen fled the attack and he sought cover.It is this kind of uncertainty that Mr. Maduro seems best suited at harnessing to his advantage, many argue. Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst and risk consultant in Caracas, expects that the alleged assassination attempt will be used as further pretext to crack down on possible opponents. The government later arrested six people who they said had made an assassination attempt on Mr. Maduro.\u201cI fear any crazy man may try something like this now,\u201d said Mr. Pantoulas, giving Mr. Maduro further leverage.While Mr. Maduro may not exactly fit the model of a military dictator, he has followed an example left by the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro: He relied on the exodus of unhappy citizens as an escape valve.Mr. Castro\u2019s reign was accompanied by two large migrations that followed his takeover of the government. The first wave was of made up of educated upper- and middle-class Cubans who opposed his 1959 revolution, and the second, of poorer Cubans who fled in boats beginning in the 1980s.Venezuela has seen a similar migrations \u2014 but they have taken place simultaneously.Colombia is now home to almost a million Venezuelans, mainly poor, who have sought refuge there and in Brazil, with which Venezuela also shares a border. Educated Venezuelans have sought refuge in Europe, the United States, as well as some South American countries, like Peru and Chile, which have recruited professionals.The upshot is changing demographics where many of Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents are now outside the country, and many of those who remain have decided to put up with him.\u201cIt leaves a population that is content with what\u2019s going on or tend to be more passive,\u201d said Mr. Smilde, the sociologist.However, Mr. Smilde warns that holding onto power by taking repeated advantage of a crisis is not sustainable in the long-term.He points to the example of the military, whose ranks have received pay increases that have well outpaced wage increases for other workers. Their raises have not, however, outpaced inflation: A typical general, Mr. Smilde estimates, earns about 250 million bol\u00edvars per month, the equivalent of $70. Other patronage measures employed by the Maduro government \u2014 such as allowing cronies to strip state companies of assets \u2014 have been the subject of investigations by American prosecutors.And few economists expect that Mr. Maduro\u2019s latest proposals \u2014 which include removing five zeros from the currency and allowing for foreign trade transactions \u2014 will right Venezuela\u2019s economy, whose major ailment remains deep declines in oil production which Mr. Maduro has yet to resolve.But for now, the president seems content that his formula is working. Though a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the populist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr. Maduro now sometimes flirts with comparisons to leaders who turned to brute force to govern.\u201cThere are people in the world who see me as the Stalin of the Caribbean,\u201d he said in a broadcast late last year. \u201cAnd I look like him. Look at me in profile. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I see Stalin.\u201dAna Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He\u2019s a G.O.P. Immigration Hard-Liner. So Why Is He Trailing in Trump Country?", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYOUNGSTOWN, Pa. \u2014 The two-story house, painted like an American flag and with a giant Trump lawn sign, was a semifamous roadside attraction in 2016. Hundreds of people detoured an hour outside Pittsburgh to take pictures there, and Donald Trump himself tweeted an image of the \u201cTrump House.\u201dNow another election season is underway, and Lou Barletta, a congressman and the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, has cast himself in the Trump mold, hoping to win statewide the way the president did.The Trump House is still in the same place. But the voters may not be.Across the street, three factory workers on a lunch break last week said they had not even heard of Mr. Barletta, who forged his political identity as the mayor of a small city at the other end of the state that he vowed to make \u201cone of the toughest places in the United States\u201d for illegal immigrants.A few blocks down Latrobe Street at the Tin Lizzy Tap Room, Bob Lihan, a retired brewery worker, said that though he thought Mr. Trump was \u201cdoing great,\u201d he planned to vote for Mr. Barletta\u2019s Democratic opponent, Senator Bob Casey Jr., in the fall \u2014 that is, if he votes at all.Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy for keeping Congress in Republican hands has been to excite his base to turn out at the polls in close House and Senate races. That has meant \u2014 more than any other issue \u2014 pushing his hard line on immigration, whether by accusing Democrats of trying to \u201cinfest\u201d the country with illegal immigrants, or by threatening to shut down the government over money for \u201cthe wall.\u201dBut Mr. Barletta\u2019s campaign is lagging far behind Mr. Casey\u2019s in the polls and in fund-raising, even though he is one of the biggest immigration hawks in Congress. His struggles illustrate how Mr. Trump\u2019s lightning-in-a-bottle victory may not be easy to duplicate this year in swing states like Pennsylvania.Mr. Barletta is one of several Republican nominees closely aligned with Mr. Trump who do not appear to be getting much benefit from his endorsements in their general election races. Others include the Senate nominees in Virginia (Corey Stewart, known for defending Confederate monuments) and in West Virginia (Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general and a former pharmaceutical lobbyist).Their difficulties suggest that, while Mr. Trump\u2019s blessing can be crucial in winning a primary, hugging him closely in a general election race can be counterproductive for some Republicans, pushing away independent voters and firing up Democrats who are burning to rebuke the president this fall.Mr. Trump was able to carry Pennsylvania \u2014 something no Republican presidential nominee had done since 1988 \u2014 because places like Westmoreland County, which includes Youngstown and the Trump House east of Pittsburgh, voted for him in huge and unexpected numbers. He won the county, a mainly exurban and rural area that was once a blue-collar Democratic stronghold, by 31 percentage points, a wider margin than in any other major county in the state.Mr. Barletta needs a surge of similar proportions there, because he is expected to underperform in the populous Philadelphia suburbs on account of his divisive immigration views.Notably, though, when Mr. Trump came to Pennsylvania on Thursday to appear at a rally for Mr. Barletta, it was not in strategic western Pennsylvania. It was in the northeast, Mr. Barletta\u2019s home base, where the candidate is already popular.Mr. Trump bashed Mr. Casey as \u201cover rated\u201d and ineffective, omitting that two days earlier he signed a workforce development bill promoted by his daughter Ivanka Trump, which was co-written by Mr. Casey.And, as ever, Mr. Trump dragged the focus away from his party\u2019s candidate, devoting the majority of his time at the rally to his grievances with the news media.A tour of Westmoreland County last week found that dozens of Trump supporters there are only vaguely aware of Mr. Barletta.\u201cI don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about, really,\u201d said Fred Tomlinson, a retired machinist.Some said they would vote for Mr. Barletta anyway, simply because of the \u201cR\u201d after his name. But others said they would sit out the election or vote for Mr. Casey, a two-term incumbent and the son of a former governor.\u201cA lot of pro-Trump voters turned out in 2016 who may not show up in 2018,\u201d said Charlie Gerow, a Republican strategist in Pennsylvania. \u201cThey were disaffected, not folks that generally vote in nonpresidential years. How many of them you can get back to the polls is an interesting question, and a significant challenge.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Barletta challenged both the accuracy of state polls \u2014 recalling how badly they missed Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity here in 2016 \u2014 and the notion that his lack of name recognition was a problem.\u201cHere\u2019s what we do know,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce people do meet me, once people do learn about my record, we catch Casey every single time.\u201d\u201cYou tell me how a blue-collar Democrat that stood in line for two hours to vote for Donald Trump turns around to vote for Bob Casey,\u201d he added.As mayor, Mr. Barletta maintained that the newcomers were bringing crime and drug problems and straining city services. He backed a 2006 ordinance to penalize businesses that hired undocumented immigrants and landlords who rented to them.The ordinance, the Illegal Immigration Relief Act, was overturned in the federal courts and never took effect. But it propelled Mr. Barletta to an appearance on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and, in 2010, a seat in Congress, where he was a leader of the successful 2013 effort to kill a comprehensive immigration bill that had passed the Senate.In March 2016, he endorsed Mr. Trump, becoming one of the first lawmakers to back a candidate whose xenophobic language broke previous norms of acceptability.Voters in Westmoreland County, which is 95 percent white, flocked to Mr. Trump and his hard line on immigration in 2016. But Eric Porterfield, a film producer who grew up in the county, said it was infuriating when outsiders suggested that prejudice was the reason.\u201cIt may appear that if I\u2019m against immigration, that translates into me being a racist,\u201d Mr. Porterfield said, channeling the views of many county residents. \u201cBut really what it means is, I\u2019m afraid. Afraid of my job being lost. Of being displaced from my home.\u201dMr. Porterfield, 58, was having breakfast at Dick\u2019s Diner in Murrysville during a visit home from State College, where he now lives. He recalled an uncle who had lost a steel mill job in the 1970s and wound up working as a short-order cook at Dick\u2019s, the same job he had had as a teenager.But another diner, Michele Clarke, 71, a liberal, said social issues were what mattered most to her conservative neighbors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want the white American culture to change,\u201d said Ms. Clarke, a retired director of parks and recreation in Murrysville.On a hot July evening, a parking lot on Route 22 was filled with American muscle cars of the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s. Barracudas, Mustangs and Thunderbirds in glistening paint jobs sat displayed with their hoods open to show off spotless engines.The owners sat in camp chairs on the surrounding lawn, in sight of a pro-Barletta billboard across the highway showing an empty suit and saying \u201cBob Casey: 12 Years of Nothing.\u201dBill Adams, owner of a black 1965 Cobra, said he was unfamiliar with Mr. Barletta, but would vote for him out of support for Mr. Trump, to \u201ckeep the good times rolling.\u201dThere was plenty of cynicism about all politicians among the retired salesmen, utility linemen and factory workers who owned the cars. One man (white 1965 Mustang) was still furious that Bill Clinton had lied about having sex with Monica Lewinsky. Another (1972 Cutlass) said he would wait to make up his mind a week before Election Day. \u201cI\u2019ll read their lies then, and pick out the one that\u2019s the least agitating to me,\u201d he said.Though they knew little of Mr. Barletta, the car collectors mostly supported the president\u2019s stance on immigration. Some praised his policy of separating children from parents at the border, which Mr. Trump rescinded under intense pressure.\u201cThey all came here illegally \u2014 now, all these people are protesting because these kids are not with their parents,\u201d Darryl Lender said. \u201cHey, put them all in a boat and send them back where they came from and let them sort it out. Why should we pay for it?\u201dEven so, Mr. Lender, who retired from customer service for a gas utility, is an ambivalent Trump supporter, unsure how he will vote in the fall. \u201cI think he\u2019s got the country in turmoil,\u201d he said of the president.Back in Youngstown, the real estate investor who owns the Trump House, Leslie Rossi, definitely knows who Mr. Barletta is. She decided in 2016 to paint the house, which is unoccupied, to increase awareness of Mr. Trump.But she fears that his surge of support that year may have been a one-off, unrepeatable in the midterms, especially since most voters in Westmoreland County are registered as Democrats.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for them to step out of the box and vote for every Republican,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone will win Westmoreland County the way Trump did.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the former occupation of Darryl Lender, an ambivalent supporter of President Trump. Mr. Lender worked for a gas utility; he did not work in a steel mill.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trade War Intensifies, China Moves to Bolster Its Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As China\u2019s economy slows and the trade war with the United States intensifies, Beijing\u2019s economic bosses are swinging into action.\u201cIt\u2019s a line in the sand for the leadership\u201d of China, said Hao Hong, the research director for the international operations of the Bank of Communications, a Shanghai-based financial institution.China is taking action as its problems mount. On Thursday the United States formally enacted its previously threatened tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese-made goods. Beijing said it would immediately retaliate with its own tariffs and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The moves intensify a trade war that has already affected more than $100 billion of goods and cast a shadow over growth prospects for China and the world.China is playing a difficult game. It must deal with its weakening economy without worsening its onerous debt problems. At the same time, it has to shore up the situation at home if it hopes to continue to retaliate against President Trump\u2019s trade war broadsides.So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China\u2019s vast, $12 trillion economy. But the trade war complicates China\u2019s deeper problems with its onerous debt levels. China has worked to wean its economy off its dependence on borrowing, but the resulting slowdown in growth has undercut that effort, leading Beijing to relent somewhat from the initiative. Should the trade war take a greater toll, China could direct its banks to expand lending further.\u201cThe Chinese government always oscillates between maintaining stability and achieving quality growth,\u201d said Zhigang Tao, a Hong Kong University economist. \u201cWhen you see the government switch to stimulus, it generally means the government cares about stability.\u201dChina\u2019s softening economy has led some within the Trump Administration to believe Beijing is vulnerable, which could lead the White House to escalate the trade war even further. Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, pointed out during a Cabinet meeting last week that China\u2019s own official statistics for business investment, retail sales and industrial production have shown weakness in recent months.\u201cRight now, their economy looks terrible,\u201d he said during the meeting, which was open to the media.The city of Harbin, a provincial capital in northeastern China, ran out of money last month to pay pensioners, and had to rearrange its finances to pay them later. Corporate bond defaults have increased this year, although they are still low by international standards. The country\u2019s banks acknowledged last month a fairly sharp uptick in nonperforming loans, although that was partly driven by tighter auditing standards.Signals of serious financial and economic weakness have prompted the Beijing authorities to rush out their series of measures since the end of July.China is taking steps to make sure its companies and spenders have enough money. The central bank announced on Aug. 10 that it would make sure enough credit reached companies. China\u2019s banking regulator announced on Aug. 11 and again over the weekend that it wanted the country\u2019s state-controlled banking sector to provide ample credit to exporters, small and medium-size businesses and infrastructure projects.The authorities are also encouraging local projects. The Finance Ministry is helping deeply indebted local governments borrow far more money this autumn so that they can restart stalled infrastructure projects. China\u2019s central planners have allowed a series of big local government projects to proceed that had previously been blocked because of debt concerns. This includes the construction of five subway and light rail lines in Changchun, a big industrial city in northeastern China where Toyota, the Japanese automaker, has extensive facilities.The financial markets are getting a boost as well.Meanwhile, the stock market has risen in a move that analysts say has been helped by intervention from big, government-connected investors, a group sometimes known as the National Team. On Friday, Chinese share prices fell to their lowest closing level since early 2016. But through Thursday, the Shanghai stock market had risen almost 2 percent this week.Other data show how China is trying to pull off a difficult balancing act. Even as Chinese officials push for more lending, a broader measure of borrowing showed the overall flow of fresh credit slowed in July. That suggested lingering effects from the authorities\u2019 previous efforts to crack down on some of the murkier parts of the vast but rickety Chinese financial system.Tolerating even more borrowing by heavily indebted local governments is a short-term measure that could create long-term problems.\u201cThe focus is no longer on deleveraging, but on transferring leverage from one sector to another,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.The injections of money by the government into the economy now may offset the withdrawal of money last spring during the deleveraging campaign, but may not be enough to spur an actual boom in the debt-laden Chinese economy, said Rodney Jones, a principal at Wigram Capital Advisors, a Beijing economic research firm.\u201cI\u2019m really skeptical that stimulus creates a surge of growth like we have seen in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI think stimulus takes out some of the downside.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

Here, you can view coral, fish and sharks native to the Indo-Pacific Reefs.The exhibit also lays down some truth: We humans are a greater threat to sharks than they are to us. We learn about finning and overfishing, and an interactive room is devoted entirely to pollution, plastics in particular.If kids are in tow, the afternoon is a great time to see the entire aquarium, which includes outdoor exhibits (hi, penguins) and a water show featuring a dabbing sea lion.But if it\u2019s you and your crew (which is also cool, promise), come for the last of their summer night hours; this weekend, the aquarium is open till 10 p.m. Friday through Sunday.

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Even President Trump\u2019s fiercest critics can find something to applaud in the administration\u2019s campaign to protect and advance religious freedom around the world. But the initiative\u2019s good intentions are in danger of being undermined by the administration\u2019s political agenda, which emphasizes the American strain of evangelical Christianity over other beliefs. In addition, the administration is pursuing immigration and foreign aid policies that belie its stated defense of religious rights. Yet, the event, headlined by Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, was clearly meant to appeal most to the evangelicals who are among the president\u2019s most fervent political supporters, reflecting a selectivity that is antithetical to the very concept of religious freedom. President Barack Obama made a point of reaching out to the Muslim world, as well as to other faith communities. And like previous presidents, he tended to consider religious rights within the broad spectrum of human and civil rights. Countries that deny religious freedom invariably restrict other freedoms as well.Supporting people facing religious persecution overseas is both a moral burden of the United States and an exercise in self-interest. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, religious freedom is \u201can essential building block for all free societies.\u201d But it is not the only one. If the Trump administration aspires to truly advance religious freedom, it will need to embrace a far broader vision of human rights.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Connecticut, Ned Lamont Scores a Decisive Win, and Jahana Hayes Moves Closer to History", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNed Lamont, a wealthy businessman whose prior bid for governor fell short, won the Democratic nomination in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday, handily beating his sole opponent according to The Associated Press, and sounding buoyant about keeping the governorship in Democratic hands.Democrats also chose Jahana Hayes in the state\u2019s Fifth Congressional District, the A.P. reported. Ms. Hayes, a \u201cNational Teacher of the Year\u201d in 2016, is seeking to become the state\u2019s first black Democrat to serve in Congress.Unlike Ms. Hayes, Mr. Lamont, who will face the Republican Bob Stefanowski in November, was far more of a known quantity. Voters may have looked to Mr. Lamont\u2019s electoral history, in particular an upset victory he pulled off more than a decade ago, in tapping him for the Democratic line.In 2006, Mr. Lamont upset the political order when he staged a shocking upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the Democratic congressional primary. He then lost the general election to Mr. Lieberman, who ran as an independent. Four years later, he lost to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in the Democratic primary for governor.But in a feisty victory speech in New Haven, Mr. Lamont focused on the future and invoked President Trump as much as his Republican opponent in November.\u201cYou guys more than anybody know that elections matter,\u201d he said, referring to the election of Mr. Trump. \u201cWe found that out the hard way 18 months ago.\u201dThen he turned to his looming general election opponent, adding, \u201cThis is a new breed of Trump Republican and we\u2019re not going to let them take over our state. We are fighting for Connecticut values, not Trump values. This is a state that celebrates diversity and opportunity for all.\u201dWith five Republicans seeking the nomination, Mr. Stefanowski won with only 29 percent of the vote; his closest rival, Mark D. Boughton, had 21 percent.\u201cWe would have liked a better outcome,\u201d Mr. Boughton said in a concession speech, \u201cbut unfortunately the cards weren\u2019t with us tonight. I want to congratulate Bob Stefanowski on a strong win tonight.\u201dIn a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by five to three, Mr. Stefanowski may be considered the underdog in November. But the Republican candidates hoped to capitalize on disenchantment with the outgoing governor, Mr. Malloy, a two-term Democrat who decided not to run for re-election. A recent survey by Morning Consult a polling firm, found that Mr. Malloy was the least popular governor in the country.Mr. Lamont, 64, and the Republican challengers talked extensively about the state\u2019s ailing economy during their respective campaigns. But they offered very different solutions to the multibillion-dollar deficits and corporate defections that have nagged at Connecticut.On his campaign website, Mr. Stefanowski said with a two-year budget exceeding $40 billion, \u201cthere are plenty of opportunities to identify savings and efficiencies.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Lamont believes the solution to the economic woes lies in targeted investments, particularly in transportation and job training. On the campaign trail, he inveighed against the lack of a skilled work force, citing the frustration of employers who could not fill thousands of good-paying jobs.This time around, Mr. Lamont is counting on the anger at Mr. Trump among Democrats to inspire a so-called blue wave in the general election.But he also appealed to voters\u2019 unease about jobs and the economy in his victory speech, nodding to his successful career in the telecommunications field. In 1984, he founded Lamont Digital Systems and pioneered the wiring of colleges campuses. In 2015, Mr. Lamont sold the business to a Texas company.\u201cHow about the first governor in generations who actually started a business and created jobs?\u201d he asked the appreciative crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to do \u2014 get this state going again, get this state growing again.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in recent years world-changing has been co-opted by the rich and the powerful.At first, you think: Rich people making a difference \u2014 so generous! Until you consider that America might not be in the fix it\u2019s in had we not fallen for the kind of change these winners have been selling: fake change.This is how the winners benefit from their own kindness: It lets them redefine change, and defang it.Mr. Tovar wasn\u2019t denying the $150 billion in wealth, or that more of it could have been paid as wages. Rather, he seemed to suggest that charity made up for these facts.The rub against such an idea isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s also that it dilutes our idea of change. It casts an app and a safety net as the same.Fake change, and what it allows to fester, paved the road for President Trump. He tapped into a feeling that the American system was rigged and that establishment elites were in it for themselves. Then, darkly, he deflected that anger onto the most vulnerable Americans. And having benefited from the hollowness of fake change, he became it \u2014 a rich man who styles himself as the ablest protector of the underdogs, who pretends that his interests have nothing to do with the changes he seeks.President Trump is what we get when we trust the rich to fix what they are complicit in breaking.In 2016, Mr. Trump and many of the world-changing elite leaders I am writing about were, for the most part, on opposite sides. Yet those elites and the president have one thing in common: a belief that the world should be changed by them, for the rest of us, not by us. They doubt the American creed of self-government.A successful society is a progress machine, turning innovations and fortuitous developments into shared advancement. America\u2019s machine is broken. Innovations fly at us, but progress eludes us. A thousand world-changing initiatives won\u2019t change that. Instead, we must reform the basic systems that allow people to live decently \u2014 the systems that decide what kind of school children attend, whether politicians listen to donors or citizens, whether or not people can tend to their ailments, whether they are paid enough, and with sufficient reliability, to make plans and raise kids.There are a significant number of winners who recognize their role in propping up a bad system. They might be convinced that solving problems for all, at the root, will mean higher taxes, smaller profits and fewer homes. Changing the world asks more than giving back. It also takes giving something up.Advertisement"}

At some point, being good with money requires something a bit more difficult: earning more of it. As awkward as the conversation can be, making more money often means asking for more money. But for many of us, the idea of asking for a raise is unimaginably awkward. It feels audacious and greedy, like you might as well be asking for a kidney or firstborn child.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re limited to that opportunity to discuss your salary and seek an adjustment,\u201d Ms. Smiley said.\u201cYou want to enter a salary negotiation on a high note, with indisputable evidence of the value you\u2019re contributing to the company,\u201d Ms. Smiley said. Evidence is important. If you\u2019re overdue for a raise, simply asking might be all you need to do, but it can\u2019t hurt to be prepared. \u201cFor example, instead of saying that you had \u2018great success in the new product launch\u2019, try \u2018the launch exceeded target by 10 percent, bringing in 1,000 new customers,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smiley said. Think about the situation from your boss\u2019s perspective. Quantifiable evidence makes it easier for them to approach the higher-ups and ask for an increase, based on value.\u201cWomen should be extra prepared with documentation and comparison information,\u201d she said.Ms. Smiley suggested a quick script you can use when you ask for a meeting: \u201cI\u2019d like to meet to discuss my performance, contribution and compensation.\u201d Use your own words, of course, depending on your relationship with your employer, but be specific in your invite and mention you\u2019d like to talk about salary so your request doesn\u2019t come as an uncomfortable surprise.\u201cThey\u2019re likely to know if the process is as perfectly mapped as the corporate flow chart would have you believe, or if there\u2019s an unofficial timetable that emerges instead,\u201d Ms. Smiley said.\u201cAsking for a salary increase based on your achievements is nothing to be sorry about,\u201d Ms. Smiley said. \u201cAnd if you lead with an excuse, don\u2019t be surprised when it comes right back at you along with a \u2018no.\u2019\u201dThis dialogue is polite and straightforward. You also want to show you\u2019re engaged, Ms. Smiley said. Try something like: \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying my work. Leading the Big Win Project was especially rewarding.\u201d From there, go in for the ask. If you\u2019re looking for a raise to match a new or enhanced role at your company, here\u2019s what you can say: \u201cTaking into consideration my experience and the responsibilities of this position, my salary expectation is X dollars.\u201d If you\u2019re simply asking for a raise in your current role, this will do: \u201cBased on my successful track record in this role, I\u2019m requesting a salary lift of X percent.\u201dAgain, speaking up can often be more difficult for women or people who aren\u2019t socialized to be assertive. In that case, it can\u2019t hurt to practice.\u201cOne recommendation is building negotiation experience and training,\u201d Dr. Stuhlmacher said. \u201cPracticing in low stakes situations can build confidence.\u201d This might mean calling a bill provider and haggling a lower rate. Or speaking up when you want a different table at a restaurant. Get comfortable asking for small things, which will make it easier to ask for something big, like a raise.\u201cAnd make sure you book another review in six months to discuss progress and compensation.\u201d Set the expectation that once you further develop these skills, it will be time to revisit the compensation conversation.Remember, this can be a difficult conversation to have.

{"Headline": "Blame Trump\u2019s Tariffs and the Weather. New York\u2019s Farmers Do.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "A drought, flash floods, the trade war and tightening immigration policy have combined to cause an economic crisis for New York farmers.Supported byPENN YAN, N.Y. \u2014 For the first three weeks of July, Peter Martens prayed for rain. At the end of the month the rain finally arrived, but by then it was too late for some of his crops. For others, it was too much water, too quickly.The lack of rain, Mr. Martens said, will reduce his corn yield by about 20 percent, but the late-summer deluges damaged the quality of his spelt, a type of wheat.New York\u2019s extreme weather this summer, which began with a drought followed by flash flooding, has been enough to make it a difficult season for the state\u2019s farmers.But farmers say President Trump\u2019s trade war and his administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration have made a bad summer far worse.Red numbers are filling farmers\u2019 balance sheets: Mr. Martens\u2019s butternut squash is covered in weeds because he did not have enough workers, at the right time, to hoe the field and now his yield will be far less than he expected. He is also nervous about selling his red kidney beans because higher tariffs abroad threaten to drive down the price as international markets disappear.\u201cThere was always something that did well,\u201d Mr. Martens said about the variety of crops on his farm in Penn Yan, N.Y. \u201cNow if nothing does well, what do you do?\u201dIn New York, the combination of the administration\u2019s policies and the weather is threatening to decimate the state\u2019s $37 billion agriculture and food-processing industry.\u201cI\u2019ve never had them all at one time,\u201d said Dale Stein, a dairy farmer in Le Roy, N.Y.\u201cYou\u2019ll deal with a drought here. You\u2019ll deal with a bad price year. You deal with a major labor issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all this year. It\u2019s a compounded problem this year, and I think it\u2019s got an awful lot of farmers saying \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019\u201dPat McCormick, a seventh-generation dairy farmer in Java Center, N.Y., said that for the first time his family has discussed the possibility of selling the farm.\u201cWe love working with the cows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love working in the field. But just with the way the financial picture is, do we really want to keep struggling like we are?\u201dOne indicator of the crisis in New York is an increase in the number of farms on the market. Tom Hosking, who runs an agriculture auction service, said in a busy year he might help sell five farms in New York. This year he has already sold 20.Mr. Stein usually has to strain his neck to see the top of the stalks of corn that typically reach 12 feet. This year he is almost at eye level with the six-foot stalks. The drought deprived the crop of water, stunting its growth and reducing his yield of corn to feed his nearly 2,000 cows. As a result, Mr. Stein estimated he will spend between $15,000 and $20,000 a month to feed them \u2014 until next year\u2019s harvest.Arthur T. DeGaetano, an earth science professor at Cornell University who is also the director of the Northeast Regional Climate Center, points to the changing climate to explain the more unpredictable weather that New York has been seeing recently: this year, a dry July followed by flooding in August.\u201cYou don\u2019t have these years where you can kick back and do what you normally do,\u201d Professor DeGaetano said. \u201cYou have to worry about bringing water in. You have to worry about irrigating your crop. You have to worry about whether you can get into the field early enough to plant corn because it may be too wet to get equipment in there.\u201dFor Dale Mattoon, the owner of Pine Hollow Dairy in Locke, N.Y., the extreme weather also tightens his farming schedule.\u201cIt changes the way you go about your work because the weather windows are smaller, so you have to get more done in less time,\u201d he said.As a result, Mr. Mattoon said he has had to buy larger equipment that can do the work faster and more efficiently, purchases that strained the already-tight finances of a farm that has not made a profit selling dairy for the past three years.In June, Ron Robbins, who owns North Harbor Dairy in Sackets Harbor, N.Y., finally saw a reason to be optimistic. After three years of low prices for his four main commodities \u2014 milk, soybeans, wheat and corn \u2014 the pricing forecasts for this season were positive.\u201cI was looking at being able to secure some prices that were finally going to put us at profitable levels,\u201d he said.Then the tariffs hit.\u201cSo everything collapsed,\u201d he said.Mr. Robbins said he is losing more than $50,000 a month on milk production: It costs him $16.50 to produce 100 pounds of milk, but the price he got in July for three million pounds of milk was $14.78 per 100 pounds. He also expects a significantly lower profit on his soybeans.\u201cIn most cases, a good share of growth in these markets has been through exports markets,\u201d Ms. Ifft said.\u201cIt\u2019s just a very low margin environment right now, which is sort of normal for agriculture,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when there are these repeated shocks, that\u2019s when it gets hard for people.\u201dBut New York farmers are skeptical of the aid package.\u201cIt\u2019s offering a Band-Aid to buy some votes,\u201d said Craig Yunker, who owns CY Farms in Elba, N.Y. \u201cI think it\u2019s thrown out there to try to mollify the farm belt ahead of the midterms.\u201dMr. Stein, who is losing roughly $55,000 a month because of low dairy prices and a lackluster growing season, sold 23 extra cows in July to pay his bills.\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to break even and that\u2019s the issue,\u201d he said.Mr. Yunker planned to get a head start on growing onions this year so he sent his seeds to Arizona to start germinating. He would have had them back by April to plant but he canceled his order. He knew he was not going to have enough workers to tend to the labor-intensive crop.\u201cThe labor market is very tight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find qualified employees. The local papers are full of ads.\u201dDairy farmers, in particular, require year-round workers to milk cows, but there are no visa programs for migrant dairy workers. As a result, experts estimate that undocumented immigrants make up a significant percentage of the labor force on New York dairy farms. But the Trump administration\u2019s strict immigration measures are making it more difficult to fill job openings.\u201cThat flow has really, really diminished since the new administration and the increased border security that has taken place,\u201d said Richard E. Stup, an agricultural work force specialist at Cornell University.A strong economy, both nationally and statewide, has also made it more challenging to find farm workers.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of jobs in the town nearby or other businesses nearby that\u2019s just going to be very attractive for them to go somewhere else and not work on farms,\u201d Mr. Stup said.Mike McMahon, the owner of E-Z Acres dairy farm in Homer, N.Y., said that one of his most trusted employees who oversees the hospital and maternity barn recently told him that he was leaving to take a construction job that pays $20 an hour, $7 more than he makes on the farm.\u201cThis business doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make that kind of money in this business.\u201dWith a diversified business that includes interactive farm tours and a trucking business that transports agricultural products throughout the region, Mr. Robbins said he was confident that he would be able to ride out the difficult season. Still, he worries about the future of farming in the state.\u201cWe are vulnerable for corporate takeover,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers like ourselves could just become servants to those corporations.\u201dNearly all of the 35,500 farms operating in New York are family-owned. From 2012 to 2017, about 17 percent of the state\u2019s dairy farms closed, leaving 4,490 as of last year, according to the New York Farm Bureau.Jeff Williams, the public policy director for the New York Farm Bureau, said farmers are dealing with the worst economic crisis he has witnessed in his roughly 20 years of working for the bureau, which lobbies on behalf of the state\u2019s agriculture industry.\u201cIt could be a watershed moment in New York,\u201d Mr. Williams said.Richard A. Ball, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, was more optimistic, pointing to New York\u2019s natural resources, including rich soil and an abundant supply of water. He also said some fruit crops, such as apples, had productive growing seasons.\u201cWe have a dangerous situation, but there\u2019s also an opportunity to rethink things and maybe realign ourselves and find ourselves in a good place long term,\u201d Mr. Ball said.But Mr. Stein, the dairy farmer in Le Roy, said this summer\u2019s stresses have taken a toll on his children, who are taking over the family farm.\u201cI\u2019m getting close to retirement and they\u2019re just getting started,\u201d Mr. Stein, 64, said. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging to them that the combination of everything is so bad. They\u2019re worried about the long-term effects. They don\u2019t want it this hard every year. It\u2019s just not going to be worth doing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hits Turkey When It\u2019s Down, Doubling Tariffs", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Friday that he would double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, inflicting additional pain on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country is in the midst of an economic crisis.In a Twitter post on Friday morning, Mr. Trump said the United States would bump Turkey\u2019s aluminum tariffs to 20 percent and steel tariffs to 50 percent and cited the country\u2019s deteriorating currency, the Turkish lira. \u201cOur relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u201d he said.I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.7 percent. The dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. dollar index, was up more than 0.8 percent, a relatively large move for the currency. Investors flocked to the safety of American government bonds, pushing yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.87 percent, a sign that jittery investors were hungry for secure places to park their money.Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of the currency suggested he is concerned that a rapid depreciation in Turkey\u2019s currency has essentially mitigated the effect of his tariffs. Since a weaker currency makes it less expensive for countries to export their goods, the tariffs carry less punch. By doubling the rate, Mr. Trump\u2019s levies will continue to hurt Turkish metal exporters.Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the president\u2019s move sent a \u201cworrisome\u201d signal to the world.\u201cHe is tweeting that when a crisis emerges \u2014 which could happen in Turkey \u2014 his gut instinct is to exacerbate the problem by imposing more tariffs, instead of stepping in with leadership to help resolve the emergency,\u201d Mr. Bown said.Ruhsar Pekcan, the Turkish minister of trade, said Turkey was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the decision to double the tariffs. \u201cThe tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now,\u201d Ms. Pekcan said.\u201cThe effects of this ill-advised action by the U.S. Administration will not only impact Turkey, but will prove detrimental to American companies and workers as well,\u201d she added.Turkey ships little aluminum to the United States, but it is America\u2019s sixth largest foreign supplier of steel. American companies that source metals from Turkey are bracing for a further impact, after already seeing their prices rise this year as a result of the tariffs.Joseph Casucci, the chief executive of FJM Ferro Inc, which erects steel columns for large residential and commercial building projects on the East Coast, said he expected the president\u2019s decision to further push up the price of steel rebar, of which Turkey is a major supplier. That will put further financial pressure on a range of companies involved in construction, especially mom-and-pop shops that have less ability to stockpile materials, he said. His company has already seen steel costs rise by 35 percent to 50 percent this year.\u201cI\u2019d love to know when these tariffs are going to subside. That\u2019s the big question in my industry, when does this end?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt becomes challenging.\u201dIn his tendency to mix trade goals with other political concerns, Mr. Trump has deviated from decades of government practice. He suggested earlier this year that he might soften his trade approach to China in return for Beijing\u2019s help in dealing with the North Korean regime, and repeatedly tied Mexican trade practices with immigration issues.Ross Wilson, the former ambassador to Turkey, said that while past administrations had used economic tools to accomplish foreign policy goals, the president\u2019s use of a specific tariff threats was unprecedented.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to tell from the specific words that came out, but it certainly appears to be a political step taken in response to the continued detention of Andrew Brunson and the president\u2019s irritation with that state of affairs,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.If the doubling of the tariffs was in fact direct retaliation for the treatment of the pastor, Mr. Trump would be undermining the stated rationale of the steel and aluminum tariffs \u2014 to protect American metals producers considered vital for national security. That could invite further legal challenges from other countries, who have already brought complaints about the steel and aluminum tariffs to the World Trade Organization.A White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said on Friday that the president had authorized the increase in tariffs based on a threat to national security.But a key Republican ally of Mr. Trump, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, appeared to attribute the tariff escalation directly to the dispute over the pastor, saying in a tweet:Another Republican senator, Rob Portman of Ohio, reiterated a previous warning to Mr. Trump against \u201cmisuse\u201d of the section of the law that allows the president to impose tariffs on national security grounds:Steel industry representatives stood by the president, saying that the drop in the Turkish currency would have given the country an advantage over other steel producers and reduced the effectiveness of his trade measure.\u201cThere are limits, of course, but exchange rates and tariff level revisions must be considered to sustain the level of relief provided to America\u2019s steelmakers on the basis of national security concerns,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and steel workers. \u201cThat\u2019s well within the administration\u2019s authority.\u201dEswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the use of tariffs in this scenario set \u201ca worrying precedent for future trade sanctions that could be triggered by purely market-driven changes in exchange rates.\u201d\u201cIt could serve as a template for further tariff actions against China if the renminbi depreciates further relative to the dollar, even if that depreciation were mainly a reflection of the relative strength of the U.S. and Chinese economies,\u201d Mr. Prasad said.The currencies of other emerging markets slumped in response to Turkey\u2019s sell-off Friday. South Africa\u2019s rand dropped more than 2.5 percent. Argentina\u2019s peso fell by about 4 percent. The currencies of Russia, Brazil and Mexico all dropped by more than 1 percent, according to FactSet data.On Friday, Mr. Erdogan appealed directly to Turks, asking them to use any dollars, euros or gold they owned to purchase domestic currency. The Turkish lira plummeted against the dollar Friday, dropping by more than 13 percent.Stock markets in the country dropped by more than 2 percent on Friday. Prices for Turkish government bonds fell, pushing interest rates sharply higher. The yield on the 3-year lira-denominated Turkish government bond has risen to more than 23 percent in recent days. At the start of the year, the bond was yielding around 10 percent, according to Bloomberg data.A previous version of this article referred incorrectly to Ruhsar Pekcan, Turkey\u2019s minister of trade. Ms. Pekcan is a woman.Matt Phillips reported from New York. Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

It starts forming well before dawn. The demand is so great that it has bred a cottage industry of hustlers here in the capital who camp out on the sidewalk and sell places in line to the highest bidder.It is one of many indications that something is gravely wrong here in Nicaragua.With a violent political crisis that has ruined the economy and challenged President Daniel Ortega\u2019s hold on power, people are fleeing the country in droves.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible reality,\u201d said Milt\u00f3n, 36, who was far back in line, and asked that his surname not be published for fear of government reprisals. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sustainable country.\u201dHuman rights advocates contend that at least 300, and maybe as many as 450 people, have been killed and thousands wounded since the protests began, and that the vast majority were demonstrators shot by the police or by paramilitary forces working in concert with the authorities.The Nicaraguan Pro-Human Rights Association, an advocacy group, said that nearly 600 people, mainly opponents to the government, had been kidnapped and that hundreds more were missing and possibly \u201cdisappeared.\u201dIn the face of the government crackdown, street protests, once a daily occurrence, have subsided, replaced by the occasional peaceful march. But the crisis has entered a new phase, colored by widespread dread and a paralyzing uncertainty over what comes next.\u201cTotal anxiety,\u201d said Msgr. Carlos Avil\u00e9s Cant\u00f3n, the vicar general of the Archdiocese of Managua. \u201cEvery day waking up and asking, \u2018How many deaths?\u2019 Death, death, death. That\u2019s what makes you sad.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in a very difficult stage,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Leiva, the director of the Nicaraguan Association. \u201cIt\u2019s the stage of repression.\u201dHundreds of protest leaders have gone into hiding or fled the country. Mr. Leiva said his team members had been threatened \u2014 it is unclear by whom \u2014 and forced to move out of their homes and sleep in a network of safe houses.Mr. Ortega, who has refused the opposition\u2019s demands to step down or hold early elections, has responded with a publicity blitz, giving interviews to several international news organizations, in which he has deflected blame for the bloodshed and sought to convey that the country is returning to normal.But even some of Mr. Ortega\u2019s closest allies acknowledge that Nicaragua is a mess. In an interview with The New York Times late last month, Paul Oquist, the minister-private secretary for national policy, recognized the sense of fear and uncertainty in Nicaraguan society \u2014 on both sides of the conflict.He seemed particularly concerned about the damage the nation\u2019s economy had suffered, calling it \u201cenormous.\u201d\u201cWe have to see what can be salvaged,\u201d he lamented.Tens of thousands of workers have been furloughed or laid off. Thousands of companies have closed. Foreign direct investment has nearly halted, and credit has been choked off.The tourism industry has suffered widespread layoffs as the flow of international visitors has slowed to barely a trickle, and international airlines have slashed the number of inbound flights. About 80 percent of the country\u2019s small hotels, which provide the vast majority of rooms, are closed, as are about a third of the country\u2019s restaurants, said Lucy Valenti, the president of Nicaragua\u2019s National Tourism Chamber.\u201cThe first thing tourists look for is security,\u201d Ms. Valenti said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t guarantee that they will find security in Nicaragua.\u201dIn Granada, a jewel of Nicaragua\u2019s once-vibrant tourism industry, the colonial streets used to be full of visitors from abroad, visiting churches, tooling around in horse-drawn carriages or relaxing in its courtyard cafes. But on a recent afternoon, there wasn\u2019t a tourist in sight.Osman Guadamuy, languishing in the cab of his horse carriage in Granada\u2019s central square, said business had never been so bad. In a week, he had been hired by tourists only once: a Mexican couple who wanted a tour of the city.If he sold his horses, that might support his family through the rest of the year, at which he point, he said, he would probably have to migrate to Costa Rica.The moribund state of affairs here in Nicaragua becomes most apparent at night, particularly in Managua and other cities, when fear of paramilitary forces and criminals taking advantage of the disorder drives Nicaraguans indoors.Businesses start closing in the midafternoon and employees head home. By dusk, restaurants and bars have gone dark, and a de facto curfew goes into effect.\u201cWe feel like prisoners in our houses,\u201d said Xochilt Aguirre, the general manager of the Hotel Plaza Col\u00f3n in Granada.Throughout Nicaragua, lives have been turned upside down. At the beginning of the year, Laura Flores had a thriving yoga business and a new landscaping company. Then the crisis erupted.Nearly all of her yoga clients fled the country, as did most of her closest friends. Her nascent landscaping business dried up, and as the body count mounted, she began to fear for her own safety.\u201cMy independence went to hell,\u201d she said. She has decided to join relatives in the United States.The uprising against Mr. Ortega came about so quickly that it seemed to catch everyone by surprise, even the opposition.\u201cWhen I went to the university and I saw a barricade for the first time, I said, \u2018I never imagined that we were going to be in Managua fighting against the police,\u2019\u201d said Harley Morales, 26, a student leader of the opposition. \u201cI never imagined it.\u201dMr. Morales is now in hiding, as are many opposition leaders. The fear of reprisals extends across the Nicaraguan population, including those who have participated in marches or have been critical of the Ortega administration on social media. People now carefully watch what they say, and whom they say it to.On a recent morning, the small offices of the Nicaraguan Pro-Human Rights Association was crowded with people waiting to file reports of threats, violence and persecution.Jos\u00e9, a barber who was afraid to give his last name, said he had received death threats for posting criticism of the Ortega administration on his social media accounts. He closed his business and fled his home.He said men disguised in balaclavas had appeared at his house, forced their way past his wife and two young children and ransacked the place, as well as his barbershop.\u201cI\u2019m scared they\u2019re going to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey kill, they imprison, they torture.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no law in Nicaragua,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that can defend you.\u201dMost people seem to agree that the best way out of the crisis is through political negotiation, not weapons. Opposition leaders, government officials, human rights activists, international diplomats, people in the street \u2014 they all speak of the need for \u201cdialogue.\u201d\u201cNeither side can impose a settlement on the other, because that would not end the violence,\u201d Mr. Oquist said.It is hard to gauge how much support Mr. Ortega has. But those who do support him cite his arguments that he was legitimately elected, that the Constitution should govern whether he stays or leaves, and that the opposition is at fault for plunging the country into violence and disarray.\u201cThere have been some mistakes,\u201d Ms. Sandino added, speaking about the Ortega administration. \u201cBut they\u2019re correctable.\u201dShe passed a cluster of police officers by the side of the road. \u201cI love you!\u201d she said, blowing them kisses. \u201cI love you! I love you!\u201dThe longer the political impasse persists, many warn, the more likely that elements of the opposition may take up arms.\u201cThe dialogue has to come back,\u201d Mr. Oquist said, predicting that the country would \u201csink into anarchy\u201d if Mr. Ortega were ousted.There is already a sense that order is fragile, and that an anarchic slide has already begun.In April, squatters began to descend on certain parcels of private land around the country, constructing rudimentary settlements of plywood, two-by-fours and plastic sheeting. Armed gangs sometimes led the way, looting and paving the way for the squatter camps.Aggrieved property owners and other critics accuse the Ortega administration of orchestrating the takeovers in retribution for the business community\u2019s support for the opposition movement.Nearly 13,000 acres of private property \u2014 including farmland, forests, mining areas and land intended for housing developments \u2014 have been overrun in at least 37 land grabs across seven states, according to the Union of Agricultural Producers of Nicaragua, a trade group.But many landowners, receiving no help from the authorities, have felt powerless to do much about it.\u201cThe property owners are left defenseless,\u201d said Julio Mungu\u00eda Sandoval, the trade group\u2019s technical manager.In one case, hundreds, if not thousands, of shacks have sprung up on undeveloped private land in rolling hills on the southwestern outskirts of the capital. Some of the land had been planned for a housing development, but the squatters have parceled off territory and some are even wiring their shacks with electricity.\u201cThis is by necessity, because of the situation,\u201d said Francisco, 33, an unemployed machinist, who claimed a piece of land and built a small shack for his family. He withheld his full name because, despite the seemingly free land, he was a critic of the Ortega administration.\u201cOur motivation is to live in tranquillity, with security,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, we lived with security. But it exploded like a bomb.\u201d\u201cThis is a day-by-day struggle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The fears triggered a plunge in the currencies of multiple developing economies.The Turkish lira and the South African rand dropped against the dollar, but it was the Argentine peso that experienced the most extreme fall, driven by fears the country would not be able to make its debt payments. Trying to halt the plunge in the value of the peso, which is down close to 50 percent this year, Argentina\u2019s central bank ramped up interest rates by 15 percentage points.The drama in Argentina comes during renewed uncertainty in Turkey. After a dramatic collapse earlier this month, the Turkish lira had rebounded in recent days. On Thursday, though, the lira was down more than 4 percent against the dollar after reports that a top official at the Turkish central bank would be leaving soon. The news fed fears among investors that the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, might be moving to assert control over the central bank, which Mr. Erdogan has criticized for raising interest rates.Other emerging-market currencies, including the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real, also fell on Thursday, as did the shares of European banks that are financially exposed to Turkey.The market turbulence didn\u2019t spill over into American stock markets, which were down about half a percent.The more popular view, though, has been that Argentina\u2019s and Turkey\u2019s problems are particular to those countries and will not spread to economies that have managed their economies more responsibly.The I.M.F.\u2019s $50 billion deal with Argentina is one of the largest in the fund\u2019s history. In order to secure the release of the money, Argentina must agree to deep cuts in government spending. The anticipated slowdown in the economy will hurt everyday Argentines and put pressure on Mr. Macri, who was elected on the promise that he would revive Argentina\u2019s economic fortunes.Argentina\u2019s central bank said its monetary policy committee decided unanimously to address the peso\u2019s plummeting value in order to counter fears that the currency\u2019s decline could drive faster inflation. The currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar since the start of the year: One dollar had bought 18.8 pesos, and now purchases 35.9.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Democratic Party Has Two Futures", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCandidates in different states are testing out the electoral power of the left and the center.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Bredesen\u2019s primary night victory speech on Aug. 2 stands in sharp contrast to the one Abrams delivered in May:We\u2019ve just turned into a country where everybody stands on opposite sides of the room and shouts at each other. I\u2019d like to be part of the fix for that, to start bringing us back together to find some solutions and to do some things together.In an earlier television ad, Bredesen \u2014 a Harvard graduate with a degree in physics and a business executive who founded HealthAmerica Corporation \u2014 made his opposition to polarization explicit: \u201cI\u2019m not running against Donald Trump.\u201d There are \u201ca lot of things I personally don\u2019t like about Donald Trump,\u201d Bredesen says,but he is the president of the United States and if he has an idea or is pushing something that is going to be good for Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be for it no matter where it came from. And likewise, if I think it\u2019s not going to be good for Tennessee I\u2019m going to be against it.On Tuesday, Democratic primary voters demonstrated a strong preference for centrist candidates; in May and June, they chose progressives. Looking toward the general election in November, there is evidence in support of both the Abrams and the Bredesen strategies. The first message expressed support for positions best described as non-adversarial and focused on expanding economic opportunity:It\u2019s getting harder and harder for people to earn the life they want. That\u2019s because the economy has changed dramatically, but government is stuck in the past. To solve this, we need an opportunity agenda for the Digital Age so that everyone everywhere has the opportunity to earn a better life.The second message takes a decidedly adversarial stance toward the rich and illustrates an approach based on economic populism:The American people must make a fundamental decision. Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? This is the most important question of our time, and how we answer it will determine the future of our country.For all intents and purposes, the result was a draw. The first message \u2014 similar to Bredesen\u2019s approach \u2014 got slightly more support from respondents (75 agree, 17 disagree), compared with 69-19 for the second message. But a higher percentage, 36 percent, \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed with the more assertive populist message \u2014 similar to the Abrams approach \u2014 than the 32 percent for the message focused on opportunity. The authors argue that more extreme candidates tend to do poorly in general elections in large part because they skew turnout in the general election away from their own party and in favor of the opposing party.Hall and Thompson contend that this happens because their positions \u201cactivate the opposing party\u2019s base more than their own.\u201d When the Republican Party picks a nominee from the far right, or the Democrats from the far left, voters in the opposite party \u201cactually have a stronger incentive to turn out when an extremist is nominated, because the extremist is so far away from them ideologically.\u201dThe Data For Progress survey, conducted by YouGov Blue, polled 1515 adults July 13-16 and found, the authors assert, strong public support for ending cash bail except for those who \u201cwere a violence or flight risk\u201d (45 percent support, 24 oppose); \u201chaving the government produce generic versions of lifesaving drugs, even if it required revoking patents held by pharmaceutical companies\u201d (51-21); and \u201cfederal funding of community job creation for any person who can\u2019t find a job\u201d (55-23).Six in ten (59 percent) favor a national health plan, or Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan \u2014 including a majority of both Democrats and independents and about one-third of Republicans.Thirty-eight percent oppose such a plan.In addition, support for universal Medicare increasesamong the overall public (75 percent) and among partisans (87 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of independents, and 64 percent of Republicans) when framed as an option for anyone who wants it, but people who currently have other forms of coverage can keep the coverage they already have.Kaiser did warn, however, that itis unclear how support would fare if these proposals became part of the larger public debate as previous Kaiser Family Foundation polling has found the public\u2019s attitudes can be quite malleable.The Data for Progress survey found that other progressive policies face substantial opposition. Reparations, in the form of \u201coffering compensation or tax credits to descendants of slaves,\u201d was opposed 48-27. Giving every American $1,000 a month to be \u201cpaid for by raising taxes on people making more than $150,000\u201d was opposed 43-37. Section titles include \u201cThe Democratic Party simply cannot move to the center; the base won\u2019t allow it\u201d and \u201cThe path forward is unleashing nonvoters, not targeting the mushy middle.\u201d The Democratic Party woke up this morning with a clear signal from Tuesday\u2019s primary elections: The #Resistance means business. The more progressive candidate won in Democratic primaries around the country.The Data For Progress and Third Way surveys provide a case study in how seemingly similar polls can produce antithetical conclusions.Third Way asked voters:Thinking about what the government in Washington, D.C. could do to directly help you and your family, which of the following policies should be the greater focus: Policies that spread opportunity to more people and places or policies that address income inequality?Opportunity beat inequality 46-25.Another question posed by Third Way: would voters choose a candidate who A) supports these three issues \u201ca single government-run health care plan for all Americans, raising the minimum wage to $15, free college for all Americans\u201d or a candidate who B) supports these three issues \u201ccreating 1 million new apprenticeship positions, giving every American who works a private retirement account on top of Social Security, eliminating all federal taxes on the first $15,000 of income.\u201dCandidate A loosely fits the Abrams mold; while Candidate B loosely approximates Bredesen, Candidate B won out, 46-23.gains in white-collar suburbs will be critical to Democratic prospects in the Georgia governor\u2019s race between African-American Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp; the highly competitive Tennessee Senate contest between former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen and Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn; and the more uphill, but still competitive, challenge by Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas.Mobilizing African-Americans, Latinos and other nonwhite voters \u201cundeniably represents an essential part of the equation for Democrats across the region,\u201d Brownstein writes. Still, he adds, increased minority participation is \u201cnecessary, but not sufficient.\u201d In key regions of the South and perhaps particularly in Georgia, President Trump has provided momentum for the two-part Democratic strategy Brownstein suggests: winning over well-educated white suburbanites offended by the president and mobilizing minorities enraged by the president. It remains to be seen whether a durable coalition can form around offense and outrage.Advertisement"}

And that figure could reach a record $1 trillion by the end of the year.The surge in buyback announcements is likely to stoke further debate about the $1.5 trillion tax cuts enacted late last year. The overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The White House and congressional Republicans said the tax bill would encourage companies to make long-term investments and would provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the American economy. Democrats argued the legislation would lead to an increase in share buybacks and wouldn\u2019t stimulate corporate investments.At a time when other stock investors \u2014 households, mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 are selling shares, buybacks could be a source of demand in the coming months, Goldman said. That could be particularly the case for the shares of technology companies. The sector has accounted for 40 percent of the buybacks authorizations this year, but only 21 percent of the actual stock purchases.Still, Goldman does not expect buybacks to lift the S. & P. 500 much this year.

{"Headline": "Are Germany\u2019s Garden Gnomes Endangered?", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGentrification threatens the country\u2019s tradition of urban gardening.Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.BERLIN \u2014 It\u2019s quiet in Germany. School\u2019s out, Chancellor Angela Merkel is on vacation and the country is recovering from the latest government crisis. Kleing\u00e4rten are not confined to, but have always had a particularly important function for, the cities. In the industrializing, rapidly urbanizing 19th century, they were a refuge for poor workers who had to live in overcrowded and gloomy apartment buildings. Crops from small gardens helped the city\u2019s poor to survive the economic crisis that followed World War I. They were where people slept after they were bombed out during World War II. They were where Eastern Germans grew the strawberries they could not buy in the Communist regime\u2019s economy of scarcity. In the postwar West, however, they have always been a luxury. They became the place where the urban petty bourgeoisie could act out its dream of perfect orderliness. The Kleingarten is a German clich\u00e9: narrow but perfectly ordered, shrewd but likable, above all an idyll amid the swirling roughness of the world.Or at least it used to be. The Kleingarten is getting caught up in a massive urban conflict: the fight over space. But driven by the ecological movement, rising housing prices and smaller apartments, families like Robert\u2019s have discovered the gardens. Like many others, Robert, too, is seeking a timeout from his stressful job. He wants his kids to learn about nature, and he wants a safe place for them to play. \u201cIt\u2019s so relaxing to dig a bed, or to cut a tree,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn the garden, I can really forget about everything.\u201d However, the changes in the social mix of the club did not go without debate. All the lines of tension in German urban society crossed in the Kleingarten. \u201cIt was the older folks against the younger ones, Easterners against Westerners, the newly arrived against long time Berlin residents,\u201d Robert said. While many new gardeners wanted to open the area to nonmembers, and envisioned the gardens as a space for neighborhood meetings and festivities, many of the older ones insisted on privacy and closed gates. Some of the older and less well-off members had been pushed out of gentrifying neighborhoods like Prenzlauer Berg; now those who had driven up the rents became their garden neighbors. The tensions in Bornholm I were exacerbated by outside changes, too. The Berlin State Senate has promised to control the rising housing prices in the city and build 30,000 apartments in the next three years. The Senate is looking for cheap land to develop, and much of the land occupied by Kleing\u00e4rten is city land. Berlin\u2019s government is considering turning some into housing developments. Bornholm I is said to be on the list.At first, Pankow\u2019s small gardeners were divided over how to respond. But eventually the outside threat had a unifying effect, Robert said. Together, they persuaded the Pankow district administration to lobby the Senate to protect Kleing\u00e4rten areas from development. Similar stories, playing out in other Kleing\u00e4rten, have led to a citywide campaign to save them.Conflict over how to share the city\u2019s limited space is the future, and not just in Berlin. Germany\u2019s Kleing\u00e4rten may no longer be a necessity for struggling urban dwellers, but they still give urbanites a desperately needed connection to nature. But it takes more than just yard work to make them function: We have to share our precious urban communal space with others, we have to follow its rules. In this urban world of scarcity and constraints, Germany\u2019s Kleing\u00e4rten have turned from symbols of conformity into places of individuality, creation and empowerment \u2014 and, at least at Bornholm I, a place where people with very different backgrounds and worldviews can labor side by side. Not all of them will survive the housing crisis. But the fight will be fierce.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect measurement conversion. Four hundred square meters is equal to 478 square yards, not 437 yards.Advertisement"}

Friday was the deadline for candidates to register, and no others did.Analysts of Indonesian politics said they feared the election would be blighted by social media campaigns of the kind seen in 2014, which falsely asserted that Mr. Joko was an ethnic Chinese Christian. (He is a Muslim of Javanese descent.) The small but influential ethnic Chinese community is resented by many Indonesians, and it has suffered persecution and state-sponsored discrimination in the past.\u201cThey will be looking around for sure to pick up on some religious-based scandal,\u201d said Stephen Sherlock, a professor of politics at the University of New South Wales who studies Indonesia.\u201cWhat we have been doing is four years of proof \u2014 and proof is not fiction,\u201d Mr. Joko said Friday at the office of the General Elections Commission in Jakarta after submitting the paperwork declaring his intent to run. \u201cThis is the foundation that has been built, that still needs to be connected, that still needs to be continued.\u201dRecent surveys have put the president far ahead of Mr. Prabowo, by margins of 15 to 20 percentage points. But Mr. Basuki, the president\u2019s now-jailed ally, also had a double-digit poll lead in his campaign for re-election as Jakarta\u2019s governor before Islamic groups began campaigning against him in earnest.The Islamic organizations seized on a lighthearted reference to a Quran verse that Mr. Basuki made during a speech, as part of an argument that it was acceptable for Muslims to vote for a non-Muslim candidate. The Islamic groups staged large street demonstrations in Jakarta against the governor, including one in November 2016 that became violent.Mr. Prabowo and his political ally Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former president, were widely suspected of orchestrating the protests against Mr. Basuki to embarrass and weaken Mr. Joko, allegations that both men denied. (Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s son, Agus Yudhoyono, had also been a candidate in the Jakarta governor election.)Some analysts saw the campaign against Mr. Basuki as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the presidential contest.Mr. Joko selected Ma\u2019ruf Amin, a prominent conservative Islamic scholar and cleric, as his running mate, seemingly in hopes of warding off attacks from hard-line activists. Mr. Ma\u2019ruf, 75, is the chairman of the Indonesia Ulema Council, the country\u2019s largest body of clerics, which supported the prosecution of Mr. Basuki.\u201cWe fight for all Indonesians regardless of their ethnicity, ethnic group, religious group, whatever their race,\u201d Mr. Prabowo said Friday after filing his campaign paperwork. \u201cAll Indonesians, our people, we will defend, we will fight for their rights.\u201dDuring the 2014 campaign, Mr. Joko was accused of being a member of the Indonesian Communist Party, which was banned in 1965 after an attempted coup. Hundreds of thousands of people accused of being communist sympathizers were killed by the military and armed vigilante groups in the years that followed.Some analysts expect the election to hinge less on religious sentiments than on the economy, which has been growing at an annual rate of about 5 percent \u2014 a disappointing figure, for Indonesia \u2014 amid shrinking foreign and domestic investment.Economic inequality has also deepened since Mr. Joko\u2019s first term, said Didik J. Rachbini, a prominent economist who founded the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance in Jakarta.\u201cIt\u2019s consumers who are contributing to the 4.9 percent or 5 percent growth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not from the budget and not from investment. Economic growth otherwise the past three years has been almost nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It keeps tipping over and then righting itself again, like a bottom-weighted inflatable unicorn.\u201cLake Success\u201d keeps righting itself for many reasons. First among them is that Shteyngart, perhaps more than any American writer of his generation (he\u2019s 46), is a natural. He is light, stinging, insolent and melancholy, to borrow the words the critic Kenneth Tynan kept on his writing desk to remind himself how to sound.

These include a potential subpoena for a particularly immoral business deal gone south. More importantly, they include his guilt over his abandonment of his three-year-old son, Shiva, who has been diagnosed with autism, and his wife, Seema, a Yale Law School graduate and the daughter of parents who had immigrated from India. Barry fled Manhattan after Seema called him soulless at a drunken dinner party, and after she and their nanny attacked him for nearly wounding Shiva out of frustration at his condition. He walked bleeding onto his first bus.Shteyngart satirizes the status details of Barry and Seema\u2019s Manhattan existence: the Filipina nannies, the Duravit sinks, the $33,000 bottles of Karuizawa single-cask whiskey. \u201cLike a long-haul jet,\u201d he writes, \u201ctheir building was divided into economy, business and first.\u201d (Rupert Murdoch owns the top three floors.) He catches every nuance of snob New York, old money and new, laughing at each other. He writes about these details in a way that resemble Tom Wolfe in his novels, but with less starch in the shirts, with less preening.\u201cLake Success\u201d takes place over the final months of the 2016 campaign, and in the early months of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Barry is a Republican, but he gets the implicit threat that Trump represents to impressionable people: \u201cHe would try to drag them down to his level. That\u2019s what he did.\u201dShteyngart can\u2019t help but link Barry\u2019s hedge-fund work and his nearly unfathomable wealth to the emergence of such a political figure. Seema understands that the issues go beyond mere money. From her point of view, we read: \u201cShe felt guilty in front of all the people who would never know the fruits of the global order. She tried to visualize the hatred of the Trump voting class for herself and people like herself, all those brown and yellow faces on Instagram peeking out of the coolest caf\u00e9 in the newest city at the latest hour, once hard-won lives now spent in merriment and ease.\u201dThis busy, squirming, roomy novel has a tidy ending, one that too neatly dispenses prizes and gives Barry a stab at redemption. We come to see that he is not so different from his autistic son. We come to see, in fact, that in some ways the reality of being on the autism spectrum, with all its challenges and rewards, is this novel\u2019s great clandestine subject. It can be hard to get a handle on people with autism. It\u2019s even harder to get a handle on Barry. He\u2019s hard; he\u2019s soft. He\u2019s gregarious; he\u2019s a loner. He\u2019s a wolf of Wall Street; he\u2019s a high plains drifter. He wants to fleece people; he wants to save them. His mind is like a bed that gets made, and then remade, on every other page. Is Barry hollow or is he holy? Shteyngart\u2019s prose holds you in a way that Barry himself never does.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Europe Benefits by Bankrolling an Anti-Migrant Effort. Niger Pays a Price.", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "Niger has been well paid for drastically reducing the number of African migrants using the country as a conduit to Europe. But the effort has hurt parts of the economy and raised security concerns.Supported byDIRKOU, Niger \u2014 The heavily armed troops are positioned around oases in Niger\u2019s vast northern desert, where temperatures routinely climb beyond 100 degrees.While both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have branches operating in the area, the mission of the government forces here is not to combat jihadism.Instead, these Nigerien soldiers are battling human smugglers, who transport migrants across the harsh landscape, where hundreds of miles of dunes separate solitary trees.The migrants are hoping to reach neighboring Libya, and from there, try a treacherous, often deadly crossing of the Mediterranean to reach Europe.The toll of the military engagement is high. Some smugglers are armed, militants are rife and the terrain is unforgiving: Each mission, lasting two weeks, requires 50 new truck tires to replace the ones shredded in the blistering, rocky sand.But the operation has had an impact: Niger has drastically reduced the number of people moving north to Libya through its territory over the past two years.The law\u2019s effect has been significant. At the peak in 2015, there were 5,000 to 7,000 migrants a week traveling through Niger to Libya. The criminalization of smuggling has reduced those numbers to about 1,000 people a week now, according to I.O.M. figures.As a result, the overall flow of people has now gone into a notable reverse: For the last two years, more African migrants have been leaving Libya to return to their homelands than entering the country from Niger, according to the I.O.M.One of Niger\u2019s biggest bus companies, Rimbo, used to send four migrant-filled buses each day from the country\u2019s capital in the south, Niamey, to the northern city of Agadez, a jumping off point for the trip to the Libyan border.Now, the company has signed a two-year contract with the I.O.M. to carry migrants the other way, so they can be repatriated.On a recent breezy evening in Niamey, a convoy of four Rimbo buses rolled through the dusty streets after an arduous 20-hour drive from Agadez, carrying 400 migrants. They were headed back home to countries across West Africa, including Guinea, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.For leaders in Europe, this change in migrant flows is welcome news, and a testament to Niger\u2019s dedication to shared goals.\u201cNiger really became one of our best allies in the region,\u201d said Raul Mateus Paula, the bloc\u2019s ambassador to Niger.But the country\u2019s achievement has also come with considerable costs, including on those migrants still determined to make it to Libya, who take more risks than ever before. Drivers now take routes hundreds of miles away from water points and go through mined areas to avoid military patrols. When smugglers learn the military is in the area, they often abandon migrants in the desert to escape arrest.This has led to dozens of deaths by dehydration over the past two years, prompting Niger\u2019s civil protection agency and the I.O.M. to launch weekly rescue patrols.The agency\u2019s head, Adam Kamassi, said his team usually rescues between 20 to 50 people every time it goes out. On those trips, it nearly always finds three or four bodies.The crackdown on human smuggling has also been accompanied by economic decline and security concerns for Niger.The government\u2019s closure of migrant routes has caused an increase in unemployment and an uptick in other criminal activity like drug smuggling and robbery, according to a Niger military intelligence document.\u201cI know of about 20 people who have become bandits for lack of work,\u201d said Mahamadou Issouf, who has been driving migrants from Agadez to southern Libya since 2005, but who no longer has work.Earlier this year, the army caught him driving 31 migrants near a spot in the desert called the Puit d\u2019Espoir, or Well of Hope. While the army released him in this case, drivers who worked for him have been imprisoned and two of his trucks impounded.The military intelligence document also noted that since the crackdown, towns along the migrant route are having a hard time paying for essential services like schools and health clinics, which had relied on money from migration and the industries feeding it.For example, the health clinic in Dirkou, once a major migrant way station in northern Niger, now has fewer paying clients because the number of migrants seeking has dwindled. Store owners who relied on the steady flow of people traveling through have gone bankrupt.Hassan Mohammed is another former migrant smuggler who lost his livelihood in the crackdown.A native of Dirkou, Mr. Mohammed, 31, began driving migrants across the desert in 2002, earning enough in the process to buy two Toyota pickup trucks. The smuggling operation grew enough that he began employing his younger brothers to drive.Today, Mr. Mohammed\u2019s brothers are in prison, serving the six-month sentences convicted smuggler drivers face. His two pickup trucks are gathering dust, along with a few dozen other confiscated vehicles, on a Niger army base. With no income, Mr. Mohammed now relies on the generosity of friends to survive.Not all the migrants returning through Niger end up in their home countries, but remain in the country, competing for scarce jobs.With Europe as a primary beneficiary of the smuggling crackdown, the European Union is eager to keep the effort in place, and some of the bloc\u2019s aid finances a project to convert former smugglers into entrepreneurs. But the project is still in its pilot stage more than two years after the migrant crackdown began.Ibrahim Yacouba, the former foreign minister of Niger, who resigned earlier this year, said, \u201cThere are lots of announcements of millions of euros in funding, but in the lived reality of those who are in the industry, there has been no change.\u201dThe crackdown has also raised security concerns, as France has taken additional steps to stop migration along the Niger-Libya border that go beyond its asylum-processing center.From its military base in the northern Nigerien outpost of Madama, France funded last year an ethnic Toubou militia in southern Libya, with the goal of using the group to help stop smugglers, according to Nigerien security officials.This rankled the Nigerien military because the militia is headed by an ex-Nigerien rebel, Barka Sidimi, who is considered a major security risk by the country\u2019s officials. To military leaders, this was an example of a European anti-migrant policy taking precedent over Niger\u2019s own security.A French military spokesperson said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have information about the collaboration you speak of.\u201dDespite the country\u2019s progress in reducing the flow of migrants, Nigerien officials know the problem of human smugglers using the country as a conduit is not going away.\u201cThe fight against clandestine migration is not winnable,\u2019\u2019 said Mohamed Bazoum, Niger\u2019s interior minister.Even as Libya has experienced a net drop in migrants, new routes have opened up: More migrants are now entering Algeria and transiting to Morocco to attempt a Mediterranean crossing there, according to Giuseppe Loprete, who recently left his post after being the I.O.M.\u2019s director in Niger for four years.But despite the drawbacks that come with it, the smuggling crackdown will continue, at least for now, according to Mr. Bazoum, the interior minister. Migrant smuggling and trafficking, he said, \u201ccreates a context of a criminal economy, and we are against all forms of economic crime to preserve the stability and security of our country.\u201dFor Mr. Mohammed, the former smuggler, the crackdown has left him idle and dejected, with no employment prospects.\u201cThere\u2019s no project for any of us here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on. I only sleep and wake up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because of the president\u2019s hyperactive use of his trade authority, the scale of this pain is unusually high. But the reality is that this disregard for the consequences inflicted on buyers in the industries downstream from tariffs is nothing new. In fact, thanks to the handiwork of interest groups who benefit from the tariffs and the politicians who serve them, it\u2019s embedded in our trade system, sometimes even in the legislation itself. Why is such a half-baked justification so easy to spin? In large part, it has to do with the Commerce Department, which is responsible for measuring a given tariff\u2019s impact. A department report on a tariff measures the direct impact on an industry \u2014 say, steel manufacturers \u2014 as well as steel-consuming industries and the economy more broadly. The good news is that there\u2019s an easy fix: Change the statutes so that commissioners are required to consider the effects of trade restrictions on downstream industries and consumers.

And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.No one spoke of wanting to cut ties to Tesla.

{"Headline": "Trump Officials Link Fuel Economy Rules to Deadly Crashes. Experts Are Skeptical.", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst, people who buy fuel-efficient vehicles will end up driving more, increasing the odds that they will get into a crash. Second, the fuel-efficient vehicles will themselves be more expensive, slowing the rate at which people buy newer vehicles with advanced safety features. Third, automakers will have to make their cars lighter in response to rising standards, slightly hurting safety.Here\u2019s a closer look at the three main arguments on auto safety that the Trump administration is putting forward in its proposal.Economists have been studying this dynamic for years: As cars and trucks become more fuel-efficient, the cost of driving goes down and people are likely to drive more. But there\u2019s a lot of debate over how big this effect actually is. The Trump administration, in its new proposal, reworked that analysis and concluded that the rebound effect was essentially twice as large. People with more efficient cars would drive more miles than previously assumed, and hence were likely to get into many more accidents. There\u2019s also some evidence, Dr. Gillingham said, that the rebound effect shrinks as Americans get richer, which suggests that this should be less of a problem in the future \u2014\u00a0an argument that the Trump proposal rejected.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that their number is at the high end,\u201d Dr. Gillingham said. \u201cAnd there are several arguments they dismissed that could bring it down.\u201dThis line of reasoning is likely to receive pushback from a variety of fronts. Some economists called the analysis too simplistic, arguing that it did not properly consider key factors like age, gender and other driver characteristics that affect crashes. \u201cI think they are substantially overestimating the impact here,\u201d Dr. Bento said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that the administration only uses this safety argument on fuel-economy standards and not for trade,\u201d said Daniel F. Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign. \u201cEven though the trade effects could be much bigger.\u201dThe Trump administration argues that strict fuel economy rules could also hurt vehicle safety by forcing automakers to produce lighter vehicles that are less capable of withstanding crashes.This can potentially affect road safety in two big ways: On average, smaller, lighter vehicles can be worse at protecting their occupants in an accident. But lighter vehicles also cause less damage to other cars on the road. The big question is which effect dominates.Experts who have looked at this question have developed a rule of thumb: If automakers are mainly reducing the weight of their largest vehicles, like S.U.V.s and pickup trucks, then that makes the roads safer overall. But if manufacturers were to focus more on reducing the weight of their smallest passenger cars, that could be worse for overall auto safety, since those cars would be more vulnerable in crashes with bigger vehicles.\u201cThe most important question is whether cars on the road are getting more similar in weight, or more dissimilar,\u201d said Mark Jacobsen, an economist at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIf you\u2019re bringing down the weight of the heaviest vehicles but not the lightest vehicles, then in the average accident, the cars will be better matched.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that this particular argument accounts for only about 1 percent of the Trump administration\u2019s fatality estimates.

{"Headline": "Can I Ruin Your Dinner Party?", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the two pillars of the West is in jeopardy.Opinion ColumnistROME \u2014 I\u2019ve found lately that I can ruin any dinner party. It\u2019s like magic. Just get me going on Trump or Putin or climate change and I can put a frown on every face and a furrow in every brow. I do weddings and bar mitzvahs, too.So I thought I\u2019d come to Italy for a little sun and risotto. I made the mistake, though, of spending a few days with Italian government and international experts trying to understand the refugee crisis that is fracturing the European Union, much of which originates in Italy. And guess what? Now I can ruin your dinner party \u2014 and breakfast!Because what you find when you take a close look at the situation here is something profoundly worrying. I was born in 1953 and have been living my entire life inside the community of democracies that came to be known as \u201cthe West\u201d and eventually spread to include democracies around the world, such as Japan, Brazil, South Korea and India. At the core of this community were two pillars: the U.S. and the group of European democracies that became the European Union.\u201cThe West\u201d was not just a state of mind. It was an association of countries with shared interests, institutions and values \u2014 particularly the values of liberty, democracy, free markets and the rule of law \u2014 which made the post-World War II world, though far from perfect, a steadily more prosperous, free and decent place for more and more people. This community of democracies was also a beacon, a refuge and a magnet for those who wanted to embrace its values but were denied them where they lived.Toppling Qaddafi without building a new order may go down as the single dumbest action the NATO alliance ever took.Democracy was never the dominant driver of the uprising against Qaddafi. It was much more a revolt by anti-Qaddafi tribes in eastern Libya. But when you just let a tribal revolt rage in a country with few real institutions, you end up with what you have in Libya today: multiple tribes and militias all competing for power and control of oil, creating vast zones of disorder, which both African and Arab refugees and economic migrants can take advantage of to reach the Libyan coastline to try to catch a human trafficking boat to Italy.In 2017, the biggest migrant groups to arrive in Italy mostly via Libya were from Nigeria, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Bangladesh and Eritrea.An Italian official expressed great disgust to me over the fact that Italy\u2019s economy has lost hundreds of millions of euros by participating in E.U. sanctions on Russia \u2014 to help deter Russia from encroaching on Central Europe \u2014 while Central European E.U. countries, like Hungary, have refused to take a single one of the migrants who have sailed to Italy\u2019s shores. Italy has the anti-immigrant government it has, an Italian refugee expert explained, because the world and the rest of the E.U. \u201cturned its back on Italy,\u201d where unassimilated migrants are now visible in the streets, squares and train stations. \u201cThere have to be shared E.U. migration quotas,\u201d he added, consistent E.U. \u201clegal pathways\u201d for immigration and a strategy to improve effective and accountable governance in Africa, not just paying off warlords there to collar refugees. \u201cThe movement of people will happen,\u201d said another Italian official. \u201cThe question is: Do we manage it or not?\u201dThat\u2019s for sure. The total population of Europe/Russia today is about 740 million people, according to the United Nations, and Africa\u2019s is 1.2 billion. By 2050, Europe-Russia will shrink to around 700 million and Africa will double to 2.4 billion. If disorder spreads in Africa, the current crisis will seem tame and manageable by comparison.In March, Italy\u2019s annual security report warned of foreign online \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d in its elections then. The vote brought to power the most pro-Putin, anti-immigrant, anti-E.U. coalition ever to rule Italy: the League and the Five-Star Movement. Trump actually pressed British Prime Minister Theresa May to make a sharp Brexit from the E.U., if she wanted to have a free-trade agreement with the U.S., and he characterized the E.U. not as a partner on trade but as a \u201cfoe.\u201d Trump seems to prefer that the E.U. fracture so he can try to strike better trade deals with the countries individually. How else to explain these irrational moves?One of the first foreign visitors to come to Italy to high-five its new government of Euro- and NATO-skeptics and anti-immigrant populists was Trump\u2019s former brain, Steve Bannon, who reportedly said of the ruling coalition: \u201cIf it works in Italy, it is going to work everywhere. \u2026 It is going to break the backs of the globalists.\u201dThis is such foolish talk. It was the U.S. and what became the E.U. that took the lead in not only repelling communism but in shaping the rules and catalyzing institutions that managed the key global issues after W.W. II \u2014 like trade, migration, environment and human rights \u2014 helping more people around the globe grow out of poverty faster than ever before. We need the U.S. and the E.U. \u2014 joined by the other Group of 20 nations \u2014 to play a similar role today. The change in the pace of change in the climate, globalization and technology has thrown up a whole set of new challenges very fast \u2014 extreme weather, cybercrime, crypto-currencies, social networks, deepfake technologies, self-driving vehicles, artificial intelligence, biological design tools and questions of how to distinguish among refugees, economic migrants and asylum seekers. These can be managed only through global cooperation and new rules. If the community of democracies fractures, and we return to a more 19th- and 20th-century great power competition, who will write the new rules for the 21st century? Who will help Libya or the struggling countries of sub-Saharan Africa create governance and nurture their human capital to escape disorder, so their people don\u2019t feel the need to emigrate to survive or thrive. Russia? China? I don\u2019t think so. There will be a global leadership vacuum, a free-for-all, with terrible consequences. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Trump\u2019s Coal and Car Plans Could Mean for Climate Change ", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:If finalized, they could have a sizable impact. Before getting to the bigger-picture questions, it\u2019s been a busy week in coal news. Here\u2019s what happened:This all raises the question \u2026 The Trump administration has been particularly busy this August rolling out its plans to weaken federal climate policies.That said, it\u2019s not yet certain that this higher emissions scenario will come to pass, and there are a few things we\u2019ll be watching closely in the months ahead.Which is all to say that this story is still in flux and even the most careful predictions about what different policies mean for global warming could change over time. Stay tuned.When the last ice age retreated, the Earth\u2019s crust sprang back up again as the weight of the ice was pressing down no more. Question: Would the melting of the ice caps cause the Earth\u2019s crust to shift and cause more quakes or volcanic activity?Here\u2019s another reason to be concerned about global warming: It might lead to more earthquakes, at least near the poles.In addition to the other problems that the eventual melting of the thick ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would create (soaring sea levels centuries from now, for one thing), it would remove a huge weight from the two land masses and affect stresses in the faults beneath them.\u201cI would expect it,\u201d said G\u00f6ran Ekstr\u00f6m, a geophysicist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of Columbia University, of the possibility that earthquakes might result. \u201cThat\u2019s a very large stress change.\u201dThere are indications that this happened in the past, as the large ice sheets that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere and Antarctica during the last ice age began to retreat 12,000 years ago and the land began to rise (a process called postglacial rebound, which continues today). Scientists have found evidence in northern Scandinavia of large faults that ruptured after the ice retreated.Much more recently, relatively small changes in mass at or near the Earth\u2019s surface have been thought to cause quakes. Several earthquakes in the 1970s and 1980s in a natural gas field in Uzbekistan, for instance, were believed to be the result of removing so much gas by drilling operations. And some scientists have linked a strong earthquake that struck Sichuan Province in China in 2008 to the filling of a reservoir behind a new dam.As for volcanoes, Dr. Ekstr\u00f6m was less certain what the impact would be. There are indications, for example, that higher sea levels in the ancient past reduced volcanism at midocean ridges, as the extra weight of water acted to constrain molten rock, or magma. So loss of the ice sheets might be expected to lead to increased volcanic activity on the newly exposed land. \u201cTo the extent that a load should affect the magma bodies underground, there should be a connection,\u201d Dr. Ekstr\u00f6m said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Chinese Investors Panic Over Dubious Products, Authorities Quash Protests", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn online chat groups, thousands of small investors who had put their savings into dubious digital products plotted a big protest in Beijing this week.Under pressure from local officials, one woman\u2019s family begged her not to go. After a visit from the local police, a man\u2019s boss threatened to break his contract if he participated. At airports, bus and train stations across China, scores of people making their way to Beijing were confronted by police officers who urged them \u2014 sometimes with force \u2014 to turn around.Those who did make it to the headquarters of the Chinese banking regulator in Beijing on Monday faced hundreds of police officers sent to quash it. Some were dragged off, while others were shoved into buses leaving the city.For Chinese officials, the financial is quickly becoming political.In recent years, millions of ordinary investors across China have plowed their savings into online financial products that promised big profits with little risk. But the sudden collapse of hundreds of these peer-to-peer lenders in recent months has prompted a panic, leaving many investors with little information and little way to get their money back.Frustrated investors are appealing to local and national authorities. As many see it, the government encouraged the growth of these online lenders, which were intended to connect mom-and-pop investors with borrowers. The state, these investors say, should make them whole.While the Communist Party always tries to tamp down protests to maintain social stability, the current discontent among investors belies a bigger problem for the Chinese authorities. A vast, unruly shadow banking system, where some companies have lured people with get-rich-quick schemes, has created hidden debt bombs that could leave the economy vulnerable. And it comes at a tricky time for the leadership, as China deals with signs of slowing growth, a wavering stock market and an escalating trade war with the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the government,\u201d said Liu Yu, a 35-year-old shopkeeper who traveled 13 hours to Beijing on Monday to protest. He said he lost $9,000 on a lending platform called Catch the Money Cat, which notified investors on July 20 that it was having problems paying back investors and that the police in the city of Hangzhou were investigating. \u201cThere is no credibility,\u201d he added.When these digital products emerged in China a decade ago, they were pitched as an outlet for small-time borrowers, who were mostly ignored by the country\u2019s big state-run banks. For investors ponying up the money to lend, the gains were tantalizing, with some promoting returns as high as 40 or 50 percent.Lightly regulated, they attracted ordinary people \u2014 from students to grandparents \u2014 in droves through an advertising blitz on mobile apps, in movie theaters and even in residential elevators. Many products appeared to have the government\u2019s imprimatur, since they used state-owned banks to help facilitate payments and create the appearance of safer investments. Thousands of companies pulled in an estimated $194 billion from as many as four million individuals.Tang Zehui, 42, a factory worker who rode a 30-hour train to Beijing this week from southwestern Sichuan Province, said she had turned to these investments, as many others in China had, because the interest rate on regular savings accounts was too low.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good ways to manage our finances,\u201d said Ms. Tang, who said she lost about $22,000 to Leadercf.com, which is based in the southern city of Guangzhou. Ms. Tang said she trusted it because the state\u2019s support seemed to be implicit.The platforms were supposed to be matchmakers, providing a place for savers to meet borrowers who needed short-term loans. But with little regulation, many of these companies pooled together investors\u2019 money and then tried to find borrowers, creating a potential mismatch when it came time to pay out.In 2016, they were told to register with local financial regulators and comply with new rules or face being shut down. But the deadline was postponed to an unspecified date.\u201cMany people see these products as similar to saving,\u201d said Yu Baicheng, director of research at Wangdaizhijia, an independent provider of data on China\u2019s online lending industry. \u201cThey are not aware of the potential risks.\u201dA deeper worry started to set in this summer, after the government warned about the risk of losses.Almost immediately, the concerns prompted a run on the industry, as investors demanded their money back. A wave of defaults followed, with each collapse setting off the next, like a set of dominoes.Some executives shut down their businesses and fled with client money, while others suspended operations following a flood of demands from investors for repayment. Many are now under investigation.In early July, Money Pig, a company based in the southern city of Shenzhen, notified tens of thousands of investors that their accounts had been suspended. Trying to get their money back, investors gathered at a police station there a few weeks later. The group of office workers, students and businessmen wore face masks, sunglasses and white T-shirts that read, \u201cGive me my hard-earned money back!\u201d and \u201cGovernment, save our investors!\u201d\u201cI started to panic,\u201d said Chen Shuaipeng, 30, a salesman who flew to Shenzhen for the protest from the eastern city of Tianjin. He said he had $93,000 of savings in a Money Pig account before it was frozen.In Hangzhou, a group of investors who showed up to talk to officials was large enough to fill two sports stadiums, according to state news media reports. Others have gathered to protest in Nanjing and Shanghai, according to news reports and widely circulated videos online.\u201cThe entire industry is facing panic, and the speed of collapse is still accelerating,\u201d said Xue Hongyan, director of Suning Financial Research Institute, which studies the industry.Officials trying to control the situation are faced with a fast-moving crisis. In July alone, 168 lending platforms halted their operations, according to Wangdaizhijia.In recent weeks, large numbers of disgruntled investors have started to share their experiences online, updating one another about investigations. Soon, investors were talking about banding together for a big protest in Beijing on Monday.China\u2019s censors quickly took note, and soon one chat room after another was closed down. Investors switched between different chat apps to avoid censorship, using forums like QQ, WeChat, YeeCall, Qunduoduo and Telegram.Mr. Gao, who asked not to use his full name for fear that he might lose his job at a machine manufacturing company, first learned online about plans for the protest in Beijing. He had lost nearly $126,000 when the lending portal Tangxiaoseng collapsed.After Mr. Gao discussed his trip to Beijing in several WeChat groups, the local police went to his home. \u201cI said one word in our chat group, and they came to my door, asking me not to go petitioning.\u201dBut Mr. Gao said he felt emboldened to let the government know what had happened to him. Quoting China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, Mr. Gao said, \u201cif you can\u2019t see sunshine where you are, please come to Beijing.\u201dHe went to Beijing a few days before the planned protests only to discover that a dozen government officials had visited his company and urged his boss to ask him to return. When he got home on Monday, his company asked him to sign a letter promising not to engage in protests; otherwise he would be fired.\u201cI think I won\u2019t be able to keep my job,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "French Labor Overhaul Led by Unusual Figure: A Business Executive", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Muriel P\u00e9nicaud is the sort of figure that French protesters love to bash. A former human resources executive. A tenacious negotiator who wrangles with unions. And a friend to business leaders and political elites.There may soon be more that draws their objections.\u201cFrance won\u2019t succeed if we stay in conflict with one another,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to take action, because the world has changed.\u201dMs. P\u00e9nicaud has been pivotal to ushering in such changes. Over the last year, she has taken an ax to some of the most cherished parts of the 3,300-page rule book in the name of remaking French capitalism. Chief was decentralizing industrywide collective bargaining agreements, once thought to be untouchable, and allowing companies to reach their own deals with workers.Now, she is negotiating the next phase of \u201cFlexicurity \u00e0 la francaise\u201d: An overhaul of the nation\u2019s inefficient skills training programs, as well as a recast of unemployment programs to expand benefits to self-employed entrepreneurs and tighten controls on jobseekers.Such actions have unsettled detractors who accuse her \u2014 and Mr. Macron \u2014 of caring less about workers than business. Critics say she is out of touch with ordinary workers, and she has been dogged by an investigation over her involvement in a lucrative no-bid government contract.To secure the business-friendly updates to the labor code, for instance, she conducted a 300-hour negotiating blitz with the heads of France\u2019s major unions and leading business groups. Unlike Scandinavia, where government dialogue with social partners tends to be smooth, the relationship in France is more confrontational. So she insisted on meeting with each group individually to forge relationships and consensus, and swore them to confidentiality to avoid posturing.Other sets of talks were more amicable. Laurent Berger, the head of France\u2019s largest labor organization, the reformist C.F.D.T., publicly declared his appreciation for what he called her vision for \u201ceconomic development with social justice.\u201dThat France needs to change is undisputed.Ms. P\u00e9nicaud said France needed to \u201crenew the social model\u201d by loosening business constraints and improving the nation\u2019s skills training for workers. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for inclusive growth,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if the most vulnerable say, \u2018I can\u2019t get on board,\u2019 there will be a danger for social cohesion and politics.\u201dTenacious and energetic, she regularly crosses the country visiting small businesses, vocational training centers and unemployment offices. Ms. P\u00e9nicaud tends to stick to formulaic speech when discussing her plans, an attempt to stay on point with Mr. Macron and Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe. But when in the negotiating room, her main aim is to strike an accord \u2014 she is willing, and able, to make concessions, those who know her say, and she sometimes proffers a pot of ginger tea to smooth the atmosphere.Often a rare woman in a room full of men, she spent over 20 years navigating labor issues as a human resources executive at Danone and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, two of France\u2019s biggest companies, where she forged links with union leaders.Her time in politics has been relatively limited. In the early 1990s, she worked for three years for the then-Socialist labor minister Martine Aubry, overseeing jobs training policies for disadvantaged youth and the unemployed. She never joined the party, though, observing once that women at that time were given little responsibility besides \u201cmaking coffee.\u201dThe image of a labor minister sympathetic to corporate interests hardened when, acting on Mr. Macron\u2019s orders, she persuaded lawmakers to pass the business-friendly reforms into law by ordinance, a procedure that sidesteps the lengthy Parliamentary process. Critics charged it was a way of ramming through changes with little dissent.Last October, just before the new rules were approved, protesters surrounded a luxe Parisian restaurant where she was scheduled to attend a conference, armed with \u201cWanted\u201d leaflets bearing her image and pamphlets suggesting that she be hunted down. Scores were arrested after clashing with police and burning cars.Ms. P\u00e9nicaud has denied any wrongdoing, and emphasized, in the case of the Danone payout, that she had insisted on receiving equal pay with men who also sat on the board. \u201cIn France,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople sometimes have a hard time believing that having money and a social view can coexist.\u201dOn the pace and style of her reform effort, she is unapologetic. \u201cWe moved too slowly on labor reforms for the last 20 years,\u201d she said, adding that going through the regular legislative process would have taken too long. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we don\u2019t have.\u201dThe government, she insisted, was on the right track. Tens of thousands of new jobs have been created. Foreign investors are coming to France.Yet she acknowledged that if the changes don\u2019t rapidly improve life for ordinary French citizens, the risk of a popular backlash could build.For Ms. P\u00e9nicaud, that means moving even faster.\u201cChange can create fear, I get that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can no longer stick with the status quo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When It Comes to a Trade War, China Takes the Long View", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyYe Fangsu, a retired Shanghai schoolteacher, doesn\u2019t need any lessons about the dangers of trade wars. For nearly 60 years, she has lived in the former French Concession, a leafy part of Shanghai whose name itself carries the humiliation of China\u2019s biggest trade war. The \u201cconcession\u201d was one of many slices of territory, including Hong Kong and parts of other port cities, that China was forced to hand over to foreign powers after its defeat in the mid-19th-century Opium Wars. \u201cChina was so weak and backward then,\u201d Ye said, shaking her head as she offered me slices of apple and pear on a hot July afternoon. \u201cWe had to give in.\u201dThe first salvos of today\u2019s trade war have barely been felt yet in China. But for many Chinese, there\u2019s a sense of history repeating itself. The Opium Wars, as every Chinese schoolchild is reminded, began as a British attempt to pry open the Chinese market. Much as it does today, China in the 17th and 18th centuries ran a huge trade surplus with the West, exporting large quantities of tea, porcelain and silk but importing little in return. (It balanced its current-account surplus by buying up loads of Latin American silver; these days, Beijing has piled up $1.2 trillion in United States government securities.) By hooking China on opium, British and American merchants redressed the trade imbalance even as they weakened the country\u2019s social fabric. The Chinese revolted, but they were no match for Western gunboats \u2014 leading to the unequal treaties that have fueled China\u2019s sense of historical grievance and patriotic ambitions ever since.Ye Fangsu was a teenager in 1949 when Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist troops marched into Shanghai, the vanguard of a revolution that vowed to end China\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation.\u201d Now 84 and widowed, Ye says she was \u201cangry\u201d when she learned from state-run media about the United States\u2019 punitive trade tariffs on Chinese products. \u201cIt just seems like the foreigners are bullying us again,\u201d she told me. But this time will be different, she said, pointing out that rather than panic or surrender, China\u2019s leaders announced a reciprocal \u201ccounterattack\u201d aimed at products, like soybeans and pork, meant to hit the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s rural base. \u201cWe\u2019ve become strong now, and our leaders are more tenacious. They won\u2019t back down.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to understand why Trump and his advisers believed China might blink first. The country exports nearly four times more taxable goods to the United States than it imports ($505 billion compared with $130 billion in 2017), so it could never keep up with Washington in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Moreover, the Chinese economy is slowing, weighed down by debt and unemployment and dependent on the American market. Still, in targeting China\u2019s high-tech industry, Washington seemed to forget that Beijing has more than a trillion dollars in reserves to cushion the blow and that 21st-century supply chains are truly global. The Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that 87 percent of the high-tech Chinese products hit by United States tariffs get some of their parts or financing from companies based outside China. American tariffs, in other words, could inflict even greater pain on allies like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan \u2014 and on the United States itself. As the Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng put it, \u201cThe U.S. is opening fire on the world and on itself, too.\u201dChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have been less scattershot. By taking aim at soybeans and pork, Beijing struck at Trump country in the Midwest, while going after a smaller export like Kentucky bourbon hit the district of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cChina targets Trump\u2019s interest groups with surgical precision,\u201d a former government official in Shanghai told me. \u201cThat\u2019s China\u2019s institutional advantage. It understands America, but the United States doesn\u2019t really understand how China operates politically.\u201d So far, the United States is feeling the brunt of the trade war: Soy and pork exports to China have collapsed, and China has scuppered one major tech deal: Qualcomm\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover of the Dutch chip maker NXP Semiconductors. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, residents seem almost oblivious to the trade war, as if it were a storm on a distant horizon. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d says a waitress at a local dumpling shop. \u201cBut the price of soy sauce hasn\u2019t gone up yet.\u201dThe United States would be wise not to underestimate China\u2019s resolve. President Xi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, has staked his legitimacy on restoring China\u2019s greatness. Backing down is not an option for him; he can\u2019t afford to look weak in a face-off with China\u2019s biggest rival. Xi may hope the trade war eases up after the midterm elections, but he seems ready to dig in. \u201cIf it comes down to a war of attrition, China will win,\u201d says James L. McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cAt the end of day, we may end up making China great again.\u201dChinese leaders have so far been careful not to rouse much nationalist fervor, however. In disputes with other countries \u2014 France, Japan and, most recently, South Korea \u2014 Beijing ramped up the hostility, orchestrated street protests and even encouraged consumer boycotts. The trade war has evoked a more measured response. Some Chinese-language articles online have highlighted China\u2019s historical grievances \u2014 \u201cNever Forget the Eight Lessons of the Opium War,\u201d one reads \u2014 but the official tack has been to calm public opinion. \u201cDon\u2019t attack Trump\u2019s vulgarity,\u201d a government guidance memo instructed media outlets earlier this summer, according to the website China Digital Times. \u201cDon\u2019t make this a war of insults.\u201dIf the trade war persists, China could make life even more difficult for American companies by adding to the web of nontariff barriers (red tape, for example) or by supporting a consumer boycott. American-owned subsidiaries in China sold $280 billion worth of goods and services there in 2017, more than double the amount of United States imports, and famous brands like Apple and Starbucks make about 20 percent of their revenue in China. As vulnerable as those companies might be, China has no interest, yet, in alienating its biggest market. \u201cAt some point, Chinese leaders may want to get nationalistic and stir up anger against U.S. companies, but that\u2019s a dangerous road,\u201d McGregor says. \u201cRight now, Chinese leaders are just studying the battlefield. They are not running around with shock and awe.\u201dAs the trade war escalates, in fact, China is seeking to shift the blame and portray itself suddenly as a champion of openness. In the past month, Beijing has approved two major deals \u2014 with Tesla and the German chemical giant BASF \u2014 that give those companies what the foreign business community has long desired: full ownership without the need for a local joint-venture partner. Xi Jinping also held a rare meeting with American and European business executives, though his words on the trade war were defiant. In the West, he reportedly told them, \u201cyou turn the other cheek. In our culture, we punch back.\u201dBack in Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession, Ye Fangsu walked me to the gate of her lane. Across the street stands an old factory that has been transformed into a cluster of hip new restaurants and marketplaces, selling everything from Japanese tapas to French pastries. Two young Chinese men with fancy fade haircuts parked their BMW and wandered in. \u201cChina is rich now,\u201d Ye said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are better.\u201d Her neighborhood, once a symbol of China\u2019s weakness, is now evidence of its economic vitality. By her street-level calculus, that means China may have the strength, this time, to stand up to the West.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade War Worries Iowa Republicans in a Close House Race", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCEDAR FALLS, Iowa \u2014 The unemployment rate here is one of the lowest in the country. Wages are rising at nearly twice the rate of inflation. Jobs are so plentiful that manufacturers are paying to train unskilled workers.Yet Iowa is also one of the states most vulnerable to a trade war. And that could be a problem for Representative Rod Blum.\u201cI\u2019m not on the ledge ready to jump out the window concerning trade, but I do have the window open a little bit,\u201d said Mr. Blum, a two-term Republican incumbent vying for re-election in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive House races.Iowa has a lot riding on global trade. Its farmers export one of every four rows of soybeans \u2014 worth around $2 billion \u2014 to China. One in five Iowans has a job tied to agriculture, and not just on farms. John Deere has several plants in the state, making tractors and combines, and hundreds of metal manufacturers churn out fences and grain bins for family farmers and corporate growers.If the trade dispute between the United States and much of the world isn\u2019t resolved soon, economists say, it will almost certainly lead to layoffs and unyielding financial loss across the state. Republican strategists worry that the simmering unease over that possibility may be enough to keep party faithful at home on Election Day in November.\u201cWe need some wins,\u201d Mr. Blum said in an interview. \u201cWe need something to rally around, something good. If we could do a deal with Mexico, that would be great.\u201dPresident Trump has urged farmers to \u201cbe a little patient\u201d with trade negotiations, and he recently announced a $12 billion aid package for those hurt by the tariffs. In July, Mr. Trump made a stop in the district to campaign for Mr. Blum, promising the Iowans in the crowd that they wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctoo angry with Trump\u201d once the trade scuffles came to an end.Kevin Harberts isn\u2019t angry. He is anxious, though.Since the president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in March, Mr. Harberts\u2019s company, Kryton Engineered Metals, has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars more than expected on the metals.\u201cIt bites,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, that\u2019s huge money.\u201dAnd yet Mr. Harberts is standing by Mr. Trump.He is on track to sell more parts than ever. He can\u2019t hire fast enough to fill the geyser of orders coming in.\u201cIf Hillary would\u2019ve won, I don\u2019t think we would\u2019ve been in this mode,\u201d he said. \u201cIn spite of the hassle and frustration, everyone is doing good.\u201dThe question is how long those good times can last. Economists are certain that if the tariffs remain in place, they will lead to layoffs, farm foreclosures and bankruptcies \u2014 but not right away. Iowa may feel only a subtle effect by November, economists said, although any damage will almost certainly be felt in full by the time the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses roll around in early 2020.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that it might look good right up until the midterms,\u201d said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University. \u201cEven though everything we know about economics says that can\u2019t be true in the long run.\u201dAlready, there are signs that the tariffs are beginning to filter through the regional economy. Chinese buyers have been canceling hundreds of thousands of tons of soybean orders since April, according to Department of Agriculture data, and soybean prices fell close to a 10-year low in July. Soybean producers in Iowa stand to lose $624 million from the trade war, according to Chad Hart, an economist at Iowa State University.In Iowa, trouble in the agriculture sector invariably spreads to the rest of the economy. Recent business surveys have found that farmers are becoming more reluctant to buy equipment and that local bankers are becoming gloomier in their outlook.\u201cAgriculture is always the first casualty of a trade war,\u201d said Ernie Goss, a business professor who studies the Midwestern economy at Creighton University in Omaha.Mr. Harberts, for example, makes housings for fans that go into massive grain bins made by Sukup Manufacturing, 60 miles northwest of here in Sheffield. Steve Sukup, the chief financial officer, has started grumbling about how metal prices are eating into his profit. Like Mr. Harberts, Mr. Sukup buys his metal from American steel mills. Several months before the tariffs were announced, those mills started to increase prices, he said, in anticipation of the protection they were about to receive. \u201cThey raised prices because they could,\u201d he said.And he heard from clients in California who said that their Chinese buyers recently froze all orders of almonds. Mr. Sukup said that \u201cthe realization has sunk in\u201d among Iowa soybean farmers that the tariffs could push foreign buyers away for good.\u201cOnce they go elsewhere, it\u2019s hard to get them back,\u201d he said.Mr. Sukup, a Trump voter, said Mr. Blum \u201chas got some headwinds\u201d in the midterms, partly because of the tariffs.Democrats spy an opportunity.\u201cIt seems bizarre to live in a world where the president is actively producing anxiety on his side two months before an election,\u201d said Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party. \u201cGenerally what that does is depress turnout.\u201dMr. Blum is treading delicately. In June, he signed a letter, along with the entire Iowa delegation, urging Mr. Trump to \u201cavoid a trade war.\u201d But Mr. Blum thanked the president during his July visit for \u201chaving political courage to renegotiate these trade deals.\u201dAbby Finkenauer, the 29-year-old Democratic challenger in the race, called those comments \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d Ms. Finkenauer, a state legislator, has built a bigger campaign treasury than Mr. Blum and recently won the endorsement of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u201cWe deserve a lot better than a congressman who sits there and thanks somebody for throwing livelihoods in flux,\u201d Ms. Finkenauer said in an interview.The fate of the contest in November may hinge on whether Kevin Watje changes his mind.Mr. Watje, 60, is a Trump supporter and a reliable Republican voter who lives in Waterloo, in the heart of Mr. Blum\u2019s district. He\u2019s giving the president the benefit of the doubt on trade.As the chief executive of Curbtender, a garbage truck manufacturer, Mr. Watje sees that American companies can be at a disadvantage in global markets.He says the tariffs have been kneecapping his business. The prices for the American steel he buys have risen up to 40 percent since March. He can\u2019t get metal on time anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s thrown a wrench into the gears,\u201d he said.With the economy still humming, Mr. Watje figures he can absorb the losses for a little while. If the trade aggression keeps ratcheting up, though, he thinks it could end the good times in Iowa and the rest of the country.\u201cWe could go into a deep recession again,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I would make a connection to Congress that they didn\u2019t put a stop to it.\u201dFor now, he plans to vote for Mr. Blum in November. But he\u2019s open to hearing what the Democrats have to offer. And if the pain stretches into the winter, all bets are off.\u201cI would probably change my mind about voting for Trump,\u201d Mr. Watje said. \u201cWhen it gets past six months, we probably are all going to start changing our minds about who we are voting for.\u201dNatalie Kitroeff reported from Cedar Falls, Iowa, and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Don\u2019t Drive a Minivan? You Should. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWe often shun the ones that can help our lives the most. Maybe out of pride. Perhaps ignorance. Many of us are looking for good solid family material, yet reject prospects that are committed and generous.But whether you\u2019ve outgrown your youthful dalliances with high-maintenance coupes or you\u2019ve always been a practical-minded hatchback owner who is now ready for true commitment, a minivan might be the ultimate symbol of adulthood. And let me tell you, as a guy who drives nearly 100 different vehicles a year, I\u2019ll testify that minivans are magical for simplifying life.But minivans are becoming harder to find. Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Nissan and Mazda have all abandoned the segment because of sagging sales. Blame sport utility vehicles and crossovers. Chevrolet alone will have six of them in its stable once the 2019 Blazer hits showrooms. BMW will soon have one more than that, with the X1 through the X7.Just five minivans are on the market today: the Chrysler Pacifica, the Dodge Grand Caravan, the Honda Odyssey, the Kia Sedona and the Toyota Sienna. And all of them are hip, even if they\u2019re square.Four-wheel mass transit doesn\u2019t get much more efficient than the Chrysler Pacifica E-Hybrid. This plug-in hybrid\u2019s lithium-ion battery provides about 33 miles of grocery-getting solely on electric power for an impressive 84 miles per gallon equivalent.Once the Pacifica\u2019s battery is depleted, the gas engine seamlessly and automatically engages to cover more than 500 miles, and the drivetrain\u2019s operation is as smooth as the baby bottoms it carries.There are disadvantages, though. The Pacifica\u2019s batteries live where the second-row Stow \u2019n Go seats normally drop in the gas-powered model. And it\u2019s so quiet you\u2019ll hear the kids arguing more clearly.\u201cMen buy 60 percent of them,\u201d said Steve Beahm, head of passenger car brands at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.Toyota\u2019s research indicates that it\u2019s women who tend to be more sensitive to the minivan\u2019s mom-friendly stereotype, said Rick LoFaso, the general manager of Toyota Vehicle Marketing.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t resonate as much with males,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owned a Sienna that I loved. My wife was very happy once a Highlander crossover took its place.\u201dVans are underrated haulers, capable of swallowing full sheets of building material or giant 70-inch television impulse buys. And unlike uncovered pickup beds, minivans keep those items secure and dry.The Sienna\u2019s outstanding feature is all-wheel drive \u2014 it is the only minivan to offer it \u2014 and the standard model comes with a suite of active electric safety features, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection.Need more machismo? The Sienna SE is dressed with 19-inch wheels, smoked headlamp lenses and sporty spoilers. To fully embrace a bad-boy image, choose the Pacifica\u2019s S package. Trim, wheels and the interior get the black treatment to make it the most menacing van at the playground.\u201cThe S is attracting a lot of women,\u201d said Mary Ann Capo, part of Chrysler\u2019s marketing department. \u201cIn all black it\u2019s a real mean-looking machine.\u201dThe Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager triplets were revolutionary transportation when they arrived in 1983, becoming an instant hit with active families. S.U.V.s \u2014 a term that didn\u2019t exist yet \u2014 were thirsty, ungainly trucks. The front-wheel-drive minivan drove like a car, carried sheets of plywood and toted half the kid\u2019s soccer team in comfort, all while getting decent fuel economy. Sliding doors eliminated the horror of kids clumsily dinging the car next to yours, which invariably ended up being a Mercedes.Those vans even saved Chrysler from bankruptcy. But by 1990, suburban America had begun to shun the image of domestic drudgery that vans had developed. Ford had a perfect solution: the Explorer. This gentrified truck, aimed squarely at women, was easier for kids to enter and exit, had a commanding view of the road and told the world, \u201cAfter we drop Ashley off at day care, we\u2019re going mountain climbing!\u201dOur love affair with S.U.V.s and crossovers has pushed the minivan to the fringes. Minivan sales are down by about 5 percent from last year, according to Mr. Beahm of Fiat Chrysler. But sales of sedans have fallen even further, so in a way, vans are holding their own against the S.U.V. onslaught.And with good reason. Consider the Kia Sedona, which is as sleek and stylish as a van can get. It has 78.4 cubic feet of cargo space behind its second row, compared with 57.5 in Ford\u2019s full-size Expedition \u2014 and the Kia is nine inches shorter. The van makes hauling family and gear to Yosemite a walk in the park: Sliding paddle boards or kayaks into one is easier than using roof racks on high-riding S.U.V.s. In short, vans can offer more utility than your sport utility vehicle.Not only does a minivan work for your 2.5 kids, but the low floor is within easy hopping distance of little pooches, or bigger pooches that aren\u2019t as nimble as they once were. Crates slip effortlessly through the wide rear doors, with less lifting than at the back of an S.U.V.Cheryl Vincent has a 2018 Honda Odyssey and a Porsche \u2014 her 11-year-old bull terrier. She works for Guide Dogs for the Blind in Boring, Ore., and is a member of the National Association of Canine Scent Work.\u201cI do dog sports, like agility and obedience, plus scent detection,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m always lugging around lots of boxes of materials for teaching. My husband, John, and I travel, so there\u2019s plenty of room for us, Porsche, our luggage and education materials. It\u2019s perfect for us.\u201dMs. Vincent\u2019s Odyssey has a built-in vacuum that keeps its interior fur-free. And she even likes how it handles.\u201cIt drives like a regular car,\u201d she said. \u201cI know minivans have a bad rap, but it drives very well \u2014 kind of sporty, actually.\u201dIt\u2019s no Porsche, but then again neither is Honda\u2019s Pilot crossover. Unless you\u2019re buying an actual Porsche, it\u2019s probably not worth worrying about \u2014 and Porsche\u2019s midsize Cayenne crossover starts at double the Odyssey\u2019s base price of $30,090.My parents, Eugene and Mary Lou \u2014 the proud president of the Slovenian Union of America \u2014 retired to coastal Alabama after raising a family in Minnesota. They often load up their 2015 Town and Country \u2014 a dearly departed model that lives on in the form of the Dodge Grand Caravan \u2014 to head north to visit friends. They got 26 miles to the gallon on the last trip, my dad said.\u201cWe like it because it\u2019s comfortable and roomy and we can haul your mom\u2019s Slovenian stuff,\u201d he said.But minivans aren\u2019t just for lugging around hobby supplies and carrying kids. They can get an active family to the bike trail as easily as a Jeep (more easily, in some ways) or carry eight people across town without having to be a $50,000 Chevy Suburban at 16 miles per gallon in the city.Minivans might not be the hottest thing on the road, but maturity is sexy, too. Don\u2019t think so? There\u2019s nothing like a van full of kids to demonstrate a healthy love life \u2014 and true commitment.Advertisement"}

But we were certainly shocked at the extent to which communities of color are just not represented either in the decision-making model or where the dollars land.\u201dThe report analyzed the amount of money allocated to each of the state\u2019s 10 economic development regions through the councils over the past seven years. Though the total amount awarded to each region was roughly similar \u2014 between $460 million and $615 million \u2014 the amount per resident varied drastically.New York City, with its population of 8.5 million people, nearly 68 percent of whom are nonwhite, received $5.5 million in awards per 100,000 residents. By contrast, the North Country, where less than 12 percent of the 400,000 residents are nonwhite, received $127.1 million per 100,000 residents.If the regions had received funding promises proportionate to their population \u2014 what the report called each region\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d \u2014 New York City would have received more than 10 times more money, and Long Island nearly three times more. The North Country\u2019s funding would have fallen by half.Howard Zemsky, the president of Empire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency, said that much of the investment upstate does go to minority communities, even if they do not make up the majority of the population there. He cited work force development and anti-poverty initiatives in Buffalo and Rochester.Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel, called the report\u2019s focus on the regional councils \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\u201cTo look at economic development policy in a vacuum without appreciating all of the work we\u2019re doing writ large is irresponsible,\u201d he said.Mr. Zemsky emphasized the plight of the upstate economy, adding that \u201cunless you\u2019re prepared to allow these regions to decline indefinitely, then those are the regions that need a disproportionate share of support.\u201dThe report also noted the lack of diversity among the council\u2019s leaders, who are appointed by the governor\u2019s office. Ninety percent of those leaders are white, and 72 percent are male.Mr. Zemsky said the councils collaborate with local groups who reflect the diversity of their regions. Given those unseen players, he said, \u201cI do think it negates that argument\u201d about the lack of diversity on the councils themselves.But the report\u2019s authors maintained that the regional councils program, while not inclusive of all economic development money, should still be scrutinized as a barometer of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s dedication to nonwhite communities.\u201cThe regional councils are the governor\u2019s signature economic development initiative,\u201d Ms. Axt said. \u201cTo call their damning record irrelevant is absurd.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Its goal is to put more science and less happenstance into the process of talent discovery \u2014 and reach more people, wherever they are in the world.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a kind of search engine for finding great people with talent, ambition and potential,\u201d said Daniel Gross, 27, the group\u2019s founder.Selecting \u201cpioneers\u201d will begin with a monthlong online tournament. Candidates will submit their project ideas. Each week, the projects will be updated. The candidates will vote on each other\u2019s projects, points will be awarded and there will be leader board. Subject experts will also vote, with their votes counting somewhat more than the candidates\u2019.The initiative is inspired partly by Mr. Gross\u2019s personal experience.When he was an 18-year-old student at a military prep school in Israel, Mr. Gross, on a whim, sent in an idea to Y Combinator, the prominent start-up incubator. To his surprise, he was accepted and departed for Silicon Valley. \u201cThat changed my life,\u201d Mr. Gross recalled.In 2013, Apple bought his fledgling company, Cue, a predictive search start-up. Mr. Gross spent four years at Apple, leading several projects and departed last year to join Y Combinator.Mr. Gross will retain a link to Y Combinator, but his main commitment now is to Pioneer, he said.Many of the proposals coming into Pioneer will likely be for technology and start-up ideas. But Pioneer is looking for innovators broadly. So far, it has lined up advisers to act as online or in-person mentors in nine categories including the arts and humanities, diversity, economics, music and philosophy. Pioneer is seeking more expert advisers.Laura Deming, 24, is the Pioneer adviser for projects in the science of longevity. While being home-schooled in New Zealand, Ms. Deming became fascinated with research into extending life spans. She sent an email to Cynthia Kenyon, a researcher in the biology of aging at the University of California, San Francisco. Eventually, Ms. Deming\u2019s persistence led to an invitation to work in the San Francisco lab. She was 12 years old.As an adviser, Ms. Deming brings expertise in her field. \u201cBut from my own experience, I also think it\u2019s important to have role models to encourage you and show you there are different paths to success,\u201d she said.The winners of the monthly tournament will receive $5,000 grants and plane tickets to San Francisco. They will stay for a week or more, meeting with each other, the advisers and others in the Bay Area.Pioneer, Mr. Gross acknowledged, is an experiment that will start small. The first group, he said, will probably be six to 12 people. A new group of pioneers will be admitted each month, and, if successful, Mr. Gross said, could eventually increase to hundreds a month.Pioneer is not a conventional investment fund in the sense that investors seek big payouts. It has a long-term plan to become self-sustaining, by taking a small stake in companies that emerge from Pioneer projects. But any proceeds will be put back into the Pioneer initiative, Mr. Gross said.\u201cIt is an experiment, but one that you can imagine scaling up to help tip the scale a bit, so fewer people miss out on opportunity,\u201d said Patrick Collison, 29, who grew up in a tiny Irish village and is now the co-founder and chief executive of Stripe, which is valued at more than $9 billion.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

But he and Mr. Gore were here in Greensboro to focus on another concern that many in the audience believed was just as insidious: pollution from North Carolina\u2019s coal-powered electrical plants.\u201cJesus said love your neighbor,\u201d Dr. Barber told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t care how many times you tell me you love me, if you put coal ash in my water you don\u2019t love me. Because if there was nothing wrong with the coal ash, then put it in the wealthy communities.\u201dDr. Barber rejected the notion that these were partisan issues. \u201cThis is the real question, not if Democrats are going to get elected, not if Republicans are going to get elected, but if America is going to be America, she\u2019s going to have to address systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism, and our false moral narrative of religious nationalism,\u201d he said.Mr. Gore, well known for his work on global warming, said the issues of coal pollution and climate change were linked. \u201cBoth are necessary byproducts of our addiction to fossil fuels,\u201d he said.The two men visited Belews Creek, a predominantly black community in a predominantly white county that resides in the shadow of the Belews Creek Steam Station, a coal-fired power plant.Belews Creek is a prime example of the kinds of communities threatened by coal ash pollution, said Lisa Evans, a lawyer for the environmental group Earthjustice, which is not involved in the suit. \u201cCoal ash ponds are in rural areas, particularly in the Southeast. Those communities have less power and less of a voice,\u201d she said.\u201cThose are the areas that do not have municipal water systems to filter and clean the water,\u201d Ms. Evans added. \u201cWhen you contaminate groundwater in a rural area, that\u2019s their lifeline.\u201dDuke says its studies and outside experts agree there is no evidence that the Belews Creek facility is polluting nearby drinking water wells. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good evidence that tells us that the drinking water wells remain very safe, and that the groundwater impacts around the basin are well-defined and well understood and not impacting the neighbors,\u201d said Paige Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the utility.Leslie Bray Brewer, a pastor who grew up in Belews Creek, remembers what life was like in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, a few years after the plant opened. Coal ash \u201cwas everywhere \u2014 the soil, the car, our roofs,\u201d she said.She said her children later suffered breathing problems. \u201cThen we started to put two and two together that a lot of the neighbors were having these issues,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s actually people down there that have to bathe in bottled water,\u201d said David Hairston, a board member of Appalachian Voices and a native of the region. \u201cThat\u2019s how fearful they are.\u201dAfterward, the state ordered Duke to close 32 coal ash ponds. The company\u2019s plan at Belews Creek is to drain the pond but leave the ash in place, filling the structure with soil and capping it with a weatherproof cover. Environmentalists want Duke to excavate the coal ash completely.Ms. Sheehan, the Duke spokeswoman, said excavation at Belews Creek would be risky and costly. The lawsuit \u201cwas filed by a number of critic organizations who want to burden people with excavation,\u201d she said. \u201cCapping is supported by the science and the engineering.\u201dIf North Carolina has a history of environmental problems, it also has a history of environmental protest.\u201cWhere did the environmental justice movement begin?\u201d Mr. Gore asked after taking the lectern at Shiloh Baptist. \u201cIt began right here in North Carolina in 1982 in Warren County.\u201dBefore they became famous for their protest, at least two of the group, which became known as the Greensboro Four, attended Shiloh Baptist.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a pastor who grew up in Belews Creek.

{"Headline": "\u2018Economy Is Strong,\u2019 Fed Chairman Says, Urging a Policy of Risk Management", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Powell\u2019s comments, at an annual gathering of leading economists and central bankers in the Grand Tetons, indicate that the Fed\u2019s strategy of moving slowly in raising interest rates is likely to stay in place. He argued for remaining open-minded about just how low unemployment can go or where rates might end up, suggesting the Fed would be guided by data rather than by assumptions.\u201cThe economy is strong,\u201d Mr. Powell said, according to prepared text of his remarks. \u201cInflation is near our 2 percent objective, and most people who want a job are finding one.\u201dHe specifically rejected the fear that inflation might be accelerating beyond the level the Fed seeks, which suggests no abrupt rate increases are on the way. \u201cWhile inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating.\u201dHis remarks came as the Fed, which has raised interest rates twice so far in 2018, weighs whether to do so one or two more times this year, and how much to raise interest rates in 2019 in an economy growing at a steady clip and with an unemployment rate hovering near its lowest level in two decades.In arguing for a risk management approach, Mr. Powell invoked a principle attributed to the economist William Brainard, saying, \u201cWhen you are uncertain about the effects of your actions, you should move conservatively,\u201d much like starting a patient on a small dose of medicine to judge the reaction.In the current context, that implies the Fed should move in small steps and constantly re-evaluate its plans in light of the latest data. Mr. Powell added that a more aggressive strategy would be warranted in the event of a financial crisis or if the Fed\u2019s credibility as an inflation-fighter were to come into doubt.The Fed, he argued, must learn from one of its past failures \u2014 allowing high inflation to take off in the 1970s \u2014 and a past success, of allowing the boom of the late 1990s to take hold rather than cutting it off out of misguided fear of inflation.One of the Fed\u2019s central errors of the 1970s, he argued, was excessive confidence in estimates of the so-called natural rate of unemployment, the level to which joblessness can fall without sparking inflation. That mistake helped fuel double-digit inflation by the end of that decade.By contrast, in the mid-1990s Chairman Alan Greenspan suspected that the economy\u2019s productive capacity was rising rapidly, and so he resisted calls from his colleagues to raise interest rates to prevent overheating and inflation.\u201cUnder Chairman Greenspan\u2019s leadership,\u201d Mr. Powell said, the Fed \u201cconverged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request: Let\u2019s wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence tightening.\u201dInflation fell rather than rose, and the Fed\u2019s caution enabled a boom that drove wages up and unemployment down.There was a small hint that Mr. Powell was thinking about the possibility that history might repeat. \u201cIt is difficult to say,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen or whether the economy will break out of its low-productivity mode of the past decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise more meaningfully over time.\u201dMr. Powell turned to a nautical pun to explain the challenges of setting monetary policy. When economists refer to the natural rate of unemployment, they use the term \u201cu*,\u201d pronounced U-star, and call the natural interest rate r*, or R-star.But these natural rates are the Fed\u2019s best estimates, and must be inferred from things that the Fed can measure more directly, like wage growth and inflation.\u201cNavigating by the stars can sound straightforward,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cGuiding policy by the stars in practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the location of the stars have been changing significantly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Is Rattling China\u2019s Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent days, officials from the Commerce Ministry, the police and other agencies have summoned exporters to ask about plans to lay off workers or shift supply chains to other countries.State news outlets, by contrast, have sought to promote the official line, with the authorities restricting the use of the phrase \u201ctrade war.\u201dStill, policy disputes over how to bolster the economy have at times spilled into the open, with the state media sometimes coming under attack for boasting about China\u2019s economic strengths.If the trade war escalates \u2014 and Mr. Trump has shown no sign of backing down \u2014 some worry that the public\u2019s faith in the economy could be shaken, exposing the nation to much more serious problems than a drop in exports. New economic data on Tuesday showed slower growth in investment and consumer spending, and there are fears that the financial crisis in Turkey could spread.China\u2019s leaders have argued that they can outlast Mr. Trump in a trade standoff. Their authoritarian system can stifle dissent and quickly redirect resources, and they expect Washington to be gridlocked and come under pressure from voters feeling the pain of trade disruptions.But the Communist Party is vulnerable in its own way. It needs growth to justify its monopoly on power and is obsessed with preventing social instability. Mr. Xi\u2019s strongman grip may be hindering effective policymaking, as officials fail to pass on bad news, defer decisions to him and rigidly carry out his orders, for better or worse.Some inside the government have argued China should be more aggressive and put Mr. Trump on the defensive, while others have proposed concessions to address American complaints, said Chen Dingding, a professor of international relations at Jinan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.He said the debate was \u201ca healthy development\u201d because it would \u201cinform the public and make policymakers better.\u201d\u201cAll of this coming together suggests Xi\u2019s grip on authority has been loosened,\u201d said Willy Wo-lap Lam, a longtime observer of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cHe\u2019s unable to fill his function as the final arbiter who settles differences among his closest advisers.\u201dEven so, the government last month requested that dozens of research institutes and universities each submit analyses on how different regions and industrial sectors would be affected if the trade war worsened and what the impact would be on unemployment and the financial markets.China sold roughly $500 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total exports and about 4 percent of national economic production.If the United States imposes tariffs on all Chinese goods, even pessimistic Chinese economists contend the country might suffer only a 1 percent drop of output from lost exports. China so dominates some industries, such as smartphone manufacturing, that tariffs may not do much damage. In other industries, China might lose business to rivals like South Korea but find opportunities to export its goods to other markets.While factories that make price-sensitive electronics and other electrical products are already beginning to lose orders, China is so competitive across so many sectors that exports to the United States are actually still rising despite the relatively limited tariffs that have taken effect.The worst case for China, however, is that the trade war undermines economic confidence. The nation\u2019s housing market teeters on a mountain of debt, and low-interest loans from state banks have built overcapacity in many industries. The worry is that prolonged trade tensions could cause money to rush out of China despite currency controls and prompt much bigger financial and economic troubles.To the extent there has been finger-pointing in the establishment, the focus appears to be less on China\u2019s trade practices than on its propaganda message. Some analysts have argued that the trade war could have been avoided if Beijing had refrained from triumphalist rhetoric about China\u2019s rise as a global power. That rhetoric is closely associated with Mr. Xi himself.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of second-guessing about whether the great leader played his cards right,\u201d said Jerome Cohen, faculty director of the United States-Asia Law Institute at New York University.A group of alumni from Tsinghua, one of China\u2019s most prestigious universities, recently circulated a petition calling for the dismissal of a well-known economist on the faculty who is an ardent defender of Mr. Xi\u2019s policies. They accused the scholar, Hu Angang, of misleading the leadership by arguing last year that China had already surpassed the United States as an economic and technological power.\u201cA slowing economy and friction with the United States provides an opportunity for people to push back,\u201d said Trey McArver, a partner with Trivium China, a research consultancy in Beijing and London.As the trade dispute festers, Chinese business leaders have been circumspect, saying almost nothing about it publicly for fear of angering Beijing. It is clear, though, that they and government officials were caught off guard.\u201cOutside of government negotiators, few people took this possibility very seriously until July 6,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to the date when tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods took effect.Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the assumption that Beijing could avoid a trade war \u201csuffused every conversation\u201d he had with officials earlier this year.\u201cThey were wrong, and they are smarting over that, trying to find north and recalibrate,\u201d he said.Tensions inside the government flared into the open last month when Xu Zhong, the research director of China\u2019s central bank, published an essay rebuffing calls to bolster the economy by issuing more money. He castigated the Finance Ministry instead for a \u201cdearth of effective fiscal policies,\u201d referring to extra government spending and tax cuts.Soon afterward, the cabinet ordered more infrastructure spending to shore up growth. In the past week, the central bank has also pumped tens of billions of dollars into the economy and driven short-term interest rates down sharply.Presented with a choice of fiscal or monetary stimulus, the leadership in effect avoided making a decision by choosing both, despite the risk of exacerbating the nation\u2019s budget deficit and chronic debt problems.Mr. Xi is presumably at the center of such decision-making. He has surrounded himself with officials who built their careers in part on their ability to deal with the United States and who might be damaged politically if the trade war goes badly for China.The leadership can still divert criticism by blaming the United States. So far, it has not ratcheted up anti-American propaganda beyond the usual volume nor encouraged protests or boycotts of the sort directed at Japan in the past.Asked on a recent afternoon about the trade tensions, a worker making digital control panels at a factory in the southern city of Zhongshan paused before she replied. \u201cIf we are going to fight a trade war,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if my job may be affected, I will still support our country.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research from Shanghai, and Olivia Mitchell Ryan from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "300,000 Troops and 900 Tanks: Russia\u2019s Biggest Military Drills Since Cold War", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRussia is mobilizing for its biggest military exercise since the height of the Cold War, the Kremlin says, citing a tense international climate that is \u201cfrequently aggressive and unfriendly toward us.\u201dThe exercises, which are set to involve nearly 300,000 Russian troops, 1,000 aircraft and 900 tanks, will also include units from China for the first time. They will start on Sept. 11.In a separate display of military power, Russia was reported on Tuesday to have assembled a large flotilla of warships off the coast of Syria. Russian news media outlets, citing unnamed defense ministry officials, described it is as Russia\u2019s largest naval deployment in the area since Moscow first intervened in Syria\u2019s civil war in September 2015.The move follows a flurry of claims by Russia, unsupported by evidence, that the West is preparing to stage a fake chemical weapons attack inside Syria as a pretext for an assault on the forces of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.Known as Vostok-2018 or East-2018, the September military exercises, involving land and air units, will begin near Russia\u2019s eastern border with China and Mongolia. Both have agreed to join a series of regular exercises that used to be restricted to Russia and countries that were either once part of the Soviet Union or Soviet allies.The participation of China, which will send helicopters and about 3,200 troops from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, signals a significant reshaping of military exercises that began in the Soviet era. For decades they were aimed primarily at preparing the Red Army for a possible attack by or on China.President Vladimir V. Putin, his ties with the West severely strained by Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and military incursions into eastern Ukraine, has put a premium on developing ever closer ties with China as a counterweight and insurance policy against the United States.Asked on Tuesday at a regular briefing with reporters why Vostok-2018 would be so big, a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said, \u201cThe country\u2019s ability to defend itself in the current international situation, which is frequently quite aggressive and unfriendly toward us, is absolutely justified and has no alternative.\u201dRussia\u2019s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that the exercises in Russia\u2019s far east would be the \u201cbiggest drill to take place in Russia since 1981.\u201d That was the year large exercises known as Zapad, or West, were held by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.In the West, Russia faces off against NATO, but on its eastern flank, it has no obvious enemy or rival. The area has instead become a zone where Russia is keen to demonstrate its close ties to China, despite the risk that Russia\u2019s weak economy and vast expanses of sparsely populated territory make it a vulnerable junior partner.Alexander Gabuev, a China expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research group, said that while the scale of the exercises was significant, \u201cwhat is most significant is that China is taking part in drills that Russia only used to do with its allies.\u201d\u201cChina was seen as the potential threat or target in exercises like Vostok,\u201d Mr. Gabuev said, \u201cbut it is now being invited to join as a friend and even a quasi-ally. This is really unprecedented.\u201dAll the same, he said, Chinese troops taking part in Vostok-2018 may well be restricted to a military training ground in Tsugol, near where the borders of China, Russia and Mongolia meet. That could allow a far bigger Russian contingent elsewhere to prepare for clashes with China.Russia\u2019s military, Mr. Gabuev said, \u201cis not so na\u00efve that it is not preparing a contingency plan\u201d in case relations with China take a sudden turn for the worse, as has happened many times in the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Feels the Squeeze of the Trump Trade Tariffs", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Higher prices. Disrupted supply chains. Wavering exports.Those are some of the ways that some of Europe\u2019s biggest companies have been affected by President Trump\u2019s trade war, offering a preview of how tensions in global commerce could begin to ripple through the European economy.As companies like BMW, Siemens and Volkswagen reported otherwise solid earnings this week, they warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive stance on trade presented them with a host of new risks, which may already be acting as a drag on growth.The president\u2019s tariffs have not just raised the costs of materials like steel, they have also diverted trade worldwide and warped the complex global supply systems that businesses rely on. Here in Europe, there are signs of strain, which, along with risks ranging from Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union to the excessive debt loads of Italy and Greece, are piling pressure on the region\u2019s economy.Beyond the direct effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, surveys in both the United States and Europe show that businesses are nervous about the fragile d\u00e9tente reached in late July between Mr. Trump and the region he had referred to only a few weeks earlier as a \u201cfoe.\u201d When managers are afraid, they may cancel or delay investments in new equipment or expansion, hurting companies like Siemens, the German industrial goods giant, whose products include technology to operate factories or manage buildings.Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Siemens, acknowledged a risk that \u201call the noise will scare away the confidence of our customers.\u201dEuropean companies can suffer collateral damage in that battle \u2014 BMW has already raised prices of S.U.V.s exported to China from its factory in Spartanburg, S.C. The German automaker is passing on the added cost from tariffs that China imposed on American products in retaliation for Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods.If the trade war continues, some companies may begin to move production to avoid paying the levies. BMW hinted as much on Thursday, saying it could sidestep the tariffs by transferring some car production to China, though the company hasn\u2019t done so yet.\u201cBMW can react very quickly to changes in the market because of our flexible network,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, the chief executive of BMW, said during a conference call with reporters.\u201cProtectionist tendencies are escalating worldwide,\u201d Herbert Diess, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said at a news conference.This pessimism is affecting not just major companies but the European economy broadly.Eurostat has not yet provided any underlying data to explain the loss of momentum. So far, the direct effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs are limited, Johannes Bahrke, a spokesman for the European Commission, said Thursday.But, Mr. Bahrke said in a statement, \u201ctrade protectionism is a serious downside risk for the global economic outlook.\u201dThe tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on European steel and aluminum don\u2019t amount to a lot of money, relatively speaking. They hit European exports worth about $8 billion annually, a substantial sum but not enough to knock the economy off course.Gauges of the mood among European businesses, however, show a clear negative trend, one that could have an outsize impact on the regional economy. And if Europe\u2019s economy suffers, so will that of the United States. Despite all the hostile rhetoric, the European Union and United States remain each other\u2019s biggest trading partner.\u201cIn the hard facts, hardly anything has changed,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank. Rather, he said, trade tensions are \u201ca cloud of uncertainty hanging over\u201d Europe.American businesses are worried, too. A closely watched barometer of sentiment among United States managers dipped to a 12-month low Thursday. Concern about tariffs is \u201can overwhelming concern,\u201d the Institute for Supply Management, which conducted the survey, said Thursday.There are other forces at work, as well, that are weighing on European growth, such as a stronger euro, which makes products manufactured in the eurozone more expensive in markets abroad.The damage from trade tensions would be much more substantial if Mr. Trump broke the cease-fire he reached last month with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.The two leaders agreed to begin talks on an accord that would eliminate tariffs between the United States and the European Union. They also pledged not to take any measures against each other while the negotiations took place. That would seem at least to postpone moves by Mr. Trump to impose 20 percent tariffs on vehicles imported from Europe, which were worth $47 billion last year.But given Mr. Trump\u2019s history of making nice with foreign leaders one day and then blasting them on Twitter the next, there is palpable nervousness about how long the truce will last.On Tuesday, representatives of Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union, all of which have large car industries, met in Geneva and discussed the Trump administration\u2019s effort to use national security as a justification to place tariffs on imported cars. The meeting was a sign that the car-making nations continue to gird themselves for a resumption of hostilities, just in case.Even if Europe manages to stay relatively clear of any dispute over auto imports, its economy would be disrupted by escalating tensions between the United States and China. Carmakers and other manufacturers depend on complicated supply networks in which components often move across borders and continents multiple times. Both the United States and China are integral players in those networks.\u201cThe global supply chains are deeply interconnected,\u201d Ralf P. Thomas, the chief financial officer of Siemens, told reporters Thursday. Stable conditions are \u201cof utmost importance.\u201dFor now, business leaders are hoping that the cease-fire holds and that negotiations between Brussels and the White House are successful.\u201cThe trade situation is certainly volatile,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00fcger, the BMW chief, said Thursday. \u201cWe hope that the talks continue in a constructive way.\u201dMilan Schreuer contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}

This has resulted in everything from Instagram accounts about our society\u2019s racist beauty standards, to Musical.ly fund-raisers for L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights groups, to creative writing pieces, artwork and political letters that urge others to help victims of police brutality, mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline.The project culminates in a TEDx Talk. They share what they\u2019ve learned about their issues, talk about the forms of action they\u2019ve already taken toward making a difference, and get see themselves in the vein of the activist leaders we\u2019ve studied in preparation for this, like Bryan Stevenson, Malala Yousafzai and Emma Gonzalez.Kristen Kalenowicz, Milwaukee, High SchoolTwo years ago I introduced the lens of mental health to discuss \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d and \u201cThe Bell Jar.\u201dPart of me wondered if this was overstepping, if mental illness should be saved for health class. Yet over the past year, my belief that young people need to explore mental health across all disciplines has been reaffirmed. With the recent suicides of public figures, the bullying of L.G.B.T.Q.+ individuals, and society\u2019s discussion surrounding school shooters and mental illness, this is a topic that we cannot afford to leave out.Kellyn McNamara, Charlotte, N.C., Middle and High SchoolI am designing an Earth and environmental science class in which students will connect a current event or issue to each unit\u2019s content. For instance, for Unit 1, Earth as a Planet, students will explore the history of space exploration (and its funding), and prepare for a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate in which they will argue either for federal funding of space exploration, or for privatized space exploration.Heidi Echternacht, Princeton, N.J., Elementary SchoolOur second-grade class explored community all year last year. First, we interviewed and drew portraits of each other in class. Then we interviewed people who worked at school and drew their portraits for a community art show. Next, we expanded into Princeton and toured the town, interviewing chefs, firefighters and the mayor, and had an art show in the town library featuring our interviews and portraits.After that, the kids decided to invent their own town they called 2ndton. They wanted to have stores, use money and hold court to solve problems, so we did. They wanted to pay taxes, so we did that, too. We were going to have an election for mayor, but they decided against it in case people\u2019s feelings got hurt. Finally, we started our own newspaper and wrote about topics ranging from biographies of people in the New Jersey Hall of Fame to national news about Donald Trump and the Women\u2019s March. We reported world news, primarily through covering the Olympics. We had subscribers and delivery routes that were coordinated by students and charged 10 cents for a subscription and a penny per paper. We put out a paper twice a week for six weeks. At the end, each student wrote an essay on community, citizenship and democracy.Tricia Ebarvia, Berwyn, Penn., High SchoolAs devastating details about the migrant crisis and family separation policies emerge \u2014 and with continued hate crimes against Muslim Americans and anti-immigrant rhetoric \u2014 I believe it is imperative to help students think critically and responsibly about how language is often used as a weapon to dehumanize others, particularly communities of color. I start this fall teaching two Vietnam War novels, \u201cFallen Angels\u201d by Walter Dean Myers and \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d by Tim O\u2019Brien. By examining how language in both texts characterizes the enemy in dehumanizing ways, we can draw a connection to the ways in which language today is used to marginalize immigrants and refugees \u2014 and what this means for us as diverse citizens in \u201cthe land of the free and home of the brave.\u201dKenny, Philadelphia, High SchoolDuring our reading of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d I ask students to observe their own relationships as citizens to their government. We also discuss contemporary examples of surveillance and the complexities of living in a world Orwell would have never predicted: one where we the citizens are the ones wielding the cameras and creating a society that challenges the boundaries between public and private life. Often, I will remind students of topics in our text and ask them to search for related articles in the news.When we read \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d I ask students to research and discuss contemporary science issues such as cloning, stem cell research and technology. They also delve into existentialism, parenting, prejudice and identity. All of these universal concepts seem to make their way into discussions about current events. Discussing the \u201coutsider\u201d persona of the Creature can lead to rich and meaningful conversations about civility, diversity and acceptance.Chris Cerrone, Hamburg, N.Y., Middle SchoolAs a seventh-grade social studies teacher, I have done congressional civics simulations about how a bill becomes a law for many years. Students research and prepare their bill for two days and then we spend two days as members of Congress.Whitney Lawrence, Dallas, Elementary SchoolLast year I had my fourth and fifth graders read current-event articles and decide what our world needed more of. The students made Brave Bots and Hope Bots to place in the community. They gave one bot to a person in need, kept one as a reminder to be hopeful or brave, and put the other two out into the community.As the midterm elections approach, my students will create Action Bots, Voter Bots and Voice Bots, encouraging the community to get out and vote. Students will design their bots on the back of a domino, using multicolored Sharpies. Attached to the bot will be a letter written or typed by the students, informing citizens what is at stake in their state elections and encouraging citizens to use their voices by voting. In the letters, students will encourage others to make bots and place them around the community or move the bot they found to a new location.Our children may not be able to vote, but the results of these fall elections will have a great impact on their lives. Thus, they deserve to have a voice in the coming elections.Susan Barber, Atlanta, High SchoolAs a literature teacher, I can choose all types of texts to teach reading skills, but I love bringing in modern voices to help students explore current issues. Many told me they had never read anything like \u201cCounting Descent\u201d in school and it offered them, predominantly upper-middle-class white teenagers, an avenue to consider a different perspective on race and coming of age than what they are typically exposed to in suburban Atlanta.Aimee Alexander, Newport, Vt., High SchoolLast school year was a tremendous time in Vermont for discussing Second Amendment issues. After Parkland, my students were interested in learning more about gun rights and gun-safety regulations, so I invited local state senators from both parties to come speak to my students. They prepared for both visits by doing research so that they could support their own points of view with facts and could question specifics from each senator\u2019s voting record. Then, we went on a field trip to the Edward Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston, where my students participated in a mock congressional session working on immigration reform. This certainly made the issues on the news much more relevant to them.Elizabeth Misiewicz, Ridgefield, Conn., Middle SchoolLast year, my students wrote speeches on topics they were passionate about that they could tie to the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They delivered these five- to six-minute speeches while also managing a Google slide presentation (like a true TED Talk!) before an audience of around 100 people made up of parents, teachers, staff and administrators.As middle schoolers, my students are growing into their identities and trying to find their places in the world. This project essentially said to them, \u201cYour opinions are important, and you deserve to be heard.\u201dMeg Arbeiter, Chicago, High School\u2022What do borders mean to you?\u2022How do you reimagine borders?These questions will provide a framework for our study of a wide range of texts (novels, literary nonfiction, essays and poems) by a multitude of authors, and I will invite students to recommend writers, texts, places and cultures to expand our curriculum and ensure representation.Larry Bowler Jr., Warrington, Pa., High SchoolI hope to start the coming school year by letting my students know that the new normal of meanness and disrespect, from the president on down, is not, in fact, normal. Civility must be demonstrated in the classroom, if nowhere else.Todd M. Mealy, Millersville, Pa., High SchoolBecause of the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy and policy of separating migrant families, I am thinking of doing something new with my unit on Latinx studies for my seminar on race, ethnicity, and gender class.The Latinx study unit is preceded by a unit on Asian-American studies and the myth of the model minority. I see value in having students compare the experiences of Asian and Latino immigration into the United States, since both groups have endured fluctuating periods of citizenship.Laura L. Jones, Baltimore, Elementary SchoolWe have a community meeting every morning in my fourth-grade class to discuss what happened over the weekend, share our \u201cvirtue of the week\u201d or discuss anything on our minds. A weekly current-events assignment asks students to watch the news, read the newspaper or go to kid-friendly news sites to find something that interests them. I do not allow entertainment news or sports news to be discussed for this assignment. I also use Scholastic News magazines for reading comprehension as well as connecting our classroom community to what is happening outside our sphere.Hayley Breden, Denver, High SchoolSomething I try to emphasize in my classes is that the more I\u2019ve learned about issues and events in our nation\u2019s past, the more questions I have about our present.Over the past few years, and especially since November 2016, I have noticed that my students have an urgent interest in learning about how we got to now in our culture, country, and world. This coming year, I\u2019ll be placing a renewed emphasis on these essential questions that apply broadly to all of American history. We will address these questions throughout the school year:\u2022 To what extent have definitions of what it means to be \u201cAmerican\u201d changed or stayed the same since 1492?\u2022 In what ways do power and privilege dynamics shape who is included and excluded by American laws and policies?\u2022 In what ways does our society still hurt from oppression, and what can we do now and in the future to live up to the American ideals of freedom, equality and opportunity?\u2022 In what ways are economic, political and social power intertwined throughout American history?\u2022 How can hearing from multiple voices give us a better understanding of what has happened in the past and is currently happening today?Jon Resendez, Irvine, Calif., High SchoolCurrent events are the practical examples we use to apply the conceptual learning we do. My social studies students and I engage in regular discussions and debates on what is happening in the country and beyond.In these discussions, I model effective questioning techniques to probe and challenge my students\u2019 assumptions about various topics. From there, students practice their inquiry techniques through the application of various thinking routines inspired by provocative current-event-based videos, music, quotes and articles that allow them to brainstorm their own questions for research. Then I allow them to spend time in the classroom finding and sharing answers to those questions.Heathre Palige, Federal Heights, Colo., Elementary SchoolDo our students understand the advantages to consciously putting money into their savings for their futures? Are they discovering how to use a spreadsheet to see their expenditures and budget their incoming cash? Do they understand money market accounts and the stock market? In school, is anyone showing children the importance of financial literacy: debt-to-income ratios, types of mortgage rates, keeping track of monthly payments, the importance of saving for retirement, how to balance a checkbook?Michelle Lugo, Puerto Rico, High SchoolMake your lessons pertinent to life, and to your students\u2019 life decisions. Twelfth graders heading to college, not knowing which path to choose, can learn with Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cThe Road Not Taken.\u201d Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cStill I Rise\u201d and \u201cPhenomenal Woman\u201d can be connected to current issues around immigration and feminism. Make your students feel a part of the world. Their favorite athletes, musicians and celebrities can be can be connected to anything you\u2019re teaching.Claudine James, Malvern, Ark., Middle School In my English language arts lessons each spring, my students construct a tolerance-themed four-day exhibition hosted by the local community college and attended by district students and the community. In 2018, we created one called \u201cWe the People: Our Stories.\u201dThe exhibit highlighted various thematic stories: overcoming genocide, fighting for civil rights, women\u2019s fight for equality, immigrants\u2019 struggles, equality in education and achieving the American dream. Throughout the year, students were assigned multicultural novels, short stories, picture books and informational texts to read that related to the different themes.Lou Frederick, Brooklyn, N.Y., High SchoolI\u2019m going to spend the summer looking at ways to tackle two essential questions for my 10th grade humanities class: How do individuals define themselves and how are they defined? How does power or the lack of it affect individuals, groups and societies?One work we read is \u201cWoman Warrior\u201d by Maxine Hong Kingston. Through this novel, I want to address issues of ethnicity, immigration and gender. My plan is to have them read and analyze articles on the diversity of the Asian community in New York City. I also want to look at recent developments in the United States border policy that directly affect many of my students. Related to this, we will look ahead to what questions and racial categories will be on the 2020 census. I also plan to have my students look at the novel through the lenses of recent developments in the #MeToo movement, the latest Supreme Court pick and women\u2019s reproductive rights. I also plan to have them look at current media portrayals of female superheroes: Wonder Woman; Black Widow; Okoye, Shuri and Nakia from \u201cBlack Panther\u201d; and the Wasp in the latest Marvel offering.Mark Drago, Summerville, Mass., Middle and High SchoolDespite news reports like this one, and the fact that heat records keep being broken, every year I have some students say they do not think the climate is changing. I do not try to silence my student\u2019s ideas. Instead, I want to take the tools we use in class to address these current issues. Mathematics can help us understand the world around us and what is happening.Estella Owoimaha-Church, Los Angeles, High School1. students self-selecting relevant issues or events to their age group and community2. researching the issue at length3. interviewing stakeholders4. working together to compose a play5. getting the play out into the communityJarred Amato, Nashville, High SchoolOver time, we have focused our efforts on increasing access to high-quality, culturally relevant books, so that all students can develop authentic reading identities. We believe wholeheartedly in empowering our students as readers and leaders, and providing our young people with the time and space to read, discuss and celebrate books that affirm and value their identities and lived experiences.Our community now includes 400 Project LIT chapters in more than 40 states, and together we will continue to support and inspire one another, advocate policies and practices that challenge the status quo, and amplify the voices and stories of students and educators of color.Courtne Thomas, Newark, Middle SchoolAs English language arts educators, a colleague and I noticed our students\u2019 disengagement from the curriculum we were given. Simply put, it was not culturally relevant to their experiences, and the outcome was low achievement on benchmark testing. And yet, these same African-American and Latino young people would provide in-depth lyrical analysis of hip-hop songs by J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Wale. Central to hip-hop is storytelling about the political, social and economic challenges faced by people living in poor communities.My colleague and I tapped into the power of musical language to reach disaffected readers, and discovered that hip-hop can be used as a vehicle to promote literacy and academic achievement. We took a type of language and used it to reach a specific population that was never motivated to read via the five-week curriculum we created, \u201cThe Message: Using Hip-Hop Pedagogy as a Literacy-Building Tool.\u201dWhile investigating topics such as poverty, food insecurity and homelessness, as well as more positive topics such as determination, perseverance and resilience, our students have been able to make connections to the fields of economics, management and communications.Mirah Anti, Chicago, High SchoolOur civics curriculum is two semester-long courses, one a version of an introduction to civics and the other a deeper dive into what some refer to as the fourth branch of government or the fourth estate: media.I worked with my students to understand the role of the media through both the historic lens of the Pentagon Papers and the contemporary lens of the probe into the connection between the Trump campaign and Russia. Our research and processing are documented in the \u201cdetective web\u201d in the photo above.Barbara Gottschalk, Warren, Mich., Elementary SchoolI teach elementary E.S.L., and I work closely with general-education teachers to support English-language learners, the majority of whom are Christian Iraqis.Julie Mann, Queens, N.Y., High SchoolMy human rights class for E.S.L. students has always been built around current events; I never know what I\u2019m going to teach until life happens.Since the new administration took over, our class has been very focused on immigrant rights: travel bans, ICE raids, DACA, the myth of the criminal immigrant, and now the separation of families. This is the first time we\u2019ve ever made our own population the focus of the human rights class and I am guessing this is going to continue into next year.Savannah Lodge-Scharff, Roxbury, Mass., High SchoolBrett Vogelsinger, Central Bucks County, Penn., Middle SchoolConnecting current events to our study of literature and our independent-reading books makes the point that \u201ctheme\u201d is not some hidden picture or message in invisible ink within a text. Rather, themes in literature extend beyond the text and apply to real-life situations. We can find a theme from \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d that surfaces on the New York Times home page or in an Op-Ed. Jessica Kaiser, Lebanon, Ohio, Middle School Along with several choice novels, eighth graders in my school read three core texts: \u201cThe Giver\u201d by Lois Lowry; \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d by Mildred Taylor; and \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel. We often make connections to current events and how conflicts of the past are still prevalent today. In addition, these texts raise students\u2019 awareness of themselves, and of the people, ideologies and experiences that shape a person\u2019s identity.The latter two novels, \u201cNight\u201d and \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,\u201d provide a common theme: Social injustices are often based on a single aspect of one\u2019s story. This theme allows connections to a plethora of modern-day literature and current events. Students choose from several different young-adult titles incorporating the common theme, social injustice. Students connect with and compare the plight of their character in their new book with that of the protagonists in the books we\u2019ve studied together, and to themselves.Mary Van Ellis, Central Bucks County, Pa., High SchoolThese videos are good to spur creative thinking and show what kind of out-of-the-box research is being done. After showing these videos, I may ask for discussion with a partner, then a class share, and ask for students to jot down ideas and thoughts about what they learned. Why do this? To show how we as humans have a lot to learn about how other creatures (even ones as lowly as a spider) figure out ways to survive, flourish and evolve, to pass on their genes!TSAT, New York, N.Y., CollegeI teach English-language learners at the college level through content-based language teaching or instruction, often using current events. My go-to sources are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. I also rely on Flipboard, an app that has helped identify relatively obscure but interesting sources such as blogs and foreign media organizations.While my students are adults, some of the recent current events have been challenging to tackle, like the #MeToo movement and sexual harassment, the racial and ethnic tension behind the immigration debate and the latest in the L.G.B.T.Q. movement. Since my students are international, it requires special attention and sensitivity to navigate their cultural backgrounds, gender identities and religious beliefs. I find it interesting that a lot of time is often devoted to helping students understand and decode the culturally specific nature and dynamics that undergird many of the current events in the popular discourse.Brian Melton, Carol Stream, Ill., High SchoolKathleen Palmieri, New York, Elementary SchoolThe fifth-grade curriculum includes exploring governments in the Western Hemisphere in regard to differences in structure, as well as exploring relationships between countries globally.Rather than being textbook-driven, I plan to use current events to provide students with an understanding of our standing as a nation and the relationships we have throughout the world. As our president meets with the various leaders, it is important to remain neutral in any personal political beliefs, but instead continuously make connections to the curriculum.Jill Yamasawa Fletcher, Kapolei, Hawaii, Middle SchoolWe read the poems together and we discuss the ideas the poems bring up. From there we may research questions we have about what the poem references. When I introduce the poem, I tell students I\u2019m reading the poem with them for only the second time and I\u2019m learning and thinking about the poem with them. We are actually learning together.Jacqueline Fitzgerald, Portland, Ore., High SchoolIf I teach students that current events and issues are immediate and very present here in Oregon, if I support them in seeing their own lives reflected in everything going on \u201cout there,\u201d I hope they won\u2019t feel so overwhelmed by it all.My students were eager learners for this unit, digging into the texts and discussion opportunities with a fervor that communicated their hunger for wanting to understand race and racism in their own community, even if they\u2019d experienced racism firsthand.Debra Greene, Norwell, Mass., High SchoolI always try to help my students understand how the material we read is relevant to their lives. For example, with my freshmen, I pair Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d with Margaret Atwood\u2019s feminist reimagining of that classic, \u201cThe Penelopiad.\u201d As part of that unit, I teach my students about the history of feminism as well as current issues such as #MeToo, the wage gap and rape culture.My freshmen also read Julia Alvarez\u2019s novel \u201cHow the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents.\u201d I have students examine statistics and stories about immigrants, and they have to interview a family member about their own family\u2019s story of coming to the United States. Then, we do a jigsaw of articles about different immigrant groups who have been targeted and stereotyped at various times in our country\u2019s history, such as the Irish and Italians. These groups were accused of such things as being terrorists and taking the jobs of Americans. My students recognize that these same accusations are hurled at Hispanic and Muslim immigrants today.Valente Gibson, Columbia, S.C., Elementary SchoolNext year, I plan to focus my teaching around helping my students bridge the gap between historic and current events, especially issues that largely affect students of color. For example, Rosa Parks\u2019s role in the Montgomery bus boycott can be associated with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality.Kalil Kantara, Humboldt County, Calif., Middle SchoolMy middle school students struggle to connect history to current events and often lack context for the latest headlines. This year, I found a lot of success in teaching early American history through the lens of the environmental movement. Students were incredulous at the shortsighted and callous ways in which European settlers polluted their own waterways, clear cut forests and destroyed ecosystems. To students living in a rural area, environmental degradation has a clear and significant impact on their lives, from lower spring water flows available during California\u2019s droughts to the diminished salmon populations due to overfishing and the pollution of the ocean. All year long we worked to connect the worldviews that could lead to such opportunistic and shortsighted thinking 100 years ago with those we are seeing in the world today.Melody Mullis, Central Bucks County, Pa., High SchoolFor students to get the most out of any piece of literature, I encourage them to make connections to text, self and world.In class, we read and discuss at least one article a week that is a current event but also connects to the text we are reading at the time. I also share TED Talks that are somehow related to the literature, even if it\u2019s not readily obvious to them how at first. The goal is to keep driving that point home \u2014 that connections can, and should, be made. By the second month of class, students naturally make the connections in discussions without being prompted.Megan Allen, Columbia, S.C., Elementary SchoolAs a white counselor working with mostly minority students, I am sensitive to the stories, needs and fears of my elementary students. It became clear last year that there was a heightened sense of fear because of current events such as police brutality, immigration issues, presidential tweets and comments, and government policy. Students are listening and watching, but schools rarely directly tackle these topics because of to their sensitive nature.As the only school counselor, I saw a need to address the issue of race and allow students the opportunity to express their thoughts, feelings and concerns in a safe environment at school. With the support of administration and classroom teachers, I led a class activity about prejudices which transformed into an open discussion about race. It was a wonderful way to allow children to process the world around them with the support of their peers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How South Koreans Are Reckoning With a Changing American Military Presence", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarIn late June, Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of United States Forces Korea, addressed a large uniformed crowd at an outdoor ceremony 40 miles south of Seoul. He christened a glittering new headquarters at United States Army Garrison Humphreys, usually referred to as Camp Humphreys, an American military base in the city of Pyeongtaek. Just two weeks earlier, President Donald Trump suggested in Singapore that American troops should be drawn down, if not removed altogether, from the Korean Peninsula, but Brooks made no mention in his remarks of any planned reduction, instead proclaiming that United States Forces Korea \u201cwill remain the living proof of the American commitment to the alliance.\u201d In his own congratulatory message, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said the partnership between his country and the United States has been \u201cthe foundation for peace and stability and paved the way for South Korea\u2019s democratization and economic growth.\u201dSince the end of the Korean War in 1953, the United States has operated upward of 175 military installations in South Korea, a country the size of Kentucky. Today, that number is closer to 90, due to a massive consolidation. Fourteen years ago, the Americans and South Koreans agreed to close and relocate three major bases to the once-sleepy outpost of Camp Humphreys: two near the North Korean border and the third at Yongsan in Seoul, the longtime headquarters of United States Forces Korea and its largest component unit, the Eighth Army. Camp Humphreys has since been modernized and expanded to more than 3,500 acres, at a cost of nearly $11 billion, 90 percent paid for by South Korea. It is now the largest American military base overseas. When it is fully populated, sometime in the next few years (there is no official deadline), it will host more than 18,000 soldiers and an additional 27,000 civilian employees, contractors, retirees and family members.In June, I visited Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek and United States Army Garrison Yongsan in Seoul to document the impact of the evolving military presence on Koreans and Americans. The recent summits between North and South Korea, and between the United States and North Korea, have shifted the conversation from \u201ctotal destruction\u201d to peace. And President Trump\u2019s offhand remarks in Singapore \u2014 not only about withdrawing 32,000 American troops from South Korea but also about canceling a forthcoming joint-military exercise \u2014 serve as a reminder that the American presence is not an immutable fact.Choi Chi-sun was born in August 1953, just after the signing of the armistice. His parents had been refugees from the north of the peninsula and eventually found themselves in Pyeongtaek, then a collection of farming villages populated by fewer than 100,000 residents. With its natural harbor and proximity to China, Pyeongtaek, like Yongsan, had been used by Japan\u2019s imperial army. The Americans, defending the South against Northern and Chinese forces, inherited and expanded K-6, the Japanese airfield that would later be called Camp Humphreys, and added another base, K-55, farther north, forcing dozens of families from their land. Bases and airfields bearing American names became a feature of the postwar landscape.For some residents of western Pyeongtaek, consolidation translated into another enormous disruption. Choi\u2019s neighbors in the rice-farming village of Daechuri, on the border of Camp Humphreys, were marked for eviction. \u201cThere were people in Daechuri who wound up there because they were kicked off their land in 1952,\u201d when K-6 and K-55 were established, Choi said. \u201cThese residents didn\u2019t want to move yet again.\u201d They fought back at public hearings and in court, and with pickets and sit-ins. Ten thousand Koreans marched through Pyeongtaek. When the diggers and bulldozers came at them, in 2005 and 2006, they tied themselves to roofs and fences and took fists and bamboo poles to the metal batons and shields and helmets of the South Korean riot police. It was no match. Hundreds of protesters were arrested, and the land was razed. The police filled irrigation ditches with concrete to prevent further cultivation.The privilege of being allowed to enter Camp Humphreys was not lost on me: As a journalist and the family member of an Army veteran, I had access to thousands of acres that most Koreans will never see. The turnstile of the walk-in gate gave way to Anytown, U.S.A. The streets inside were conspicuously wide; the asphalt was new. A queue of young men waited to use an A.T.M. that dispenses American dollars, and a redheaded girl zoomed by on a scooter. From a base shuttle bus, I looked out at miles of half-built apartment towers and office buildings, colossal equipment hangars, the Pacific Victors chapel, a child-care center and outdoor pavilions with Korean-style roofs. A row of California-style mansions (housing for \u201cthe stars\u201d \u2014 the generals, in Korean parlance) butted up against a golf course and a pond. The capaciousness was jarring; I pictured the claustrophobic alleys of downtown Pyeongtaek just a few miles away.Near the new Humphreys movie theater, which was playing the latest Marvel flick, I met a Korean contractor who had been moved from Yongsan. He was adjusting to life outside Seoul and the loss of longtime colleagues \u2014 he said many civilians had been fired during the consolidation. Pyeongtaek had also paid a price: \u201cThe land we\u2019re standing on used to be grape farms.\u201d In the mess hall of the Second Infantry Division, the unit relocated from the North Korean border, I ate macaroni and cheese and watched the Golden State Warriors celebrate their championship win. A soldier wearing shorts and a T-shirt at a nearby table said he had yet to explore the base, let alone Pyeongtaek city, though he arrived several months earlier. I wondered if he qualified as a \u201cbarracks rat,\u201d the kind who prefers the confines of Anytown. \u201cI came here when the tensions with North Korea were high,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys were excited because we thought it\u2019d be World War III.\u201d It was a crude but understandable comment: How odd to be a restless 20-something, dropped in the middle of Asia, no conflict in sight.On another visit to Pyeongtaek, Maj. Zach Delabastide welcomed me to his off-base apartment. Delabastide is a physician assistant and a Trinidadian immigrant who began his tour last August. He lives in the Brown Stone, a shiny complex that caters to American military personnel; his wife and two children remain back home, near Fort Bragg in North Carolina. After two tours in Iraq and a three-year stint in Germany, Delabastide was surprised by how little he learned about Korea during his in-processing at Yongsan. \u201cIn Germany,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s an entire week on just language, culture and history. I was hoping for that here.\u201d I asked Delabastide what his purpose was on the peninsula and how he felt about the recent spate of bilateral summits. \u201cThe tensions between all the countries involved have been going on for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the talks started, I felt optimistic, but also, why would it be different this time?\u201d He was there, he said, to be in a perpetual state of \u201creadiness,\u201d in South Korea\u2019s defense. As to the specifics, \u201cThere\u2019s so many decisions being made that I never see,\u201d Delabastide said. \u201cPeople a lot smarter than me are thinking it through, seven steps ahead.\u201dWhile the Korean people may not agree on the desirability of the American military presence, \u201ca pro-U.S. security consensus is fairly well embedded in domestic institutions and ideology,\u201d according to Andrew Yeo, a professor at Catholic University. South Korean liberals and conservatives, while at odds in their rhetoric, are equally bound by the \u201cnorms that guide South Korean national-security strategy,\u201d including an enduring alliance with the United States, Yeo writes in his book, \u201cActivists, Alliances and Anti-U.S. Base Protests.\u201d Fear of a rising China is similarly bipartisan: These days, it\u2019s not uncommon to read op-eds by professors and politicians in the Korean press warning that \u201cif the U.S. washes its hands and leaves, all of Northeast Asia will be left to the Chinese.\u201dThough the South Korean military is by no means anemic (618,000 uniformed personnel, universal male conscription, warships, submarines, missile-defense systems and fighter planes bought from American arms manufacturers), the foreign-policy establishment believes that American troops should, and will, remain in place. \u201cI think it\u2019s important, both in the face-off with North Korea and for regional and global stability,\u201d said Jonathan Cristol, a research fellow at Adelphi University. Moon Chung-in, an adviser to President Moon, recently wrote that the suspension of joint-military exercises should not be construed as undermining \u201cthe alliance and combat readiness.\u201dE.

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\u201cWe joke with our American friends that we can tell them the future and what tomorrow\u2019s going to be like,\u201d laughs Robert Wickham, Salesforce\u2019s regional vice president for platform and ecosystem innovation, Asia-Pacific. Jesting aside, Wickham explains why Australia is an ideal gateway to Asia: \u201cYou can run a follow-the-sun model, which means we can service our customers with global operations 24 hours a day.\u201dThe cloud computing giant employs around 300 people in the city. \u201cAccess to talent is important,\u201d Wickham adds. \u201cAnd you have that in Melbourne.\u201d More than 52 percent of residents have a tertiary education, and the city\u2019s world-class institutes boast a competitive edge in software engineering, cybersecurity and data sciences. Melbourne produces 38 percent of the nation\u2019s tech graduates, more than any other Australian state. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a state that supports our knowledge capital,\u201d says Philip Dalidakis, Victoria\u2019s Minister for Innovation and the Digital Economy.\nMelbourne\u2019s skilled work force, coupled with the affordable cost of doing business, also makes it attractive for the regional operations of multinationals to perform more sophisticated functions. In addition to customer service, sales and marketing, Google\u2019s Melbourne outfit is taking on software engineering work in cloud-based solutions and geo-mapping capabilities. \u201cWe have a cross-functional team represented by a dozen different parts of the business,\u201d says Sean McDonell, the company\u2019s site lead here. Meanwhile, the cloud-based customer services company Zendesk and mobile payment provider Square both picked Melbourne to open their first engineering labs outside the Valley.\nEven as Melbourne comes into its own as an international tech hub, it has had to create its own model. \u201cWe can\u2019t replicate the Silicon Valley model, nor should we try,\u201d says Dalidakis. Wickham, who also sits on the Innovation Expert Panel of the Victoria State Government, sees an opportunity for Melbourne to play to its strengths and deepen relationships between the government, universities and the private sector. \u201cWe need to bring in density and be intentional about getting the different parts of the ecosystem to work in unison,\u201d he says, citing the example of the Melbourne Innovation District, a partnership among the city of Melbourne, Melbourne University and RMIT to activate the Carlton Connect precinct.Spun off a decade ago from its parent tech company, SitePoint, 99designs is a global creative platform that makes it easy for designers and clients to work together on projects.As CEO, Llewellyn heads up a 120-strong team spread across Melbourne, Oakland, Calif., and Berlin. After joining the company in 2009, he moved to San Francisco to better service the company\u2019s  customer base in the U.S. and to be closer to the investment community in the Valley. The company received $35 million in financial backing from Accel, the venture capital firm that supported Dropbox, Etsy and Facebook. To date, the company has fulfilled almost one million projects and has 10,000 active designers on its network at any given time.A meeting with Victoria\u2019s Premier, Daniel Andrews, two years ago persuaded Llewellyn to run the global business from his home city. \u201cI could see how much he cared about the sector,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government is very progressive, and the ecosystem has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. An influx of accelerators and incubators and the creation of high-quality local VC funds have transformed Melbourne into a city that can compete internationally. I see crowds building at start-up conferences, and there is a new wave of founders benefiting from this increased investment and supportive infrastructure.\u201d Elzinga says that Melbourne is an excellent place from which to launch a global business. \u201cI wanted to build a business that was global from day one,\u201d he says, adding that he chose Melbourne over Sydney for the former\u2019s superior quality of life. Besides offering excellent coffee, international cuisine and a host of accessible sporting amenities, the government has invested heavily in smart city infrastructure and has dedicated a $60 million fund to the sector.

{"Headline": "Programming New York for Video Game Development", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a steamy night in May, six stories above Times Square, a 12-year-old aimed a blaster into the sky, and fire shot out of his avatar\u2019s boots. His mother attempted to do the same. She was quickly admonished.\u201cNo, Ma, you\u2019re doing it all wrong!\u201d\u201cThere are more disadvantages than advantages to being in New York,\u201d said Kurt Bieg, of Simple Machine, the mobile game company. \u201cBut the advantages are really rare and unique.\u201d Simple Machine\u2019s game Pop the Lock has been downloaded 25 million times and has been turned into an arcade game.A discussion about the challenges of New York game developers often begins with tax credits. More than 20 states give incentives for interactive media companies, according to the Entertainment Software Association. Internationally, London and Montreal created some of the world\u2019s largest game hubs by offering developers between 20 percent and 37 percent in production reimbursement.In 2016, a bill that included a $50 million tax incentive for video games and music production passed the state house and senate, yet was vetoed by the governor. Then Senator Golden said he learned that the governor was more interested in a credit for games than music production.So in 2017 Mr. Golden submitted the Empire State Digital Gaming Media Production credit with a $50 million cap. It passed the State Senate. Later he found out that the governor was more likely to pass a $25 million credit. Mr. Golden resubmitted the bill with that amount in early 2018, which passed the senate in June, but now the State Assembly is expected to be out for the rest of the year.\u201cIf we don\u2019t pass the tax credit we\u2019ll lose these jobs to neighboring states like New Jersey, which just passed a tax credit for video game companies. Once a company has settled somewhere else, it\u2019s very hard to get them back.\u201dNew York\u2019s city and state efforts to support the video games industry are often tucked away in larger programs. The Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment and the New York City Economic Development Corporation are spending $6 million, for example, to open a virtual reality/augmented reality lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the fall. The mayor\u2019s office is also preparing a report on women\u2019s representation in the video game industry.And yet these projects are unlikely to add the thousands of jobs to the economy that large game studios could bring to New York.\u201cIf you go to a game event in Montreal, they roll out the red carpet,\u201d said Prof. Frank Lantz, director of the New York University Game Center. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of wooing developers and investing a lot in trying to build out that industry,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd you just kind of get the opposite effect in New York. The attitude is more \u2018Hey, you\u2019re lucky to be here\u2019 rather than \u2018We want you here and will do everything we can to make it a desirable place to start.\u2019\u201dWhile most people think New York is pricey, the reputation runs deep among game investors. David Grijns oversaw the hiring of a 100-person team in SoHo for the Swedish company Avalanche, which produced the third installment of Just Cause, an adventure game series partly inspired by the United States\u2019 1989 invasion of Panama.Mr. Grijns said that those in the business regularly ask him how he was able to afford starting a studio in New York. He even gets the question from San Francisco-based executives, who are accustomed to paying comparable or higher prices. Programmers have told Mr. Grijns that they would prefer to work in New York, but they stay on the West Coast for job security.Mr. Zemsky has not spoken with Governor Cuomo about the digital gaming credit, he said. \u201dIt\u2019s always more challenging when industries want extra-special tax treatment, you have a lot of hurdles to clear,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen other industries also want special tax treatment.\u201d\u201cI certainly think if you look at the history of the company, in terms of where we have studios and where we have chosen to expand, they have been places where it makes sense for us to expand in terms of preferential treatment for our industry,\u201d said Jennifer Kolbe, the head of publishing for Rockstar Games.New York state has one of the highest concentrations in the country of schools with games-related degrees, according to the Entertainment Software Association. But without many large game studios, graduates often leave the state for steady work, Mr. Lantz said.Guha Bala, of Velan Ventures, a games-focused investment company, said that New York game makers need more than just tax credits to bring them to the city. Mr. Bala founded Vicarious Visions, a development studio in Menands, N.Y., with his brother in the early 1990s, grew it into a 200-person company and sold it to Activision in 2005 for $5.3 million in stock and an undisclosed amount of cash.Mr. Bala supports the idea of a clustered ecosystem of companies, which is happening a bit in upstate New York. Velan Ventures is across the hall from Warner Bros. Games in Troy, N.Y., for example. In such a tight community, ideas and problems can be shared and fixed much more easily. A sector that started as a two-person partnership with Vicarious Visions has grown into a cluster of companies in the Albany Region that employs 450 people, Mr. Bala said.New York City has the potential to provide similar video games clusters across the five boroughs, Mr. Bala said, but a challenge remains. \u201cIt\u2019s so damn expensive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In suburban Pittsburgh the previous year, two men opened fire on a dozen people in a backyard, killing an eight-months-pregnant woman and four others at a family barbecue. On Jan. 7, 2018, Detroit experienced one of its bloodiest Sundays on record: At least 14 people were shot or stabbed in various incidents, and two died, including a woman whose throat was slit. \nViolent crime has plagued the Rust Belt in recent years. Consistently, crime rates have been higher than the national norm in this region \u2014 which spans roughly from western New York to eastern Wisconsin, including Baltimore and sections of West Virginia. Out of the five metropolitan areas with the highest per capita murder rates, according to CBS News, four are deindustrialized cities: St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit and Cleveland. What is it about former manufacturing hubs that lead to homicide and other brutal crimes? Here\u2019s how vanishing jobs, alienated neighbors and shattered hopes swirled together to create a toxic storm that continues to burden the most economically depressed parts of this once thriving region.In the mid-1900s, the area we now associate with rust was prestigious and wealthy. \u201cDuring World War II, Detroit\u2019s manufacturing plants were retooled for the war effort,\u201d says Richey Piiparinen, the director of the Center for Population Dynamics at Cleveland State University. \u201cThe region really saved America.\u201dWith the end of the war came the golden age of capitalism: \u201cIt was a great time in America,\u201d Piiparinen says. \u201cDetroit had the highest per capita income in the nation in 1960.\u201d Before long, however, people started migrating west, dreaming about California, and Silicon Valley burst into existence. Factories began moving south or offshore, and unemployment in former industrial towns started to rise, which had a negative effect on not just wallets but minds. \u201cYou had this death of a region that once flourished,\u201d Piiparinen says. \u201cAnd it provided a psychology of contrast that was hard to deal with \u2014 a very existential contrast.\u201dOn Nov. 1, 2017, in a normally tranquil south Allentown neighborhood, two drivers collided, then stopped their vehicles and shouted at each other. After a few minutes, one man grabbed a shotgun from the back of his pickup truck and killed the other with a single blast.\nCrime declined throughout the United States from the early 1990s to 2013, then spiked in 2014 through 2016 for reasons experts are still trying to determine. But for certain areas of the Rust Belt, the murder rate has long been above average. \u201cIndustrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast, like St. Louis, Cleveland \u2014 and Pittsburgh, to a degree \u2014 have seen relatively high homicide rates over some time,\u201d says Richard Rosenfeld, emeritus professor of criminology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. \u201cAnd that is clearly related to economic decline and the inability of some of those cities to climb back from deindustrialization.\u201dWhat does the economy have to do with violence? \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen poverty, unemployment, segregation and lack of economic opportunities strongly correlate with higher violent crime and murder rates,\u201d says sociologist Emily A. Shrider, a research associate at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cWithout economic options, for some people, desperate times call for desperate measures. You commit an armed robbery and maybe murder someone in the process.\u201d The increased anxiety and financial pressures can exacerbate problems in other areas of someone\u2019s life. \u201cPeople say that being under a lot of economic stress can give you a shorter fuse,\u201d Shrider says. \u201cThen certain situations might escalate, and what could have been just an argument turns into domestic violence or ends in a murder.\u201dIn Detroit, three men and one woman were arrested in August 2017 for running a drug and human trafficking operation. They allegedly preyed on people addicted to opioids and forced them into sexual slavery. In a separate 2017 case, the F.B.I. and a local task force exposed a Detroit-to-West-Virginia \u201cpill pipeline\u201d organized by violent gangs.\nThe opioid crisis has hit the Rust Belt particularly hard. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing very high opioid addiction rates in the counties outside Pittsburgh,\u201d says Piiparinen, \u201cas well as Youngstown, Ohio, and Appalachian coal-mining towns that don\u2019t have anchor institutions \u2014 such as universities and hospitals \u2014 to help transition to a knowledge-based economy. That\u2019s where the severe pain is.\u201dOpioids may be on the rise in former factory towns because people who are out of work are more likely to be financially stressed, suffer from depression and have extra time on their hands, suggests Sean Safford, a professor of economic sociology at Sciences Po, in Paris. \u201cThey may turn to opioids as a way to deal with diminished circumstances.\u201dA potential result? Increased gang activity. \u201cWhen you have high demand for opioids, gang networks fight over who gets the opioid supply and disperses it,\u201d says Piiparinen. \u201cAnd violent crime goes up.\u201dFor some of those addicted, it can be a fatal cycle: Their bodies compel them to buy drugs, then their finances dwindle, which can lead to depression, making them seek more drugs to numb the pain. If they don\u2019t have enough cash, they might steal what they need. Gangs move in. Income and quality of life plummet. Crime rises. Repeat.In 2014, two sisters in Pittsburgh\u2019s gentrifying East Liberty neighborhood were murdered in their apartment, then doused with bleach and detergent. Their next-door neighbor later received double life sentences for the sisters\u2019 homicide, as well as robbery and burglary.\nAnother factor that can lead to increases in crime, at least in the short term, may seem counterintuitive: gentrification. \u201cIn the earlier years of gentrification, the crime rate actually gets worse before it settles down,\u201d Shrider says. \u201cNew neighbors are more likely to call the police, which can cause an uptick in arrest rates. Also better goods are available to steal. And with an influx of newcomers, it\u2019s harder for people to keep tabs on their neighbors.\u201dSociologists debate whether social media has broken real-world connections. But many agree that disconnection among neighbors correlates to higher crime. \u201cSocial ties, the connections we have with those around us, are weaker or less likely to exist when there\u2019s a lot of turnover in a neighborhood,\u201d Shrider says. She believes this may have been the situation with the Cleveland Strangler case, which took place in Ohio\u2019s fractured Mount Pleasant neighborhood. In 2009, Cleveland police officers raided the house of a former factory worker and military man, and discovered 11 bodies, some buried in his yard. \u201cIt makes me wonder,\u201d Shrider says. \u201cDid poor neighborhood health have something to do with why this went on as long as it did?\u201dWhat can be done to help turn around Rust Belt cities and neighborhoods experiencing increases in violent crime? One solution might be to attract businesses that will hire locals and pay good living wages. \u201cWe need more jobs \u2014 and to raise the minimum wage to $15,\u201d says Anne Trubek, editor of the book \u201cVoices From the Rust Belt.\u201d Trubek, who was raised in Wisconsin, moved to Cleveland in 2006 and started her own company, Belt Publishing. \u201cIn Cleveland there are a lot of possibilities for launching your own business,\" she says. \u201cIt is a fascinating, complex place to live.\u201dPiiparinen says that to bring jobs to the Rust Belt, \u201canchor organizations need to lead the way.\u201d One example he says inspires hope is the Cleveland Clinic, which is working with the local community and looking into how artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies might be used to help correct the disparity in health outcomes in different neighborhoods. \u201cWe just need to get our A.I. chops up to figure out the local problem and grow our regional economy,\u201d Piiparinen says. \u201cThen we can decrease crime and become a global hub again in the next wave.\u201d\nIllustration by Simon PradesThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Can Vietnam Avoid Getting Hurt in the Crossfire When the Tariffs Are Flying?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyConsider the predicament of Vietnam. China and the United States, which each have their own violent histories in Vietnam, are now that country\u2019s most important trading partners. Together, the giants gobbled up roughly 35 percent of Vietnam\u2019s exports last year, furthering its transformation from sleepy purveyor of rice and coffee to manufacturing hub. When the trade war broke out, so did the ominous headlines in Hanoi. A rapid devaluation of the Chinese yuan sparked a brief run on Vietnam\u2019s currency and a drop in its stock market. Rumors spread about an influx of cheap Chinese consumer goods and the threat of American protectionism spreading in ways that would affect Vietnam\u2019s vital exports. And there was a tangible concern: Nearly $5 billion of Vietnamese exports are part of China\u2019s value-added supply chain, meaning they may feel the impact of being exposed to punitive American tariffs.Soon another sort of reaction began taking place. Driven by the dangers of the trade war, many foreign companies with stakes in China \u2014 those ants underfoot \u2014 have started shifting production away from China to Southeast Asia. One sign of this development was on display in mid-July, when a group of visitors showed up on Vietnam\u2019s northern coast near Ha Long Bay. The men in white shirts and dark ties were not tourists. They represented 72 Japanese businesses, in industries ranging from textiles to electronics, and they were looking for economic refuge. \u201cMany of these Japanese firms have been operating in China,\u201d Nguyen Duc Tiep, an official from the local-investment promotion center, told a Vietnamese magazine. \u201cThey want to expand their investment markets out of China to shun risks caused by the nation\u2019s rising production costs and by the U.S.-China trade war, which is making it hard for Japanese firms to export their products to the U.S. from China.\u201dThe Japanese businessmen may be among the trade war\u2019s first economic victims. But the shift of manufacturing away from China is not a new phenomenon. Over the past few years, as wages in Chinese factories have risen sharply, many companies, foreign and Chinese alike, have begun moving at least some of their operations to Southeast Asia to take advantage of lower production costs. In Vietnam, where wages are barely a third of those in China, Adidas now makes twice as many shoes as it does in China, and Intel and Samsung Electronics have made billion-dollar investments there. The country\u2019s export-led growth depends on attracting foreign investment, and now American and Chinese policies may be hastening its arrival. \u201cFor many companies, the trade conflict is a catalyst to explore changes they hadn\u2019t contemplated before,\u201d says Jon Cowley, a tax-and-trade partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong. \u201cFor others, it\u2019s an accelerant to a process they\u2019d already started. The trade conflict is just pushing them over the finish line.\u201dSupply chains, innocuous as they sound, are a locus of collateral pain in this trade war. The American exports that China is hitting with retaliatory tariffs are mostly simple goods sourced close to home: pork, soybeans, whiskey. But China\u2019s exports to the United States, especially in high-tech, are complex products assembled in China from a staggering array of foreign components and raw materials. A \u201cMade in China\u201d laptop shipped to America, for example, may have a South Korean screen, a Japanese hard drive and a memory chip from Taiwan. A tariff hurts every part of this international supply chain. Asia\u2019s most advanced economies, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, are so globalized that they can easily get caught in this protectionist crossfire.Taiwan may stand to lose the most. It supplies 18 percent of China\u2019s total imports of intermediate goods, or nearly 14 percent of Taiwan\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the Stimson Center in Washington. As Tsai Ming-fang, an economist at Taipei\u2019s Tamkang University, told Bloomberg: \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs are giving Taiwanese companies further incentives to move to Southeast Asia.\u201dThe dust kicked up by the trade war obscures the fact that Asia is the world\u2019s most dynamic trading region. According to the World Trade Organization, Asia in 2017 had the world\u2019s fastest growth in trade volume for both imports and exports, 9.6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. Eighteen months ago, the leaders of Vietnam and 10 other Pacific Rim nations believed the economic outlook would be enhanced even further by the creation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The agreement, which included the United States and Japan but not China, also offered the chance to push back, as a group, against Beijing\u2019s unfair trade practices like intellectual-property theft and forcing companies that do business in China to share their technology.President Trump rejected T.P.P. out of hand. Now, with diminished influence in the region, the United States wages its trade war alone, leaving many of its erstwhile Asian partners, and many American companies, too, stuck in the middle, seeking the safest way out.To offset the conflict\u2019s negative impact, Beijing has slashed tariffs to Asian countries, a reminder, it seems, that China will remain the lone superpower in Asia long after the trade war is over. This appeal, however, may not stop the flow of manufacturers out of China to Southeast Asia. The American shoe-and-accessory maker Steve Madden, for example, is shifting its handbag production from China to Cambodia \u2014 15 percent this year, 30 percent in 2019. (A U.S. Fashion Industry Association study released in July showed that two-thirds of all textile companies are expected to lower production in China over the next two years, citing United States trade protectionism as the top challenge.) Moving production to a new location is expensive and complicated. Given the mercurial man behind the trade war, and the chaotic churn of American politics, some executives are holding fast in hopes that it will all go away. But as new tariffs loom for another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, with 6,031 products on its target list, the trade war no longer looks like a short-term crisis.As the battle escalates, there\u2019s a worry that Chinese companies may shift more operations southward, too, using \u2018\u2019tariff-jumping\u201d tactics to get their goods to the United States. The Vietnamese, at least, are vigilant against Chinese intrusions. Their antagonistic history with their northern neighbor \u2014 the millennium under Chinese imperialism, the bloody 1979 border war, the ongoing disputes over the South China Sea \u2014 has colored recent protests against Chinese businesses. It almost seems like karmic payback that Vietnam might benefit from China\u2019s conflict with the United States, a country that, despite its own protracted war here, has become one of Vietnam\u2019s strongest allies.Nobody can predict all of the pain and permutations of the trade war. The Vietnamese government is cautious, even projecting negligible declines in growth over the next five years. Others are far more sanguine. In July, Standard Chartered raised its growth forecasts for Vietnam to 7 percent this year, based on the influx of foreign direct investment. In addition to attracting companies hedging their Chinese bets, Vietnam may also pull in American buyers eager to diversify their imports from outside China. \u201cThe consensus before was that T.P.P. would be the catalyst,\u201d says Michael Kokalari, chief economist at the Vietnam-focused asset-management firm VinaCapital. \u201cBut the trade war could be the thing that really opens the floodgates.\u201d In Vietnam, fighting elephants just might give the nimblest (or luckiest) ants a chance to thrive.Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "California Strikes Back Against the Trump Administration\u2019s Auto Pollution Rollback", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration\u2019s proposal \u201cis contrary to the facts and the law,\u201d the California document says, before refuting point by point the Trump administration\u2019s arguments for weakening the nation\u2019s long-term goals for making vehicles more fuel efficient and less polluting.The clash between California and Washington threatens to throw the United States auto market into disarray. Because California has the authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own air pollution rules, and because a dozen other states follow its lead, the dispute could effectively split the nation\u2019s market into two, one side adhering to stringent emissions rules set in Sacramento and the other to weaker federal standards.As a first step, California plans to change its rules to declare that the federal government\u2019s current, stricter auto-emission targets are the only ones that comply with state law \u2014 and not any future targets that are less strict.That move collides with the administration\u2019s plan to freeze Obama-era rules, which would have required automakers by 2025 to roughly double the fuel economy of their new cars, pickup trucks and S.U.V.s to about 36 miles per gallon. Those rules, which are aimed at cutting tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming, represented one of President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant efforts to fight climate change.The Trump proposal would instead freeze the standards after 2021, when new cars must average around 30 miles per gallon.Weakening the national standard \u201ccould substantially slow progress toward the emission reductions needed to address the serious threat climate change poses to California, the country, and the world, waste billions of gallons of gasoline, and cost consumer money on fuel,\u201d the state\u2019s report said.\u201cThey\u2019ll just say anything to justify a weaker standard,\u201d Mary Nichols, the state\u2019s clean air regulator, said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cWe want our response to be as strong and cogent as possible.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s move would also unequivocally establish a separate emissions regime for the state and the 12 others that follow its standards, a coalition that covers more than 130 million residents and more than a third of the domestic auto market. Heavily Democratic California has emerged as a bulwark against the Trump administration\u2019s policies.Carmakers have balked at the prospect, calling for the Trump administration and California to come to terms to avoid a messy legal battle.That looks unlikely.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we must do to continue to move forward rather than backslide,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general.By Tuesday, the post had been erased. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance, said the tweet had been a \u201cmistake\u201d though there were parts of the opinion piece, published by the Brookings Institution, that the group agreed with.She added that automaker executives had urged President Trump to come to an agreement with California, and that the alliance had \u201craised the possible elements of a deal with both sides.\u201dCalifornia also said that it \u201chas been, and remains, willing to consider well-founded and necessary changes to the program,\u201d including allowing automakers to exploit more generous loopholes to meet the standards. But the state has maintained that the headline fuel-economy targets, and their associated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, are not negotiable.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.The Trump administration has made government deregulation a centerpiece of its policy agenda, and the auto-emissions proposal has won kudos from some staunch supporters.\u201cFor decades, multiple administrations in Washington, D.C., allowed liberal California to dictate environmental mandates to the rest of us,\u201d said Tim Huelskamp, president of the Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank, in a statement last week. \u201cRevoking Obama\u2019s draconian fuel mileage restrictions, and California\u2019s dubious exemption to federal standards, would make cars safer and more affordable. If adopted, this regulation would be another promise kept by President Donald Trump.\u201dIn justifying its freeze, the Trump administration, led by officials at the Department of Transportation, put forward several arguments that contradict previous findings by its own researchers. On Tuesday, California pushed back against those arguments.Administration officials argue, for example, that fuel-saving technologies are expensive and will make cars costlier, making it tougher for people to afford them. In its rebuttal, California cited a 2016 technical review published by Department of Transportation researchers to say that current standards \u201ccan be readily met at the same or lower cost than originally projected\u201d with advanced gasoline engines and transmissions.The Trump administration also says that scrapping the Obama-era standards after 2021 would prevent road-accident fatalities (more than 12,700 deaths over the following decade) compared with keeping the standards in place. Among the reasons put forward: People who buy fuel-efficient cars will drive more, increasing the odds that they will get caught in an accident.California disputed that, saying that any negative effects would be \u201coutweighed by the reduced impacts to health and mortality\u201d from tailpipe pollutants if stricter standards were upheld.The state is \u201crefuting the counterintuitive and counterfactual arguments from the Trump administration that weaker emissions standards are good for public health and safety,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, an expert in environmental law at Columbia Law School.California has long set its own air quality regulations, so when the federal Clean Air Act was passed decades ago, it enshrined the state\u2019s right to continue making its own rules. In 2009 President Obama began an effort to revise the federal standards in order to harmonize a mishmash of greenhouse-gas and fuel-economy standards set by federal agencies and California. For the first time, California allowed cars that complied with federal emissions rules to also be deemed as meeting California standards.The state has threatened to sue to protect its authority to write its own air quality rules. And California is readying a separate set of official comments on the Trump administration\u2019s proposed rollback, which it will submit as part of a 60-day public comment process on those rules.California is preparing for the worst, experts say, namely the Trump administration\u2019s freeze of federal rules, along with its plan to eliminate California\u2019s right to set its own pollution rules, said Ann Carlson, professor of environmental law at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. The state would then likely go to court to defend that waiver.With Tuesday\u2019s statement, California is \u201cmaking sure its i\u2019s are dotted and its t\u2019s are crossed,\u201d Ms. Carlson said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any confusion on this question.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a professor at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. She is Ann Carlson, not Carson.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting from Detroit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Issues Crackdown on State and Local Tax Workarounds", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department moved on Thursday to block states from circumventing new federal limits on state and local tax deductions.The regulation would affect only taxpayers who currently deduct more than $10,000 in state and local taxes. And its effect would most likely be concentrated among high earners in high-tax states, some of which created credits to help residents reduce the federal take.But it could also adversely affect taxpayers in other states, where such credits were already being given for contributions made to certain private or charter schools and universities, land donated for conservation purposes and donations to housing assistance programs.The proposed rule involves a provision of the new Republican tax law that set a $10,000-a-year cap on deductions for state and local taxes. The cap helped Republicans keep the estimated cost of the tax law, which centers on a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate, under $1.5 trillion, to comply with a budget procedure that allowed the bill to pass without the support of any Democrats.The Treasury rule would render those credits effectively useless for taxpayers. They would still be paying the same amount to the state, but receive no additional tax deduction from the federal government for their trouble.Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, who has denounced the Republican tax law as \u201can economic missile\u201d aimed at his state, threatened Thursday to take legal action against the proposed rule, calling it \u201can abuse of government power.\u201dMore than 90 percent of households earning at least $200,000 in 2015 took the state and local deduction, writing off $269 billion in taxes, according to Internal Revenue Service data. Those households accounted for less than 5 percent of all filers in 2015, but took nearly 50 percent of the total deduction that year.In New York, more than a third of taxpayers took the state and local tax break in 2015, deducting more than $20,000 on average from their federal taxes. In Alabama, just over a quarter of taxpayers took the deduction, and claimed less than $6,000 on average.Capping the deduction effectively increases the advantage that low-tax states have over high-tax states, which could make it harder for states to attract and retain high earning residents and businesses.The rule does not apply to state tax deductions, only to credits, and it does not affect taxpayers who receive a credit worth 15 percent or less of the amount they donate \u2014 a loophole that could exempt landowners who donate large tracts for conservation purposes.\u201cWe appreciate the value of state tax credit programs, particularly school choice initiatives,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, \u201cand we believe the proposed rule will have no impact on federal tax benefits for donations to school choice programs for about 99 percent of taxpayers compared to prior law.\u201dSome analysts had expected the Trump administration to try to carve out an exemption for pre-existing programs like Alabama\u2019s, which are more common in Republican-leaning states. But by choosing not to do so, the administration may have made the new policy easier to defend.Darien Shanske, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, said the government had \u201ctaken the more principled approach\u201d by going after all the programs, not just newly adopted ones like New York\u2019s. Still, Mr. Shanske said the government would need to explain why it was moving to block state efforts now when it hadn\u2019t acted earlier.\u201cI think states will have the grounds to challenge it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to explain why you\u2019re turning practice on its head.\u201dBut Jared Walczak, a policy analyst for the Tax Foundation, said the new tax law changed the stakes for the I.R.S. For one thing, the previously unlimited deduction for state and local taxes meant that for most taxpayers, the state-level charitable credits had no effect on taxpayers\u2019 federal tax liability. With the deduction capped, that will no longer be true.A wealthy taxpayer who contributes $10,000 to a private school scholarship fund in Iowa, for example, receives a $6,500 tax credit from the state, under Iowa law. Previously, the taxpayer could deduct that entire $10,000 contribution from her federal taxes. Under the new regulation, she would only be allowed to deduct $3,500.And the newly adopted programs are on a much larger scale.\u201cThe simple answer is it just never rose to the level of importance where the I.R.S. chose to weigh in,\u201d Mr. Walczak said.Even if the regulation is upheld, most New York residents will receive a tax cut under the new law, albeit a smaller one than they would have gotten if the state and local deduction had survived unscathed.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.Advertisement"}

Visitors enter through two tall wood doors leading to a 2,583-square-foot space that originally served as a ballroom. The arched-wood beams, wooden trim carved with German phrases and stained-glass windows are all original to the house. With its 23-foot ceilings and tall windows, the wide-open main room includes the living area, dining area and kitchen.At one end of the space is a large, modern fireplace with a mantel made of colored concrete. The floors are epoxy resin, and there is under-floor heating throughout the house. An ornate iron chandelier, salvaged from the old house and restored, hangs in the dining area. The kitchen has lacquered wood cabinets, an island with a counter seating area and Gaggenau appliances. Behind it is a lounge area that serves as a media room, with a large U-shaped sofa. (The furniture is not included in the asking price, but is available to buy; several pieces were custom-made for the home.) As part of the restoration of the ground-floor main hall, a loft was added above the kitchen area to serve as the master bedroom. It has an en suite bathroom and a round tub built into the floor. Two more bedrooms are on the ground floor, set off from the main room, and there is an additional space currently used as an office. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors in the rear open to a private 2,422-square-foot backyard, with a large ground-level deck, several large trees, sculptures and a manicured lawn. A small building in the garden houses a sauna, whirlpool and shower. The attic and basement offer additional storage space, and there is also a garage, which is shared with the other units on the property.The neighborhood of Dornbach is home to many 19th-century villas in the distinctive Gr\u00fcnderzeit style, with spires and ornate facades. This house is on a commercial stretch of Dornbacher Street, with shopping, restaurants and schools nearby. It is a short walk to a tram stop, with connections to downtown Vienna that take about 30 minutes. Vienna International Airport is a 30-minute drive.Demand for housing in Vienna is strong, with low unemployment, a growing population and a stable economy driving the market, agents said. \u201cSince the economic crisis in 2008, investors are looking for a safe investment, and interest rates are very low,\u201d said Peter Marschall, chief executive of Marschall Real Estate, in Vienna.More buyers are looking beyond traditional neighborhoods, with affordability and proximity to public transportation increasingly important. \u201cThere are many new developments in locations where people did not want to live several years ago,\u201d Mr. Marschall said.The most popular areas for high-end buyers are in the western part of the city, including the neighborhoods of W\u00e4hring (the 18th district) and D\u00f6bling (the 19th district), as well as the 17th district, where this home is, said Susanne Thomanek, a Vienna-based agent with Austria Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cThe beautiful, classical prewar architecture is known worldwide and fascinates buyers,\u201d Ms. Thomanek said.In the 18th and 19th districts, the best-known areas for buying older estates, \u201c2017 was an absolute record year on the villa market,\u201d according to a report by Otto Immobilien Gruppe, a real estate agency in Vienna.

{"Headline": "Can Imran Khan Save Pakistan?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the incoming prime minister can persuade the military to enable him to improve relations with the United States, Afghanistan and India, he will pull off a feat none of his predecessors has managed. Mr. Zaidi is a political analyst based in Islamabad, Pakistan.ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 When Imran Khan is sworn in as the prime minister of Pakistan on Saturday, he will be confronted by daunting challenges.Many Pakistanis, including senior military officials, blame an incompetent and venal political class for Pakistan\u2019s chronic problems, from economic vulnerabilities to anxieties about security. They have been yearning for a messiah-like figure who can turn Pakistan into a financially autonomous and militarily robust nation that is respected globally. They see Mr. Khan as that man of destiny. In his victory speech, Mr. Khan offered a glimpse of how he will rule. Having built his politics on an anti-corruption platform, he expressed hope that a transparent and accountable leader will increase global confidence in Pakistan. He intends to bank heavily on the Pakistani diaspora, which is already a major source of remittances. Mr. Khan takes great pride in his Pashtun ethnic identity. His family traces its roots to Waziristan, on the troubled border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. His view of the conflict in Afghanistan has been colored by a sense that the mostly Pashtun Taliban have waged a war of resistance against outsider rulers. It informed perceptions among liberals in Pakistan and the West, and some critics unfairly took to calling him \u201cTaliban Khan.\u201d The challenge for Pakistan\u2019s new prime minister will be to manage expectations in the three countries. Pakistan may not have the clout to get the Taliban to the negotiating table, despite the United States seeing them as Pakistani proxies.Mr. Khan has said that a peaceful Pakistan needs a peaceful Afghanistan. Unlike previous Pakistani leaders, he is personally invested in better relations with Afghanistan \u2014 something that may have spurred Mr. Ghani\u2019s quick congratulatory phone call. Mr. Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or Movement for Justice, came to power nationally off the back of its success in the frontier province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bordering Afghanistan. It is the province that suffered the most in the insurgency and counterinsurgency in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and the United States invasion of Afghanistan. Mr. Khan\u2019s rivals in the province \u2014 the religious right and the secular nationalist Pashtuns \u2014 will tear into him for failure in Afghanistan.Mr. Khan also wants to improve Pakistan\u2019s relationship with the United States. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have been frustrated by Pakistan\u2019s refusal to bow to American demands on Afghanistan and alter Islamabad\u2019s strategic calculus to Washington\u2019s satisfaction. Resentful of this pressure, the military now sees itself as a bulwark against attempts to reduce Pakistan to an American colony. Mr. Khan\u2019s nationalistic broadsides against American policies and what he describes as a humiliatingly uneven relationship chime with the military\u2019s position. And this would be Mr. Khan\u2019s most difficult test.But the Pakistan military suffers no such constraints. If Mr. Khan can make the military a partner and enabler of his foreign policy ambitions \u2014 including a \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d relationship with the United States, \u201copen borders\u201d with Afghanistan and peaceful trade with India \u2014 he will pull off a feat no Pakistani leader, civilian or military, has ever managed. If he does, it will help establish an unprecedented regional peace and stability. That would be an outcome that Americans, Afghans and Pakistanis can all root for together.

{"Headline": "Imran Khan Takes Oath in Pakistan, a Nation Divided and in Debt", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImran Khan, the former cricket star turned firebrand politician, was sworn in as Pakistan\u2019s prime minister on Saturday, taking control of a country facing a looming economic crisis as observers questioned whether he had the political acumen to govern a deeply divided nation.Mr. Khan\u2019s first decision was to scrub the nine-course meal traditionally served after the oath-taking ceremony, held at the president\u2019s house. It was a sign of the \u201causterity drive\u201d he had promised while on the campaign trail, his party said. Instead, refreshments were served in the grand hall of the residence.Since winning the July 25 election, Mr. Khan has stressed that he would lead a lean life, shunning the ostentatious displays of power and wealth of his predecessors. He has said that he will not live in the prime minister\u2019s house, a lavish, white marble building on a hilltop overlooking Islamabad.Instead, he vowed to take a smaller house belonging to the military secretary. Mr. Khan, however, maintains a sprawling, private Mediterranean-style villa nearby.\u201cThe main challenge is economic,\u201d said Ayaz Amir, a former lawmaker and noted Pakistani columnist. \u201cThere\u2019s not much money in the kitty, and there are a lot of debts coming due both in the immediate and long term.\u201dMr. Amir added: \u201cHe will be judged by what kind of people he appoints to key ministries \u2014 this will be crucial. And he has many other advantages: People look upon him as a clean leader with no legacy of corruption attached to his name, and he\u2019s popular enough to withstand populist demands.\u201dIf Mr. Khan completes his five-year term, he would be the first prime minister in Pakistan\u2019s history to do so.The new prime minister has said he would break the dynastic nature of Pakistani politics and promised to bring young, dynamic leadership to his government. Instead, he has so far elevated into key roles some of the same politicians he had denounced in the past over their political opportunism and checkered records on corruption.Asad Umar, a private-sector businessman whom economists view as a populist with a thin grasp of the challenges ahead, was named as finance minister.One of the first tests facing Mr. Khan is whether to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout or to extend another open palm to China, deepening Pakistan\u2019s economic reliance on its larger neighbor. Pakistan already relies on China to develop critical infrastructure projects worth some $62 billion, with onerous loan terms and profit-sharing agreements benefiting Beijing.Pakistan will start negotiations with the I.M.F. in the coming weeks and will ask for loans worth up to $12 billion, officials say, part of a four-year program that will require the country to undertake privatization measures and tighten its fiscal policy. Pakistan has taken 14 bailouts from the fund since the 1980s.If Mr. Khan\u2019s government pursues an I.M.F. bailout, he will have to explain to voters why the populist measures he promised will no longer be possible under the fund\u2019s lending terms.Saturday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony was the second democratic transfer of power in Pakistan since it was founded in 1947. The military has ruled for about half the country\u2019s history through a series of coups.Whether Mr. Khan can assert control over Pakistan\u2019s foreign and defense policies will be another crucial test of how successful his government will be. The military has typically controlled those domains, and Mr. Khan\u2019s objectives \u2014 such as brokering peace in Afghanistan and pursuing talks with India, a longtime rival, will need the military\u2019s approval.Mr. Khan \u201cneeds to sit down with the military and figure out what are the national security objectives,\u201d said Ikram Sehgal, an independent analyst and retired Pakistani military officer. \u201cEveryone should be on the same page.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe need to fix the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. We cannot afford to be in either the U.S. or the China camp. We need to be neutral and friendly with everyone.\u201dAlthough Pakistan\u2019s main political parties all agree that the economy is the top priority, whether Mr. Khan can cobble together the needed support will be a challenge. He was voted in as prime minister by Parliament on Friday, with 51 percent of the vote. As he took the floor to make his acceptance speech, opposition lawmakers began chanting slogans against him.It was not the image that many had expected Mr. Khan to project: a new, composed prime minister. The tirade was a break from the conciliatory note he had taken in a national address just after his party won the elections.\u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t have it; he doesn\u2019t have the temperament to deal with dissent,\u201d said Khurram Dastgir-Khan, a sitting opposition parliamentarian who served as the defense minister in the previous government.\u201cThat is why he abandoned whatever high-minded speech he planned and went back to his fiery accusations. He was elected with a razor-thin majority. This is our new leader, a man who will struggle to negotiate with parliament to get support for his policies,\u201d he added.During Saturday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, Mr. Khan stumbled as he repeated the oath, and was immediately denounced by opponents for not being prepared. But his followers praised his humility.There were other stumbles. When Parliament was inaugurated on Monday, Mr. Khan forgot the national identification needed to enter the session. The speaker of the House had to grant him special permission to enter and to take his oath alongside fellow parliamentarians.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the most auspicious of beginning for this Parliament,\u201d said Mr. Amir, the analyst, adding, \u201cHe has to make the transition from opposition leader to the leader of Pakistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stock market wealth is heavily concentrated among the richest families.As the stock market surged, prices for homes \u2014 the most important source and store of wealth for the American middle class \u2014 recovered much more slowly from the Great Recession and housing bust. Incomes, too, have only recently surpassed pre-crisis levels, despite steady economic growth in recent years.\u201cThis is the decade in which wealth inequality has increased the most in U.S. history,\u201d said Moritz Schularick, a professor of economics at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics in Germany who has written about the distribution of wealth in the United States. \u201cThe driver has been the very unequal gains in the very sharp performance of the stock market relative to the sharp drop of the housing market.\u201dThere is some debate over whether this bull market technically deserves the award for the longest on record. Bull markets are defined as a stretch when the stock market rises without suffering a 20 percent drop.At issue is a market run from October 1990 to March 2000, a 3,452-day period that was preceded by a slump of 19.92 percent. Wednesday, despite the S. & P. 500\u2019s ticking down 0.04 percent, was the current upswing\u2019s 3,453rd day.Statistical sticklers, though, don\u2019t round up, in which case that earlier boom started in December 1987 \u2014 a 4,494-day stretch that would retain the crown.In terms of staying power, the current bull market has some advantages over past sprees, when a surging stock market fused financial speculation into the fabric of American life.In the 1920s, Americans dived into the market to snap up shares of a range of companies churning out the technological marvels of the day, like automobiles and radios. In the 1980s, as the country recovered from a deep recession, Wall Street enjoyed a broad boom grounded in Reagan-era deregulation and economic growth.In the 1990s, retail investors poured their money into high-flying, and in many cases profit-free, companies developing around the emerging technology known as the internet. And in the years before the financial crisis of 2008, the stock boom was coupled with the excesses of the housing market and Wall Street.\u201cYou were in some sort of a dreamy state, and it couldn\u2019t last,\u201d Allen Sinai, chief economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics and a former chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said of the dot-com era. \u201cThe taxi drivers, the elevator operators, everybody was into the stock market and buying. It was euphoria.\u201d\u201cToday the sentiment that\u2019s out there is actually more to the opposite,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s cautious. It\u2019s careful. \u2018Recession is coming tomorrow. How long can this go on?\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s a natural question to ask. Those euphoric periods ended in spectacular stock market crashes, in 1929, 1987 and the early 2000s and during the financial crisis.But the same frothiness doesn\u2019t exist now, suggesting there is little immediate risk that the market will do a 180.Price-to-earnings ratios, a proxy of investor enthusiasm, are nowhere near the peaks seen during the dot-com boom.The share of the American public that has any money in the stock market remains mired well below the level that prevailed before the financial crisis. It\u2019s concentrated among the wealthy, with the top 10 percent owning roughly 84 percent of the value of all shares owned by households, according to research by Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the wealth structure of the American population. It was 81 percent in 2007.Even as the S. & P. 500 charges higher, retail investors continue to exit the equity markets. Between mid-March and late July, investors pulled some $40 billion out of American mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, while pumping some $80 billion into the safety of bond funds, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm.\u201cFor most of this bull market, the individual investor has largely sat out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a co-founder of Bespoke. \u201cCompared to the 1990s, when individual investors were actively looking for stock ideas, today there\u2019s a lot less of that.\u201dAs many people sit on the sidelines, the divergence between the wealthy and the rest of the country has widened. In 2016, the last year with solid data, the wealth of the median American household \u2014 which is heavily concentrated in the home itself \u2014 was 34 percent below where it was just before the Great Recession, according to research from Mr. Wolff.That\u2019s not to say the average American is in an especially sour mood. Consumers in the United States are feeling good at the moment \u2014 and for good reason. At 3.9 percent, unemployment is near an 18-year low. The economy grew at an annual pace of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest clip since 2014.And that economic strength \u2014 along with the deep cuts in corporate tax rates that President Trump signed into law in late 2017 \u2014 has translated into gushers of profits for large American companies. Second-quarter profits for companies in the S. & P. 500 are up roughly 25 percent compared with a year earlier, after a similar rise in the first quarter.The boom in earnings has helped the markets fend off various economic and geopolitical concerns.After peaking in late January, stocks plummeted by more than 10 percent in the following weeks on worries that the Federal Reserve would begin to raise interest rates at a faster cadence than previously expected, choking off growth. Then in March, the eruption of the trade war sent shares sharply lower again.More recently, the nose-dive of the Turkish lira and signs of weakness in the Chinese economy raised the prospect that problems in emerging markets could hamper global growth.But for many seasoned stock market observers, the existence of continuing worries about whether the bull market can last is a strong piece of evidence that it can.According to this line of thinking, the moment to worry is when there is broad agreement that the market can only go higher. That would suggest there is little fresh money available to drive stocks to new heights.\u201cWhen the bears give up, that\u2019s when I would start to worry,\u201d said Laszlo Birinyi, who started analyzing the stock market for the storied New York investment firm Salomon Brothers in 1976, before founding his own stock market research firm, Birinyi Associates. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the length the current bull market. It is nearly 10 years, not 10 years. The article also referred imprecisely to the share of stocks owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of households in the United States. It is 84 percent of the value of shares owned by households, not 84 percent of all outstanding shares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Biggest Climate Move Yet Is Bad for Everyone", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Freeman was President Obama\u2019s counselor for energy and climate change in 2009-10.Los Angeles \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation moved Thursday to fulfill President Trump\u2019s promise to undo landmark Obama-era rules requiring automakers to steadily reduce greenhouse gas pollution from cars and trucks and improve fuel efficiency through 2025.To make sure it accomplishes that goal, the Trump administration also wants to strip California of its authority to set stricter greenhouse gas standards for vehicles sold within its borders, which the state is authorized to do under a longstanding provision of the Clean Air Act.Though the E.P.A. approved California\u2019s greenhouse gas standards in 2013, the agency now argues that they impermissibly conflict with another federal law, the Energy Policy Conservation Act. That law, passed in 1975 in response to the energy crisis, gives the Transportation Department the sole power to set standards \u201crelating to fuel economy.\u201d Because auto companies comply with California\u2019s greenhouse gas standards primarily by improving fuel efficiency, the E.P.A. now says in an about-face that the standards are pre-empted by those Transportation Department regulations. On the same theory, California\u2019s program to promote electric and hybrid vehicles would also be eliminated.If the Trump administration succeeds in scuttling the federal standards and neutralizing California, it could be the most significant setback for American progress on climate change so far under President Trump. Worse, this disastrous policy could continue well beyond his tenure. Future presidents could not simply undo the decision, if courts rule that the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation of the law is categorically correct. In that case only Congress could restore California\u2019s authority.Congress recognized California\u2019s leadership when it passed the Air Quality Act of 1967, allowing the state to set its own stricter-than federal standards for vehicles. Congress cemented this approach in the 1970 Clean Air Act, and reinforced it again in 1977, letting other states adopt California\u2019s standards.Under this longstanding authority, California has received dozens of waivers from the E.P.A. in both Republican and Democratic administrations to pursue pioneering policies that have spurred technological innovation to make cars and trucks cleaner. The benefits have been enormous.California\u2019s early standards helped to propel widespread adoption of the catalytic converter, which transforms harmful tailpipe pollutants into harmless gases. The modern vehicle engine, which is more efficient, more powerful and more durable, is a direct result of innovations driven by California\u2019s emission standards. Keeping pace with California also helps the auto industry to stay globally competitive.California does not dictate national standards, since auto companies are free to make higher-polluting vehicles for the rest of the country. But automakers prefer to avoid the manufacturing complications of meeting more than one standard, which gives California leverage.That is why, in the deal brokered by the Obama administration to harmonize greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards into a single national program, California agreed not to implement its own tougher rules in exchange for steadily increasing federal targets. Now that the Trump administration plans to unravel that deal, California says it will move ahead with its own greenhouse gas standards, with those dozen-plus other states poised to follow.The most unstable scenario of all would be a ruling letting the Trump administration pre-empt California for now, but leaving future administrations free to reverse course. In that case, auto companies would sometimes have to meet California\u2019s standards and sometimes not.The auto industry should convince the Trump administration to reach a deal, or make one on its own. A workable solution would leave the current federal standards in place while making it easier for industry to meet them, by rewarding companies for investing in advanced technologies like electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles, tinted windows, efficient lighting and the like.These and other pragmatic fixes would respond to the auto companies\u2019 core complaints about needing flexibility, continue the long-term trajectory toward cleaner cars, and preserve the national program, all without sacrificing California\u2019s traditional role.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Crashed\u2019 Connects the Dots From 2008 Crisis to Trump, Brexit and More", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesThe Columbia professor Adam Tooze might be expected to have precious little in common with Stephen K. Bannon, the shambolic former chief strategist to President Donald J. Trump. Tooze is a self-described \u201cleft\u2011liberal historian whose personal loyalties are divided among England, Germany, the \u2018Island of Manhattan\u2019 and the E.U.\u201d; Bannon is a brawling, right-wing connoisseur of nationalist resentment. In \u201cCrashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World,\u201d Tooze, with his Oxbridge-trained ear for a withering epithet, calls Bannon \u201cthe sulfurous impresario of Breitbart.\u201dThere is, however, a significant point on which they both agree: The financial crisis of 2008, along with the bailouts that followed, exposed the seamy underbelly of a global economic system that was supposed to be so finely calibrated that political wrangling (unseemly, inefficient) was beside the point. As Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Swiss newspaper just a year before the crisis, the world of 2007 was a central bankers\u2019 paradise: \u201cWe are fortunate that, thanks to globalization, policy decisions in the U.S. have been largely replaced by global market forces.\u201dIn \u201cCrashed,\u201d Tooze shows how the upheaval of 2008 radiated outward, shaping not only the new economic order but the political free-for-all that stumped conventional pundits and scrambled traditional allegiances. He connects the mortgage crisis to the American banking crisis to the European debt crisis to the crisis of liberalism. Brexit, Trump, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and China\u2019s ever-escalating role in the financial system: Tooze covers them all and much more, in a volume that\u2019s as lively as it is long \u2014 which is to say very, on both counts.Having published previous books on the turbulent post-World War I era and the economic policies of Nazi Germany, Tooze has made a specialty of financial collapse and historical disaster. He also understands the language of corporate balance sheets and sovereign debt deeply enough to know that he ought to use it sparingly, translating some of the most byzantine gibberish into elegant English.\u201cThe sort of thing that you could do in London but not in New York is exemplified by \u2018collateral rehypothecation,\u2019\u201d he writes, rather menacingly, before nimbly breaking down what that means and why it matters. Several lucid sentences later, you\u2019ll have learned, perhaps despite yourself, how the financial wizards of New York competed with the financial wizards of London, and how a worldwide daisy chain of banks turned into a ticking bomb.Of course, the story of \u201cCrashed\u201d isn\u2019t just a panoply of transactions and statistics. Tooze regales us with character sketches while recounting the \u201cfreak show of outsize personalities\u201d at the G-20 summit in London in 2009 \u2014 a pageant of the world\u2019s leaders pledging to boost cratering trade and quell panicking markets.There\u2019s Angela Merkel of Germany, a moralizing pillar of unyielding rectitude, and a jittery, grandstanding Nicolas Sarkozy of France. A restless Silvio Berlusconi of Italy was \u201cnoisily desperate\u201d for attention, while England\u2019s Gordon Brown glowered over the proceedings.Brown, a Labour Party leader who was doing his delicate best not to antagonize the trillion-dollar interests of the City of London, might have lost touch with the \u201chumdrum reality\u201d of a Britain gripped by recession, but as Tooze wryly puts it, the prime minister \u201cproved that he was perfectly suited to the role of Treasury secretary to the world.\u201dYes, the compliment is as backhanded as it sounds, but it\u2019s a measure of Tooze\u2019s nuanced and often counterintuitive narrative that the line retains a measure of praise, however faint. Part of Tooze\u2019s argument in \u201cCrashed\u201d is that the technical know-how of an able treasury secretary can be useful in a crisis. He depicts Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary during President Barack Obama\u2019s first, hairy term in office, as a technocrat ne plus ultra, a public servant committed to upholding the financial system, which he ultimately did do.This approach apparently satisfied Obama, whose administration is described as an embodiment of \u201cAmerican corporate liberalism.\u201d Again, the characterization is doubled-edged. Obama was \u201cby inclination a bipartisan centrist\u201d forced to fend off \u201cthe sheer violence of the conservative hostility toward him.\u201d He shepherded the banks through calamity with a firm but gentle hand. They got their bailout, so that even the gargantuan Citigroup, whose sheer survival was entirely dependent on government action, was able to splurge for $5 billion in bonuses a year later.Any non-bankers who lost their jobs or homes weren\u2019t so lucky. On the apparent Democratic distaste for conflict, Tooze is quietly scathing. \u201cRather than seeking to mobilize the indignation simmering in American society,\u201d the Obama administration sought to tamp it down, offering \u201cone technocratic fix after another.\u201d Putting it another way, Democratic centrism won the (financial) war but lost the (political) peace. To judge from Trump\u2019s ascendancy, along with the historical evidence so scrupulously marshaled in \u201cCrash,\u201d Tooze is right.But at least Obama took seriously his responsibility to govern, whereas the same can\u2019t be said for Republicans, portrayed here as gifted obstructionists \u201cincapable of legislating or cooperating effectively.\u201d \u201cCrashed\u201d details how Republican administrations had abandoned fiscal responsibility long ago, bloating the deficit with pumped-up military spending and protracted, expensive wars, while leaving it to their Democratic successors to clean up the mess.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Paul Pogba and the Power of Perception", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did not have to wait long to be proved right.In the middle of Paul Pogba\u2019s first season back at Manchester United, as questions lingered and doubts swirled about whether his performances warranted his $114 million, world-record price, his manager turned soothsayer. Soon, he believed, Pogba would look \u201ccheap\u201d by comparison.\u201cNext summer will bring a few surprises at this level,\u201d Mourinho said at the time. Pogba would, he believed, lose his status as the world\u2019s most expensive player by the end of the summer transfer window. In a few months, Mourinho said, \u201cplayers with only half his quality will cost the same price.\u201dThat was February 2017. By August, Paris St.-Germain had agreed to pay the $222 million buyout clause in Neymar\u2019s contract at Barcelona, and Mourinho\u2019s prophecy started to come to pass. P.S.G. soon agreed to pay $205 million more for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and Barcelona, flush with the Neymar funds, subsequently gave Borussia Dortmund $105 million for Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and, six months later, offered $182 million to Liverpool for Philippe Coutinho. While few would argue that Pogba is twice the player of any of them, in that context, United\u2019s fee for him seems much less outlandish.More important still is the knock-on effect elsewhere. Since Neymar fundamentally altered the idea of what represents value in the transfer market, Liverpool has paid $96 million for a center back and $84 million on Alisson, the most expensive goalkeeper in history \u2014 at least, he was for a week or so, until Chelsea spent $92 million on Kepa Arrizabalaga. Manchester City made just one signing this summer, Riyad Mahrez. He is far from a guaranteed starter for Pep Guardiola\u2019s team. He cost $77 million, and is the seventh-most expensive player in British history.Just as Mourinho predicted, Pogba had been less an outlier, and more a portent of the coming distortion of the market.While Mourinho was right, however, it was perhaps not for the reasons he had envisaged. Cost is not the same as value. Pogba\u2019s cost, the amount of money United gave to Juventus to sign him, no longer seems quite so eye-watering. His value, though, is a different matter.What has happened in the transfer market has normalized his fee, but that is not the same as Pogba justifying it. Even now, two years on, $114 million does not seem, to borrow Mourinho\u2019s word, \u201ccheap.\u201dThis was a transformational summer for Pogba. He left Manchester at the end of last season as a midfielder of lavish talent but mercurial effect. For both club and country, there were those who wondered if he was sufficiently disciplined to quell his instincts in the service of the team, people who fretted over his hairstyle and his social media presence and his attitude.He returned as a World Cup winner.A few days after the final, a video emerged of Pogba gathering his teammates around a table in France\u2019s dressing room in Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki Stadium, a few minutes before the final. As they stood in silence, Pogba told them they were \u201c90 minutes from history, one match.\u201d He encouraged them to draw on the pain of defeat in the Euro 2016 final \u2014 which France lost to Portugal on home turf \u2014 and warned them that Croatia would punish any absence of heart, or desire.He had done much the same before previous victories against Argentina and Uruguay. As Adil Rami, his France teammate, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how, and I don\u2019t know where from, but Paul Pogba has become a leader.\u201d Blaise Matuidi, the Juventus and France midfielder, described him as \u201ca real boss.\u201dThis was Pogba\u2019s chrysalis moment: a triumph he had not just been part of but central to, the summer in which all of his simmering potential finally came to the boil and all of the doubts were laid to rest. It had long been said Pogba lacked the maturity to lead, the humility to put the collective first, the appetite for work. Russia proved it all wrong.If it was intended to capture the mood on the outside \u2014 of returning to the everyday after the escapism of the World Cup \u2014 it encapsulated Pogba\u2019s situation perfectly. The summer has not been as transformational as he might have hoped. He has only been back in Manchester for a few weeks, after a long vacation in California and the Pacific, and already it must feel as if Russia never happened.Pogba still finds himself locked in a relationship with his manager, Mourinho, that might best be described as uneasy, for all the public protestations of both to the contrary, and a humbling 3-0 home defeat to Tottenham on Monday will not help matters. He is still singled out, consistently, for criticism whenever United fails to live up to expectations, a lightning rod for the many and varied complaints of many and varied former players. He is still troubled, by his own admission, by an occasional lack of \u201chunger\u201d \u2014 the word he chose after United\u2019s defeat at Brighton last week.Why that might be is a matter of theory rather than fact. Manchester United fans might suggest that, as far as the news media is concerned, bad news for their team is good news: strife sells. The slightest misstep by Pogba \u2014 or his teammates \u2014 tends to trigger an inquest that can last for days.A rather more dispassionate analysis might suggest that United, the biggest club in the world\u2019s biggest league, can hardly avoid scrutiny when it stutters. That it seems to attract much more now than, say, a decade ago is because it has stuttered rather more in the absence of Alex Ferguson. Pogba is often at the center of it is because he is the club\u2019s outstanding player.Both assessments, though, contain one crucial flaw. United\u2019s comparative travails over the last two years, and the contrast between Pogba\u2019s performances for France and for Mourinho, are not an invention of the news media. How the problem is reflected does not explain why the problem exists.Mourinho would suggest that the explanation is simple: He made it perfectly clear this summer in continued barbs at his board that he needs more money to play with in the post-Neymar transfer market to acquire better teammates for Pogba.Others might suggest that United\u2019s squad \u2014 though not quite as packed with quality as France\u2019s \u2014 is hardly filled with amateurs. Mourinho has a raft of internationals at his disposal, a decent proportion of whom he has signed, and at no little expense. Perhaps, then, the key issue is that Mourinho is failing to inspire Pogba in the way that France\u2019s manager, Didier Deschamps, did.Again, though, that does not stand up to scrutiny. Pogba and Deschamps have not always been especially close, and even in the days before the World Cup there was talk of a rift, with Pogba using an interview with France Football to suggest his coach change his system, and Deschamps responding by criticizing his performances. Pogba is clearly capable of shining even for a coach he does not particularly love.There is one other possibility: that the contrast between the Pogba who materialized in Russia and the Pogba that exists in Manchester is down not to some innate difference in him, but in a difference in the context in which he finds himself.Pogba has always glided through games. He moves languidly, effortlessly, covering vast tracts of ground without ever really appearing to sprint. He does not bustle around the field, harrying and harassing opponents. He does not wear his work-rate, his physicality, on his sleeve. He is, instead, elegant and graceful; he is a player of great moments, who sparks into life, not one who constantly burns.That is, he said in the interview with France Football, how he has \u201calways been.\u201d\u201cWhat I won, I won by being like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my style of play.\u201dThe problem is that, in certain lights, economy of movement looks like idleness; effortlessness can seem like a lack of effort. For France, at a World Cup, it was enough to play in moments: international soccer is much more disjointed than the club game, and Pogba\u2019s elegance, in games that lacked rhythm and poise, was a strength, not a weakness. So, too, was what Deschamps called his ability to \u201cdo everything\u201d \u2014 to be whatever sort of midfielder was required. As France breezed through the tournament, winning relentlessly, there was no reason to shine a harsh light on Pogba.For United, in the Premier League \u2014 where brawn has always been prized more than brain \u2014 it is different. England has always had a predilection for hard-running midfielders; anything else seems like an indulgence.When United does not click, when United does not win, Pogba\u2019s failure to match that stereotype is seized upon. Here, too, his flexibility is a flaw: Whatever type of midfielder he has been, it is always possible to wonder if he might have been better choosing a different path.It is, in other words, not that Pogba changes. He is not diminished in Manchester, or improved by France. He is always Pogba. It is just that how much he is valued changes by what is around him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tensions Between Turkey and U.S. Soar as Trump Orders New Sanctions", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 A worsening dispute between the United States and Turkey reverberated through the global economy on Friday, hastening a broad flight of money from emerging markets and sowing instability throughout the Middle East as relations between the NATO allies neared a breaking point.Turkey\u2019s economy is only the 17th largest in the world, but its problems are worsening as Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war is rattling global commerce, damaging longtime alliances and threatening economic growth worldwide.The move effectively priced Turkish steel out of the American market, which accounts for 13 percent of Turkey\u2019s steel exports.\u201cOur relations with Turkey are not good at this time!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.The deepening standoff raised questions of whether the two strong-willed leaders were risking even broader chaos as they vied for the upper hand in a widening diplomatic dispute largely focused on individual personalities.Mr. Erdogan has shown no sign of backing down. He sounded defiant in two speeches to supporters on Friday, railing against foreign powers that he accused of orchestrating Turkey\u2019s economic crisis, and vowing not to bow to Western pressure.\u201cThose who believe they can make us kneel by economic manipulation, have never understood this nation at all,\u201d he told a crowd in Gumushane, a province on Turkey\u2019s northern Black Sea coast. \u201cThey can\u2019t use threatening language, blackmailing language against this nation. Especially bullying will not cut it with our nation.\u201dAfter watching Mr. Erdogan on live television, Asli Aydintasbas, senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said, \u201cThey have no deal, their positions have hardened.\u201dThe breakdown was surprising, she said, because Mr. Trump had appeared to reach the outlines of an agreement for the pastor\u2019s release with Mr. Erdogan on the sidelines of the NATO summit last month.In exchange, the United States agreed to arrange for the Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is serving a 32-month prison term in the United States, to be returned to serve the remainder of his sentence in Turkey.After his meeting with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Trump even threw in an extra favor, asking Israel to release a Turkish detainee, Ebru Ozkan, who was quickly freed.Washington wanted Mr. Brunson released immediately, but the formalities of the Turkish banker\u2019s transfer were expected to take two or three weeks, according to Ms. Aydintasbas.The deal has not happened, she said, as Turkey has held out for further guarantees, including the lowering of a fine by the United States Treasury against the state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank for conspiring to violate United States sanctions against Iran, and a promise to cease any further prosecutions.According to one American official, Turkey had been given a deadline to release Mr. Brunson, who is now under house arrest at his home in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, by 6 p.m. Wednesday.Turkey had seemed to be trying to stave off the crisis by scrambling a delegation to travel to Washington for more talks that day.The talks did not go well, said a second American official.\u201cThe conversations continue,\u201d said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, after the discussions.By Friday Mr. Erdogan seemed determined to tough it out. He called on Turks to sell their gold and dollars and buy lira to bolster the Turkish currency.\u201cThose who have dollars, euros, gold under their pillows, should go and change them in our banks for the Turkish Lira,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national struggle.\u201d\u201cErdogan has made a decision,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said. \u201cHis speech was clearly very defiant.\u201dYet Turkey\u2019s economic situation looked increasingly fragile.The lira\u2019s plunge has sent shudders through financial markets because it has raised doubts about investing in Turkish securities. The yield on Turkish 10-year bonds has risen sharply, to more than 20 percent, which means traders are demanding much higher returns for what they see as an increasingly risky investment.The anxiety extended to doubts about Asian and European banks that have heavily invested in Turkey, and it contributed to declines in stock markets around the world. As with the financial crisis set off by Greece in 2010, Friday\u2019s events were the latest example of how troubles in a nation with a midsize economy but world-class problems could threaten financial stability further afield.\u201cIn financial markets everything is interlinked,\u201d said Bart Hordijk, a market analyst in Amsterdam at Monex Europe, a foreign exchange firm. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if one bank has huge exposure to the Turkish lira.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Hordijk said, \u201cPeople scramble to safer assets.\u201dIn power for 15 years already, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has depended greatly on his ability to bring Turks continued economic growth. It has created a middle class beholden to him, even as he has trimmed civil liberties, jailed opponents, and constrained traditional and social media alike.The economic trouble has only worsened in the weeks since Mr. Erdogan acquired sweeping executive powers after his re-election to a newly enhanced presidential system in June.The currency\u2019s sharp decline has reflected concerns about the fundamentals of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s economic model, which has depended on a voracious construction industry that his opponents say has enriched his inner circle while heaping debt on the country.The even steeper fall in the lira since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election is now fueled by worries that he is ever more insulated and is taking no one\u2019s economic advice but his own.In an example of his increased role, he has resisted calls for a rise in interest rates to curb inflation and to ease pressure on the lira.Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, who has been appointed to the combined post of Treasury and Finance Minister, attempted to calm markets with a briefing to the news media.He insisted that Turkey would respect the independence of the Central Bank even as Mr. Erdogan\u2019s interference in monetary policy has been one of the causes of the fall of the lira, and that its economy would even show positive growth this year.\u201cTurkey will go further with its friends and with those who say \u2018We are for winning with Turkey,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTurkey has a very strong banking sector, it is well prepared to these kind of scenarios with its capital structure.\u201dTurkey also announced that Mr. Erdogan had held a telephone call with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Friday to discuss economic ties amid the market turmoil, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Erdogan, who has often touted his relationship with Russia as a signal that he has an alternative to relations with the West, said they discussed Russian tourism to Turkey.The minister of trade, Ruhsar Pekcan, reacted the news of the new sanctions in measures tones, pleading for a return to negotiations.\u201cTurkey is deeply disappointed by the U.S. Administration\u2019s decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now.\u201d\u201cThe effects of this ill-advised action by the U.S. Administration will not only impact Turkey, but will prove detrimental to American companies and workers as well.\u201d\u201cWe implore President Trump to return to the negotiating table \u2014 this can and should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.\u201dCarlotta Gall reported from Istanbul, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Germany.

And it has done just fine.But is Denmark socialist?It\u2019s true that Denmark doesn\u2019t at all fit the classic definition of socialism, which involves government ownership of the means of production. It is, instead, social-democratic: a market economy where the downsides of capitalism are mitigated by government action, including a very strong social safety net.In other words, in American political discourse, anyone who wants to make life in a market economy less nasty, brutish and short gets denounced as a socialist.And this smear campaign has had a predictable effect: Sooner or later, if you call any attempt to improve American lives \u201csocialism,\u201d a lot of people will conclude that socialism is O.K.And that puts her in line with the rest of her party.

{"Headline": "The Chefs Redefining Polynesian Cuisine", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFood MattersCenturies of colonization nearly erased the taste of the Pacific. Now, a new generation is reimagining the regional food for a new era.In Aotearoa \u2014 what the Maori, indigenous to New Zealand, call their home \u2014 the leaves were traditionally chewed or brewed for tea to ease toothaches and abdominal pain, wilted over flames to make a poultice for cuts and stings and burned to banish mosquitoes. The kawakawa tree\u2019s branches cast blessings on the launch of canoes, the birth of children and the dawn of battle.But Scandinavia was never colonized. For Fiso, 30, and her peers, the challenge is defining a cuisine that was never considered a cuisine at all by Western conquerors; their diets were deemed of limited interest beyond anthropology and what could be fobbed off on tourists as exotic remnants of some imagined paradise. So these chefs must speak not only for ingredients but for cultures that, in two and a half centuries of domination by the West, have been undermined, exploited, misrepresented and threatened with erasure. To do so, they are reaching back to a pre-contact past \u2014 before the advent of meat pies and Marmite, spaghetti and Spam \u2014 in search of both origins and identity. The history of their ancestors\u2019 food is also the story of fishing, hunting and gathering; of their management of natural resources; and of the social mores that enabled them to survive as a people. What their elders ate is inextricable from who they were, and who these chefs are today.MOANA IS THE word for ocean in Maori, Hawaiian and Samoan, but on maps, the waters in this part of the world bear a name from another tongue, bestowed by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan in 1520: Mar Pac\u00edfico, or peaceful sea. Three centuries later, French explorers coined the term Oceania as a catchall for a heterogeneous area that, in its broadest definition, stretches from Asia to the Americas and encompasses more than 10,000 islands, some former colonies turned sovereign nations (New Zealand, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea) and others far-flung dependencies of Western empires (Bora Bora, American Samoa, the Marianas). The islands were eventually subdivided into Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia, which were seen as culturally and racially distinct, although the lines of delineation have never been entirely clear: Anthropologists disagree on boundaries, and Fiji is often considered uncategorizable, a nexus where Melanesia and Polynesia meet. Of these, Polynesia \u2014 a triangle drawn from New Zealand to Hawaii to the remote Chilean territory of Rapa Nui \u2014 has most compelled the world\u2019s attention, typically as a projection of repressed Western desire: an ahistorical haven peopled by flower-bedecked voluptuaries from a Paul Gauguin canvas. That fantasy turned to kitsch with the rise of tiki culture, beginning in Depression-era California at restaurants such as Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic\u2019s, where diners were distracted from their troubles by gardenias afloat in giant bowls of rum and the then-novel Mai Tai, which was Polynesian only in name, an appropriation of maita\u2018i, Tahitian for good.But the menu at Trader Vic\u2019s, now a global chain, never had any kinship to what Pacific Islanders actually ate. Instead, it skewed vaguely Chinese (cream-cheese-stuffed crab Rangoon, sweet-and-sour pork) with interpolations of tropical fruit \u2014 what the food critic Craig Claiborne of The New York Times dismissed, in 1958, as \u201cpineapple and coconut fare.\u201d For much of the 20th century, not even travelers to the Pacific could easily find local cooking beyond their resort\u2019s carefully choreographed luau.But how do you keep this cuisine alive when its inheritors no longer live in the old ways \u2014 when no one has time to dig a pit or to search for the leaves with the most holes? When Fiso started her dinner series two years ago, she struggled: \u201cHow are you supposed to open a Maori restaurant when you can\u2019t even get the ingredients?\u201d Foods that were once part of daily life are now greatly diminished, from more than 150 varieties of taro in Hawaii a century ago to less than half that today. In parts of the Pacific, fish stocks are in serious decline: Off Fiji, the average catch rate for albacore tuna fell from 200 a day in 2009 to 20 in 2014.Culinary knowledge, passed down for generations as oral history, is likewise at risk. Hawaiian pa\u2018i\u2018ai almost vanished after 1911, when the territorial government passed a law requiring regulation of poi shops, ostensibly to prevent the spread of cholera, but effectively eliminating small family businesses that made the staple by hand. In 2011, grass-roots lobbying by native Hawaiians finally helped persuade the state legislature to give pa\u2018i\u2018ai makers an exemption from the century-old law.So much else has been lost in the Pacific since the first encounter with explorers from the outside world. Populations were decimated by Western-borne diseases, to which they had no resistance; entire bloodlines and genealogies were destroyed. Languages were silenced: Only in 1978 was Hawaiian recognized \u2014 alongside English \u2014 as an official language in its place of origin, followed by Maori in 1987 and Fijian in 1997. Land was taken away, and with it the traditions of sustenance that defined a people.In the U.S.In FijiIn New ZealandAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Fueled Anti-Refugee Attacks in Germany, New Research Suggests", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterALTENA, Germany \u2014 When you ask locals why Dirk Denkhaus, a young firefighter trainee who had been considered neither dangerous nor political, broke into the attic of a refugee group house and tried to set it on fire, they will list the familiar issues.This small riverside town is shrinking and its economy declining, they say, leaving young people bored and disillusioned. Though most here supported the mayor\u2019s decision to accept an extra allotment of refugees, some found the influx disorienting. Fringe politics are on the rise.But they\u2019ll often mention another factor not typically associated with Germany\u2019s spate of anti-refugee violence: Facebook.Everyone here has seen Facebook rumors portraying refugees as a threat. They\u2019ve encountered racist vitriol on local pages, a jarring contrast with Altena\u2019s public spaces, where people wave warmly to refugee families.Many here suspected \u2014 and prosecutors would later argue, based on data seized from his phone \u2014 that Mr. Denkhaus had isolated himself in an online world of fear and anger that helped lead him to violence.Karsten M\u00fcller and Carlo Schwarz, researchers at the University of Warwick, scrutinized every anti-refugee attack in Germany, 3,335 in all, over a two-year span. In each, they analyzed the local community by any variable that seemed relevant. Wealth. Demographics. Support for far-right politics. Newspaper sales. Number of refugees. History of hate crime. Number of protests.One thing stuck out. Towns where Facebook use was higher than average, like Altena, reliably experienced more attacks on refugees. That held true in virtually any sort of community \u2014 big city or small town; affluent or struggling; liberal haven or far-right stronghold \u2014 suggesting that the link applies universally.Their reams of data converged on a breathtaking statistic: Wherever per-person Facebook use rose to one standard deviation above the national average, attacks on refugees increased by about 50 percent.Nationwide, the researchers estimated in an interview, this effect drove one-tenth of all anti-refugee violence.The uptick in violence did not correlate with general web use or other related factors; this was not about the internet as an open platform for mobilization or communication. It was particular to Facebook.Other experts, asked to review the findings, called them credible, rigorous \u2014 and disturbing. The study bolstered a growing body of research, they said, finding that social media scrambles users\u2019 perceptions of outsiders, of reality, even of right and wrong.Facebook declined to comment on the study, but a spokeswoman said in an email, \u201cOur approach on what is allowed on Facebook has evolved over time and continues to change as we learn from experts in the field.\u201dThe company toughened a number of restrictions on hate speech, including against refugees, during and after the study\u2019s sample period. Still, experts believe that much of the link to violence doesn\u2019t come through overt hate speech, but rather through subtler and more pervasive ways that the platform distorts users\u2019 picture of reality and social norms.We visited Altena and other German towns to retrace each step from the site\u2019s algorithm-driven newsfeed to real-world attacks that its users might not otherwise commit \u2014 and that hint at subtle but profound ways that the social network reshapes societies.When refugees first arrived, so many locals volunteered to help that Anette Wesemann, who runs Altena\u2019s refugee integration center, couldn\u2019t keep up. She\u2019d find Syrian or Afghan families attended by entourages of self-appointed life coaches and German tutors.\u201cIt was really moving,\u201d she said.But when Ms. Wesemann set up a Facebook page to organize food drives and volunteer events, it filled with anti-refugee vitriol of a sort she hadn\u2019t encountered offline.Some posts appeared to come from outsiders, joined by a handful of locals. Over time, their anger proved infectious, dominating the page.Told about research linking Facebook to anti-refugee violence, Ms. Wesemann responded, \u201cI would believe it immediately.\u201dSuch links would be indirect, researchers say, but begin with the algorithm that determines each user\u2019s newsfeed.That is how anti-refugee sentiment \u2014 which combines fear of social change with us-versus-them rallying cries, two powerful forces on the algorithm \u2014 can seem unusually common on Facebook, even in a pro-refugee town like Altena.But even if only a minority of users express vehement anti-refugee views, once they dominate the newsfeed, this can have consequences for everyone else.People instinctively conform to their community\u2019s social norms, which are normally a brake on bad behavior. This requires intuiting what the people around us believe, something we do through subconscious social cues, according to research by Betsy Paluck, a Princeton University social psychologist.Facebook scrambles that process. It isolates us from moderating voices or authority figures, siphons us into like-minded groups and, through its algorithm, promotes content that engages our base emotions.A Facebook user in Altena, for instance, might reasonably, but wrongly, conclude that their neighbors were broadly hostile to refugees.\u201cYou can get this impression that there is widespread community support for violence,\u201d said Dr. Paluck. \u201cAnd that changes your idea of whether, if you acted, you wouldn\u2019t be acting alone.\u201dIn his office, Gerhard Pauli, a grandfatherly local prosecutor, flipped through printouts of social media posts that the police had pulled from Mr. Denkhaus\u2019s cellphone.\u201cHe was very interested in Facebook,\u201d Mr. Pauli said. He paused over an image of wide-eyed, dark-skinned men, superimposed with the text, \u201cThe welfare ministry is out of money. It\u2019s back to work.\u201dMr. Denkhaus messaged near constantly with friends to share articles and memes disparaging foreigners. At first they trafficked in provocations, ironically addressing one another as \u201cmein F\u00fchrer.\u201dOver time, they appeared to lose sight of the line separating trolling from sincere hate. Heavy social media users refer to this effect as \u201cirony poisoning.\u201d\u201cHe said to his partner one day, \u2018And now we have to do something,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pauli recalled. Mr. Denkhaus and a friend doused the attic of a refugee group house with gasoline and set it on fire. No one was hurt.In court, his lawyer would argue that Mr. Denkhaus had shown no outward animus toward refugees before that night. It was only online that he\u2019d dabbled in hate.Intended as exonerating \u2014 wasn\u2019t the real world what mattered? \u2014 this defense underscored how Facebook can provide a closed environment with its own moral rules.Mr. Denkhaus had little opportunity to encounter anti-refugee hatred in the real Altena, where overwhelmingly tolerant social norms prevailed. But within his Facebook echo chamber, he could drift unchecked toward extremism.And these attacks may represent only the tip of a much larger iceberg, the University of Warwick researchers said.Each person nudged into violence, they believe, hints at a community that has become broadly more hostile to refugees. For most users, the effect will be subtler, but, by playing out more widely, perhaps more consequential.But, as in Altena, Facebook use and anti-refugee violence rates are both unusually high. Could that hint at more than a few isolated vigilantes?We sought out a particular kind of user, known to researchers as a superposter, who is thought to embody the ways that Facebook can make a community incrementally more hostile to outsiders.Rolf Wasserman, an artist whose studio overlooks Traunstein\u2019s quaint central square, is not politically influential in any traditional sense. Though conservative, he is hardly extremist. But he is furiously active on Facebook.He posts a steady stream of rumors, strident opinion columns and news reports on crimes committed by refugees. Though none crosses into hate speech or fake news, in the aggregate, they portray Germany as beset by dangerous foreigners.\u201cOn Facebook, it\u2019s possible to reach people who are not highly political, to bring information to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can build peoples\u2019 political views on Facebook.\u201dSuperposters tend to be \u201cmore opinionated, more extreme, more engaged, more everything,\u201d said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University social scientist.When more casual users open Facebook, often what they see is a world shaped by superposters like Mr. Wasserman. Their exaggerated worldviews play well on the algorithm, allowing them to collectively \u2014 and often unknowingly \u2014 dominate newsfeeds.\u201cThat\u2019s something special about Facebook,\u201d Dr. Paluck said. \u201cIf you end up getting a lot of time on the feed, you are influential. It\u2019s a difference with real life.\u201dIn the offline world, people decide collectively whom to listen to and whom to ignore. Professional gatekeepers such as editors or party leaders decide which voices to elevate. Facebook overrides those practices.Dr. Paluck, by persuading the influential students to oppose bullying, could shift social norms in an entire school, reducing bullying by about a third. Isolating students who favor bullying and elevating those who oppose it can also reduce violence. By shuffling around the students just so, a few moderating voices could be made to set norms for the whole community.Facebook\u2019s algorithm, engineered to maximize the amount of time spent on the site, does the opposite of this. It elevates a class of superposters like Mr. Wasserman who, in the aggregate, give readers an impression that social norms are more hostile to refugees and more distrustful of authority than they really are. Even if no one endorses violence, it can come to feel more justifiable.Natascha Wolff has seen this firsthand, she said at a Traunstein church lunch for local Nigerian families.Ms. Wolff, who teaches at a vocational school, has found that young people like her students often express the most anti-refugee views. They seem to draw, she said, on things they saw on Facebook \u2014 and a mistaken belief that everyone agrees.Any rumor or tidbit about foreigners, she said, \u201csure gets around fast. People feel confirmed in their viewpoint.\u201dThe ideological bubbles can be radicalizing, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018like, like, like.\u2019\u201dHer refugee students, she said, have had coffee or other objects thrown at them from windows \u2014 casual, light-of-day violence one only braves with the assumption that it will be tolerated.But police here aggressively pursue crimes against refugees, highlighting that some locals have a skewed perspective of their own community\u2019s social norms.A young woman who attends Ms. Wolff\u2019s vocational school, but asked to not be named so she could speak more freely, described lurid stories of refugee wrongdoing she\u2019d read on Facebook. Everyone her age uses the site to discuss refugees, she said, and everyone agrees that they are a threat.She may have been misled by Facebook\u2019s tendency to sort people into like-minded groups. Our interviews in Traunstein, along with voter records, suggest that the town is split but leans liberal.Like most Germans, she is at little risk of committing violence. But her Facebook-tinged social norms show in other ways. She supported hardline anti-immigration policies, she said. When an African classmate was deported over an error in his paperwork, she\u2019d hoped more would face similar fates.Could Facebook really distort social relations to the point of violence? The University of Warwick researchers tested their findings by examining every sustained internet outage in their study window.German internet infrastructure tends to be localized, making outages isolated but common. Sure enough, whenever internet access went down in an area with high Facebook use, attacks on refugees dropped significantly.And they dropped by the same rate at which heavy Facebook use is thought to boost violence. The drop did not occur in areas with high internet usage but average Facebook usage, suggesting it is specific to social media.This spring, internet services went down for several days or weeks, depending on the block, in the middle-class Berlin suburb of Schmargendorf.Asked how life changed, Stefania Simonutti went bug-eyed and waved her arms as if screaming.\u201cThe world got smaller, a lot changed,\u201d said Ms. Simonutti, who runs a local ice cream shop with her husband and older son. She lost touch with family in Italy, she said, but was most distressed by losing access to news, for which she trusts only social media, chiefly Facebook.\u201cMany people lie and fake things in the newspapers,\u201d she said, referring darkly to matters of war and disease. \u201cBut with the internet, I can decide for myself what to believe and what not.\u201dEsperanza Mu\u00f1oz, a cheery, freckled woman who moved here from Colombia in the 1980s, found the outage relaxing. She socialized more with neighbors and followed the news less.\u201cSocial media, it\u2019s an illusion,\u201d she said.Her daughter, a medical student named Laura Selke, said global events seemed less stressful during the outage.\u201cWhen news spreads on Facebook, it\u2019s made more provocative,\u201d she said.She hadn\u2019t realized how much anxiety social media caused her until she went for a few days without it.\u201cYou really do notice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really was very comfortable, very nice.\u201dMs. Mu\u00f1oz added that Facebook communities in her native Colombia seemed even more prone to outrage and filter bubbles.\u201cIt really was as if there was only one opinion,\u201d she said, describing her Facebook feed during recent Colombian elections. \u201cWe\u2019re only informed in one direction, and that\u2019s really not good.\u201dThis hints at what experts consider one of the most important lessons of the University of Warwick study. If Facebook can be linked to hundreds of attacks even in Germany, its effect could be far more severe in countries like Colombia with weaker institutions, weaker social media regulations and more immediate histories of political violence.\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t say these things with their own mouths,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1oz said, referring to the rancor she saw from Colombian Facebook users. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy for them to share it online.\u201dShane Thomas McMillan contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.&P. Closes at a Record, as Profits Defy Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the year, the stock market has been on the ropes. Trade wars have erupted, the Federal Reserve raised rates, emerging market currencies collapsed, and major technology firms faced regulatory scrutiny \u2014 and, in the case of Amazon, presidential broadsides via messages on Twitter. Investors quailed at times, sending stocks down by as much as 10 percent.But the nine-year-old bull market never completely crumbled. By April, stocks had started a fresh climb. And after a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at a record high of 2,874.69 points, reflecting investor faith in a single fundamental fact: Big American companies are making lots of money.\u201cWe\u2019ve had record earnings growth, we\u2019ve had record numbers of earnings and sales beats,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBasically the fundamentals couldn\u2019t look better.\u201dBecause owners of stock are entitled to a share of the money a company makes, corporate profits are a key ingredient of stock market rallies. And profits for companies in the S. &P. 500 were up roughly 25 percent in the second quarter, after a surge of 27 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.About 80 percent of companies reported results that were better than Wall Street analysts expected. (In a typical quarter, some 64 percent of companies outperform the analysts\u2019 predictions.) This year\u2019s crop of quarterly earnings has been the best since 2010, when the American economy was just emerging from the recession that ended the previous year, making big leaps in annual profit growth much easier.The current rosy profit picture shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The Trump administration\u2019s deep tax cuts that went into effect in January reduced corporate tax expenses sharply and raised profitability almost automatically. But other metrics \u2014 such as sales growing at an annual rate of more than 9 percent in the second quarter \u2014 suggest that corporate America is riding a robust American economy. The unemployment rate is near 18-year lows. Gross domestic product expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent-plus growth world, and that\u2019s because the fundamentals underlying consumer spending, underlying business spending, underlying our manufacturing sector are in superb shape,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm.Since the bulk of companies began reporting their quarterly results in July, that upward economic pressure has erupted in gushers of profits, especially at some of the giant technology-centered firms that have been hugely influential in determining how the stock markets move.Amazon reported a $2.53 billion quarterly profit, its largest ever. Microsoft notched $8.87 billion in earnings, beating estimates. Apple\u2019s quarterly profit jumped 32 percent to $11.52 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and pushing the company\u2019s market value above $1 trillion, a milestone that no American company had ever reached before.The earnings boom has also reached far beyond tech. Earnings at financial firms jumped more than 27 percent. Quarterly profits at industrial companies rose 20 percent.Even the retail sector, which has been squeezed by online competition and soft prices in recent years, is enjoying a respite. Home Depot raised earnings and sales targets for the year. Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, including a 40 percent rise in online sales in the United States. And Target said quarterly sales at stores it had previously opened rose at the fastest pace in 13 years, sending its stock to a record high.There could be more market gains to come. From the bargain hunter\u2019s perspective, the combination of blockbuster profits and a prolonged stock market soft patch for much of the year, means that stocks \u2014 compared to their earnings \u2014 are significantly cheaper than they were earlier this year.A key valuation measure, the price of the S. & P. 500 index compared with analyst estimates for corporate earnings over the next 12 months, has fallen this year. Some observers see that as a positive sign, indicating that the rising market over the last few months has been fueled by solid earnings growth, rather than wild optimism by stock market investors.On the other hand, the stock market is by no means dirt cheap, as it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And there are plenty of risks that could still derail the recent rally, from disorderly decline of some emerging markets, such as Turkey, to the continuing fallout from trade tensions between the United States and other large economies.\u201cThe big talk on the street is obviously trade and China,\u201d said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of United States equity strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities.On the other hand, Mr. Lakos-Bujas thinks that a resolution of the trade fight between the world\u2019s two largest economies, could generate a pop in the stock market, by removing a risky overhang clouding an otherwise bright picture. The American economy, he says, is in something of a sweet spot, with strong growth, low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits.\u201cIn this kind of environment, generally, risk assets such as equities, they tend to do well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The object is to force the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to release Andrew Brunson, an American and evangelical Christian pastor who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 2016 on trumped-up charges of aiding an aborted coup by Erdogan opponents.Strong ties between the two nations go back to World War II. With NATO\u2019s second-largest army, after America\u2019s, Turkey anchors NATO\u2019s eastern flank, and the country has long been viewed as a bridge between the Muslim world and the West. But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule and the regional unrest caused by the Syrian conflict have tested this bond. The United States is not the only ally that Turkey has antagonized.

{"Headline": "Scorching Summer in Europe Signals Long-Term Climate Changes", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In Northern Europe, this summer feels like a modern-day version of the biblical plagues. Cows are practically dying of thirst in Switzerland, fires are gobbling up timber in Sweden, the majestic Dachstein glacier is melting in Austria.Southern Europe is even hotter. Temperatures in Spain and Portugal are expected to reach 105-110 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend. On Saturday, several places in Portugal experienced record highs, and over the past week, two people have died in Spain from the high temperatures, and a third in Portugal.By analyzing data from seven weather stations in northern Europe, the researchers found that the closer a community is to the Arctic Circle, the more this summer\u2019s heat stood out in the temperature record. A number of cities and towns in Norway, Sweden and Finland hit all-time highs this summer, with towns as far north as the Arctic Circle recording nearly 90-degree temperatures.Not only is much of northern and western Europe hotter than normal, but the weather is also more erratic. Torrential rains and violent thunderstorms have alternated with droughts in parts of France. In the Netherlands, a drought \u2014 rather than the rising seas \u2014 is hurting its system of dikes because there is not enough fresh water countering the seawater.The preliminary results of the Oxford study found that, in some places, climate change more than doubled the likelihood of this summer\u2019s European heat wave.\u201cIn the past, we had this kind of heat wave once every 10 years, and now we have them every two years or something like that,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Br\u00e9on, a climatologist and deputy director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Science, a research institute affiliated with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research. \u201cThat\u2019s really the sign of climate change: We have heat waves that aren\u2019t necessarily more intense but that are more and more frequent.\u201dTemperatures that used to be seen as outliers \u2014 like those in the summer of 2003 when at least 70,000 people died across Europe \u2014 will become \u201cthe norm for summer\u201d after 2060, said Jean Jouzel, who was vice chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 when it won the Nobel Prize.Occasional heat waves could push temperatures in Europe toward 120 degrees unless there is a dramatic slowdown in global warming trends, he said.\u201cThis really is to enter into another world,\u201d Mr. Jouzel said. \u201cThis is a world that France and Western Europe are not used to. For Western Europe, this is truly a major change of climate if we do not fight efficiently against global warming.\u201dThe Dachstein glacier is one of the more dramatic symptoms. The glacier \u201cis melting so fast you can see it with your naked eye,\u201d the meteorologist Klaus Reingruber told journalists.It has been melting incrementally for many years, but the change became more visible this summer after the hottest June on record since 1767, when the country started keeping track, according to researchers at Innsbruck University.For Europeans living with the heat day to day, a raft of practical problems has become worrisome \u2014 difficulties that might have happened elsewhere or rarely, but never before seemed likely to become facts of daily life.Climate change is gradually becoming understood here as something that will alter many aspects of how Europeans live, potentially destroy or diminish some parts of the economy, and halt beloved local traditions such as the summer barbecue, which was banned this year in public spots in parts of Sweden to reduce the chance of fire.It used to be winter storms that closed down airports and delayed flights. But this summer in the northern German city of Hannover, the 50-year-old runways buckled in the 93-degree heat and travelers were delayed for hours.Across northern Germany, trees, especially saplings, have been hard hit by the drought and cities have been calling on citizens to help local trees. They have responded by dragging garden hoses from their houses or sloshing pails of water to nearby trees.Throughout the Alps but especially in eastern Switzerland and western Austria, as well as in Ireland, the water shortages have been so severe that there is not enough hay in the pastures to feed local milk cows. So farmers are having to dip into their winter feed stocks, diminishing what they will have for their livestock later in the year.In Switzerland, where the herds are led to the high pastures in summer to graze, the drought has stranded cows without water. Farmers have turned to the country\u2019s helicopter association and the Swiss Air Force to transport tens of thousands of gallons of water every week to keep the herds alive.\u201cThe situation is very serious,\u201d said Christian Garmann, a spokesman for the Swiss Helicopter Association. \u201cFor thousands of years, the cows could get water at small watering holes. Now they are dry in many places.\u201dThe last time the association undertook an aid mission was in the summer of 2003, but this year \u201cthe situation is more extreme\u201d with some farmers considering slaughtering their herds, Mr. Garmann said.Reto R\u00fcesch, the managing director of Heli-Linth, a member of the helicopter association, said his company was running 30 to 40 trips a day, transporting 250 gallons on each run.In France, the hot weather has not broken records so far. But it is part of an overall trend \u2014 this July was one of the three hottest on record \u2014 and subtle changes are taking place countrywide. Among them are rising sea levels, which Mr. Br\u00e9on, the climate scientist, fears are being underestimated.\u201cToday, the sea level is increasing by three millimeters per year, or between three and four millimeters,\u201d Mr. Br\u00e9on said. \u201cOne might think that\u2019s not very much, but I would insist otherwise because it is completely irreversible.\u201d\u201cEven if we respect the Paris climate accord and manage to stabilize the temperatures at two degrees higher than in the preindustrial era, the level of the sea will continue to rise for many hundreds of years. There are coastal cities that are already condemned,\u201d Mr. Br\u00e9on said.Among them are areas of the Camargue on the Mediterranean, in Brittany both on the English Channel and along the Atlantic coast and in the Vend\u00e9e and Gironde, the area near Bordeaux. In some places, that is already affecting land and house values as well as bird habitats.In England, as in almost all of Europe, growing patterns are changing. The drought has increased food prices, and staples may be in short supply this fall.The drought in Ireland means that income for dairy farmers is likely to be cut in half this year, said Teagasc, the state\u2019s farming advisory body.Sweden has faced some of the most severe repercussions from the hot weather, starting with the forest fires that destroyed more than 61,000 acres of timber, according to David Sundstr\u00f6m of the Swedish Contingencies Agency. Wildfires are still burning, although significantly fewer than when they were at their height.The drought has also severely hurt production of the iconic Scandinavian bilberries (similar to blueberries), cloudberries (similar to raspberries and blackberries, but often yellow or orange), and red lingonberries.Sylve Bjorkmanm, 62, said he buys berry crops from farmers and brings 1,000 workers from Thailand each year to pick them. In a telephone interview from Vasterbotten in Sweden\u2019s north, where he was looking for berries for his pickers, he said bilberry prices are up 30-35 percent because the hot weather has meant a smaller harvestThe cloudberry harvest was down as well because it was too hot for the beautiful alpine fruit.\u201cWe had an early season and the cloudberries ripened really fast,\u201d said Mr. Bjorkmann, adding that the berry season had outstripped the arrival of the pickers, who came too late.An earlier version of this article misidentified the affiliation of Reto R\u00fcesch. He is the managing director of Heli-Linth, a member of the Swiss Helicopter Association, not of the helicopter association itself.Reporting was contributed by Aurelien Breeden and Emma Bubola in Paris; Melissa Eddy and Christopher Schuetze in Berlin; Elisabetta Povoledo in Rome; Milan Schreuer in Brussels; Rafael Minder in Madrid; Christina Anderson in Stockholm; Ceylan Yeginsu and Palko Karasz in London; Ed O\u2019Loughlin in Dublin; and Niki Kitsantonis in Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Escalates Feud With Canada Over Rights Criticism", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia took concrete steps to disengage economically from Canada on Wednesday, escalating the feud over Canadian criticism of Saudi rights abuses and demonstrating that its expulsion of the Canadian ambassador this week was more than a symbolic protest.The kingdom announced on Wednesday that it would no longer send its citizens to Canadian hospitals and that it would withdraw resident physicians from Canadian hospitals.The measures came in response to two Twitter posts by Canada\u2019s Foreign Ministry last week calling on Saudi Arabia to immediately release imprisoned rights activists, including two who have family in Canada.The unusually strong reaction shows that Saudi Arabia, under the day-to-day leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is willing to wield its wealth to deter Western countries from criticizing how its absolute monarchy is run.Prince Mohammed, who has emerged as the kingdom\u2019s most dynamic official since his father, King Salman, assumed the throne in 2015, has made similar moves against Sweden and Germany in response to criticism.For now, both Saudi Arabia and Canada appear to be sticking to their positions.Asked Wednesday if his government would consider an apology to Saudi Arabia to smooth things over, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cCanadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly, clearly and politely about the need to respect human rights at home and around the world. We will continue to do that.\u201dIn Riyadh, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters that mediation in the dispute was not possible and that Canada needed to \u201cfix its big mistake.\u201d He said: \u201cThere is nothing to mediate. A mistake has been made and a mistake should be corrected.\u201dThe kingdom, he said, is considering unspecified \u201cadditional measures\u201d against Canada.Mr. Trudeau said that the foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, had a \u201clong conversation\u201d with the Saudi foreign minister on Tuesday, and that diplomatic talks between the countries would continue.The United States, which has strong diplomatic and economic ties with both countries, has taken a neutral stance on the dispute.\u201cBoth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it for them; they need to resolve it together.\u201dShe encouraged Saudi Arabia to \u201crespect due process and publicize information on some of its legal cases.\u201dSaudi Arabia has dismissed the Canadian criticism as an unjustified intervention in its internal affairs, and Saudi-owned television stations have aired content aimed at tarnishing the image of Canada.The withdrawal of Saudi students from university and college campuses across Canada appeared unlikely to cause much disruption; they account for fewer than 2 percent of international students in the country.Some campuses will be hit more than others. At the University of Regina, a small school in the middle of Canada\u2019s prairies, for instance, Saudis make up 7 percent of international students \u2014 and pay hefty international tuition fees.It is not merely a matter of revenue.\u201cThe richness of the culture these students bring, the ideas they share from so far away, I think that\u2019s the biggest loss,\u201d said Livia Castellanos, an associate vice president at the university.The Saudi students, she said, were stunned at having to leave their homes, cars, furniture and studies with less than four weeks\u2019 notice. \u201cThey have invested a lot of their life here,\u201d she said.On Wednesday, the Saudi state news agency also said the kingdom was no longer sending patients to Canadian hospitals. It was not immediately clear how many Saudi patients are in Canada, but many Saudis have surgery and other complicated treatments abroad, often paid for by their government.Saudi Arabia also moved to withdraw about 800 Saudi medical students working as residents or fellows in hospitals around Canada, including more than 200 at the University of Toronto. They have been told they have until the end of the month to leave the country, according to Dr. Salvatore Spadafora, a vice dean at the University of Toronto\u2019s faculty of medicine.\u201cWe are hopeful the situation can be resolved,\u201d he said.While the Saudi sanctions may touch individual sectors, they will not have a great impact on the overall Canadian economy, analysts say.Cam Dahl, president of Cereals Canada, said farmers were more likely to be troubled by the larger picture: the general rise in protectionism. Just last year, Italy slapped a made-in-Italy labeling on imported durum wheat, which led to exports from Canada for Italian pasta all but collapsing, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a protectionist environment we are in right now and it\u2019s troubling,\u201d Mr. Dahl said.Saudi Arabia and Canada do about $4 billion a year in bilateral trade. In 2017, Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia totaled $1.1 billion, a fraction of a percent of Canada\u2019s total exports.A few countries, including Bahrain and Egypt, have stated their support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s position, but without announcing concrete steps of their own.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the split between Canada and Saudi Arabia. It blamed international powers \u201cmeddling in the internal affairs of countries in the region\u201d for the tensions.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter at: @NYTBenAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Grew Even Faster in Truman\u2019s Presidency. So What?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBased solely on a few headline numbers, the American economy looks good. But it would be a mistake to read too much into the data \u2014 or to give too much credit to President Trump.In fact, the most spectacular economic growth since World War II occurred nearly 70 years ago, when Harry Truman was president. But Truman didn\u2019t cause it, and it wasn\u2019t particularly good news.First, let\u2019s look at where we find ourselves now. Avid supporters of Mr. Trump attribute good economic tidings to him. His policies \u2014 tax cuts, curtailment of immigration, reduction in regulations \u2014 and confidence-building talk are seen as driving faster economic growth.But that is largely a misreading of the way modern economies work. They have a tendency to alternate between booms and recessions for reasons that are imperfectly understood but involve changing popular narratives, the contagion of ideas and emotions, and circumstances that are mostly outside a president\u2019s control.These numbers may look like evidence of a fundamental transformation, but that view overstates the significance of such statistics.The numbers are actually driven by changes in individual day-to-day economic decisions \u2014 many of them so small that people can\u2019t say why they made them. In the case of the stock market, shareholders are claimants on corporate income and fluctuations in sales can have an amplified effect on share prices.That 4.1 percent G.D.P. growth is hardly unusual: We have had 101 quarters of growth at least this great since quarterly G.D.P. enumeration started in 1947. These high-growth quarters were interspersed among sporadic quarters of negative growth, usually recessions.To understand subtle economic changes, it helps to look at the biggest ones. The fastest annual G.D.P. growth since quarterly numbers began occurred over the period ending in the fourth quarter of 1950, when Truman was president. It was 13.4 percent, more than three times bigger than the 4.1 percent of the last quarter.We ought to be able to understand what caused that colossal Truman boom. After all, there has been plenty of time to consider it.There are many explanations, but we don\u2019t really know the truth.We know for sure that a tax cut didn\u2019t spur growth back then: Personal income tax rates rose slightly in 1950. And government spending didn\u2019t do it: Total government expenditure in 1950 was still near a postwar low. Nor did new protective tariffs cause the surge. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which went into effect in 1948, was in the process of reducing tariffs, not raising them.In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that the fundamental cause of the 1950 boom was bad news, not good. Recall that on, Aug. 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first atom bomb, ending the brief nuclear monopoly of the United States.For several reasons, the United States in 1950 was at the peak of its biggest housing construction boom since 1929. It still counts as the peak, ranking even higher, as a fraction of G.D.P., than the boom just before the 2007 financial crisis.People feared re-imposition of wartime constraints on home building, too. Many consumers felt it might be now or never if you wanted a new home.So, yes, 1950 had spectacular growth, but it was not a good year.Now, in 2018, there are also some fearful narratives spreading through the country, though they seem less likely to motivate people to spend. The nuclear war scare of 2018 has not come close to the levels of 1950. And the mood of fear lingering from the experience of World War II is practically forgotten now.Yet it seems likely that people in many countries may be accelerating their purchases \u2014 of soybeans, steel and many other commodities \u2014 fearing future government intervention in the form of a trade war. Surely some consumers, fearing that if they don\u2019t buy a house or car now they may be faced with higher interest rates imposed by central banks, are making purchases earlier than they otherwise would have.On a more positive note, the impulse to buy a home or a new car today could be subtly strengthening because of the demonstration effect of Mr. Trump, who models ostentatious living. Most of us can\u2019t keep up with the Trumps, but he may be inducing some of us to be more focused on keeping up with the Joneses.We have to be careful not to give too much credence to interpretations of the economy\u2019s strength offered by the president, who focuses on his policies and ignores many other kinds of factors. Something \u2014 probably a variety of circumstances, narratives and emotions \u2014 has pushed consumption spending up a smidgen more than usual. That, from the long perspective of history, is really no big deal.In fact, there could soon be a reversal of this strong-economy story, a sudden recession. But, if so, it won\u2019t disprove Mr. Trump\u2019s claims any more than the high growth of the second quarter proved him right.Robert J.

Where its wings should be are a giant fork and a giant carving knife. The combination makes for a troubling message: chicken as both dinner and diner.

In Birmingham, 50 miles south of this \u201cJerusalem in miniature,\u201d the cosmology goes back even further. Rising above the city is a mammoth statue of Vulcan, the Roman god of the forge. It is the world\u2019s largest cast-iron statue, but during the years when I was growing up there, its fame lay primarily in its peculiar attire: Vulcan is wearing nothing but a blacksmith\u2019s apron and knee-high sandals, and his bare buttocks moon the town of Homewood.Perhaps because that image is still fresh in mind by the time drivers on I-65 reach the water tower in Chilton County, center of the Alabama peach-growing region, it\u2019s hard not to see a connection between Birmingham\u2019s famous landmark and Chilton County\u2019s almost-as-famous water tower, which was built in the shape of an authentically cleft peach. Nearby Montgomery boasts the World\u2019s Largest Brick Made of Bricks. (Once the World\u2019s Largest Brick period, it was bested in 2007 by a slightly larger brick built in one piece.) We didn\u2019t stop to see it, but we did stop for five more giant chickens \u2014 some metal, some concrete \u2014 that were standing in front of various small-town establishments off the interstate.All across the country, on interstates the width of football fields and two-lane blue highways, stand an uncountable number of homespun reminders that American ingenuity and wit have not yet been Walmart-ized out of existence. Think of Carhenge in Alliance, Neb., a replica of Stonehenge made entirely of vintage automobiles. Think of Dog Bark Park Inn in Cottonwood, Idaho, a bed-and breakfast that doubles as the World\u2019s Largest Beagle. Think of the 13-foot-tall peanut smiling with Jimmy Carter-style teeth in Plains, Ga.; or the World\u2019s Largest Ball of Twine in Cawker City, Kan.; or Lenny, the World\u2019s Only Life-Size Chocolate Moose in Scarborough, Me. Every state has them. Virtually every road in the country is the site of at least one.They are most visible on leisurely summer road trips, when a detour to take a selfie with a chicken or to snicker at a 114-year-old statue\u2019s bare butt won\u2019t make anyone late for the cranberry relish or the Easter ham, but they are always there. Often meant to be an advertisement for some local enterprise, they are inevitably much more than the mercantile economy requires. They are also evidence that human imagination will always resist homogenization, that daring art isn\u2019t found only in galleries and museums, that wit and wile are everywhere among us. When interstate exits are marked by the instantly recognizable icons of a dozen fast-food restaurants and gas stations supplied by the same multinational oil companies, the giant roadside chickens will always remind us of who we are.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a simple solution \u2014 but some of the large groups that influence the recycling industry are not motivated to fix the problem. DB: Why not? When there is this type of conflict of interest at such an influential level in the recycling industry, it becomes clear why the simple issue of public confusion at the bin wasn\u2019t resolved. Because when recycling is highly contaminated and too costly to process, then the landfills generate more revenues, the virgin material industries sell more virgin materials and there is a stronger appetite for building incinerators that burn waste to create energy. As an analogy, imagine the groups responsible for promoting road safety in the U.S. also owning most of the auto body shops, hospitals and morgues. DB: What will be the effect if the recycling industry does collapse? DB: What would you like to see done? Even though recycling programs are different from one community to the next, there can be standardized labels for every type of sorting system. Speed limits are different from one road to the next, but the standardized signs allow us to change our speed accordingly wherever we are. DB: What\u2019s been your experience when the information is presented more consistently? When Bank of America donated standardized labels for all the bins at Orlando\u2019s public K-12 schools, recycling levels for the school district increased 90 percent and the district saved $369,000 in trash hauling fees in the first year alone. Despite having millions of visitors from all over the world, Yosemite National Park\u2019s contamination levels in their recycling bins have decreased to less than 8 percent since displaying the standardized labels on their bins. Some of the hotels and theme parks at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida saw a doubling or tripling of their recycling rates after implementing the standarized-label solution for their 90,000 employees. DB: What can individuals do? DB: What can policymakers or other leaders who care about recycling do to try to save the industry? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Oklahoma City", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationI\u2019ve been around. Once, in the middle of Marrakesh, a man threw a monkey on my back. I kept walking, pretending there was no monkey, until eventually it jumped off. I have eaten ant eggs in Mexico City, paella in Seville, fried squash blossoms in Florence and thick mouthfuls of Guinness in Dublin. I was once publicly scolded, in florid Italian, for almost being pickpocketed by a child in Rome. On the 22nd floor of a Tokyo hotel, I was shaken awake at 4 a.m. by an earthquake. I have walked under bright midnight skies in Reykjavik and stood in Edinburgh gaping at an extinct volcano with a castle on top. None of these exotic places, however, has captured my imagination quite like the humble outpost of Oklahoma City.We tend to approach cities with a mental checklist of urban greatness. We want streets visibly teeming with life. We want world-class museums, immense parks, rare shops, grand boulevards. We want strong coffee and dedicated bike lanes, major concert halls and interesting jobs. We want deep history \u2014 the overwhelming feeling that a city has built itself up, layer by layer, over the course of countless generations.Oklahoma City has none of these things, at least not obviously, not at any kind of major scale. If there is a Mount Rushmore of great world cities, O.K.C. is nowhere near it; it\u2019s more like the discount parking lot in the next town, with intermittent shuttle service. The place sits way out in the middle of the Great Plains, profoundly landlocked, 1,300 miles from both Los Angeles and Washington. It is home not to the Getty or the Smithsonian but to the American Banjo Museum. If someone tells you she is from Oklahoma City, your brain will process that information in the same area it uses to process different shades of brown socks or clouds that almost look like something but don\u2019t. Even the name \u201cOklahoma City\u201d sounds like something a panicked kid would make up on a pop quiz about state capitals.Before I went there, I had basically no interest. On the rare occasions when Oklahoma City passed through my mind, I pictured a generic everyplace \u2014 the sort of beige and blocky cityscape (warehouse, shed, warehouse, garbage can, shed) that a 1980s video-game designer might have invented for characters to fight in. But I was wrong. In 2012, this magazine sent me \u2014 quite innocently \u2014 to Oklahoma City to write about its ascendant basketball team, the Thunder. I became obsessed not only with the team but also with the city \u2014 so obsessed, in fact, that I spent the next five years writing a book about it. Oklahoma City, it turned out, was the most secretly interesting place I had ever been. It was a pure distillation of our nation\u2019s essential weirdness \u2014 a bouillon cube of America.Consider, for instance, its origin. Oklahoma City was born on a single afternoon in 1889. Under a clear blue sky, tens of thousands of settlers from all over the world lined up around what was then known as the Unassigned Lands \u2014 two million vacant acres in the center of Indian Territory. (The Seminole and Creek tribes had been evicted for siding with the South during the Civil War.) What happened next seems less like history than a Reader\u2019s Digest version of Manifest Destiny. At noon, all the settlers raced in \u2014 on horses, in wagons, on foot, even on bicycles \u2014 to stake claims. In a matter of hours, a scrubby patch of grassy prairie became a city of 10,000.That formative chaos set the tone for everything that would follow. The city\u2019s history can be seen as an effort to impose order on its initial mess. Since that very first afternoon, Oklahoma City has been obsessed with its position in the world \u2014 desperate to prove to outsiders (usually unsuccessfully) that it is a real place, a major city, not just a novelty. Every motion that a normal American city went through in the 20th century, Oklahoma City exaggerated beyond all reason and restraint. In the 1950s and \u201960s, when the fad was urban renewal, O.K.C. took it to a horrifying extreme, destroying most of its downtown to make way for glass skyscrapers and malls, most of which never materialized. (The local economy went bust just after the bulldozers finished up.) When compact cities began to expand to incorporate suburban sprawl, Oklahoma City followed suit, spasming in just four years from around 80 square miles \u2014 not too shabby \u2014 to more than 600. A modest city of 300,000 residents was suddenly larger, in land area, than Philadelphia, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. In terms of urban planning, O.K.C. was like a drunk man learning how to dance: one-two-three, one-two-three \u2014 elbow through the window, foot in the trash can, belly-flop down the stairs.I will return to Oklahoma City, I think, for the rest of my life. It is like a theme park of modern urban America. Downtown has recently come back to life; an 850-foot glass skyscraper now rises out of one of urban renewal\u2019s weedy parking lots. The structure is practically twice as tall as any other building for 100 miles in every direction. Although it is meant to make O.K.C. seem big, it mostly makes it look puny. Set out in any direction from the city\u2019s center, and you can drive forever, past cows and horses, without ever leaving city limits. Keep your eyes peeled. Even a quick glance somewhere you never intended to look can change your world forever.Sam Anderson is a staff writer for the magazine.

{"Headline": "Republicans Urge Embattled Incumbents to Speak Out on Trump", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Republican Party leaders began urging their most imperiled incumbents on Wednesday to speak out about the wrongdoing surrounding President Trump, with Representative Tom Cole, a former House Republican campaign chairman, warning, \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, and there\u2019s a lot of smoke, there may well be fire.\u201dDemocrats face their own pressure to shed their cautious midterm strategy and hammer the opposition for fostering what Democratic leaders are labeling \u201ca culture of corruption\u201d that starts at Mr. Trump and cascades through two indicted House Republicans to a series of smaller scandals breaking out in the party\u2019s backbenches.By urging some candidates to speak out or at least stay silent, Republican leaders who gravely fear losing control of the House risked opening the first significant rift between the Trump White House and the Republican-controlled Capitol.\u201cAnybody who says this is not disturbing is not being honest,\u201d said Mr. Cole, an Oklahoman and the former head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, adding, \u201cso my advice to any candidate would be: Keep your powder dry and don\u2019t rush to attack or defend anybody because you just don\u2019t know enough to have a reaction that you can still defend three months from now.\u201dOn cue, Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, called the accumulation of Trump-related scandals a \u201csad chapter in our country\u2019s politics\u201d and said that \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d Mr. Curbelo, in a tough re-election fight, also reproached the president for his caustic attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cHe\u2019s making a major mistake by attacking the Mueller probe in such a personal way,\u201d said Mr. Curbelo, who represents a district that Hillary Clinton won handily in 2016. \u201cThe best thing for everyone, especially if the White House is so confident that the president will be absolved in this process, is to let the process continue.\u201d\u201cWherever the facts go, if they go towards the president or someone in the White House, they\u2019re not above the law,\u201d Mr. Katko said, voicing support for the Mueller inquiry. \u201cNo one is.\u201dNearly as alarming to House Republicans were the mushrooming scandals in their own chamber, misdeeds that may dampen turnout among conservative voters.\u201cIt has been a really bad August,\u201d as Mr. Cole put it.Mr. Hunter\u2019s Democratic opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, released a video declaring, \u201cThe division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far.\u201dA flow chart that shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer saw to it that a porn star and a former Playboy model received payments after alleging affairs with Mr. Trump.Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, issued a fund-raising plea declaring, \u201cDonald Trump himself was implicated yesterday in Cohen\u2019s guilty plea. The rot of corruption runs deep in the Republican Party.\u201dBut the summer eruption of apparent Republican malfeasance has some in the party arguing that Democrats should make corruption more central.\u201cThere\u2019s no way this won\u2019t matter in a whole bunch of races out there, and Democrats need to be talking about this everywhere,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, invoking the 2006 campaign, when \u201clate-breaking corruption scandals, on top of an unpopular president, tipped the House and the Senate.\u201dOr, as Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former congressman and the architect of the 2006 House Democratic takeover, put it: \u201cTrump is the issue, and rather than draining the swamp, he brought it with him.\u201dDemocrats moved on Wednesday to elevate the theme. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, distributed a public letter to her colleagues arguing that the Trump-era capital had \u201cbecome a cesspool of self-enrichment, secret money and ethical blindness\u201d and that House Republicans were offering only a \u201cblind eye to the corruption and criminality at the heart of President Trump\u2019s inner circle.\u201dBut in the same letter, Ms. Pelosi also said that Democrats \u201cmust also stay focused on delivering our strong economic message.\u201dDemocratic strategists overseeing the midterm elections said they would use corruption against those Republicans tarred by any wrongdoing, but they were not yet convinced that focusing on what some in the electorate view as unending Washington drama would be more effective than highlighting policy differences.\u201cFor a lot of voters, the Donald Trump circus is not enough to get them to vote Democratic in the midterms,\u201d said Alixandria Lapp, who runs the main House Democratic \u201csuper PAC.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat running for re-election in Ohio, which Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, put it this way: \u201cVoters see this, and the people who don\u2019t like Trump know it, and the people who do like Trump know it. I think my job is to make the case that the Republicans have cut taxes for the rich. They are going to raise the eligible age for Medicare. And they try to take health care away from people and Democrats stand on the other side.\u201dDemocrats also worry that employing a Trump-tinged message about corruption will only prompt more questions about whether they would use a new House majority to impeach Mr. Trump, a campaign that could rile an otherwise demoralized Republican base. Democratic leaders have studiously avoided the \u201cI\u201d-word for months amid liberal outcry, preferring to shift the burden onto Republicans who have all but ceased conducting oversight of the Trump administration.But the criminal implications of Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea will raise the pressure on Democrats from their own base.\u201cWe need to see what Mueller comes up with,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said about the potential for an impeachment inquiry, allowing that \u201cthis is getting deeper and deeper, and it\u2019s going to get more and more serious.\u201dAs news of a Cohen plea deal was circulating Tuesday, House Democratic leaders urged members on a private call to stay on message, avoiding the topic of impeachment. Instead, Democrats will cast themselves as offering a check and balance on the president, a message that their polling indicates voters respond to favorably.But this is an election year in which the battles for the House and Senate are being fought on drastically different terrain, with many of the most competitive House contests taking place in suburbs that revile Mr. Trump and control of the Senate hinging on a group of Democrats from more rural states that he won overwhelmingly.So even as House Republicans suggested that their most at-risk lawmakers should tread gingerly around the embattled president, some of their Senate counterparts taunted Democrats for trying to curry favor with Mr. Trump.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a number of red-state Democrats that are trying to get closer to the president,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the Senate Republican campaign arm, who flew with Mr. Trump to his rally in West Virginia in the hours of Tuesday\u2019s convictions. \u201cThey are trying to run as close to the president as they can.\u201dSome Democrats from pro-Trump states said they had no immediate plans to highlight the matter of the president authorizing an undisclosed payoff to a pornographic film actress with whom he had an affair.\u201cIf asked, I absolutely will talk about it,\u201d said Senator Jon Tester of Montana, adding that it is not currently a front and center campaign issue. \u201cI think people are still trying to sort through it.\u201dGiven the health of the economy and relative stability abroad, Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are already significantly lower than what virtually any other president would be enjoying at this moment of his administration. And if there is one predictable element of this otherwise unpredictable presidency, it is that some new story will detonate in the days or weeks ahead, pushing the last eruption off the home page and television chyron.Even more worrisome to Republicans is what damage Mr. Trump may do to himself. If the president is seen as thwarting Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, either by terminating the special counsel or pardoning allies who are implicated, it would create a far more serious upheaval and force Republican lawmakers into a confrontation they have long avoided.\u201cOf course you can imagine the president doing things that would be counterproductive,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, before adding with evident hope in his voice, \u201cbut you also could imagine the president saying something but never acting on it, just venting.\u201dCatie Edmondson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Thing in Hong Kong\u2019s Public Schools: White Students", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For generations, Hong Kong\u2019s prestigious international schools exclusively educated the children of wealthy Western expatriates. Today, placement in those schools is increasingly competitive and enrollment fees can exceed $1 million, making them some of the most expensive private schools in the world.Recent changes to the city\u2019s demography \u2014 prompted by Chinese politics and global markets \u2014 have driven up tuitions and resulted in a dramatic shift in the complexion of the city\u2019s schools: An increasing number of ethnic Chinese students are now enrolled in international schools, and many more white students are occupying desks in Cantonese-language public schools.\u201cPrivate schools here are bloody expensive you know, and we have twins,\u201d said James Runciman, a Briton, shop owner and father of two 6-year-olds who are set to begin second grade in September. \u201cWe just can\u2019t afford to send our kids to these schools,\u201d he said of the private international schools, which replicate the curriculums of Western countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and France.As students return to school next month, there will be more white students in public schools than at any time in the city\u2019s history, a telling indicator of how Hong Kong is both shaking off its colonial past and losing its draw as a magnet for the West\u2019s wealthiest workers.Last year 818 white students were enrolled in the city\u2019s public schools, according to the Hong Kong Education Bureau, which labels all Caucasian students \u201cwhite\u201d regardless of nationality or self-identification.That number represents a small fraction of the overall public school population, but is indicative of a 44 percent increase from 2013, when only 556 white children attended public schools.Robert Adamson, a professor of curriculum reform at the Education University of Hong Kong, said white students were increasingly attending public schools because they had been priced out of the city\u2019s international schools by a newly rich immigrant constituency: mainland Chinese.\u201cInternational schools are in high demand from a new market \u2014 mainland China \u2014 and fees have increased considerably in recent years,\u201d Professor Adamson said. \u201cThus, some traditional students are struggling to gain access and therefore look to local schools instead.\u201dHong Kong, which reverted to Chinese control from Britain in 1997, has long been considered Asia\u2019s pre-eminent financial hub. For decades, the world\u2019s largest banks sent Western employees to the city on lucrative expatriate contracts that included money for housing and school tuition. But China\u2019s meteoric rise to become the world\u2019s second largest economy has meant an influx of mainland bankers to Hong Kong. Today, Mandarin is more likely to be heard spoken on a bank\u2019s trading floor in Hong Kong than English.Still, after a decline in expatriate whites following the 1997 handover, the city has seen an increase in its white population in the last decade. As China has opened its economy, many foreigners have come to Hong Kong looking to open \u2014 and work for \u2014 businesses eager to gain access to China\u2019s enormous markets and its inexpensive goods and services.From 2006 to 2016, the number of white residents increased by 60 percent, to 58,209 from 36,384. The majority of those whites were from English-speaking countries, including Britain, the United States and Australia. But as of 2006, 16 percent of whites in the city did not speak English at home, according to a government report that cited German-, Italian- and French-speaking residents. The government tracks the number of \u201cwhites\u201d as an \u201cethnic minority\u201d in the city, but its statistics do not break that down by nationality.Since the 2008 financial crisis, Western firms have been less willing to offer employees gold-plated relocation packages. And white workers in the city are no longer just bankers, but also small-business owners, middle managers at tech start-ups and baristas in coffee shops.\u201cMany low and middle-management people are not given the same packages when asked to move here,\u201d said Jacqueline Cohen, an American who moderates a parents group on Facebook for expatriates with children in public schools.But as expatriate packages have declined, prices at international schools have increased. Tuition at international schools can exceed $42,000 a year, excluding so-called debentures, which can exceed $1 million at the most prestigious and expensive schools.Debentures are lump-sum loans that incoming students are required to pay to the school on top of regular fees. Large debentures often come with the promise of admission at some selective schools. The loans, used for capital projects at the school\u2019s discretion, are sometimes reimbursed at graduation, but can also be bought and sold on a secondhand market. Some debentures, however, depreciate and are never returned.Increasingly, many of the students at international schools are Hong Kong locals or the children of mainland Chinese parents. Foreign students once made up 100 percent of those schools\u2019 populations. In 2017, however, foreigners accounted for less than 75 percent of students at primary international schools. Local students accounted for 21.6 percent of the student body, and \u201cnonlocal Chinese,\u201d a Hong Kong government designation for mainlanders, made up about 4 percent, according to the Education Bureau.Hong Kong prides itself on being a diverse, international city but it is also largely segregated \u2014 not by law but by custom.For many white parents, however, a Chinese-language education is an added reason to send their children to public schools and a chance for them to better integrate in the city.\u201cWe consciously put our children into Cantonese schools,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, whose children are 11 and 12. \u201cThey need to know the language to be a full member of Hong Kong.\u201dKatherine Ferreira, Mr. Runciman\u2019s wife and the mother of twins, Vicente and Florencia, 6, also said learning Cantonese was an important factor in deciding to enroll her children in public schools.\u201cThis is a different continent, so I saw it as a good chance to learn a new language,\u201d said Ms. Ferreira, who is from Chile. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to learn a language, now\u2019s the moment.\u201dPrimary public school students are required to use English and Cantonese in their regular classes and learn Mandarin too. High schools are typically designated either as English-language or Cantonese-language schools, with the other language and Mandarin being taught as electives.Aiken Bridges, 13, said he is the only non-Chinese student at the English-language secondary school to which he will return in September. \u201cMy friends usually speak to me in English,\u201d he said, adding that he was still nervous when speaking Cantonese outside class.The vast majority of immigrant students enrolled in the city\u2019s public schools are Asian, which the government\u2019s ethnicity statistics do break down by country of origin. Last year there were 6,267 Pakistani students in public schools \u2014 the single largest immigrant bloc \u2014 nearly eight times the number of white students.Unlike whites, non-Chinese Asian immigrants have attended the city\u2019s public schools for decades. Some South Asian families complain of systemic racism, arguing that the schools fail to teach their children Cantonese, the predominant Chinese language spoken in the city, which is necessary for public sector employment.(In addition to \u201cwhite\u201d and the nine most common Asian countries from which students trace their heritage, the Education Bureau also has demographic categories for \u201cother Asian\u201d and \u201cothers.\u201d)Hong Kong\u2019s students often rank among the world\u2019s top performers in math, reading and science, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That reputation, however, comes at a cost. Many students say the schools are high-pressure environments in which rote learning is stressed over critical thinking.Some experts attribute a rise in teenage suicide to the stress and rigor of school.About 35 students killed themselves in 2017, according to Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, a nonprofit anti-suicide organization, a 50 percent increase over 2016. More than 93 percent of high school students reported that school led to anxiety, according to the group.Western parents are often shocked by the long hours spent at school and the mountains of homework students in Hong Kong are expected to complete. In many cases, expatriate parents who send their children to public elementary schools use the money they have saved to pay for a private or international high school once classes get harder.\u201cI chose my children\u2019s mental and physical health over their results when they got to primary two,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, the American who moderates the \u201cCantonese School Parents Group\u201d on Facebook. \u201cAfter school and their homework tutorial, they will have the time for relaxation and a balanced life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Is Expanding Power to Block Chinese Firms. HNA Was Already No Match.", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Just over a year ago, two senior executives from the giant Chinese conglomerate HNA landed a meeting with Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, at his office. The executives, Adam Tan and Guang Yang, snapped a photo with Mr. Mnuchin, holding a model plane of the HNA-owned carrier, Hainan Airlines.Officially, they wanted to discuss the state of the American economy. But HNA had other urgent business: It was trying to buy the New York investment firm SkyBridge Capital.The deal had been languishing for months while the Treasury Department and other agencies reviewed it for potential national security concerns. Other acquisitions, too, were on hold, putting pressure on a spending spree that had turned HNA into a global behemoth with $100 billion in annual revenue and stakes in Hilton Hotels, Swissport and Ingram Micro.HNA executives were eager to complete the deal, as was SkyBridge\u2019s co-founder Anthony Scaramucci, who was hoping to be appointed to a White House post. They held a second meeting, in June last year, with Treasury officials involved in the SkyBridge review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the highly secretive, multiagency board known as Cfius.The meetings were part of a major campaign by HNA to win over Washington power brokers. It hired leading lobbying firms like McLarty Associates. It bought splashy advertisements to position HNA as an emerging global brand and a good corporate citizen. Top executives visited Capitol Hill, and in February one met President Trump at the Trump International Golf Club, near his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.Regulators will soon be more emboldened. Congress has just passed new rules on foreign takeovers of American companies, to strengthen the national security reviews and give more authority to Cfius. Mr. Trump is expected to sign them into law.HNA, in many ways, has embodied China\u2019s global vision. In recent years, company executives jetted around the world, investing overseas in airports, shipping lines, office towers and international logistics operations.The company had longstanding ties to leaders in both China and the United States. Its executives have struck business deals with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida as well as the family of the former Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao, according to records obtained by The New York Times.But global regulators started to ask questions about its debt-fueled buying binge, as well as its ownership structure. Like other large Chinese conglomerates, HNA is a vast network of public and private companies, subsidiaries and affiliates under a single corporate umbrella. In the United States, regulators asked HNA about its links to the Chinese government, according to court documents.\u201cThe problem with HNA is not that they\u2019re a Chinese company. It\u2019s about transparency,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \u201cThey say, \u2018Who is HNA?\u2019 No one knows who owns this company.\u201dAfter the election of Mr. Trump, Mr. Scaramucci started laying the groundwork to sell SkyBridge, a New York firm that invests clients\u2019 money in hedge funds. Mr. Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had served as a Trump campaign adviser, was positioning himself for a role in the administration and wanted to be free of potential conflicts.In December 2016, he hired Greg Fleming, a respected investment banker, to find a buyer for the firm. Within weeks, Mr. Scaramucci said, there were four bids, although he wouldn\u2019t identify the other potential buyers or the price HNA agreed to pay.HNA stood out, Mr. Scaramucci said. A fast-growing Chinese conglomerate, it had $100 billion in annual revenue and 400,000 employees. The company, he said, pledged to retain the vast majority of SkyBridge staff, many of whom had been with him from the start.But HNA was politically toxic for Mr. Scaramucci. As speculation swirled that HNA was buying SkyBridge to curry favor with the administration, his appointment to become the business liaison was rescinded.Mr. Scaramucci, who later served briefly as the White House communications director, said such rumors had been spread by aides who opposed his joining the new administration. HNA has strongly denied such motivation was behind its agreement to buy SkyBridge, saying its interest in the firm dates back to the summer of 2016, before the election.HNA proactively decided to seek regulatory approval from Cfius, an interagency body that includes, among others, representatives from the Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security. HNA had gone through the process before, including in early 2016 for its $6 billion purchase of Ingram Micro, a California electronics distributor.Back then, HNA was relatively unknown in the United States. By early 2017, perceptions of the company had changed.Heavily indebted companies like HNA came under scrutiny as Chinese authorities pressed banks to rein in deal-making. Its debt mushroomed, and global banks pulled back from advising the company last year. Regulators in Switzerland said HNA had given \u201cuntrue\u201d information about its ownership structure when the company sought approval for a takeover of Gategroup, a Swiss catering firm.Several deals were in limbo as HNA waited for approval from American regulators. In addition to SkyBridge, HNA had agreed to buy a division of Ness Technologies, a New Jersey software firm, for $325 million in early 2017.Regulators reviewing the Ness and SkyBridge deals for national security purposes wanted more information about HNA\u2019s ownership. But they began discovering discrepancies in documents that the company had submitted about its corporate structure and ownership, according to court documents filed by Ness in a lawsuit against HNA. (Ness sued HNA for breach of contract, accusing it of obstructing the regulatory approval process.)According to the lawsuit, HNA filings did not make clear who ultimately controlled the company. In regulatory filings, for instance, the company made inconsistent and contradictory statements about who held a large stake in the HNA Group, Ness said. The company later revised its filings to say a large portion of the shares had recently been donated to a New York charity controlled by HNA\u2019s top executives.Regulators also pushed for months for a better understanding of the company\u2019s ties to the state, the suit said. Eventually, HNA disclosed to American regulators that its other co-chairman, Chen Feng, was a member of the Communist Party, according to the lawsuit.In a statement, HNA disputed the account given by Ness but declined to elaborate. \u201cWe respect the confidentiality of the Cfius process and therefore will not comment on it,\u201d the company said in a statement.Lawyers representing Ness said HNA had botched the acquisition by making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements, undermining the regulatory review.\u201cWe terminated based on a breach,\u201d said Paul Werner, an attorney representing Ness.\u201cWe tried to obtain Cfius approval. But ultimately it became clear that they poisoned the process and frustrated the Cfius review.\u201dWith HNA facing more pressure in the United States, top executives sought to polish the company\u2019s image.The company hired Sard Verbinnen & Company, a firm known for its crisis communications division, to help manage press coverage. It placed full-page advertisements in Bloomberg Businessweek and The Wall Street Journal, touting HNA as a global brand, symbolized in print by an image of a whale floating over city skyscrapers.It enlisted McLarty Associates, started by Thomas F. McLarty III, who served as chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, and another powerhouse lobbying and consulting firm in Washington, the Cohen Group, run by former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. One firm organized a Washington round table on Chinese investment and invited reporters. The other arranged for HNA executives to meet Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.The company spent lavishly on extravagant parties and corporate events held in New York, London and Paris. In New York, HNA held a gala event for 300 guests at Lincoln Center, capped by a ribbon cutting and an appearance by Christopher Nixon Cox, a grandson of President Richard M. Nixon. In London, HNA promoted itself with a \u201cDNA of HNA\u201d symposium featuring paid appearances by former Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.\u201cThere have been very few Chinese companies that have tried to engage the Washington policy community directly,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cBut once HNA realized they were hitting a brick wall on regulatory matters, that began to change.\u201dTo help lead its charm offensive, HNA turned to one of its executives, Mr. Yang, a former Franklin Templeton investment manager who has a Harvard M.B.A. and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a mix of business and political endeavors.Mr. Yang \u2014 a naturalized American citizen who was born in China \u2014 once accompanied Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, on a business trip to China that involved meetings with government officials. He raised money for Mr. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and, before that set up a partnership between HNA and Mr. Bush. Corporate records reviewed by The Times show he also had business dealings with the golf legend Jack Nicklaus and the son of Mr. Wen, the former Chinese prime minister.With Mr. Yang\u2019s aid, HNA executives met Vice President Mike Pence at an Atlantic Council dinner. In early June 2017, with the Cfius review underway, they went to Treasury. Mr. Yang also met with Mr. Trump at Trump International Golf Club on Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. And the photo opportunities with American leaders also played well back in Beijing.The company said Mr. Yang\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump had been an \u201cunplanned and impromptu greeting,\u201d adding that its meetings with American officials were \u201ccommon for companies of our size and economic impact.\u201dIn the United States, HNA emphasized its role in creating jobs and buying American goods. It was essentially making the case that Chinese investment in the United States was beneficial to Americans.\u201cNew flight routes to the U.S. by Hainan Airlines will undeniably contribute to U.S. economic growth through tourist spending, international business deals and the purchase of American-made aircraft,\u201d Mr. Tan, the company\u2019s vice chairman, said in one speech aimed at an American audience.By early spring, it was clear HNA\u2019s deal for SkyBridge was doomed. Two other HNA deals had failed to win Cfius approval. And in Washington, the mood toward Chinese investment was souring, as trade tensions mounted.In an interview, Mr. Scaramucci said that in March the two firms agreed to cancel the SkyBridge acquisition. Instead, they decided to create a joint venture that might seek new opportunities in China.\u201cWe just decided we didn\u2019t want to go forward,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because these are great guys. But we\u2019ll do something in China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Quake-Prone California, Alarm at Scant Insurance Coverage", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The ravages of wildfires in California have kept Dave Jones, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, very busy over the past year. But that\u2019s not what keeps him up at night.\u201cI go to sleep praying that there\u2019s not going to be an earthquake the next day in California,\u201d said Mr. Jones, who has been commissioner for the past eight years. \u201cFrom an insurance perspective, Californians are simply not prepared.\u201dDespite an aggressive advertising campaign by the state to promote earthquake insurance, only 13 percent of homeowners have it. And fewer than one out of 10 commercial buildings, which include everything from low-rise office buildings to the high-rise office towers of Los Angeles and San Francisco, are insured for earthquakes, according to the California Department of Insurance.\u201cMost new buildings are not buying it all,\u201d said Justin Dove, the area vice president in San Francisco for Arthur J. Gallagher, a large insurance broker. Some companies are self-insured, he said, but many find earthquake insurance too expensive.California, with its multiple geological faults, has benefited from a period of seismic quiet over the past two decades \u2014 the last major earthquake struck Los Angeles in 1994 \u2014 but a small earthquake that shook parts of Los Angeles County earlier this week was a reminder of the state\u2019s seismic vulnerability. A big earthquake is a certainty for the state, scientists say.\u201cWhat are we going to do when no one has insurance and everyone has damage?\u201d said Mary Comerio, an earthquake expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dOther states prone to natural disasters have much higher insurance rates. In Florida, where banks typically require homeowners to purchase hurricane windstorm coverage, about 70 percent of households have it, according to ImageCat, a company specializing in disaster risks.In California, earthquake insurance is not included in standard homeowner policies, and few banks require homeowners to buy it. Alex Kaplan, a disaster specialist at Swiss Re, the insurance company, calls earthquakes the \u201clargest uninsured exposure from a natural disaster in the U.S.\u201dWith the median price of a home in California now above $500,000, estimates of the potential uncovered losses in an earthquake run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Economists say a large earthquake could have serious repercussions for local California banks. And with one-fifth of America\u2019s $10 trillion in mortgage debt held in California, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that guarantee much of America\u2019s mortgage debt, are also exposed to the risk, economists say.Those who have lived through major earthquakes recount how damaging they can be, even to ordinary wood-structure homes, which are considered among the safest.Art Polan and his wife were still sleeping when the Northridge earthquake struck their two-story home in 1994. Bookshelves crashed to the floor, and the china in the kitchen spilled out of closets. \u201cThe house was totaled,\u201d Mr. Polan said. The insurance payout he received was not enough to rebuild the house, so with the help of a federal loan, he moved and built elsewhere.Cindy Watter remembers the Napa earthquake of 2014 sounding like \u201ca runaway train full of howling beasts was outside my back door.\u201d Her two-story Victorian home, built in 1895, had relatively light damage, but her neighbors were not as lucky. One house burned to the ground because of a gas fire.\u201cLots of people around here took a real financial hit and couldn\u2019t afford to fix up their houses, so they sold them and moved away,\u201d Ms. Watter said. \u201cI still have earthquake insurance because, well, you never know.\u201dInsurance is not a panacea, experts say. Even if every building in California were insured, a large earthquake could nonetheless have a devastating impact on the economy.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy as some people make it out to be,\u201d said Laurie A. Johnson, an expert on the economics of earthquakes who has served as a consultant to cities and insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not a simplistic answer just to say people need to have insurance.\u201dA magnitude 7 earthquake on the Hayward fault, which runs through major cities like Oakland and Berkeley, would displace more than 400,000 people from their homes \u2014 the equivalent of about half the population of San Francisco \u2014 according to a recent simulation by the U.S. Geological Survey. With California already suffering a severe housing shortage, many people who would lose their homes could be forced to leave the area after an earthquake, whether they have insurance or not, Ms. Johnson said.The scale of economic losses from an earthquake would of course depend in large part on whether it struck near a large metropolitan area. Estimates of total damages for an earthquake in the Los Angeles area dwarf the costs of any previous natural disasters in the United States.CoreLogic, a real estate research company, estimated that a 7.3 magnitude earthquake along the Puente Hills Fault in Los Angeles would cause economic losses of as much as $450 billion, more than twice as much as the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the costliest United States natural disaster to date.The main source of earthquake insurance in California is a nonprofit, publicly managed organization known as the California Earthquake Authority, founded two decades ago in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. Shocked by the nearly $17 billion in payouts they made in that earthquake, insurance companies balked at offering further earthquake policies, forcing the state to step in and establish the earthquake authority.The seismic lull in California since Northridge has helped the authority accumulate $15 billion in available funds for an eventual payout. But its earthquake policies are expensive, and awareness remains low among California residents, experts say.Mr. Jones, the insurance commissioner, describes the low uptake of insurance as \u201ca chronic problem of denial and underestimation of the risk.\u201dIn the case of a large earthquake would the state or federal government come to the rescue?Mr. Jones says no.Many Californians, he said, \u201cmistakenly believe that FEMA or the state will rebuild their homes in the event of an earthquake.\u201dFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has a ceiling on individual assistance in disasters of $33,000, but actual payouts are typically much lower.\u201cIf you have a $1.45 million home in San Francisco, that $33,000 is not going to get you very far,\u201d said Mr. Kaplan of Swiss Re.Evan Reis, an engineer who is the executive director of the U.S. Resiliency Council, a nonprofit organization founded to promote the construction of buildings more resistant to earthquakes, finds it odd that flood insurance is required by banks in flood zones, but that earthquake insurance is not required in coastal California.\u201cIn the Bay Area, 90 percent of the properties are not insured,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many hundreds of billions of dollars is that in potential uninsured losses? it\u2019s astounding when you think of it.\u201dLast year, the share of California households with earthquake insurance rose to 13 percent, from 11 percent the previous year.Glenn Pomeroy, chief executive of the California Earthquake Authority, attributes the uptick partly to the public seeing reports about disasters like the Northern California wildfires last October, as well as Hurricane Harvey and earthquakes in Mexico.Several years ago, the earthquake authority ran ads showing happy Californians enjoying the beach or walking through a Sierra forest, with an upbeat narrator suggesting that viewers consider earthquake insurance because \u201cCalifornia rocks.\u201d\u201cWe overdid it in terms of not scaring people,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said.The authority plans to spend $12 million on advertising in 2019, more than double its spending at the beginning of the decade. Its latest campaign, \u201cIt could happen today,\u201d uses suspenseful music and darkened scenes of California waking to uncertainty.\u201cWill today be like any other?\u201d intones a worried voice. \u201cOr a day that turns our world upside down?\u201dAdvertisement"}

I believe in my nation.\u201dHe then repeated his call for Turks to trade in their dollars for lira, to help shore up the currency. \u201cExchanging the dollar immediately to protect the honor of the Turkish lira, this would be the best answer,\u201d he said.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s heavy involvement in managing the country\u2019s economy, which has resulted in the appointment of a relative as a key minister and the erosion of the independence of the central bank, has added to the concerns.Many in Turkey, however, have stood by him.One barber shop in the northern Turkish province of Ordu responded to United States sanctions imposed over the detention of the American pastor by refusing to carry out haircuts that residents associate with the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Seeks to Block Pay Raises for Federal Workers", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter being rebuffed in an attempt to peel back the union protections of federal workers, President Trump took aim elsewhere on Thursday: at their paychecks.Invoking authority that he and other presidents have used previously, Mr. Trump told Congress he was canceling government pay increases scheduled for next year.Congress has the power to override his decision, however, and unions representing government workers called on lawmakers to do so.\u201cWe must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases,\u201d the president wrote.But if Congress passes a bill with a pay increase and Mr. Trump signs it, the increase would take effect despite the president\u2019s letter. The Senate has approved a bill that would increase pay for federal workers by 1.9 percent, but the House of Representatives has not embraced that figure.Many legal experts were puzzled because the orders were supposed to apply immediately.Union officials in at least one agency, the Social Security Administration, exulted as they were told that they would be allowed back into offices that managers had evicted them from when the executive orders took effect this summer.Still, unions and Democrats on Capitol Hill saw the president\u2019s call for a pay freeze \u2014 shortly before Labor Day \u2014 as an attack on civil servants.\u201cIt is unacceptable that after last year signing a Republican tax bill that gave away tens of billions in corporate tax cuts and added more than $1 trillion to the national debt, President Trump cites the need for government belt-tightening in his decision to slash a planned pay increase,\u201d Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said in a statement.J.

{"Headline": "Modi\u2019s Cash Crackdown Failed, Indian Bank Data Shows", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Modi\u2019s plan, kept secret even from his cabinet until it was announced, gave citizens a 50-day deadline to turn in their 500-rupee and 1,000-rupee notes to banks in exchange for new notes. After the deadline, the old notes would be totally useless.As Indians waited in interminable lines at banks, and everyone from rickshaw drivers to real estate agents suffered a hit to their businesses and lives, Mr. Modi\u2019s team said the pain was necessary to punish those who were hoarding ill-gotten cash.These hoarders \u2014 including criminals, terrorists and tax evaders \u2014 would be too afraid to exchange their old bills for new ones, the thinking went, because going to banks would expose them to scrutiny and possible prosecution.But according to the central bank, it didn\u2019t work out that way.Mr. Modi\u2019s enemies instantly pounced on the findings, saying the prime minister should apologize for all the chaos he caused. Economists shook their heads.\u201cThis was a big mistake,\u201d said Arun Kumar, an economics professor at the Institute of Social Sciences in New Delhi. \u201cEmployment was lost, output was lost and investment came down.\u201dMr. Kumar said Mr. Modi\u2019s decision clearly did not tackle the problem of illicit cash and was \u201ca complete failure.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s plan, called demonetization or just \u201cdemo\u201d by many Indians, was a huge gamble, possibly Mr. Modi\u2019s biggest, and some analysts say the prime minister will pay next year when he is up for re-election.It is also the way he did what he did that ruffled many feathers. He did not consult Parliament. He did not solicit advice from many learned advisers. He did not give the public any warning.So much in India turns on cash, not just common purchases for goods and services like food and taxi rides. Even real estate deals worth millions of dollars are sometimes done partly in cash.That growth rate, however, is still the envy of many countries. And some economists contend that it is wrong to consider demonetization a failure, because the government can now obtain much more data from the banks, forming a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening in the economy.\u201cThe risk to tax evaders has jumped sharply and they should be on tenterhooks,\u201d said Gautam Chikermane, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a research institute in New Delhi.Another goal of demonetization was to move Indians away from cash. The idea was that Indians would bank more of their money and the government could then track it more closely \u2014 and collect more taxes in a country where only a tiny fraction of earners pay income tax.To some degree, the banking sector did benefit. In the wake of demonetization, millions of Indians opened their first bank accounts.But not all of that is attributable to Mr. Modi\u2019s efforts. India has been rapidly modernizing, and its economy is now the world\u2019s sixth largest (behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and Britain), though hundreds of millions of people are still very poor.And even to this day, cash is still king in India. Want to buy a table? More often than not merchants will offer two prices.If you want to pay by credit card, it\u2019s this much. But if you pay cash (which means the merchant will most likely not report the sale), the price can be much cheaper.Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Ayesha Venkataraman from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judges\u2019 Ruling on Election Map Plunges North Carolina Politics Into Disarray", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe court left open a host of possibilities. Ms. Coleman might have to run in a new Democratic primary, in a newly drawn district with voters who do not know her. Or she might find herself in an open, multicandidate election with no primary at all.Then again, the old map and her current district, including part of Raleigh and some surrounding communities, might be left just as it is for one last election this fall.And she may not know the answers for weeks.\u201cI\u2019m very anxious about this, because we are 70 days out from the election,\u201d Ms. Coleman said Tuesday. \u201cWe have been meeting with voters, communicating with them, getting messages out, spending money targeting specific voters we want to go after. That really puts a strain on the direction that you had charted.\u201dIn a state already drenched in partisan vitriol, the ruling reinforced the frequent complaint by Democrats that the Republicans who dominate the State Legislature have been constantly, aggressively tinkering with the rules of politics in every way they can think of, to gain advantages both large and small.Republican leaders in the state said they would petition the United States Supreme Court for a stay, which would freeze the current congressional boundaries in place for the time being. But a stay would require the votes of five justices, and the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in July has left the court divided 4-4 on ideological lines.A new, more neutral map could increase the number of competitive House races in the state to four or five, from just one or two now. And that could have major national repercussions, with Democrats needing to gain 23 seats nationwide to take control of the House.For the moment, though, with the court leaving so many possible scenarios up in the air, any prediction seems premature.The state\u2019s political experts and power brokers had already been expecting a political brawl this year. On Tuesday, with the rule book in tatters, they essentially threw up their hands.\u201cI think on both sides, nobody knows what to expect,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a professor of political science at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C. \u201cWe\u2019re wandering in the political pines, searching for directions.\u201dWhether they will get it soon from the Supreme Court is not clear. The high court has generally been reluctant to allow major changes to voting procedures to be imposed very close to elections. But the justices may wait to act on a stay application until the lower court panel has decided whether the flawed, existing map should be used one more time. The court called for briefs on that issue to be filed by the end of the week.If the Supreme Court adds an appeal in the case to its docket, it will have another opportunity to settle a question that it sidestepped twice in June: whether the Constitution bars extreme partisan gerrymandering.So little time remains before the date in September when ballots must be printed and mailed to overseas and military voters, and other election details must be settled, that the calendar would ordinarily all but dictate that the existing map be used.But the chief author of the three-judge panel\u2019s ruling, Judge James J. Wynn, left that question open, citing North Carolina Republicans\u2019 own turn-on-a-dime manipulation of state politics.A new map would mean discarding the results of the state\u2019s May primary. But the judge noted that the State Legislature summarily eliminated primary elections for judicial races this year, so perhaps staging a House election without primaries \u201cwould be consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s policy preference.\u201d Or, he wrote, the state could hold primaries on Nov. 6 and a special House election later in the year.Some legal experts say the Supreme Court would be likely to grant a stay, just as it did after the panel first ruled against the existing House map in January.But \u201cwe\u2019re in uncharted water, given how poisoned the political waters in North Carolina have become,\u201d said Edward B. Foley, an election-law scholar at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University. He added that evidence of rank manipulation of the political process could make the court think harder about delaying a new map yet again.Judge Wynn seemed to hammer that point home in his opinion, noting that Republican lawmakers had already been given two chances to draw a constitutional House map and had failed both times. He noted that they also drew state legislative maps that were overturned as racially biased, and had passed election-related laws that were struck down.Their actions raise \u201clegitimate questions regarding the General Assembly\u2019s capacity or willingness to draw constitutional remedial districts,\u201d he wrote.As a practical matter, two experts said on Tuesday, drawing a new House map for North Carolina would take less than a day\u2019s work on a laptop. In a Pennsylvania gerrymandering case decided by that state\u2019s supreme court in January, \u201cour experts produced thousands in a few minutes that all complied with traditional redistricting criteria,\u201d said Mimi McKenzie, the legal director of the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, which won the case.The three-judge panel said that if the North Carolina Legislature is given another chance, it would have about three weeks to draw an acceptable new map. Judge Wynn\u2019s opinion recommended that they get started immediately.The ruling on Monday may have left many North Carolinians confused, but few were surprised that their state would be the venue for last-minute, high-stakes maneuvering over voting and district boundaries. Fights over those issues have roiled the state for decades, during periods of both Republican and Democratic control.Recently, though, Republicans in the State House have gone farther, seeking out what Dr. Bitzer described as \u201cany and every means at their disposal to solidify their power.\u201dThat power diminished in November 2016, when Roy Cooper, a centrist Democrat, unseated the incumbent Republican governor, Pat McCrory. Mr. Cooper\u2019s victory was fueled in part by popular anger over a Republican-backed public restrooms bill that critics said discriminated against transgender people.Democrats are hoping that voters will once again punish the Republican Party for going too far by pushing state constitutional amendments that would diminish the governor\u2019s power to appoint judges and members of the state elections board. All five living ex-governors, including two Republicans, criticized the move this month as a legislative power grab.Pope McCorkle III, a professor of public policy at Duke University, said it sometimes seemed as though \u201ceverything that happens in the Legislature ends up being adjudicated in the courts.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just dizzying,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s happening, today or tomorrow.\u201dSo it was this week for the state\u2019s congressional candidates and their advisers.Art Pope, an influential Republican donor, said party leaders were not yet \u201chitting the panic button.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s lots of contingency planning going on,\u201d said Mr. Pope, a lawyer who has advised Republicans on map-drawing. \u201cI think most people are going to wait a couple of days to see if it gets stayed.\u201dHe said the possible remedies outlined by the judges would be hugely disruptive. \u201cTo have the election for new congressional districts, with no primaries, would be chaos,\u201d he said.Larry Shaheen, a Republican strategist in Pineville, said some disruption was already being felt. \u201cYour certainty level has now plummeted to zero,\u201d he said.Mr. Shaheen, who is not working for a House candidate this year, said he thought candidates would be wise not to campaign aggressively right now, and should instead use the next few days to shore up their fund-raising.\u201cUntil certainty exists from a legal standpoint, you have to hit pause,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t un-spend the money.\u201dBut Morgan Jackson, a Democratic strategist who advises Mr. Cooper, counseled the opposite \u2014 that candidates should run full steam in the districts they have now, and hope for the best.\u201cCampaign season is upon us, and these guys are so focused on November, it doesn\u2019t do them any good to slow down,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Dr. Bitzer, the political scientist, said that while Democrats as a whole may stand to gain seats under a new map, a redrawing might not turn out to be good news for individual candidates like Dan McCready, in the Ninth District around Charlotte, or Kathy Manning, in the 13th District around Greensboro. They have been running competitively with messages tailored to those districts, he said, and may not find it easy to retool.Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he was not expecting campaigns to make major changes in strategy, in part because his party is confident that the Supreme Court will block the lower court\u2019s ruling from taking effect.\u201cWe will proceed as if our elections will take place in 2018 as planned and scheduled,\u201d he said. \u201cA couple of things the courts suggested are absolutely unworkable.\u201dNorth Carolina voters tended to react to the news along partisan lines on Tuesday.Larry Beck, 67, a Republican from New Bern, near the coast, said the federal courts should leave the mapping of congressional districts to the states, and that this was no time to redraw them.\u201cYou\u2019re just coming up with this now, right before the election?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much at stake.\u201dEmilia Frederick, 66, a nurse who lives in Chapel Hill, said she has resented the Republican-drawn district map for years because she believes it is intended to dilute the votes of African-Americans like her.\u201cWith gerrymandering, people see that their vote doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to get millennials to vote \u2014 they have no incentive.\u201dNorth Carolinians were also split on one of the court\u2019s proposals, to hold primaries on Nov. 6 using a new map and then hold a general election a few weeks later.Mr. Pope said the extra attention and political investment would be good for the state economy. But Dr. Bitzer said it would only worsen partisan bitterness, particularly if control of the House will be hanging in the balance.\u201cIt will be nuclear Armageddon, I think, to put that kind of pressure on North Carolina,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the middle initial of an election-law scholar at the Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University.

{"Headline": "Bannon\u2019s New Group Issues a Midterm Plea: Save Trump", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, is forming a group to try to sell voters on a midterm message that they should support Republicans to defend the Trump agenda and save the president from impeachment.The group, Citizens of the American Republic, is Mr. Bannon\u2019s new vehicle after he was pushed out of the White House last summer and then parted ways with the conservative website Breitbart.Mr. Bannon declined to describe his donors or how much money the group has raised. One person close to the group said that Rebekah Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who supported Mr. Bannon\u2019s previous political efforts but broke ties with him months ago, has no role.Most of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers in the White House consider Mr. Bannon\u2019s foray into the midterms to be quixotic \u2014 they say the House is almost certainly lost to the Democrats \u2014 and see his efforts as another way to promote himself. They point to Mr. Bannon\u2019s paltry record in backing Republican candidates, particularly Roy S. Moore, the Alabama Senate hopeful who was accused of sexual misconduct against several women, including a teenager, and lost last year to a Democrat.But Mr. Bannon, who insists that approaching congressional races as one-offs is a waste of time, is planning a messaging push on cable television, the op-ed pages of newspapers and local conservative radio shows. His premise is that more of Mr. Trump will be a good thing.\u201cMore than any other midterm, this is a referendum on his style and on his content, and you cannot run from that; you have to embrace it,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in an interview.In addition to Mr. Bannon, the group includes Sam Nunberg, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest political advisers; Michael Caputo, a New York-based strategist who worked on the Trump campaign; and Pat Caddell, a pollster who worked in Jimmy Carter\u2019s White House and who has remained close to Mr. Bannon over the years.Political strategists say the main risk to Mr. Bannon\u2019s strategy is that Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with Republicans is singular and nontransferable. Those voters most loyal to Mr. Trump may not show up to vote for Republicans running for Congress, they say, because they have no interest in midterm elections.In fact, data that Republican pollsters have analyzed over the last year shows that Republicans are already staying home.But Mr. Nunberg said the call to arms for Republican voters would be a worthwhile message.\u201cDonald Trump is the threshold issue of this midterm whether the Republican consultant class likes it or not,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cUnlike the Democrats in 2014, who mistakenly ran away from President Obama, we need to embrace President Trump and set the terms. Jobs, economy, national security and impeachment. 2018 is about saving the Trump presidency. That is a winning message.\u201dMr. Bannon has written and directed a movie about Mr. Trump that is aimed at riling up the \u201cdeplorables\u201d whom Hillary Clinton criticized in September 2016 as a key demographic of Mr. Trump\u2019s support. His group has rented out a Wall Street restaurant to commemorate the date Mrs. Clinton made the comments. And he appears to be trying to bridge the gap between what Republican Party officials hope to focus on for the midterms and what Mr. Trump gravitates toward in his own speeches and on his Twitter feed.His approach to the midterms represents the kind of all-or-nothing proposition that, at times, endeared Mr. Bannon to Mr. Trump but also helped create some of the administration\u2019s most serious self-inflicted crises.It was Mr. Bannon who was alone in telling Mr. Trump that he had a 100 percent chance of victory the weekend that the tape surfaced of Mr. Trump boasting that he had assaulted women. Mr. Bannon, along with a longtime Trump adviser, Roger J. Stone Jr., helped plan the audacious stunt at one of the presidential debates to fly in women who had accused President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and seat them near the Clinton family box.But that same fearlessness \u2014 or recklessness, in the eyes of many in the Trump orbit \u2014 also led Mr. Bannon to advocate making the president\u2019s travel ban among the first actions taken by the new administration to signal how unflinching this White House would be in tackling immigration. The ban\u2019s early versions did not pass legal muster and had to be rewritten.Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon no longer speak. Mr. Bannon dismissed that fact as irrelevant.\u201cThis is his first re-elect,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of Mr. Trump, adding that if Democrats take the House, Mr. Trump\u2019s program \u201ccomes to a screeching halt.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Obesity rates in the United States continue to worsen. So, too, does economic inequality. Are these trends related? The obesity epidemic affects every region of the country and every demographic group. But rates have increased the fastest among low-income Americans and racial minorities, exacerbating pre-existing health disparities.Weight-related complications like hypertension, fatty liver, orthopedic problems, sleep apnea and Type 2 diabetes are bad enough when they strike in middle age. But they have become relatively commonplace at pediatricians\u2019 practices across the country. In adults, obesity substantially increases the risk for some of the most feared illnesses, like heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. At all ages, obesity is associated with social isolation, depression and other major mental health problems. Beyond the toll of human suffering, obesity and diet-related diseases impose massive and rapidly growing economic costs.These long-term fiscal pressures lead political parties to fight ever more ferociously over shrinking resources. Simply put, the more the government must spend on health care and the more tax revenues it loses, the less there is for discretionary spending (such as education, highways, the environment and defense) and safety net services.There are, of course, many causes of political conflict today. But our ability to negotiate differences within a large, diverse society will inevitably be undermined by rising economic pressures on families, communities and government and growing disparities in health and well-being.With the couple hundred billion dollars of savings that could be achieved by rolling back obesity, Republicans could have tax cuts, Democrats could have increased social spending and the common ground for compromise would grow.Right now the government is doing the opposite. Farm policies have made low-nutritional commodities exceptionally cheap, providing the food industry with enormous incentive to market processed foods comprised mainly of refined grains and added sugars. In contrast, vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, nuts and high-quality proteins are much more expensive and, in \u201cfood deserts,\u201d often unavailable. Processed foods are heavily advertised, even in educational materials directed at young children. And as cheap calories have flooded the environment, opportunities to burn off those calories at school, in recreation and through physically active modes of transportation have declined.Second, adequately fund obesity research into innovative approaches for prevention and treatment, beyond the conventional focus on eating less and moving more. These policies would help us reverse the obesity epidemic, improve the health and financial well-being of millions, decrease inequality, halt the decline in life expectancy \u2014 and even promote a modicum of political comity. David S. Ludwig is a co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is a professor of economics at Harvard. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Once Dry Discussions, Cabinet Meetings Are Now Part of the Trump Show", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoIn between, the president called on his top economic adviser to publicly share his \u201cvery beautiful\u201d assessment of the economy, and said Mexico and China were waging a form of war against the United States by exporting drugs to kill Americans.In other words, it was a normal cabinet meeting in the age of Trump. What was once considered a dry policy discussion among restrained public servants has turned into a kind of West Wing performance art, featuring a president prone to exaggeration and his advisers taking turns praising him and his policies.By now, the ritual has become familiar, like a monthly installment of a faithfully watched reality show with a story line that has become almost comically consistent.\u201cDespite the horrible laws, we\u2019re doing very well,\u201d the president said during Thursday\u2019s episode.Mr. Trump spent much of the session gently quizzing his cabinet secretaries with lead-ins prodding them to offer positive comments. Past sessions have occasionally featured a sharp comment directed at an unfortunate participant on the receiving end of a televised rhetorical swipe.On Thursday, cabinet members were largely spared the indignity. But when Mr. Trump turned to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general he likes to publicly insult, the president put the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official on the spot with a call to bring a \u201cmajor federal lawsuit\u201d against drug companies over opioids.\u201cIn China, you have some pretty big companies sending that garbage and killing our people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a form of warfare, and I\u2019d like to do whatever you can do legally to stop it from China and from Mexico.\u201dNot so at Thursday\u2019s gathering. Mr. Trump steered clear of the more controversial news of the day \u2014 including his decision to revoke the security clearance of a prominent critic and the unflattering tell-all book by a former aide \u2014 and instead began by noting the death of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul.\u201cI want to begin today by expressing my condolences to the family of a person I knew well,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he opened the meeting. \u201cShe worked for me on numerous occasions. She was terrific: Aretha Franklin.\u201dIn the middle of a health care update from R. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, Mr. Trump engaged in some wishful thinking about the repeal of the health care law enacted under Mr. Obama. \u201cWe actually got rid of Obamacare,\u201d the president said, \u201cexcept for one vote.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re spending a fortune in California because of poor maintenance and because, frankly, they\u2019re sending a lot of water out to the Pacific to protect the smelt,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He called on Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, to repeat an argument he had made earlier in the day on television \u2014 that climate change was not to blame for the deadly blazes. \u201cRyan was saying it\u2019s not a global warming thing, it\u2019s a management situation,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Zinke obliged, blaming Canadian lumber imports \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite trade villains \u2014 for what he called displacing American-grown lumber on the market, leaving fallen trees to rot and become combustible. \u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Trump said with a nod.\u201cIf you\u2019d like, you can stay,\u201d Mr. Trump told the small group of reporters representing the White House press corps at the meeting. \u201cOr if you\u2019d like, you can also leave. Don\u2019t forget: freedom of the press!\u201dThe president did make some news of his own. At one point, he appeared to confirm a disputed account of a deal for Turkey to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, in exchange for Washington\u2019s help in freeing a Turkish woman detained in Israel on charges of funding Hamas.The Turkish woman was freed, but Mr. Brunson remains under house arrest in Turkey. The deal was reported widely, but disputed privately by some American officials, and White House and State Department officials have refused to publicly discuss it.The president, however, was more than happy to hold forth.\u201cWe got somebody out for him,\u201d Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. \u201cHe needed help getting somebody out of someplace; they came out. They want to hold our wonderful pastor. Not fair. Not right.\u201dSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he was ready to impose additional sanctions on members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government if Mr. Brunson was not freed quickly.Other news Mr. Trump wanted to share was of dubious authenticity.He asked Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, how American farmers are faring. \u201cThe farmers like Trump,\u201d the president said.\u201cThey\u2019re selling the corn, and they\u2019re selling the soybean, and they\u2019re selling everything at levels that are soon going to be pretty good levels,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m hearing it\u2019s starting to really pick up.\u201dMr. Perdue pushed back a bit, but only gently.\u201cObviously there are some price constraints right now,\u201d he began. But, Mr. Perdue told the president, the farmers were keeping the faith.\u201cThey believe what you\u2019re doing in China, as you\u2019ve tried to indicate to them, will lead to a better and brighter future,\u201d Mr. Perdue said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supply Chains and Trade War (Very Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistWell, although I yield to nobody in condemning the stupidity and corruption behind Trump trade policy, I\u2019m a bit skeptical about the supply chain concern. Or maybe the best way to say this is that there are three possible stories about how supply chains might increase the costs of trade war, and while two of them are right, I suspect that many economists are buying into the third, which isn\u2019t.So, what difference does a supply-chain trading system make?Another thing the rise of global supply chains has done is to increase both total trade and the gains from trade. As a result, there is more to lose from a trade war than there was a generation ago.But what I think many economists have in mind is something more than that.Real income loss = 0.5*tariff rate*reduction in importsThis formula suggests only moderate costs even from a major trade war. Suppose that worldwide tariff were to rise to 40 percent, and world trade were to fall by 15 percent of world GDP, a 50% reduction. Even so, world real income would fall only 3 percent.Now, what I think many economists are suggesting is that this kind of analysis understates the losses when much of that trade is in intermediate goods. But I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re wrong, at least in the medium to long run.Let me sketch out a model here.Let\u2019s also assume for simplicity that the intermediate inputs are used in fixed proportions. However, for some subset of the intermediate goods each country has a choice between using domestic production and using imports; the others are nontradeable.We can rank the goods in order of the ratio of Home to Foreign productivity in their production. Call this ratio A(z) for any good z. And let\u2019s make a further simplification and assume that the countries are symmetric, so that the underlying situation looks the same if we reverse the countries\u2019 identities. In that case wages will be the same, and under free trade Home will produce (and Foreign will import) all the goods for which A(z)>1, Foreign will produce and Home will import all the goods for which A(z)<1.The answer is, each country starts producing some of the intermediate goods it used to import for itself. Home becomes self-sufficient in goods for which 1 > A(z) > 1/(1+t), Foreign becomes self-sufficient in the goods for which 1+t > A(z) > 1. In each case efficiency goes down, because it takes more labor to produce these goods than it previously took to export stuff and import the goods instead.What does this say about real income? Home\u2019s loss from the marginal good it no longer imports is the excess resources required for Home production as compared with imports, namely, the tariff rate. The cost from all the inframarginal goods is less, down to zero at the last good it would have imported under free trade. The same is true for Foreign.But this looks just like the logic of the standard estimates of the cost of protection: the average cost of a lost import is roughly half the tariff rate. So analyzing the costs of a trade war in a supply chain world isn\u2019t any different from a conventional trade war analysis.So where does the intuition that the costs of trade war must be higher in today\u2019s world come from? I think it comes from the combination of two things. First, imagining a literal cutoff of imports, as opposed to a mere rise in their price; second, imagining a short run in which it\u2019s impossible to develop domestic production to replace key inputs.Something like that combination has occurred in the past, notably in the former Communist economies after the fall of the Soviet Union. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be where we\u2019re going right now.That said, a trade war in a supply-chain world would cause a lot of disruption, because it would lead over time to a major restructuring of industry. This would create a lot of losers, as well as some winners, perhaps more than a trade war would have in the past. But I don\u2019t think the notion that the total loss in real income would be bigger than conventional analysis suggests holds up. Trump\u2019s policy moves are destructive, based on ignorance, but we shouldn\u2019t overstate their cost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Wages, a Trump Slump", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe official economic indicators look pretty good. The trends in hourly pay do not.Opinion ColumnistAh, yes: the good old days of 2014, also known as the sixth year of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Ryan\u2019s nostalgia for 2014 wasn\u2019t even the most-mocked part of his tweet. His attempt to make grand claims about a single quarter of growth was. If the Trump economy were so wonderful, why would the speaker of the House feel the need to traffic in disingenuousness? Because the Trump economy isn\u2019t actually so wonderful.

It shows the trends in average inflation-adjusted hourly pay, arguably the best measure of economic well-being for most people. As you can see, hourly wages are suffering through a Trump slump.That slump isn\u2019t entirely Trump\u2019s fault, by any means. But he deserves some blame for it. Worst of all, he is doing virtually nothing improve the situation, instead enacting policies that will ultimately hurt workers\u2019 ability to earn a decent paycheck.As a result of the growth, nominal wages \u2014 that is, the numbers people see in their paychecks, before taking inflation into account \u2014 are growing. You can see the pickup in the gentle upward slope of the chart\u2019s solid gray line. Over the past year, the average hourly nominal wage has risen 2.7 percent.Second, nominal wages by themselves can\u2019t buy a higher standard of living. Prices matter, too. When the prices of good and services are rising faster than nominal wages, people end up with less buying power. And that is exactly what\u2019s happening now.My best guess is that real wages will do modestly better over the next year, barring another oil spike or an unexpected recession. But there is no reason to think that most Americans are on the cusp of truly healthy pay increases.Right now, Trump is presiding over precisely the wage growth that he deserves: zero.Advertisement"}

Appearing subdued and distracted, he played up the strong economy and his trade policies, and charged without evidence that Democrats were putting the interests of undocumented immigrants before those of American citizens.\u201cTheir whole campaign is \u2018resist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said inside a cavernous banquet hall here where the Ohio Republican Party was holding its annual banquet, adding, \u201cthey still haven\u2019t figured out they lost the election, but they\u2019re going to figure it out soon.\u201d\u201cDemocrat immigration policies are destroying innocent lives and spilling very innocent blood,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that any party that puts criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office.\u201dBut even as he argued that the strength of the economy under his leadership should be enough to buoy Republicans in the coming contests, Mr. Trump was less bullish about his party\u2019s chances than he has been in the past.\u201cThey keep saying that whoever is president, they don\u2019t win the midterms \u2014 I just don\u2019t get it \u2014 but no president has ever had this economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said, expressing confidence about preserving the Republican majority in the Senate. \u201cThe House is probably tougher. We have so many people running.\u201d (It was not entirely clear what Mr. Trump meant; unlike the Senate, which has six-year terms, House seats turn over every two years, meaning that all 435 are contested.)\u201cYou would have made me look bad if you hadn\u2019t pulled that out,\u201d Mr. Trump quipped during his speech.Governor John Kasich, the state\u2019s Republican governor and an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, skipped the dinner, highlighting divisions in the party over the president\u2019s leadership.Matt Borges, an ally of Mr. Kasich\u2019s whom Mr. Trump helped to force out as chairman of the state\u2019s party, said that the president\u2019s divisive messaging on issues like immigration was driving up the enthusiasm of Democrats in a way that could spell peril for Republican candidates in November.\u201cHis constant desire to polarize the electorate \u2014 whether it be polarized Democrats or polarized Republicans who just aren\u2019t comfortable with the president \u2014 could be a dangerous strategy,\u201d Mr. Borges said. \u201cHe\u2019s goading the other side \u2014 he does it all the time \u2014 so what we have now is an electorate where the people who don\u2019t like him are maxed out, and the question is whether that sort of rhetoric really helps energize Republicans to vote.\u201d\u201cSo far, it has succeeded,\u201d Mr. Borges added of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach. \u201cBut I just think it could be playing with fire.\u201dDuring the dinner, Mr. Trump stoked the themes of cultural division that he has made his trademarks. He lashed out at the N.F.L., as well as the television networks ESPN and CBS, for their handling of the controversy over football players kneeling in protest during the national anthem.And he claimed that Americans had refrained from saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d before his election, but were doing so now, and \u201cproud of it.\u201dMr. Trump praised Representative James B. Renacci, a Republican, who is running to unseat the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown, calling Mr. Brown \u201ca very liberal Democrat.\u201d But he saved his most savage words for Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is the Democratic candidate for governor, calling him a \u201cbad guy\u201d who was \u201cdestroying a lot of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll destroy your state \u2014 Cordray will destroy your state,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering to share disparaging information about Mr. Cordray with Republicans seeking to defeat him. \u201cCall my office.

{"Headline": "Ruble Tumbles as U.S. Sets Out New Sanctions on Russia", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s currency fell on Thursday to its lowest dollar value in nearly two years, jarred by new American sanctions imposed in response to a nerve-agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.For several years, the Russian economy has appeared able mostly to shrug off the effects of a series of Western sanctions tied to its incursions into Ukraine and its election meddling. Buoyed by rising oil prices, the economy even grew modestly this year.But the ruble\u2019s precipitous decline may be a clear sign that the sanctions have begun to cloud the country\u2019s long-term economic outlook.\u201cSuch decisions made by the American side are absolutely unfriendly, and you cannot associate them with the constructive, even if difficult, atmosphere we had during the last meeting of the two presidents,\u201d Dmitry S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists in a conference call.A domestic bond issue was met with lackluster demand despite rising interest rates. And at times, Russian media reported, liquidity dried up on currency exchanges as ruble sellers far outnumbered buyers.Market turmoil began earlier this month after Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the United States Congress introduced a draft bill to punish Russia for election meddling, and accelerated with the announcement of the separate chemical weapons sanctions on Wednesday.Before the sanctions scare began, it cost just 62.5 rubles to buy a dollar, but by the end of the day Thursday, the Russian currency had weakened to 66.5 to the dollar. Russia\u2019s main stock index, the Micex, dipped on news of the chemical weapons sanctions but recovered losses by the close.Some companies were hit harder. Shares in Aeroflot, the national airline, fell 11.4 percent before bouncing back later in the day. The chemical weapons sanctions could ban flights between the United States and Russia within three months, a State Department official told reporters in Washington.The restrictions cover exports to Russia of anything with a potential national security purpose, such as gas turbine engines, electronics, and testing and calibration equipment.The ruble tumbled despite what economists considered a modest direct effect on Russia\u2019s economy of this sanction, which will come into force later this month.The new measures, wrote Lilit Gevorgyan, a principal economist at IHS Markit, are \u201cless menacing\u201d than sanctions announced in April that targeted politically connected oligarchs. But they unnerved investors because they signaled the American government\u2019s willingness to keep taking steps.\u201cThe escalating \u2018sanctions war\u2019 between the U.S. and Russia, especially the uncertainty surrounding the long-term investments in critical energy projects, will damage the overall investment activity,\u201d Ms. Gevorgyan wrote. \u201cThe investor community is unsettled.\u201dMost economists have attributed a recession in Russia that began in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine, to falling global oil prices rather than Western sanctions. The economy has since resumed growing.Russia has $458 billion in gold and hard currency reserves it could use to prop up the ruble, but the central bank has been allowing its value to drop, and did so again this week. The policy helps domestic industry and agriculture.Russia has been subjected to successive waves of sanctions. The Obama administration imposed sanctions for Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The Trump administration in April sanctioned oligarchs and government officials over the election meddling and other \u201cmalign\u201d activities, and this week over the nerve agent attack in Britain.In Moscow, some officials described the new sanctions in terms of American domestic politics. They were imposed, the Russians said, as part of a struggle in the United States between Mr. Trump and his supporters, who wanted to engage with Russia, and a \u201cdeep state\u201d of national security bureaucrats, who were determined to worsen relations.\u201cThis means more pressure on Russia as well as those U.S. politicians who want a rapprochement with Russia, with the ultimate aim of exacerbating the situation,\u201d Aleksei V.

{"Headline": "The Super Bowl of Beekeeping", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "FeatureAlmond growing in California is a $7.6 billion industry that wouldn\u2019t be possible without the 30 billion bees (and hundreds of human beekeepers) who keep the trees pollinated \u2014 and whose very existence is in peril.Supported byThis year the beekeepers responsible for those bees gathered on a mid-February Saturday for a potluck lunch at a community center in Kerman, a small town of ranch houses wreathed by acres upon acres of almond orchards. The meeting was supposed to kick off the pollinating season, but the beekeepers, many of them wearing tucked-in plaid shirts and trucker caps with dirt-curled bills, had already been at work for a couple of weeks, summoned to the state early by a heat wave. The sun beckoned the blossoms, and the blossoms begged for the bees. Farmers have a window of just a few weeks when pollination has to happen, otherwise the nuts won\u2019t set, which is what it\u2019s called when blossoms are pollinated and kernels emerge. When the nuts don\u2019t set, much of a crop can be lost. By the time of the potluck, it seemed as if the season were already at its midpoint.The beekeepers lined up to fill their paper plates with pork chops, baked beans, chicken, rice, salad and three different kinds of cake. Teri Solomon, the organizer of the event and a longtime local beekeeper, collected $10 each for lunch. A list of speakers was taped to the table where she sat \u2014 respected beekeepers, bee brokers, scientists, a Fresno County sheriff\u2019s police detective and a rep from the Almond Board of California. Topics of the day included the steady growth of the almond industry, the science of pollination, agricultural theft (hence the cop) and the ever-more-imperiled state of honeybees. That last item carried the most weight with the crowd, as they were all struggling to maintain the vast numbers of bees needed for almond pollination. Bees are central to an enormous agricultural industry \u2014 about one of every three mouthfuls of food we eat wouldn\u2019t exist without bee pollination \u2014 and beekeepers\u2019 custodianship of billions of these delicate animals is as much an art as it is a science. Beekeepers themselves, Solomon confided, are funny creatures: solitary in the field, trying to anticipate the needs of a finicky insect and, unlike that insect, social only once in a while. \u201cWe\u2019re an odd bunch, very individualistic in nature,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in trouble.\u201dMostly the beekeepers and bee brokers \u2014 the agents who negotiate contracts between beekeepers and farmers \u2014 were trying to get a sense from one another of how badly bee populations had been hit, how much each was charging per hive and how much they could increase that price for the next season. There was talk of disease, pesticides, drought, floods, suburban sprawl, parasites. They talked shop: Which menthol strips are you using to inoculate your bees? How often do you change the treatment-laced pad placed in the hive to keep your bees healthy? Are the wafers or quick strips more effective for mites? Where do you apply them in the box, and for how long? Does the medication affect the performance of the bees? Can you get rid of a mite infestation, or are preventive measures the only option?Pollination is a migratory practice now \u2014 more than two-thirds of America\u2019s honeybees are mobilized for pollinating almond trees, and most come from out-of-state apiaries. One slide from the Almond Board rep showed the path of beekeepers who transport their colonies in semi-trucks around the nation seasonally \u2014 bees winter in Texas and Florida, head to California for almonds, then often summer in cooler states like North and South Dakota, where beekeepers will rebuild their colonies by splitting hives and feeding their bees manufactured protein patties and natural forage. The Midwest used to provide weeds, wildflowers and alfalfa for native and domesticated bees alike, but in the last couple of decades much of this food source has disappeared. Drought and suburban sprawl leave beekeepers with less open acreage for their bees to forage.Last year, climate-intensified hurricanes and flooding along the Gulf Coast destroyed entire apiaries; they drowned blooms in Florida and led to the starvation of thousands of bees; wildfires in Santa Barbara and Ventura, Calif., killed more. And beekeepers need to worry not only about keeping their charges alive but also about keeping them from being stolen. Last year, just a few miles from Kerman, two men were arrested in association with what may be the largest bee heist ever, a three-year crime spree that added up to nearly a million dollars\u2019 worth of stolen bees. A preliminary hearing is set for November. When one defendant was caught at a local bee yard with stolen boxes, local newspapers and major media outlets had fun with the bee heist, lacing copy with inevitable puns about sting operations. But the reality for beekeepers and bees is much more grave.The worst of the woes is the Varroa mite, a pest that was identified in the mid-\u201980s. The mite has become increasingly associated with the spread of viruses, including deformed-wing virus. The size of a poppy seed, this parasite sucks blood from both adults and developing broods. Varroa leaves bees in a zombie state, unable to navigate.Lyle Johnston, a beekeeper and broker based in Colorado, described his methods for keeping colonies healthy: Feed them protein patties to make up for the lack of forage, and place menthol strips in the brood chamber in early fall to stave off mites. And always reserve some of the honey that bees produce to feed them come winter. He learned that last tip in the early \u201990s from Joe Traynor, a bee broker based in Bakersfield, who has been renting bees since 1959. The audience sat rapt. While most of Johnston\u2019s peers were losing 40 percent of their bees every season, Johnston said he was losing only 10 percent. \u201cUntil you have a mite collapse and your bees actually go down, you don\u2019t really learn how to treat for mites,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of guys go through hard times, get their butts kicked\u201d \u2014 losing thousands of colonies, sometimes all their bees.\u201cIf cattlemen lost 50 percent of their cows, you know people would do something and react,\u201d Chris Hiatt, vice president of the American Honey Producers Association, told me. \u201cBut since it\u2019s bees and everyone thinks we can just breed more, nothing\u2019s done. No one appreciates the stress we\u2019re under.\u201dNow they\u2019re transported to Florida to pollinate watermelons, to Washington State for cherries or apples, to Maine for blueberries. And to California for almonds \u2014 the largest managed pollination event in the world. California grows more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s almond supply. In 2014, the almond industry contributed $7.6 billion to California\u2019s economy and was responsible for more than 100,000 jobs. A record total of 1.3 million acres in the state were devoted to almond production last year, an increase of 7 percent from the previous year.The almond industry\u2019s bullish expansion is not without controversy. It takes one gallon of water to produce a single almond; almond cultivation requires water year-round in a state where residential water usage has been restricted and some rural communities don\u2019t have clean water at all.On a hot February afternoon in Chowchilla, about 45 minutes north of Fresno, Johnston pulled up to an orchard in bloom. The trees appeared from afar to be still, but they were in fact vibrating with activity. \u201cThe almond pollination is the Super Bowl of beekeeping,\u201d Johnston told me. His family has been in the bee business for 110 years. For decades, Johnston Honey Farms was primarily a business that sold honey. \u201cI\u2019d rather just do honey; it\u2019d be a lot less stress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to find another way to generate revenue. When I first started in the \u201980s, we were probably 80 percent honey, 20 percent pollination, and now it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d In recent years, American beekeepers have been finding it increasingly difficult to compete against cheaper honey from China. As a result, most beekeepers turn to pollination events \u2014 especially the almond season \u2014 to make ends meet.Many beekeeping operations are, like Johnston\u2019s, third- and fourth-generation businesses. Johnston always knew he would be a beekeeper \u2014 on his first day of school, he left during recess to go home and tend to the bees. \u201cDad had Mom take me right back to school, but there was no question I was always going to work in bees.\u201dAt 6-foot-5, Johnston towers over his hives, and he is scientific when it comes to his bees. He is beholden to his tiny insects, his mood dictated by their moods. Today they were happy, so he was happy. The bees, coated in pollen, flew from branch to hive and back again, with full pollen baskets, the part of the insect\u2019s legs where they store loads for their brood. The bees clustered at the bottom of each box, pushing to deposit their pollen into a cell where larvae would eventually emerge, expanding the colony\u2019s population. Johnston burned wood pellets in a gunny sack to work up mesquite smoke to pacify the bees, then pulled a frame out of one of his boxes. His bees looked fat and healthy and boisterous. A good beekeeper can immediately tell when a hive is unhealthy: The bees push to the outer edges of the frame as if they\u2019re trying to escape.Honeybees used for managed pollination are domesticated; they are actually considered by a number of states to be livestock. Without their human keepers, honeybees might have faced extinction decades ago, as some of their native counterparts are beginning to now. Three bumblebees are believed to have gone extinct already: Bombus rubriventris, Bombus melanopoda and Bombus franklini; the rusty-patched bumblebee was listed under the Endangered Species Act just last year. The threat to both managed and wild bees is considered serious enough that in 2015 President Barack Obama established a task force to promote the health of honeybees. Its report called upon the Department of Agriculture to track honeybee-colony loss and to restore millions of acres of land to pollinator habitat.At the potluck lunch, the Almond Board rep passed along a U.S.D.A. forecast that by 2020, 300,000 additional acres of almond trees would be blooming. Johnston said: \u201cThey\u2019ve tripled the acreage since I started, and I remember an old-time grower telling me this thing is all going to go down; when they get to 400,000 or 500,000 acres, this thing is going to collapse like a crater. He was totally wrong: They blew right past that, and they\u2019re going for more.\u201d The problem is that there aren\u2019t enough healthy bees to accommodate the growth of the almond industry.On a dry-erase board in an office in the back of a lab lined with experimental patches of wildflowers in the entomology department of U.C. Davis, the professor and researcher Neal Williams explained what he teaches to his undergraduate and graduate students and what he has found through decades of research. Pollinators can produce crops in a variety of ways \u2014 and sometimes, obviously, as nature intended, just by showing up. \u201cSome of the work we\u2019ve done is to determine whether some combination of wild bees with honeybees improves overall pollination,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf there is a synergy. If you want more pollination, you either need more bees or you need to make them better.\u201d Williams found that planting wildflowers increases pollination in two ways: It attracts native pollinators, which create competition in managed honeybees, and the wildflowers vary bees\u2019 nutritional intake. Several years ago, Williams conducted a study that monitored populations of bees for two consecutive seasons when growers planted wildflowers on the borders of their orchards. The results established that the wildflowers had not distracted honeybees from almond pollination.Farmers have worried that flowering plants compete for pollination with almond blossoms, so they\u2019re reluctant to allow for any other plantings. The bases of almond trees are usually stripped clean, with mounds of bare soil protecting the roots. To persuade growers to adopt new techniques, Williams and a colleague developed an algorithm to determine the exact cost-effective plants to suit the specific needs of each crop. But almond growers are reluctant to change standard practices, especially when there\u2019s financial risk involved.Nissen had been deployed by his broker, Joe Traynor, who was too busy during bee season to leave his office. For the first few months of every year, Traynor, 82, sends a flurry of emails to a list of all the beekeepers and brokers and scientists he has encountered \u2014 updates, research reports, weather forecasts and long-winded exchanges about the nature of bees. Sometimes he\u2019ll forward a poem \u2014 like the one he sent after frost threatened this year\u2019s crop written from the perspective of a farmer praying for rain and debating suicide. Traynor studied agriculture at U.C. Davis and by his own admission wasn\u2019t a great student. \u201cI got a C in economics at U.C.D. \u2014 all I learned was the law of supply and demand,\u201d he said. Now, after nearly 50 years of renting bees, the demand is wearing on him. He barely sleeps during almond season and spent hours creating aerial crop maps, color-coded to indicate which acres he\u2019s responsible for pollinating.At his office in downtown Bakersfield, Traynor shared his collection of bee research and theories on pollination. The hallway to his office was shedding paint; on his door, a simple brass plate read \u201cScientific Ag Co.,\u201d as if he were a private investigator. Inside the office \u2014 where he catches whatever sleep he can during the season \u2014 files, books and papers were stacked on every conceivable surface. Traynor\u2019s shy, studied demeanor shifts at the mention of bees. He becomes laser-focused. Every year, he gets the same anxiety about whether he\u2019ll have enough bees for his growers, whether his bees will perform, whether the almonds will set and how fast he can get the boxes out of the fields before farmers start working their crops with pesticides. There is a lot of tension between beekeepers and growers about timing. Once blooms are pollinated, growers will start spraying their orchards, and bees have to be removed quickly.That night 130 people gathered at the annual beekeepers\u2019 dinner Traynor hosts with Mike Mulligan, another area bee broker. A sudden frost had set in, and they stood around open-pit fires at Mulligan\u2019s house, adjacent to an almond orchard. Beekeepers and brokers and scientists talked about the same issues discussed at the meeting in Kerman a week earlier. How do we treat hives for Varroa mites? What do we do to feed our bees when there\u2019s no forage? How do we keep up with pollination? How can we raise prices if the frost affects almonds? How do we continue on as beekeepers without going broke? All the questions added up to one big question that hovers over every meeting and every dinner and every potluck: What is the future of bees?Mulligan stood in front of the crowd to say a prayer for friends and for the season. He talked about how at the beginning of pollination he was worried he would be short a thousand hives. \u201cThe bees aren\u2019t looking good, the weather is lousy, we just have to cancel,\u201d one of his beekeepers called and told him from Texas. Mulligan reminded himself of a passage from Philippians 4:6: \u201cDo not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.\u201d Within a couple of days, he made up the loss with last-minute hives from local keepers whose plans had fallen through and who needed to place their bees. Many other beekeepers short on hives did not have the same luck.Each year the beekeepers compare notes on whether to raise prices for pollination in the coming season \u2014 a decision that might depend on drought or frost or how big the almond crop would be. But one thing they didn\u2019t anticipate, back at that dinner in February, was a tariff war. Beekeepers are now negotiating contracts with almond growers for next season. This season\u2019s yield, which will be harvested in September, is projected to be a record crop. But trade disputes that have been initiated by the Trump administration are likely to affect most large-scale nut distributors, because both China and Europe are major buyers. If President Trump\u2019s policies are carried out, almonds sold to China will be subjected to an additional 15 percent retaliatory tariff starting Aug. 23.\u201cBeekeepers are pushed into the margins,\u201d said Randy Verhoek, former president of the American Honey Producers Association. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things we never imagined would even be a factor in beekeeping. We\u2019re just trying to do everything we can to keep them healthy, because there\u2019s nowhere to go. Where are we going to go?\u201d Verhoek, a migratory beekeeper based in Texas, has dealt with one almond grower in California for 17 years. This past season, he dropped 9,000 hives on 4,000 or so acres. He\u2019ll gross $1.4 million from pollinating almonds, but when I asked him about profits, he said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the problem with beekeepers; we don\u2019t crunch the numbers. We just put everything back in the business and hope we\u2019ll be here next year.\u201dJaime Lowe is a frequent contributor to the magazine and the author of \u201cMental.\u201d She previously wrote a feature about the incarcerated women who fight California wildfires.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was the U.S. Actually \u2018Built on Tariffs,\u2019 as Trump Says?", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact CheckWhat He SaidPresident Trump defended his trade policies on Wednesday, ambiguously claiming on Twitter that the United States was \u201cbuilt on Tariffs.\u201dOur Country was built on Tariffs, and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President. Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great U.S.A. No longer!The FactsAlthough it is unclear what era in United States history Mr. Trump was referring to, it was most likely the period starting in the late 19th century, from after the Civil War to before World War I, said Douglas A. Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.During this period, the country maintained high taxes on imports that effectively blocked manufactured goods from foreign countries, Professor Irwin said. At the same time, the United States had high levels of economic growth and industrialization.The country emerged from this period with a larger share of world exports, wrote Mr. Eckes, who served as chairman of the United States International Trade Commission under President Ronald Reagan.\u201cIn the 19th century,\u201d he added, \u201cMany public and elected officials thought \u2018protectionism\u2019 an accolade, not a slur.\u201dBut Professor Irwin argued that correlation does not necessarily mean causation in this case. \u201cIt\u2019s utterly simplistic,\u201d he said of the argument. \u201cWhen you look more deeply into it, it was really other factors driving growth in that period.\u201dThose alternative explanations include the spread of technology like railroads and the telegraph, as well as a labor force expanding because of an influx of immigrants.However, at certain points in history, tariffs did provide for a vast majority of government funding.But that is mostly because the size of the federal government was a fraction of what it would become in later years, Professor Irwin said. At that time in early United States history, the nascent government didn\u2019t need much more than that.Then, as expenditures ballooned during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln imposed excise and income taxes to add revenue. In the decades after the war, tariffs generated less than half of government revenue, according to congressional records.In the modern era, Mr. Trump\u2019s recent tariffs on steel and aluminum were mostly meant to boost domestic industry after what the president believes to be \u201cdecades of unfair trade and bad policy\u201d with foreign countries. But in an early 19th-century fashion, Mr. Trump has claimed that the tariffs would help the United States pay off its national debt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riz Ahmed Acts His Way Out of Every Cultural Pigeonhole", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "From HBO to \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to Shakespeare, he has discovered how to excel beyond tidy genres.He arrived a few minutes late, speed-walking toward me in apologetic haste and grabbing my hand with enthusiasm. He was dressed in a gray kurta-inspired top, black slacks and a perfectly disheveled royal blue jacket with the sleeves rolled to midforearm \u2014 an ensemble that, along with the suede baseball cap pulled low over his eyes, gave him the look of a very well-read semiretired pro skateboarder. Onscreen his presence can be almost comically malleable \u2014 he can come across as pliant or stalwart, frank or cagey \u2014 but in person there is a distinct and direct energy to him, a keenness bubbling under the surface.It comes out not only in how he talks but also in what he talks about. Tribalism, for example, which we explored at length over breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong instinct,\u201d he told me from across the table at a crowded Fort Greene restaurant. \u201cAnd that can be a really healthy instinct. The organization of marginalized groups relies on tribalism, to some extent. If you\u2019re trying to move uphill against injustice, I can understand that. But when you\u2019re already at the top of the mountain, tribalism is just a way of [expletive] on people and excluding them from power.\u201dOr the Mughal Empire, with which he has found himself low-key obsessed of late, and on which he just might, if you\u2019re open to it, deliver a full-throated disquisition. \u201cUnder the Mughals, you have this multicultural empire, which is basically Muslims, Hindu majority, and there\u2019s a certain pragmatism that comes from ... \u201d \u2014 here he stopped, midthesis, to re-form his thoughts \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a mongrel empire, it\u2019s a multicultural empire, and they intermarry between Hindus and Muslims. It\u2019s like a pragmatism emerges when you have to abandon the idea of purity or a monolith, where it\u2019s like, we just present things as they are. Then you start getting realistic depictions as opposed to idealized depictions. ... \u201dOn an intellectual flight like this, Ahmed seems self-assured, fueled by his knowledge and his quest for more of it. There are other moments when he feels, still, completely powerless. Like when it emerges that people are calling him a Renaissance man \u2014 which, of course, he hates. But why? He does, in fact, excel at a lot of different things. He has become a go-to actor for unique secondary characters in Hollywood spectacles, like the \u201cStar Wars\u201d film \u201cRogue One,\u201d the Jason Bourne film \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and the forthcoming Marvel film \u201cVenom.\u201d He has won an Emmy for his devastating lead role as an American Muslim railroaded by the criminal-justice system in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d in which he mesmerized audiences with his evolution from delicate na\u00efvet\u00e9 to delicate violence without ever seeming to change the expression on his face. Hollywood appears to be fully buying in: In addition to \u201cVenom,\u201d Ahmed stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the macabre western comedy \u201cThe Sisters Brothers,\u201d opening this month; he is in preproduction for the title role in a \u201cHamlet\u201d adaptation that will appear on Netflix; and he has created and sold the sweeping multigenerational immigrant-epic series \u201cEnglistan\u201d to the BBC, with preproduction set to begin soon.As if that weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s also one half of the critically acclaimed, if niche, rap duo Swet Shop Boys and a solo artist whose 2006 song \u201cPost 9/11 Blues,\u201d released in the wake of the 7/7 attacks in London, was banned by some English radio stations for being too controversial. He is an Oxford graduate, a classically trained actor and maybe the only person I\u2019ve ever seen recite a poem on an American late-night show to thunderous applause. The poem, called \u201cSour Times,\u201d was delivered two nights after Heather Heyer was killed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., and it sparked a miniwar on the Facebook page for \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d over whether Fallon was divisive for introducing politics into his show.This is another thing Ahmed takes issue with: being called political. \u201cA lot of mainstream movies, they\u2019re steeped in their perspective,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery story, every decision, who you prioritize, what your perspective is. That\u2019s what your politics is.\u201d He wonders too why some artists have their work labeled political while others don\u2019t. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to express yourself authentically, doing that becomes somehow perceived as a struggle, as picking a fight. When really I\u2019m just going from A to B. It\u2019s like Ferris Bueller\u2019s going from A to B.\u201dI ask him what that means.\u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s just lawless out here, man!\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just a white dude skipping class and being lawless.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him, \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d And then I repeat the sentence, word for word, because it\u2019s not true: I don\u2019t actually see what he\u2019s saying. It will be at least 24 hours before I see what he\u2019s saying.At Merchant Taylors\u2019 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the face of \u2014 well, wait. Ahmed pauses here, breaking the flow of our interview, his voice dropping half an octave: He\u2019s conscious of the fact that he\u2019s told these stories before, and he doesn\u2019t want to bore me, or come across like ... you know. Not at all, I remind him, but he pauses before going on \u2014 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the formerly white face of private education. There he witnessed and experienced racism from students and teachers. \u201cThe teacher would be talking about evolution and would just wander over and stand next to the one black kid in class, gesturing to him.\u201d It made an impression. He also found himself immersed in the stuffy, old-white-man literature that would, against his better judgment, affect him forever. Literature like the now corny World War I poems he had to study, about \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land,\u201d the empty, apocalyptic, unclaimed space between enemy trenches where no humans belonged. Verses like:That kind of stuff, likewise, stuck with him.He also had inspirational teachers who encouraged his talent and curiosity and, I\u2019m guessing, insatiable energy. Teachers like Mr. Roseblade, whom Ahmed describes as seeming, even at the time, like something out of an inspirational high school movie: \u201cHe was this Jewish guy from the north, this English teacher who spoke Punjabi. He just took a lot of those kids under his wing and made us realize, like: \u2018Look, you\u2019ve got to get these credits. You\u2019ve got to go and join the debating society. Otherwise, you ain\u2019t gonna be able to get into a good university. Because you\u2019re not on the rugby team, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019\u2009\u201dLast year, many years removed from Mr. Roseblade\u2019s class, Ahmed found himself standing before the House of Commons, having been selected to deliver the second annual Channel 4 lecture on diversity in media. In his speech, clear and eloquent, he delivered a warning. Either let English people like him participate fully in English society, or they might just go do it with ISIS. \u201cIn the mind of the ISIS recruit, he\u2019s a version of James Bond, right?\u201d Ahmed asked the assembled members. \u201cHave you seen some of those ISIS propaganda videos? They are cut like action movies. Where is the counternarrative? Where are we telling these kids that they can be heroes in our stories, that they are valued?\u201d In watching the footage, something struck me about it: Ahmed was using the word \u201cwe\u201d to describe the country that colonized his ancestors.\u201c\u2009\u2018We\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 changes and shifts constantly,\u201d he conceded when I asked him about it. \u201cThat was my biggest experience going to Merchant Taylors\u2019. Extreme code switching. The most confusing conversation is to have to talk about the colonization of our continents.\u201d We laughed a little at the ridiculousness of sentences like \u201cwe colonized us,\u201d or \u201cwe took us into slavery.\u201d But then his face turned serious. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are. We are the inheritors of the scars of Empire, but also the spoils of Empire. And that kind of inside/outside state is totally ingrained in us. Which is why, at a time like now, where everybody\u2019s being asked to pick a side, everything is binary, it\u2019s a confusing time to be us.\u201dWe were sharing food, which he had all but insisted on. I had been a tad unsure about it, not certain that it was entirely professional to be digging into a subject\u2019s meal minutes after we met. But he seemed hampered by no such considerations. \u201cGet in there, bro,\u201d he said, gesturing to his plate in between discussions of whether or not people of color can be gentrifiers (his black female optician did not think so) and whether or not N.W.A. was, by any definition, \u201cconscious rap\u201d (an argument can be made, perhaps). I felt aware of a duality. On one hand, I was a professional reporter, trying my best to look as if I belonged where I was, doing what I was doing: sharp questions, clear thinking, research prepared. On the other hand, I was a black American man hanging out with a British-Pakistani man in a white cafe in what used to be a black neighborhood, chopping it up at a high level. On the third hand, I was a writer for a national magazine sharing a platform with an international film star while we talked about all the serpentine machinations of oppression and how they\u2019ve woven and buried themselves in the very flesh of our lives. To dig haphazardly into his plate of quinoa or not?Instead, we were interrupted by something else. Beside us on the road there appeared a battered black jeep, on monster tires, with huge steer horns glued to either side of the hood. And a shark\u2019s fin coming from the roof. And radioactivity stickers. And what seemed like a thousand headlights. And a personalized license plate that read \u201cMOVE AWAY.\u201d And while I was thinking, \u201cLOL, New York, amirite? Back to my interview,\u201d Ahmed was saying, \u201cPete\u201d \u2014 our driver\u2019s name, which he had clearly made a point of remembering \u2014 \u201cpull up next to him, and let\u2019s see exactly who this is. Let\u2019s have a little chat quickly.\u201d Pete obliged.We pulled up, only to find the vehicle was being driven by an Orthodox Jew.\u201cWhoa!\u201d we said, all three of us, at precisely the same time. None of us saw that coming.Now Ahmed had to talk to him.Man: \u201cI chase them.\u201dMore was revealed. The man was French. He\u2019d been in the States for five years, along with his brother. They were children\u2019s entertainers, performers and low-key stuntmen and were in the process of making a kids\u2019 DVD that was based, somehow, on this Zombie Proof jeep. (Their act is called \u201cThe Twins From France,\u201d and they are available for bar mitzvahs.)After the light turned green and we\u2019d gone our separate ways, Ahmed was glowing, bouncing and rocking in the back seat. \u201cNone of you expected that!\u201d he was yelling. \u201cNone of you expected it!\u201d He seemed to consider the incongruousness of the whole scene something of a personal victory.And he was right: I was not expecting it. I was quietly thinking about how sure I\u2019d been that, if we pulled up alongside that truck, I\u2019d see, somewhere on its body or its driver, a Confederate flag.As we crawled through Midtown traffic, the conversation turned to music, a topic by which Riz Ahmed is perpetually enchanted, and as he schooled me on the history of the U.K. garage and jungle scenes, I watched him transform from a political thinker to an excited dorm-room music bro. He made me listen to the track he claims was most seminal to his entire worldview: \u201cOriginal Nuttah,\u201d by Shy FX featuring UK Apachi. It is a song better heard than described. Suffice it to say that in the early 1990s, British-Jamaicans started singing reggae melodies and rocking the mic over absurdly sped-up beats, and the results were as manic as they were marvelous. Except UK Apachi was not Jamaican. His father was Iraqi, and his mother was Indian and South African. Abdul Wahab was a British Muslim who grew up getting called \u201cPaki\u201d and eventually aligned himself with whatever his conception was of Native Americans to create a persona doing British-Jamaican music. And it was fire.Dunham took an interest in the actor after seeing his performances in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d and in \u201cFour Lions,\u201d a dark comedy about a group of men trying, ineptly, to commit an act of terrorism; she calls it \u201cas iconic and cozy a comedy as \u2018Wedding Crashers.\u2019\u2009\u201d Ahmed, she says, takes his work seriously: \u201cHe\u2019s such an academic.\u201d She remembers how, in preparation for his time on \u201cGirls,\u201d he researched surfing, scouted the Montauk area and used an American accent through all five days of shooting. \u201cThen at the end we wrapped, and he was, like, \u2018Alroight, bruv, see you lata, bruv,\u2019 back into his rude-boy deal. And people felt, like, betrayed \u2014 like, \u2018We partied with him, we danced with him, we went out for lobster with him, he spoke in an American accent the whole time!\u2019\u2009\u201d She also tells me about the time she fell ill, and he left a dinner with \u2014 she thinks \u2014 like, Salman Rushdie, just to sit by her hospital bed and talk until she fell asleep. \u201cHe\u2019s a very tenderhearted person,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to forget, because he has the bravado of someone in the hip-hop world and the intensity of someone who\u2019s an activist.\u201dWe had come to the Met because, in addition to being a rapper and an actor and a budding producer, Ahmed has also been spending his Sundays in one-on-one study sessions with Navina Haidar, a curator in the Met\u2019s department of Islamic art. She led us upstairs, past various security doors and card scanners and cloistered offices into a small, cool conference room. The walls were lined with reproductions of Islamic art from eras spanning the last thousand years. While we waited to begin, Ahmed stepped out for a moment, and Haidar confided in me about why she agreed to spend her Sundays talking art with this particular movie star. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, a moral core. And he\u2019s intellectually very active and quite creative, and curious and very dedicated to what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Ahmed returned, but she didn\u2019t stop; instead, she just turned her praise to him. \u201cIt\u2019s been very impressive to see how you have been really dedicated to wanting to learn about this, and to have these tutorials, and really explore the subject in depth. That commitment, I think, is really inspiring for me as a curator.\u201d Ahmed kept his eyes down, scanning the page in front of him, while she lavished him with praise, and then, when she was done, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a G.\u201dSometime around 1600, in the Ottoman court of what is now Turkey, a book was created. Perhaps it is better described as an album. In fact, it is often called the Bellini Album, after the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, who served as a point of cultural connection between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and whose portrait of Mehmet II hangs in the National Gallery in London. (He also created an image of \u201cthe East\u201d for \u201cthe West\u201d and as such was, in a sense, ground zero for Orientalism.) The complete origins of the Bellini Album are not entirely known. Experts suggest it cannot be attributed to Bellini himself but speculate it was so named because of the European art scattered throughout, some of which was once rumored to be Bellini\u2019s work.The album is, in essence, a scrapbook, each page featuring a form or piece of art, from sources all over the Ottoman Empire and beyond \u2014 Persian calligraphy, an ink-and-watercolor goose attributed to China, collages of devotional scenes attributed to Italy and the Netherlands. On one page, you find a painting of a person falling into a well; on another, a peacock whose tail is actually calligraphy, and whose calligraphy is actually a poem. There is even a page on which the disembodied head of Jesus appears on what may be the Veil of Veronica. Each page is itself a meditation on adornment, with the image in the center hemmed by borders of intricate flowers and the detailed marbling of lapis lazuli and rose. All of it without an owner, all of it a mashup of something prior. If visual symbology were music, then the Bellini Album would be a mixtape.What made that transition particularly tough for Ahmed was that, in the \u201990s, it seemed to him that British South Asians were enjoying a kind of aspirational freedom. The economy was good. It was O.K. to live well. The South Asian sketch-comedy show \u201cGoodness Gracious Me\u201d was enjoying huge success. South Asian culture was rippling into U.K. music, as well, in genres like bhangra and jungle and with pop acts like Cornershop. There was something of a multicultural moment for British South Asians. Growing up, Ahmed believed that the flag of Britain should and would obviously include him.But he soon found himself at Oxford University, just after 9/11 \u2014 a brown kid surrounded by the acolytes of seemingly ancient white wealth, who sometimes did have a way of talking to him as if he were a shopkeeper. Rather than retreating into Oxford, he decided to make Oxford come to him. He started organizing parties that celebrated his music and cultural touchstones, parties where he would get on the mic over drum \u2019n\u2019 bass records. Soon enough, the event he co-founded, \u201cHit and Run,\u201d moved to Manchester and became one of the city\u2019s leading underground music events. Ahmed also performed as a vocalist with a 12-member jazz/electro/drum \u2019n\u2019 bass ensemble called \u201cConfidential Collective.\u201dHe invited me back to the apartment he was subletting in Fort Greene, in a spacious brownstone with hardwood floors and sunny high ceilings. There was at least one other roommate floating around. It seemed strange to think that Riz Ahmed had just found a room sublet on Craigslist, or whatever, but that seemed to be the case. He wanted me to hear music \u2014 not the music he was making, necessarily, but the music he was thinking about, that was inspiring him.He also looked for connections between the two of us, adroitly comparing and contrasting the black American experience and the British-Pakistani one. The quest for him, it seemed, was to prove that although people have a hard time seeing certain things as connected, reality has a much more expansive view. \u201cHis thing\u201d is to make everything his thing. Or perhaps that\u2019s not quite right: He is not out to co-opt the world to him. Rather, he is looking to elbow out a space for himself in the world, to prove that it should exist.I asked him what kind of art he liked the most in the Islamic collection. It was not the meticulously crafted objects, carved by hand, floral patterns seeming to move as fluids, and it wasn\u2019t the deeply attentive nature drawings, each barb of the feather\u2019s vane painted with microscopic care, sometimes by a brush made, according to legend, with a single hair. These he found beautiful. But they were not his favorites; the miniatures were. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my own weird way of looking at things,\u201d he told me at the museum, \u201cbut what I really appreciate about lots of miniatures and lots of things like this is, you get a God\u2019s-eye view. You get the schematic.\u201d Details are nice. But for him the best way to see anything is to see everything.In an odd way it made me reflect on \u201cCashmere,\u201d the first LP from Ahmed\u2019s Swet Shop Boys project. (His opposite number in that duo, Himanshu Suri, is from Queens, and sounds like it; Ahmed is from London, and sounds like it; and yet somehow they also sound like they\u2019re from South Asia, only by way of Jamaica, and also by way of a sweat-filled Brixton rave in 1999, and finally by way of a musty bedroom, a lone red lamp, a laptop and a severe lack of sleep.) On this album, Ahmed wrote a song, \u201cHalf Moghul Half Mowgli,\u201d the title perhaps a reference to the British-Indian singer Susheela Raman\u2019s 2003 fusion track \u201cHalf Shiva Half Shakti.\u201d In it, he delivers three verses mostly about not quite fitting in anywhere \u2014 or, depending on how you look at it, fitting in just a little everywhere.The first two are straightforward evocations of his past: \u201cMy only heroes were black rappers/So to me, Tupac was a true Paki.\u201d On the third, though, he does something different. He addresses himself from four different perspectives, four different ways he is interpreted and received, attacked and praised. First there\u2019s the grateful South Asian fan (\u201cOur young ones need someone like you to look up to\u201d). Then he embodies the voice of someone calling him a \u201cterrorist Paki\u201d and a weak rapper. Then comes a young rap fan, saluting him in a mix of Asian and Caribbean argots (\u201cSalaam, wagwan bruv\u201d) and says \u201cbecause of you I went to uni\u201d \u2014 and, last, a disgruntled elder who warns him that he\u2019s going to hell \u201cfor the sex and the swearing\u201d and should obey the Quran. All of this in one dizzying verse, each voice rushing in to replace the last.The first time I heard this, it struck me so deeply that I paused the song and sat quietly. The verse was simple: It was just four different ways people look at you. But the reason it unraveled something so deeply inside of me was that it also represented four different ways you can look at yourself. All completely opposite one another, and completely isolated, and yet completely validated by the world you live in. And when there are so many versions of self, maybe the only way to maintain safety is to develop a view that can see, literally, everything.A few weeks later, we met in Boston. Ahmed was running late, having spent all day on the set of the forthcoming film \u201cThe Sound of Metal.\u201d In it, he plays a rock drummer who is losing his hearing. He had been learning sign language, practicing drumming and, as he does, just generally molding himself into the role \u2014 or rather, accessing the part of him that already was the role.Ahmed is still doing independent films, because he loves the genre, loves the work. But he is also hoping for bigger and bigger opportunities. He has talked about playing James Bond, if for no other reason than the sense of arrival such a casting would represent \u2014 an acceptance of the fact that Riz Ahmed, in all his contradictory glory, is in no way a contradiction. He is a human and a Brit and capable of being seen as a hero.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Think There Are Too Many Bars in Your Neighborhood? You\u2019re Not Alone", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA resident of Inwood testified to trash-strewn streets and violence in her corner of Manhattan, while a woman from the Upper West Side lamented the departure of a shoemaker and barbershop. A man from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, complained that his community was \u201coverrun.\u201dAbout 50 people gathered on the Lower East Side of Manhattan this spring to discuss a common villain they said was causing problems in their neighborhoods: the rising number of bars in New York City. Then they pointed to the New York State Liquor Authority, accusing the agency of issuing too many liquor licenses and eroding their quality of life.\u201cThe S.L.A. is less concerned with the public welfare and more concerned with granting licenses to bar owners,\u201d Diem Boyd, who helped organize the meeting, said afterward. \u201cWe\u2019re at a critical point.\u201dA spokesman for the State Liquor Authority, William Crowley, offered a different perspective, saying: \u201cThe S.L.A. takes a balanced approach in our review process, weighing the merits of the individual application, while placing substantial weight on the recommendations of residents, community boards and elected officials.\u201dThere is little doubt that liquor licenses can reshape a neighborhood. To the State Liquor Authority, bars and restaurants are \u201ca vital part of the city\u2019s economy.\u201d Critics say that a flood of drinking spots can turn neighborhoods into unruly entertainment zones, hasten gentrification and make streets less safe.Block associations and other groups have long fought licenses one at a time.But now a new coalition, Neighborhoods United, which held the spring meeting, is focusing on their cumulative impact and beginning a campaign to limit new licenses based on a 25-year-old state statute.The law forbids the State Liquor Authority from issuing a liquor license to any premises within 500 feet of three existing licensed establishments \u2014 unless the authority consults a community board or a municipality, holds a hearing, finds that the license would be in the public interest, and records its reasons.The State Liquor Authority has written that the so-called 500-foot rule \u201cclearly creates a presumption that the license should not be issued.\u201d At the same time, coalition members say the authority has improperly placed the burden on the community to prove that an exception should not be granted.The authority rarely gives specific reasons for its exceptions, the coalition said.Last week the coalition, which has 36 member groups from across the city, began sending letters to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and other officials with recommendations, including \u201cstrict enforcement\u201d of the 500-foot rule, a greater number of state inspectors and a uniform process to inform the public of license applications.\u201cThe saturation of liquor licenses and irresponsible nightlife-driven establishments are turning many neighborhoods into \u2018night life malls,\u2019\u201d the letter said. \u201cAt stake is the rich cultural diversity and vibrant mix of neighborhoods that define N.Y.C.\u201dNot everyone sees the licensing process as too lax. Robert S. Bookman, of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group, said he thought it gave the public too great a voice in opposing licenses.\u201cIf the 500-foot law was to be interpreted to be an absolute ban, then there would be no restaurant row, no Times Square,\u201d he wrote in an email message.Gripes about rowdy bar-goers are nothing new, but the number of licenses in the city allowing bars, clubs, restaurants and hotels to sell liquor has risen to 7,616 this year from 5,391 in 2000, according to figures from the State Liquor Authority, an increase of 41 percent. (When beer and wine are included, there are nearly 12,000 licenses in the city.)In some neighborhoods, particularly those that have seen significant real estate development, the increase is palpable.The 11101 ZIP code in Queens, which covers Long Island City and part of Astoria, has 94 establishments with liquor licenses today, up from 40 in 2000. The 10002 ZIP code on the Lower East Side grew to 175 from 41. And the 11211 ZIP code, in Williamsburg, leapt to 238 from 40.The 500-foot rule was adopted in 1993 after an alcohol-fueled brawl led to the fatal shootings of an off-duty police officer and another man on Bell Boulevard in Queens, where two dozen bars lined an eight-block strip. The State Liquor Authority allows the approval of licenses after hearings when \u201cthere is no community opposition and no other reason for disapproval.\u201dHearing reports obtained through Freedom of Information requests by coalition members and their allies provided a window into that decision making process. They showed that applicants often said licenses would benefit the public by creating jobs and tax revenue.Neighborhood residents often did not attend hearings, the reports showed. Community boards sometimes failed to register their opinions. At other times, community boards supported applicants who agreed to operating restrictions.When elected officials or a community board opposes the license, decisions are referred to the State Liquor Authority \u201cfull board,\u201d which has granted exceptions even in cases where up to 30 to 40 other licensed establishments were within 500 feet.State Liquor Authority reports showed that in August 2017 there were 80 hearings at the agency\u2019s New York City office for applicants seeking exceptions. Administrative law judges for the authority found that 70 of those showed that a license would be in the public interest. And records indicated that the State Liquor Authority eventually reached the same conclusion for seven of the remaining 10 applicants.The State Liquor Authority spokesman, Mr. Crowley, wrote that elected officials and others will support applicants even when a community board does not. He added that some applications scrutinized under the 500-foot rule have been for new businesses replacing licensed businesses at the same location.Critics of the exceptions often cite the Lower East Side, where noisy and sometimes disorderly throngs are drawn to a three-by-three-block section with about 50 premises serving liquor.On a recent Saturday night there, a 17-year resident, Tom Cole, watched as shouts from revelers blended with bleating car horns and music leaking from bars. Long lines formed in front of some establishments. Groups roamed, or staggered, arm in arm. Some people sipped their drinks while standing outside.\u201cIt\u2019s like being inside a college fraternity party,\u201d Mr. Cole said. \u201cThis has become one of the most popular parts of the city, and that\u2019s what has turned it into one of the most hellish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What The Source Taught Me", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe hip-hop magazine was edited by black editors, for black readers. And it turned me into a philosopher. Mr. Ware grew up reading The Source and writes about hip-hop for Slate and The Root. As the only child of a strict, black, Baptist mother, I was not allowed to listen to music that she believed was not made for the purposes of \u201clifting up the name of Jesus.\u201d To her, the songs of Prince and Motown would inevitably lead me down the path to lasciviousness. (Yes, she used words like that.) The magazine was my only portal into the world of hip-hop. It taught me that the genre was more than just \u201cthug\u201d music, as pastors had admonished during church. It was a culture worthy of writing about. Chuck D of Public Enemy called hip-hop CNN for black people. That\u2019s true of some of the music, but I found a number of artists to be more philosophers than documentarians. As a kid, I was attracted to anything with catchy rhymes spoken over a fun beat. However, as I got older, The Source taught me that not all music was created equal. A mediocre rapper can merely rhyme over a beat and entertain those within earshot; but a great M.C. uses lyrical content and flow to create a sonic atmosphere that transforms the listener. The Source argued that commercial success should not be the only standard by which we judge black music. Instead, we must pay attention to how the community for which it was made receives the artists and their work. This allowed readers to stop obsessively seeking white validation for black art. The impassioned arguments in the magazine about who was the best rapper and which albums deserved a coveted five-mic rating helped me develop as a black critical thinker. The magazine taught me that merely having an opinion about music was not enough. One had to think about black art with an appreciation of history and an eye for originality. In the wake of the magazine\u2019s declining influence, and amid the democratizing power of social media, we have entered an \u201call-new hip-hop is the greatest hip-hop ever\u201d milieu. I long for when we had an established black institution, beloved by artists and fans, that was serious about the preservation and aesthetic interpretation of black culture. Black art is as popular as it has ever been. I wish only that we had more places like The Source to help us properly interpret it. Let my mother tell it, The Source turned me into a heathen who listened to worldly music, but I still don\u2019t think she appreciates how it turned me into a philosopher, too.

{"Headline": "Top C.E.O.s Denounce Trump Immigration Policy as Threat to U.S. Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDozens of American business leaders are challenging the Trump administration over changes to immigration policy that they say threaten the livelihoods of thousands of their skilled foreign workers, and the nation\u2019s economic growth and competitiveness as well.Some of the most prominent chief executives in the United States signed the letter, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Laurence Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Indra Nooyi, the departing head of PepsiCo.Business leaders have praised President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and rolling back of many regulations. But they have deplored some of his statements and some of his administration\u2019s actions, including on immigration.With their letter on Wednesday, the group\u2019s members took issue with a series of immigration enforcement guidelines that they said were \u201carbitrary and inconsistent\u201d and created new and unnecessary hurdles for skilled foreigners working in the United States.The changes, the letter stated, were \u201ccausing considerable anxiety for many thousands of our employees while threatening to disrupt company operations.\u201dThe business group\u2019s complaint focused on new guidelines and practices by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security that vets visa applications and administers immigration policy.The letter\u2019s main focus was the treatment of applications for, and renewals of, H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The visas are used by companies to hire computer engineers and other professionals.As a result of the changes, there has been a sharp increase in the number of denials and requests for more information. A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan policy research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions had increased 41 percent in the government\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, compared with the third quarter.Government examiners\u2019 requests for additional information on H-1B visa applications tripled in the same period. The government\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter began in July 2017, a few months after Mr. Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order.The Trump administration, experts said, was using the government\u2019s regulatory apparatus, which it has so often scorned, to serve its policy goal of clamping down on the flow of foreign workers into America.\u201cStep up investigations, slow things down, and you can accomplish your policy goals without legislation,\u201d said Hal Salzman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University.In response to the business leaders\u2019 letter, the immigration service said in a statement on Thursday that the administration had been \u201crelentlessly pursuing necessary immigration reforms that move towards a merit-based system.\u201d It added that it handles all applications and petitions \u201cfairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis.\u201dThe H-1B program was created to provide a pathway for talented foreigners whose special skills were expected to strengthen the American economy. Today, the nation\u2019s technology hubs are filled with H-1B alumni who have become entrepreneurs, executives, venture capitalists and, quite often, United States citizens.In recent years, however, the visa program has been criticized because corporations, especially Indian technology outsourcing companies, have exploited legal loopholes in the H-1B regime to replace American workers and shift jobs out of the United States. The immigration service has said its increased scrutiny and enforcement actions were intended to strengthen \u201cprotections to combat H-1B abuses.\u201dBut to the business leaders, the policies are vague and capricious, creating uncertainty for their workers and in company operations. For example, the group\u2019s letter stated, \u201ccompanies now do not know whether a work visa petition that was approved last month will be approved when the company submits the identical application to extend the employee\u2019s status.\u201dA particular concern, the business leaders said, was that the immigration service was expected to revoke work eligibility for spouses of H-1B visa holders. The spouses, they said, are often highly skilled workers who have built careers in America.\u201cRevoking their U.S. work authorization,\u201d the letter said, \u201cwill likely cause high-skilled immigrants to take their skills to competitors outside the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He remains in jail at least until Sept. 11, when he will have a hearing on a bail request that was filed this week.Human rights organizations, as well as journalism and photography groups, have loudly protested his imprisonment.

It\u2019s a lot for any one person and it\u2019s a lot for a party,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be kind of shocked if it came to that.\u201dTheir growth is due not just to the failure of Mr. Sanders campaign, but to what many Greens see as the success of Ms. Stein\u2019s, which raised three times as much money, $3.4 million, and got over three times as many votes as she did in 2012. She appeared on the ballot in 45 states, the most ever for a Green nominee, and won over 1.4 million votes, or roughly one percent.Last month, 175 Green Party activists from more than 40 states gathered at the University of Utah for their annual conference, where they dined on pizza alongside students in the cafeteria, placed bids on secondhand sci-fi books and homemade wine at a silent auction, and discussed their dream of implementing eco-socialism and ranked choice voting.But the most pressing matter was the midterm elections, which for them are an important first step in the 2020 presidential campaign. Under the state-by-state patchwork of ballot access laws, Green candidates need to win enough votes in November, generally between one and five percent, to secure a spot on the presidential ballot in most states.Party leaders said they expected to field at least 224 candidates for a variety of offices in 32 states this year. There are already 155 elected officials nationwide who are Greens, most of them serving in local offices like city councils or on school boards.But because the party does not accept money from corporations, unions or political action committees it has never won the kind of race that takes deep pockets, like governor or anything at the federal level. There is no indication that is about to change.But that has not deterred candidates like Mr. Mejia, Mr. Cortes Barragan and Ms. Moxley, who are running for Congress armed with little more than shoestring budgets and the strength of their convictions.As far as New Jersey is concerned, Ms. Moxley said she thought \u201cthere really is no difference now\u201d between the Democrats and the Republicans. That sentiment is not shared by Democrats and Republicans, but at the Green Party convention Ms. Moxley was not alone in that belief. Even in the age of President Trump \u2014 whom they concede may be uniquely hostile to their principles \u2014 there are many Greens who squint to see the difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.\u201cThey are not different enough to save your job, to save the climate, to save the economy and to save the peace,\u201d said Ms. Stein. \u201cThe reality is we are going further and further over the edge here, whether it is a Democrat or a Republican, and it\u2019s not as if Hillary would have stopped this slide into catastrophe.\u201dThe Democratic Party loomed large over the Green conference, where attendees ruminated over the many ways they claimed the Democrats had slighted or sabotaged them over the years.And last November, the Senate Intelligence Committee requested documents from the Stein campaign as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the election.Ms. Stein also blames \u201cDemocratic operatives\u201d for years of unfavorable coverage in the news media. And, of course, there is the word that irks the Greens more than any other: \u201cspoiler.\u201dGreens bristle at the \u201cspoiler\u201d accusation, which they say ignores poll data that suggested many of Ms. Stein\u2019s 2016 supporters either would not have voted if she had not been on the ballot or would have voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cCandidates have to earn votes, they don\u2019t own votes,\u201d Ms. Stein said. \u201cThat in a nutshell is the problem with the Democrats, it\u2019s the arrogance of thinking they own the system.\u201dWhile the Green Party and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party share a great deal of common ground, the Greens express a mix of grand idealism and grim cynicism: they believe American society is capable of revolutionary change, but the Democratic Party is not.Gloria Mattera, one of the party\u2019s co-chairpersons, said she doubted that the enthusiasm currently propelling the Democratic Party\u2019s left flank would lead to a lasting change in its priorities.\u201cI don\u2019t think one or two wins around the country in a Democratic primary should be dismissed, but they\u2019re not a revolution inside the party, either,\u201d said Ms. Mattera. \u201cThe Democrats will eat their own young, if you ask me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Cheers as Erdogan Takes On U.S. Over Sanctions", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 In their recent encounter at the NATO summit meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Trump gave each other a fist-bump, as Mr. Trump declared, \u201cI like him, I like him.\u201dCombative politics is written in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s DNA, one Turkish columnist explained, and for that matter, it seems, in Mr. Trump\u2019s. Indeed, according to diplomats, the several phone calls that have taken place between the two men this year have been stormy.In the nationalistic mood of the moment, many Turks have even applauded Mr. Erdogan\u2019s riposte.Across the spectrum, Turkish politicians, despite their deep divisions, took a united front against the United States for freezing the assets of the Turkish interior and justice ministers last week.Most of the opposition parties in the Parliament condemned the United States sanctions in a joint statement, and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other business organizations denounced the sanctions by the United States.The Ceyhan municipal council, in Turkey\u2019s southern province of Adana, announced that it had revoked its sister-city status with Frisco, Tex., because of the dispute.\u201cI have my own company and dollar affects almost our entire business,\u201d said a Twitter post by Erkan Babur, an engineer from Tokat, a province in the Black Sea region, and a local executive member of the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party. \u201cBut we are not born as bosses from our mothers. And it is not the dollar that made us the boss.\u201d\u201cWe will close down our company if necessary and paint shoes, sell bagels, thanks to God, but never make Turkey bait for you,\u201d he added.Newspapers, most of them now under control of businessmen close to the president, took fiercely anti-American stances as well.\u201cKnow your limits, U.S.,\u201d said one headline in the daily Milliyet. Even the newspaper S\u00f6zc\u00fc, an aggressive nationalist opponent of Mr. Erdogan, called on the government not to bow its head. \u201cStand tall, that\u2019s enough for us,\u201d one headline read.Even before Mr. Erdogan ordered matching sanctions on Saturday against two American officials, some analysts had predicted that he would escalate the dispute.Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, predicted an \u201cirrational response from Ankara.\u201d\u201cHalf of Turkey, including many in Erdogan\u2019s circles, has drunk the Kool-Aid and believes that Erdogan is under attack (by his domestic and foreign adversaries) because he\u2019s out to make Turkey great again,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay wrote in a text message.Kemal Can, writing in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, said much of the dispute was driven by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s personal style.\u201cSometimes a cunning tradesman, sometimes a stubborn toughness, sometimes glowering, sometimes bowing, but always with confidence that he would make it happen in the end,\u201d Mr. Can wrote. \u201cA mental state manages this style that Erdogan himself strongly believes in as he molds his close circle around the same religious belief.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s propensity to surround himself with yes-men may have led him to misjudge domestic politics in the United States and miscalculate how far he could push Washington, he and others said.\u201cIt is the thinking that \u2018we are so valuable that America is not going anywhere,\u2019\u201d said Ahmet Kasim Han, associate professor in international relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul.Not only is it wrong, but dangerous, Mr. Han said. \u201cThis leads to an escalation that becomes very hard to control and it can really lead to a point where it can all break up.\u201d\u201cIt is possible that, in seven or eight months, Brunson will be sitting in his home in North Carolina, Atilla will be back in Turkey, and Trump will be raving about Erdogan on Twitter once again,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas wrote, describing a proposed deal to exchange the pastor for Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker convicted by an American court.\u201cBut it is also possible that Turkey will become the next Venezuela, clashing with the West and dealing with a dire economic downturn,\u201d she added. \u201cNo one can be sure.\u201dYet Mr. Erdogan, some analysts pointed out, can also be a pragmatist, capable of conducting an about-face on policy when it suits him.Officials close to him have continued to offer assurances that an agreement would be found. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has repeated that negotiations were continuing, and reports surfaced Tuesday that a Turkish delegation would travel to Washington within days.Berat Albayrak, the finance and treasury minister and also the son-in-law of Mr. Erdogan, expressed confidence in a television interview on Friday. \u201cTies would never break,\u201d Mr. Albayrak said, likening the dispute to an argument within a family.\u201cEven two siblings in the same household cannot agree on the same issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWife and husband, partners of 40 years long cannot agree on everything. They sometimes argue and then they make peace.\u201dHis comments were intended to calm the financial markets which have suffered losses in the last week since the United States announced the sanctions.Sedat Ergin, a former Washington correspondent for the newspaper Hurriyet who has followed American-Turkish relations for more than 40 years, suggested that damage control for the economy would be Mr. Erdogan\u2019s priority.He described the current crisis as the worst he had seen since the weapons embargo over Cyprus by the United States against Turkey 40 years ago.Both sides were to blame, he said. Turkey did not grasp the grievances that Mr. Brunson\u2019s case caused to the United States. And Washington, he said, had made no progress on the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of instigating the 2016 failed coup, and it had disregarded Turkey\u2019s security concerns in Syria for far too long.The relationship would not be easily mended, he said. \u201cThere is no magic wand to solve this deadlock with a single touch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps, it will be best for both sides to put this relationship on ice for a while.\u201dYet he also saw signs that Mr. Erdogan may yet want a deal.The president\u2019s language, Mr. Ergin wrote, was carefully measured, he expressed the wish that an agreement on the Syrian town of Manbij remain in place, and he made an unusual appeal that was clearly a message to Mr. Trump, the businessman.Mr. Erdogan complained that some around Mr. Trump were causing the problems by imposing sanctions and \u201cbeating the grape grower,\u201d while he was for cooperating so both parties could enjoy \u201ceating the grapes.\u201d\u201cAlways, everywhere, we are on the side of \u2018win-win\u2019 politics,\u201d Mr. Erdogan declared. \u201cWe are for every kind of cooperation to eat the grapes. But we will never give the opportunity to those whose aim is to beat the grape grower.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the \u2018Temp\u2019 Economy Became the New Normal", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesThere\u2019s nothing like political and economic upheaval to make boredom look good. An era like the 1950s, which used to be lampooned for its stifling conformity \u2014 all those organization men in their gray flannel suits \u2014 has since been revered for its stability. To the gig-economy worker who has no idea how many hours she\u2019ll be putting in next week (much less whether she\u2019ll make enough to pay her rent or her health insurance), the prospect of donning a fedora, taking the commuter train into the city, sitting at a desk from 9 to 5 while her ample pension benefits accrue \u2014 well, it sounds like a fantasy now.\u201cThese different protections were rooted in assumptions about whose work needed to be secure \u2014 and who had power in society,\u201d Hyman writes in \u201cTemp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary.\u201d \u201cWhite men\u2019s work counted. Everybody else\u2019s did not.\u201dA number of books have been published in recent years about the brave new gig economy, but \u201cTemp\u201d examines the underlying cultural shift that made it all possible. An astounding 94 percent of American jobs created between 2005 and 2015 were for \u201calternative work.\u201d Slow and steady growth used to be a cardinal virtue for the big American corporation. Now leanness and flexibility are prized, and nobody is spared. \u201cIn the end,\u201d Hyman writes, \u201ceven white men were not protected from this new reality.\u201dHyman, a labor historian at Cornell, argues that the common explanation for what happened \u2014 mainly, that our current dispensation was foisted on us by technological and economic change \u2014 is self-serving and inadequate. He says that human choice, including a palpable shift in values, played an essential role. \u201cTemp\u201d traces how, for corporations and government policymakers alike, \u201cthe risk-taking entrepreneur supplanted the risk-averse, but loyal, company man as the capitalist ideal.\u201dTo that end, Hyman homes in on two businesses in particular: Manpower, the temporary staffing agency, and McKinsey, the management consulting company. In his telling, they acted like a vise, with one supplying the labor and the other supplying the ideology; together they helped squeeze the American work force into its current shape.The material they had to work with was the postwar American corporation, which tended to be lumbering and cautious. After the convulsions of the Great Depression, Americans longed for predictability. Franklin Roosevelt created the Security and Exchange Commission in 1934, which demanded that publicly traded corporations open their books to enable government oversight. Heavy manufacturing entailed enormous investments in machinery, which required every worker along the assembly line to show up, so that those expensive machines wouldn\u2019t sit idle. Corporations couldn\u2019t abide too much volatility. They sought to minimize risks rather than maximize profits.Corporate paternalism might have been born from self-interest, but it helped to create a culture that was hard to shake loose. The assumption that the corporation had a responsibility to its workers proved to be exceptionally stubborn \u2014 especially when employee rights were enshrined in union contracts. Even Elmer Winter, the founder of Manpower, originally pitched his company\u2019s services as \u201cemergency support,\u201d filling in when an employee was sick or on vacation. \u201cPermanent, full-time jobs were the norm, and Winter did not want to change that \u2014 at first,\u201d Hyman writes, rather ominously.But then those permanent, full-time employees were expensive, and temps were comparatively cheap. There could be beauty in their contingency; you didn\u2019t have to pay them benefits or overtime, and their numbers could be quietly shed in a downturn without announcing embarrassing layoffs. Eventually, \u201crather than protecting the core workers, Manpower enabled them to be fired.\u201dHyman dates the beginning of this shift to the late 1960s, a time of stagnating profits. Cutting costs was easier than increasing revenues, and executives chose accordingly. Outsourcing certain functions to temporary or contract workers is now so commonplace it almost seems like part of the natural order, but back then, Hyman says, it was strange enough that it had to be learned.For skittish executives, McKinsey consultants were there to help. Not only could consultants shoulder the blame when a corporation announced plans to restructure, but they also brought with them a worldview shaped by their own experiences as McKinsey \u201cassociates,\u201d subject to the up-or-out policy of an \u201cunforgiving meritocracy.\u201dAs a former McKinsey consultant himself, Hyman likens associates to highly paid temps. They were indoctrinated to believe that \u201cinsecurity\u201d was a goad for \u201cexcellence.\u201d \u201cA brutal lifestyle became a filter for becoming a successful consultant,\u201d he writes, recalling colleagues who sacrificed their marriages and family lives in the process. \u201cThe people who reorganized corporations, by this filter, had little respect for stability.\u201d\u201cTemp\u201d also includes sections about American immigration law, towel-folding robots and undocumented women in Silicon Valley assembling circuitboards with their fingernails. Hyman is a lucid stylist who usually manages to write his way through the deluge, but sometimes the information can feel like too much all at once.This sounds pretty fanciful, coming precisely at a time when Republicans in Congress seem determined to cut whatever threads of the safety net are left. I prefer Hyman when he gets out of wonk-mode and tells us what is really at stake: \u201cThe point is not to be better robots than robots, but to have more human work than our ancestors \u2014 creative, caring, curious.\u201d This might sound fanciful too, but at least it\u2019s an attempt to understand what work is and what it can be. Here, finally, is a book that encourages us to imagine a future that is inclusive and humane rather than sentimentalize a past that never truly was.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "FeatureHe has won a cult following by playing the wise fool, but his comedic ambitions are much greater than that. If he could only hold down a job.Supported byMacdonald used to linger after his nightclub performances to talk to fans, he explained, but the stalker made him stop. She lived in Florida and was convinced that they\u2019d been conducting a secret affair for decades. Her psychiatrist contacted Macdonald\u2019s manager to warn that she might be planning to harm him. His manager did not write down the psychiatrist\u2019s number, though, so Macdonald learned only that she was out there, somewhere in Florida. Later, when his manager offered him some Florida dates, Macdonald cited her as a reason not to go. His manager dismissed this concern.\u201cThat loony tunes?\u201d Norm recalled him saying. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the point!\u201d Macdonald protested. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play chess with her.\u201dBy all outward appearances, stand-up is thriving. The number of shows and specials, as well as the critical attention devoted to them, has reached heights not seen since the 1980s. This rising tide has also lifted Macdonald, who is still best known for anchoring the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d from 1994 until January 1998, when he was fired during the Christmas hiatus \u2014 not by the show\u2019s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, but by the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer. The reason has always been a subject of debate. The popular explanation was that Ohlmeyer, who died in 2017 and was a close friend of O.J. Simpson\u2019s, resented a string of jokes about Simpson\u2019s murder trial that continued long after the former football star was acquitted.In retrospect, the Simpson trial was eerily suited to Macdonald\u2019s sense of humor, in that it centered on an assumption widely held but politely denied. While the news media was obliged to withhold judgment, Macdonald gave voice to the popular belief that Simpson was guilty, delivering joke after joke about how he was obviously a murderer. Macdonald made the number and intensity of these jokes a kind of gag in itself, even after he left \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Hosting ESPN\u2019s Espy Awards one month after he was fired, he congratulated Charles Woodson on winning the Heisman Trophy: \u201cThat is something that no one can ever take away from you,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you kill your wife and a waiter.\u201dHis refusal to stop saying things like that on TV fits his image, among his fans, as a comedian who prioritizes the joke above all else \u2014 even his career. Since \u201cS.N.L,\u201d that career has been aesthetically pleasing but commercially uneven. The dedicated fan will identify two patterns in his television work: It is invariably funny, and it is invariably canceled. His longest-running show, the sitcom \u201cNorm,\u201d aired on ABC between 1999 and 2001. \u201dA Minute With Stan Hooper\u201d was canceled after six episodes. \u201cSports Show With Norm Macdonald\u201d lasted nine. He also played the KFC mascot Colonel Sanders in a handful of commercials.Mostly, he does nightclub comedy. He estimates he was on the road 44 weeks last year \u2014 a grueling schedule for a 58-year-old man who doesn\u2019t drink and describes himself as never having been \u201cpromiscuous.\u201d Between his stand-up, his short-lived but distinctive TV projects and a series of memorable appearances on late-night talk shows, he has captured an audience that is dedicated and, in many cases, influential. Jon Stewart described him to me as \u201ca master of stand-up\u201d; David Letterman, who is credited as \u201cspecial counsel\u201d on Macdonald\u2019s new show and helped sell it to Netflix, likened him to a \u201cpitcher with five out pitches.\u201d\u201cIn my mind, I\u2019m just a stand-up,\u201d Macdonald said at brunch, interrupting his thought to thank the waitress for bringing his eggs. He is scrupulously polite. In conversation, he seems to make a point of following other people\u2019s remarks with notes of encouragement, saying \u201cthat\u2019s interesting\u201d or \u201cexactly right.\u201d Even on the set of his own show, he speaks quietly, almost to the point of diffidence. He looms at over six feet, though, and he has that voice \u2014 flat but resonant, drawn, the comedy version of Buffalo Bill in \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut other people don\u2019t think that. They go, oh, the guy from \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 is doing stand-up now.\u201dTwo decades later, he has yet to recapture the fame he enjoyed when he left that show. To his thinking, though, he has moved steadily closer to his own ideal of what comedy can or should be. Macdonald speaks often about a kind of Platonic form of a joke whose punch line is identical to its setup. He feels he came close in 1995 on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d: \u201cJulia Roberts told reporters this week that her marriage to Lyle Lovett has been over for some time,\u201d he said, as a picture of the country singer\u2019s asymmetrical face appeared behind him. \u201cThe key moment, she said, came when she realized that she was Julia Roberts, and that she was married to Lyle Lovett.\u201dAt that time, Macdonald was better known for shocking punch lines than for elegant writing, although the elements of his mature approach were already in place. Over the last two decades, he has grown more devoted to the pure joke, even as comedy has turned away from it. Contemporary stand-up increasingly positions the comedian either as a relatable personality whom audiences can follow from role to role or as a righteous truth-teller. Macdonald is neither. He is resolutely nonpolitical in an industry bent on producing new versions of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d an ironist working on the same platform as \u201cNanette.\u201d At a moment when comedians work for applause as much as laughter, by being vulnerable, honest, outspoken, socially relevant, Macdonald is still pursuing the laugh \u2014 and nothing more. This anachronistic approach might be limiting his audience, but it could also explain his enduring appeal, because it lends him a kind of moral authority. He is something like a comedy ascetic, demanding a purity that temporal jokes cannot achieve. He seems vital and transgressive again, but pushing 60, he also seems tragic. One thing that makes him a captivating figure onstage is the tension between his refusal to do material about himself and the sympathy you feel for a craftsman who has not been rewarded in proportion to his talent.At brunch, he cited the \u201970s stand-up Robert Klein as saying that when he started, there were 50 stand-ups, and five were funny; suddenly, there were 500 comedians, and five were funny. Macdonald thinks the dynamic Klein described has continued apace, and now the ratio is something like 500,000 to five. He rejected the idea that he was just getting older. \u201cI don\u2019t understand abstract art, but I\u2019m not stupid enough to think it\u2019s worthless,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think comedy, though, is that complicated.\u201dMacdonald is not an anti-comic. He despises anti-comedy, but that has not stopped people from mistaking his work for it, sometimes to his benefit. In 1992, after touring the clubs of his native Canada for the better part of a decade \u2014 including a four-month stint opening for Sam Kinison in 1984 \u2014 he moved to Los Angeles. There, he heard from another comic that Dennis Miller liked one of his jokes. Macdonald reached out to Miller, who asked him to submit a packet for his new talk show. Macdonald bought a copy of USA Today and went through it article by article, struggling to come up with topical material. He wound up submitting exactly one joke: \u201cJeffrey Dahmer went on trial today for murdering and cannibalizing 15 men. But I don\u2019t like his chances after hearing what his defense strategy is going to be: They started it.\u201d Miller hired him, thinking his single-joke packet was, as Macdonald puts it, \u201csome Andy Kaufman move.\u201d He wrote for several episodes, then joined the writers\u2019 room of \u201cRoseanne\u201d after the titular Barr saw him doing stand-up. The next year, he got a call from Lorne Michaels.None of these details appears in Macdonald\u2019s 2016 book, \u201cBased on a True Story: A Memoir\u201d \u2014 which, despite its title, is actually a novel. It recasts the events of his life as the exploits of a drug-addled sociopath desperately recycling the same joke about answering machines. (The joke, mentioned repeatedly, is never revealed.) This kind of strategic withholding is a central element of Macdonald\u2019s act. Although he is unmistakably intelligent in real life \u2014 Letterman told me he was \u201cmaybe the smartest guy in comedy\u201d \u2014 he likes to establish a position of ignorance and then lecture his audience from it. Jerry Seinfeld described this approach to me as \u201csophisticated dumbness\u201d \u2014 a technique that makes any glimpse of the real Macdonald feel thrilling. In those rare moments when he chuckles at his own joke or otherwise breaks character, we feel a rush of empathy, as though we have caught the playwright watching from the wings.This awareness of an amused Macdonald lurking behind the deadpan Norm is what animates his forays into meta-comedy \u2014 not the smug refusals of anti-comedy, but genuinely funny subversions that exploit what audiences have come to expect from the form. Consider the moth joke. During a now-infamous appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d in 2009, Macdonald told a long joke about a moth who goes to a podiatrist\u2019s office. He described in dramatic terms the moth\u2019s complaints \u2014 from the boss who delighted in exercising power over him, to the aged stranger he once recognized as his wife, to the son that, he feared, he no longer loved. After nearly three minutes of Tolstoyan elaboration, the podiatrist finally says that he sympathizes, but what the moth really needs is a psychiatrist. \u201cWhy on earth did you come here?\u201d he asks. The moth answers, \u201cBecause the light was on.\u201d After delivering this punch line, Macdonald stared at O\u2019Brien, only just perceptibly smirking, while the audience cheered.The moth joke is not a shaggy-dog story, one of those ambling anecdotes with no point. As anti-comedy, the shaggy-dog story congratulates the audience for being in on the absence of a joke. The moth joke resembles a shaggy-dog story structurally, but its wrenching punch line reveals Macdonald\u2019s mastery of craft. \u201cBecause the light was on\u201d is classical. It resolves the tension Macdonald has built up by situating the moth within the dynamics of human psychology and misery, slamming us back into joke territory with a reminder that, actually, it\u2019s just a moth. That\u2019s what makes us laugh, but what makes us cheer is the audacity of telling this joke on network television for three minutes, when you might be expected to use that time to promote your own career.The moth joke rewards a type of person whose lifestyle was not viable 20 years ago: the comedy nerd. Macdonald\u2019s talk-show appearances, previously misremembered as anecdotes or entombed as home VHS recordings, are now collected on YouTube. His 2016 appearance on \u201cConan,\u201d in which he plugged his book for 30 seconds and spent the next three and a half minutes doing Catskills-style jokes about how his wife was \u201ca real battle-ax,\u201d has over 1.5 million views. Shareable digital archives have allowed casual Norm fans to become cult Norm fans. YouTube also allowed Macdonald to fulfill what seemed like his destiny in narrowcasting with \u201cNorm Macdonald Live,\u201d a video podcast with the co-host Adam Eget that featured guests like Tom Green and Caitlyn Jenner, which he uploaded directly to the site between 2013 and 2017.That podcast became the proof of concept for his new Netflix show. On a set whose sparseness and simple lighting evoke Charlie Rose, Macdonald interviews a single guest each episode. There is no studio audience, although the crew can periodically be heard laughing in the background. The conversational format reveals the friendly autodidact Macdonald has made a career of hiding. \u201cNorm just kind of twinkles, even when he\u2019s not playing the dumb guy,\u201d Letterman told me. \u201cHe\u2019s deadly funny, he\u2019s incredibly smart, he\u2019s wildly personable and he\u2019s peculiar.\u201dThe program is descriptively titled \u201cNorm Macdonald Has a Show.\u201d It offers to fulfill the promise his book subverted: Here Macdonald will be himself, talking with other celebrities about things that actually happened. There is another way to read that title, though: as fatalistic disillusionment with show business. \u201cMy idea was \u2018The Latest Show,\u2019\u2009\u201d Macdonald told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a clever little title.\u201d Norm Macdonald has a show, and we all know what happens next.Macdonald is a creature of habit, and many of those habits are not conducive to the advancement of his career. He doesn\u2019t go to parties. He doesn\u2019t schmooze. He doesn\u2019t drive, which in Los Angeles is like being confined to an iron lung. He used to live in West Hollywood, which made it easy to drop by the Comedy Store for surprise sets. But now he lives in a planned community with his adult son, Dylan, next to the home he bought for his mother. He\u2019s deep in the wad of office parks and car dealerships near LAX and has to take a hundred-dollar Uber to get to the Comedy Store, so he rarely does. By his own admission, he spends a lot of time at home, going down what he calls \u201crabbit holes\u201d on YouTube or watching sports on television. The night before our dinner, he stayed up until dawn live-tweeting the World Series of Poker.Macdonald\u2019s life seems characterized by routines that shade over into compulsion. He quit drinking as a teenager, after an initial foray into weeklong binges and blackouts. He was a chain smoker before he stopped 10 years ago \u2014 stand-up footage from his youth shows the telltale gesture of index and middle fingers toward mouth \u2014 and he said that, if he found he had a few cigarettes left in the pack around bedtime, he would stay up to finish it. He seems to love carbohydrates; in his dressing room after the taping, I watched him consume the better part of an economy bag of SweeTart Ropes. At the Daily Grill, he ate a heroic amount of bread before telling me he would have done \u201cWeekend Update\u201d forever.\u201cI told Lorne I would hire on like Walter Cronkite, and just take the money as it exists, and never ask for a raise, and just do it until I was 65,\u201d he said. He paused a moment before adding, \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that idea.\u201dAs our pasta arrived, Macdonald said he rejects the O.J. hypothesis and has come to believe that he was fired for his material. \u201cWe were doing experimental stuff, non sequiturs,\u201d he said. \u201cOhlmeyer would watch Leno kill every night for 15 minutes. Every joke, huge laughs, and then I\u2019d do 10 minutes a week and sometimes not get laughs.\u201dAt that time, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d was at a critical and popular nadir \u2014 Macdonald told me of watching in astonishment as the live audience booed the final installment of the \u201cIt\u2019s Pat\u201d sketch \u2014 and the \u201cUpdate\u201d writers were trying to break out of it. He hired Frank Sebastiano, a delivery man who had submitted hundreds of handwritten jokes along with his packages, whom Hoekstra credits with the blunt tone \u201cUpdate\u201d developed during Macdonald\u2019s tenure. (After Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley filed for divorce: \u201cAccording to friends, the two were never a good match. She\u2019s more of a stay-at-home type, and he\u2019s more of a homosexual pedophile.\u201d) Such acerbic jokes felt increasingly at odds with the rest of the show, which was moving toward silly sketches like Cheri Oteri\u2019s cheerleaders and Chris Kattan\u2019s Mango.Macdonald often skipped the curtain call, he said, because it made him feel foolish. \u201cWhen I got \u2018Update,\u2019 I\u2019d just leave right after \u2018Update,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. How did the rest of the cast feel about that? \u201cEh,\u201d he said, \u201cnot great.\u201d He rarely attended the show\u2019s famous cast parties, either. Instead, he would take the studio-provided limo to Atlantic City and play craps.A six-figure win on one of these trips changed his relationship to gambling forever. Instead of cashing out, he took the chips home in a paper bag and stashed them in his refrigerator. He couldn\u2019t go back to playing $25 craps after that. Macdonald has had long runs of compulsive betting on poker, craps, blackjack and sports book. Although he spoke candidly about his tendency to gamble in problematic ways, he hasn\u2019t quit. At one point he went to Gamblers Anonymous, but he said listening to all those stories about gambling only made him want to gamble more. As the check arrived, he talked about other people\u2019s tales of hitting bottom, losing their houses or their children\u2019s college funds. \u201cI never got close to that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you never went broke?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, I did go broke,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cBut I always had a job, so it was different.\u201dIt is tempting to conclude from this kind of statement that Macdonald is sad. When he says he doesn\u2019t care about money, it must be a mechanism to defend himself from regret over his gambling losses \u2014 because who wouldn\u2019t regret that? Likewise, when he laments the state of contemporary comedy, it is easy to assume he is lamenting the state of his own career. But to make these judgments is to succumb to the fallacy that he values what most people value. Maybe Macdonald really is just in it for the jokes and the admiration of his peers, and what looks by other standards like a series of disappointments is, to him, success enough.It was after 1 in the morning, but Macdonald was amped up. As we drove back to his place, he talked about the Henny Youngman one-liner \u201cTake my wife, please.\u201d Youngman delivered this joke without a pause before the last word, which, Macdonald pointed out, does not make sense. The terminal \u201cplease\u201d is funny because it shifts the meaning of \u201ctake my wife [for example]\u201d to \u201ctake my wife [away from me.]\u201d He wondered whether Youngman intentionally removed the pause to further increase the efficiency of an already stunningly economical joke, or if it became so popular he delivered it as a catchphrase. The latter possibility seemed tragic to him, a joke\u2019s equivalent of death.We stopped in front of his condo, where Macdonald opened the door, put one foot on the curb and talked to me for the next 90 minutes. He talked about how bewildered he felt when he heard that Mo\u2019Nique got $10 million for a Netflix special \u2014 a rumor that the actor and comedian debunked only recently \u2014 when he was paid a fraction of that. He discussed the galling experience of being asked to \u201caudition\u201d for his own comedy special \u2014 \u201cHitler\u2019s Dog, Gossip and Trickery,\u201d released last year \u2014 by having content executives attend one of his performances. (Netflix initially passed on the special, only to reverse its decision later.) He talked about his desire to overcome these kinds of attachments, and the satisfaction he found in working on his next book, a 600-page straight novel that he plans to publish under a pen name. The process was maddeningly difficult, but he liked the way it organized his days. \u201cIf I can not watch sports and not gamble, so much time opens up,\u201d he said.At 58, he said, he was having the disturbing experience of recognizing some of his own opinions as the thinking of an old man. There were new ideas about gender identity that he knew were right but couldn\u2019t quite get his head around. He recounted what Dylan said to him when he broached this subject: \u201cWhy do you always need to feel you understand things?\u201d The question had set him thinking, and he related it to me with a father\u2019s uninhibited pride.Many of these remarks he prefaced with the caveat that he knew he shouldn\u2019t say them in front of a reporter. He couldn\u2019t help it, though; he seemed compelled to speak honestly, the way he once felt compelled to finish a pack of cigarettes at bedtime. He even talked about politics. Mostly, though, he talked about his desire to transcend such things \u2014 current events, popular wisdom, even the quotidian details of his own life \u2014 to operate in the realm of the pure joke, one that\u2019s still funny 100 years from now.\u201cMaking people laugh is a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cPreaching to them is not a gift. There are people who can do that better.\u201d His eyes seemed to glimmer in the light from the dashboard before he completed the thought: \u201cPreachers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Top Leader Faults Rouhani for Crisis, Saying He Crossed \u2018Red Lines\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIran\u2019s supreme leader made his sharpest criticism yet of his country\u2019s president on Monday, faulting him for having crossed \u201cred lines\u201d in nuclear negotiations with the United States and other failures that have created an economic crisis.Mr. Rouhani\u2019s promises that the 2015 nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers would lead to an economic revival in Iran have been thwarted since the Trump administration renounced the agreement in May and moved to restore American sanctions.Over the past three months, Iran\u2019s currency has plunged in value and large multinational companies have scrapped plans to do business in Iran, intimidated by the strong threat of financial penalties in the United States.Ayatollah Khamenei said Monday that because of the insistence of Mr. Rouhani and his team, he had allowed them to negotiate the nuclear agreement, in which Iran curbed its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, Ayatollah Khamenei said, Iranian negotiators surrendered too much and \u201ctrespassed the red lines that had been set.\u201dWere it not for his own advice to Mr. Rouhani, the ayatollah said, \u201cwe would have given up more.\u201dWhile other Iranian officials, including Mr. Rouhani, already had spurned the offer, Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s rejection is considered the final word.\u201cThe Islamic Republic can negotiate with America whenever it achieves the power to resist America\u2019s pressure and blackmail,\u201d the ayatollah said. \u201cToday this is not the case.\u201dInvoking the admonition of Iran\u2019s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to never negotiate with the United States, Ayatollah Khamenei said, \u201cI prohibit it as well.\u201dHis remarks came as Iran\u2019s military flexed its muscle, showing a new generation of short-range missiles after conducting war-game maneuvers last week in the Persian Gulf, where warships of the United States Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet also patrol.Most outside analysts say Iran is not interested in armed conflict with the United States. Ayatollah Khamenei used the opportunity to also make it clear that Iran was not seeking a fight, even as he denounced the Americans in his own version of a Trump-style Twitter posting.Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s virulent hostility toward the United States is well known, and he has said before that the Trump administration\u2019s repudiation of the nuclear agreement had proved his suspicion \u2014 which he expressed to Mr. Rouhani \u2014 that the Americans could not be trusted.But analysts who follow Iran\u2019s opaque politics said his criticism on Monday was sharper in assigning blame to Mr. Rouhani.\u201cMy sense is that Khamenei is throwing Rouhani under the bus, in a number of ways,\u201d said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, an Iran expert and political science professor at Syracuse University.While Ayatollah Khamenei also blamed himself for having approved the nuclear negotiations, the professor said, \u201che\u2019s transferring the guilt to Rouhani.\u201dThe ayatollah\u2019s criticisms do not presage the political downfall of Mr. Rouhani, a moderate cleric who is in the last three years of his second term.On the contrary, Ayatollah Khamenei also made it clear to the hard-line factions in Iran\u2019s hierarchy that he disapproved of their efforts to sabotage Mr. Rouhani\u2019s administration.\u201cThose who call on the government to step down are playing a part in the enemy\u2019s plot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should remain and carry on with its responsibilities with authority to solve problems.\u201dHenry Rome, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington, said Ayatollah Khamenei might have weighed in because the possibility of talks with Mr. Trump still was publicly discussed in Iran.\u201cWe hadn\u2019t heard from him since Trump made repeated overtures,\u201d Mr. Rome said, and despite Mr. Rouhani\u2019s rejection of such talks, \u201cthere was a debate going on in Iran \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a taboo subject \u2014 so Khamenei had to come out and say something.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei spoke a week after the first round of the restored American sanctions took effect, restricting Iran\u2019s use of dollars and its business in gold, metals, aviation, automobiles and other industries.The second \u2014 and far more onerous \u2014 round of restored sanctions will take effect in November, when the Trump administration has warned that buyers of Iran\u2019s oil \u2014 its most important export \u2014 could face American penalties.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Notes on a Butter Republic", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistStill on vacation, and I\u2019m currently in Denmark \u2013 in fact, just cycled from Copenhagen to Helsingor, aka Elsinore. Sad to say, I\u2019m such a fearsome nerd that instead of thinking about Shakespeare, my thoughts have turned to \u2026 economics. For Denmark\u2019s story is, I\u2019d argue, of considerable interest to the rest of us.Blessed are the cheesemakersDuring the creation of the first global economy, the one made possible by railroads, steamships, and telegraphs, the world seemed to bifurcate into industrial nations and the agricultural raw/material producers who catered to them. And the agricultural nations, even if they grew rich at first \u2013 e.g., Argentina \u2013 seemingly ended up getting much the worse of the deal, turning into banana republics crippled economically and politically by their role.One interesting point about this export surge is that in a way it was value-added production, like the exports of modern developing economies that rely on imported inputs \u2013 except that in Denmark\u2019s case it was imports of animal feed from North America that helped provide a crucial edge.The good news was that this agricultural orientation didn\u2019t turn out to be a dead end. Instead, it laid the foundation for excellent performance over the long run. And in Denmark\u2019s case globalization seems to have been equalizing, both politically and economically: instead of fostering dominance by foreign corporations or domestic landowners, it led to dominance by rural cooperatives.Anyway, I\u2019m not pushing a universal lesson that globalization is great for everyone; just the opposite. The point is that the results depend on the details: a country can produce agricultural products, be \u201cdependent\u201d by most definitions, yet use that as the basis for permanent elevation into the first world.The non-horrors of \u201csocialism\u201dA number of people on the U.S. right, and some self-proclaimed centrists, seem totally taken aback by the rise of politicians who call themselves socialist. But this rise was predictable and predicted.Here\u2019s what happened: for decades the right has tried to shout down any attempt to sand down some of the rough edges of capitalism, whether through health guarantees, income supports, or anything else, by yelling \u201csocialism.\u201d Sooner or later people were bound to say that if any attempt to make our system less harsh is socialism, well, they\u2019re socialists.The truth is that there are hardly any people in the U.S. who want the government to seize the means of production, or even the economy\u2019s commanding heights. What they want is social democracy \u2013 the kinds of basic guarantees of health care, protection against poverty, etc., that almost every other advanced country provides.Ahem:Yep, Danish adults are more likely to be employed than their U.S. counterparts. They work somewhat shorter hours, although that may well be a welfare-improving choice. But what Denmark shows is that you can run a welfare state far more generous than we do \u2013 beyond the wildest dreams of U.S. progressives \u2013 and still have a highly successful economy.Macro muddlesDespite all this good stuff, there is something rotten \u2013 OK, maybe just slightly off \u2013 in the state of Denmark. While the long-term performance has been great, Denmark hasn\u2019t done too well since the 2008 financial crisis, with real GDP per capita falling substantially, then taking a long time to recover. In particular, Denmark has lagged far behind Sweden:There\u2019s no mystery about this recent underperformance. Denmark isn\u2019t on the euro, but unlike Sweden, it has pegged its currency to the euro. So it has shared in the euro area\u2019s problems.Leaving aside the general issue of exchange rate regimes, this is a reminder that microeconomics \u2013 things like the incentive effects of a strong welfare state \u2013 is different from macroeconomics. You can do great things on the micro front and still screw up your monetary policy.So those are my notes on Denmark \u2013 plus one more observation: nothing in Danish is pronounced remotely the way the spelling suggests to an English speaker. (The famous astronomer Tyco Brahe was, if I got it right, something like Tuco Brawwww.) The same isn\u2019t true for German. Why did they do this?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let Kids Play", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CheckupDoctors should prescribe playtime for young children, the American Academy of Pediatrics says. The statement characterizes play as intrinsically motivated, involving active engagement and resulting in \u201cjoyful discovery.\u201d It summarizes extensive developmental and neurological research on play, and tries to tease out some of the specific developmental discoveries in peek-a-boo (repetitive games provide \u201cthe joy of being able to predict what is going to happen\u201d) and Simon Says (builds impulse control and executive function). It also says that doctors should encourage playful learning for parents and infants by writing a \u201cprescription for play\u201d at every well-child visit in the first two years of life.\u201cWe\u2019re in a climate where parents are feeling like they need to schedule every minute of structured time, and 30 percent of kindergartens offer no recess,\u201d said Dr. Michael Yogman, chairman of the A.A.P. committee on psychosocial aspects of child family health and the lead author of the statement. To some, he said, \u201cplay is seen as irrelevant and old-fashioned.\u201d Dr. Benard Dreyer, the director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine and a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said, \u201cThe old saying is, play is the work of children. Play is the way they learn and the way they develop. It\u2019s important to understand how all of us, and especially parents, can encourage play.\u201d\u201cKids develop 21st-century skills in play,\u201d said Dr. Yogman, who is chief of the division of ambulatory pediatrics at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. These include social and emotional skills and executive function, \u201cskills that are crucial for adults in the new economy, that help them collaborate and innovate.\u201dA fundamental job in pediatric primary care is to strengthen the parent-child relationship, he said, and play is important in that area as well. Even with a very young child, he said: \u201cWhen a 3-month-old smiles and a parent smiles back, those kinds of turn-taking activities are not only far from trivial,\u201d but are actually important for developing language and social-emotional skills, such as taking turns. And the policy statement goes into detail on recent research showing that play can affect the developing brain, both in its basic structure and in function, with changes that can be traced to play showing up at the molecular and cellular level, as well as at the level of behavior and executive function.\u201cI think there\u2019s a real pediatric role in pointing out the real profound importance of play on many levels,\u201d Dr. Yogman said. \u201cParents are looking to us for what do I do with my child, how many activities do I get them in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really thrilled the academy was willing to endorse the idea of a prescription for play.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about fancy toys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about common household items that kids can discover and explore,\u201d like putting spoons and plastic containers on the floor \u201cand bang them and see what the child does with them.\u201d Parents often tell him, \u201cGee, I always believed in that. Nice to have it validated,\u201d he said.\u201cThe goal is not to make parents feel guilty or to lord it over them as an expert,\u201d Dr. Yogman said, but rather to look for moments during an office visit that a parent might build on, and to talk about what is coming up developmentally for the child \u2014 which is a basic imperative of primary care in pediatrics. And there are ways to work play into the medical visit, like blowing bubbles to help fearful children, or using hand puppets to demonstrate what\u2019s going to happen in an exam. It may help to take the family out to the waiting room and see what the child does with the toys there. The statement is advocating for a balanced curriculum in prekindergarten that does not ignore playful learning and doesn\u2019t regard time spent in the block corner as somehow beside the point, Dr. Yogman said. Playful learning means supporting young children\u2019s intrinsic motivation to learn and discover, instead of imposing extrinsic motivations like test scores.What parents need to do, Dr. Dreyer said, is be there to help their children with \u201cscaffolding.\u201d That means \u201cyou don\u2019t control the play for your child, but when you see they\u2019re ready to go to the next step, support that.\u201dFor example, you wouldn\u2019t do the puzzle for the child, but you might point out a clue to help figure out where the piece might fit. Giving parents positive reinforcement for what they are already doing is what helps most, he said, not criticizing them for what they aren\u2019t doing. But can we successfully \u201cprescribe\u201d reading, playing, going outside and all the other essential pieces of a healthy busy childhood?There are crucial underlying themes that connect all these different ideas; the importance of interacting with children, responding to their cues and questions, the value of the old-fashioned kind of face time, with parents and with peers, and the importance of helping kids find a variety of experiences that are not all about screens and screen time in a world that is increasingly virtual for both parents and children. \u201cReading is also having kids imagine what their role would be, which is playful,\u201d Dr. Yogman said. \u201cGetting outside and getting physical exercise is playful.\u201d\u201cA \u2018prescription for play\u2019 I might hand to parents at the end of a visit is really just saying, it\u2019s O.K. to go back and rely on your common sense about where you think you can share some of the joy as your child is exploring the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is really validating what I think parents might come to on their own but are feeling pressured by a culture that says no, they really need to do special video games on an iPad or they need to have every minute of structured time.\u201d\u201cPlay is the most important part of childhood,\u201d Dr. Dreyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they develop emotionally, cognitively and in language \u2014 the statement comes out to help pediatricians and parents understand the importance and how to even do it better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Plan for Coal Emissions: Let Coal States Regulate Them", "Date": "2017-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plan would also relax pollution rules for power plants that need upgrades. That, combined with allowing states to set their own rules, creates a serious risk that emissions, which had been falling, could start to rise again, according to environmentalists.The proposal, which President Trump is expected to highlight Tuesday at a rally in West Virginia, amounts to the administration\u2019s strongest and broadest effort yet to address what the president has long described as a regulatory \u201cwar on coal.\u201d It would considerably weaken what is known as the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature regulation for cutting planet-warming emissions at coal-fired plants.\u201cThe science is just getting clearer and clearer every day,\u201d Ms. McCabe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times people need to hear that we\u2019re having the warmest summer on record or how many storms people need to see. This is no fooling.\u201dOfficials at the White House and the E.P.A. did not respond to requests for comment.It all depends on where you live.The plan is the latest move in a string of efforts \u2014 including prodding grid operators to purchase more electricity from coal plants and asserting that coal plant retirements are threatening the reliability of the national power grid \u2014 to end what Mr. Trump has called his predecessor\u2019s war on coal and a sure sign to the industry that the Trump administration still has its back, even as coal production continues to decline.\u201cI certainly think we are supportive of what the administration is doing and we applaud their efforts,\u201d she said.Conrad Schneider, advocacy director for the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group, predicted that the new plan would ultimately make coal plants more competitive in the electricity markets, allowing them to displace cleaner sources of energy.\u201cEmissions are going to go up, and I don\u2019t mean from where they would have been under the Clean Power Plan, but relative to the trends now,\u201d Mr. Schneider said. \u201cThis is to put the thumb on the scales and bring coal back.\u201dThe proposal could help Mr. Trump rally his base in coal regions heading into the midterm elections, though there are few vulnerable Republican seats in those areas and it could also involve political risk by pushing Democrats to the polls.\u201cEveryone who votes on climate change is a Democratic base,\u201d said Eli Lehrer, president of R Street, a free-market think tank in Washington that supports policies to combat climate change but opposes the Clean Power Plan.This is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry.\u201cIt may not look as stringent, but one of the important things to keep in mind is the emissions reductions that were driven by the Clean Power Plan were driven by forcing a move from coal to natural gas and renewables,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s happening anyway even in the absence of the Clean Power Plan.\u201dWhile offering a possible lifeline to the coal industry, the new rule is also notable for what it would not do: reject the federal government\u2019s legal obligation to reduce emissions.The plan barely takes note of climate change. The words appear on only one of the nearly 300 pages of documents, according to two of the people who have seen the full draft. Yet, by proposing the regulation at all, the Trump administration is implicitly acknowledging a key 2009 E.P.A. decision known as the endangerment finding that declares climate change a threat to human health and welfare.That finding is the legal backbone for almost all federal climate policy and requires the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.Coral Davenport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Keith Ellison about its sale of products featuring Nazi and white supremacist imagery.In response, Mr. Ellison wrote to Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, expressing alarm. \u201cI am disturbed that such a powerful corporation is materially fueling the rise of hate groups in our country,\u201d Mr. Ellison said.He also questioned Amazon about the profits it generated from white supremacist literature available on its Kindle e-reader platform. The Partnership for Working Families and the Action Center on Race and the Economy pointed to Amazon\u2019s sales of an illustrated children\u2019s book by George Lincoln Rockwell, who founded the American Nazi Party in 1959.In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman said: \u201cSellers are expected to comply with our policies, and we immediately investigate any reported violations.

{"Headline": "What a Drone Attack Says About Venezuela\u2019s Future", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA democratic transition for the Latin American country requires a firm engagement by the international community, the government and the opposition.Mr. Smilde is a sociologist specialized in civil society and political conflict in Latin America. He has studied Venezuela for 25 years.The first task of any autocrat is to look strong and invincible. But the Aug. 4 assassination attempt made Mr. Maduro looked weak and vulnerable. That an amateurish drone attack could get so close to the president shows the deterioration of Venezuela\u2019s state apparatus at the highest levels. That the soldiers would break and scatter to save their own hides reveals the superficiality of the support that the president has around him.What would have happened had the assassination attempt been successful? Without any viable opposition, it most likely would have empowered Chavista military loyalists to take charge and make Venezuela into a true military dictatorship. Or it could have begun an armed conflict between rival factions within Chavismo.No one knows whether the Maduro regime will last decades or days. But this drone attack should be a warning to international stakeholders. To achieve an orderly, democratic and nonviolent solution to the Venezuelan crisis, international pressure must be complemented by constructive engagement of both the government and opposition.While many government and military officials have their hands in corruption schemes that provide them with ample rewards, they know that Mr. Maduro is running Chavismo, the political system built by former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, off a cliff. If they get to the point that they see their livelihoods at risk, they are not going to turn around and run like the National Guardsmen did on Saturday. They will walk forward and force Mr. Maduro himself off the stage.The governments of Uruguay, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the new administration in Mexico could play such a role, perhaps facilitated by the United Nations or a European country with experience in peace negotiations. Such engagement should include discussion of mechanisms of transitional justice that could ensure officials they can change course without being the object of persecution.The government\u2019s crass manipulation and outright fraud in elections over the past two years have weakened the hand of opposition moderates and strengthened the long-term message of radicals: \u201cyou don\u2019t remove dictators with votes.\u201d But this idea is historically inaccurate. Pressure leading to a pact leading to a vote is the classic way to overcome authoritarian rule. It was through a plebiscite that the Chilean opposition defeated the dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1988. A year later, the Solidarity movement in Poland accepted a limited vote and stunned the government by sweeping the election, leading to its demise. And it was through negotiations, and a vote, that South Africa overcame apartheid.In none of these cases did dictators simply roll over and give up after a weekend of dialogue. Nor did they play fair. In each case it was through months and years of hardball politics and arduous negotiations that democratic challengers were able to outsmart and outmaneuver authoritarian governments.

{"Headline": "Kalashnikov Unveils a Car of the Future. Russians See a 1970s Relic.", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 What do you get when a staid Russian weapons manufacturer designs a \u201cconcept\u201d electric car and a futuristic robot? Apparently, you get a car based on a Soviet-era design and an ungainly monster more than 13 feet tall that many people doubt is capable of moving.\u201cWe are talking about competing with Tesla precisely because it\u2019s currently a successful vehicle project,\u201d the spokesperson told the RBC news website. \u201cWe expect to at least keep up with it.\u201dThe Russian internet was having none of it. Memes mocking the concept car and questions about whether the robot was actually mobile proliferated across social media.To test a rocket last February, the founder of Tesla, Elon Musk, famously launched his roadster into space. So observers began creating pictures of the clunky concept car showing it, too, in orbit.If anything it came across more like a Los Angeles lowrider than the wave of the future. One creative observer imagined how the interior of a futuristic car might be decorated with Russian Orthodox icons, a favorite of many local drivers.Both the car and the robot were unveiled at a military trade show outside Moscow called ARMY-2018. The robot resembled a giant mechanical chicken, albeit one with a giant head and weighing more than 4.5 metric tons. Various tech writers compared it to armed robots from the \u201cRobocop\u201d movies or the \u201cMetal Gear\u201d video games.There did seem to be at least one innovation, at least when it came to Kalashnikov\u2019s concept car. Side view mirrors are something of a vehicular vestigial organ here: Russian drivers often change lanes or otherwise plow forward without bothering to check what is coming up behind them.The concept car had no side mirrors.Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: What Trump\u2019s Auto Emissions Plan Means for California", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The administration\u2019s proposal, jointly published by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department, would roll back a 2012 rule that required automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles to an average of about 54 miles per gallon by 2025. It would halt requirements that automakers build cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars, including hybrids and electric vehicles.The new proposal would freeze the increase of average fuel economy standards after 2021 at about 37 miles per gallon, while challenging a legal waiver \u2014 granted to California under the 1970 Clean Air Act and now followed by 13 other states \u2014 that lets those states set more stringent pollution standards than the federal government\u2019s.Gov. Jerry Brown did not mince words in his response: \u201cFor Trump to now destroy a law first enacted at the request of Ronald Reagan five decades ago is a betrayal and an assault on the health of Americans everywhere,\u201d he said.Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that he would lead a 19-state lawsuit against the proposal once it was finalized.Speaking of the wildfires now ripping through Northern California, and noting the scientific conclusions that a hotter, drier planet caused by climate change can worsen such fires, Mr. Becerra said, \u201cThe pollution we\u2019re all seeing, and certainly here in Los Angeles, that pollution is fueling the death and destruction we\u2019re seeing here in California.\u201dOnce filed, such a lawsuit could drag on for years. If the states win, it could split the national auto market in two \u2014 an outcome that automakers have called a worst-case scenario.In hopes of avoiding that end, William Wehrum, the top clean air official at the E.P.A., said he still would like to find a way to broker a deal with California over the rule before it is finalized, probably this year or early next year.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)\u201cIt\u2019s been heartbreaking and overwhelmingly joyful,\u201d a volunteer at the shelter told The Guardian. \u201cPeople lose everything, but then their animals are here still.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Seeks the Death Penalty for Female Activist", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia, which has one of the highest execution rates in the world, is taking the rare step of seeking the death penalty for a 29-year-old female activist accused of encouraging demonstrations for greater rights for the Shiite Muslim minority, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said.Most executions in Saudi Arabia are by beheading, a method used to kill 48 people over a four-month period this year.The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The charges against the six include participating in protests, chanting slogans hostile to the regime, attempting to inflame public opinion, filming protests and publishing on social media, and providing moral support to rioters. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for five of the six, including Ms. Ghomgham.The arrests of the female activists appeared to be intended to reinforce the notion that any overhauls must come as gifts from the monarch, rather than as a response to grass-roots activists or independent advocates.Ms. Ghomgham, whom Human Rights Watch described as a well-known advocate of equal rights for Shiites, faces accusations related to that activism, not for work with women\u2019s rights.She and her husband were arrested in a night raid on their home on Dec. 6, 2015, and she has been in jail since. She now faces trial in the kingdom\u2019s Specialized Criminal Court, which was set up in 2008 to try terrorism cases. The court has drawn criticism from rights advocates, who say it severely limits the rights of criminal defendants.In 2014, the Specialized Criminal Court sentenced to death eight Shiite activists, including the prominent cleric Nimr al-Nimr, for participating in protests inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. The court sentenced 14 others to death for similar reasons in 2016.He had said he hoped to attract investment to help diversify the Saudi economy, which is almost entirely dependent on oil. Instead, the secretive and arbitrary character of the detentions prompted many Saudi and international investors to move large amounts of money out of the kingdom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Agrees to Pay $2 Billion Over Seizure of Oil Projects", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 More than a decade ago, Venezuela seized several oil projects from the American oil company ConocoPhillips without compensation. Now, under pressure after ConocoPhillips carried out its own seizures, the Venezuelans are going to make amends.After winning the arbitration ruling in April, ConocoPhillips seized Pdvsa oil inventories, cargoes and terminals on several Dutch Caribbean islands. The move seriously hampered Venezuela\u2019s efforts to export oil to the United States and Asia, and emboldened other creditors to seek financial retribution.\u201cWhat they did was choke the exports and made it clear to Pdvsa that the cost of not coming to an agreement would be higher than actually settling on a payment schedule,\u201d said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University.As its oil production has plummeted to the lowest levels in decades, Venezuela has fallen behind on more than $6 billion in bond payments. Pdvsa has already defaulted on more than $2 billion in bonds after failing to make interest payments over the last year, and owes billions of dollars more to service companies.Adding to Venezuela\u2019s woes, the Trump administration has imposed sanctions that prohibit the purchase and sale of Venezuelan government debt, including bonds issued by the state oil company.Mr. Monaldi said Pdvsa would be forced to pay ConocoPhillips with money it would have paid other creditors and would probably delay some oil shipments to China it owes in separate loan agreements. He added that \u201cthere is not a negligible probability\u201d that at some point it will discontinue payments for lack of money.A year and a half after I was kicked out of Venezuela, I returned to find out how Venezuelans are holding on as the country falls apart and inflation makes buying a single cup of coffee nearly impossible.Hyperinflation, corruption and growing starvation have crippled the Venezuelan economy, as the socialist government is forced to choose between buying food and medicine and satisfying the demands of creditors. Over the last few days, the government has scrambled to deal with its economic crisis by sharply devaluing its currency, raising wages and promising to shave energy subsidies.The settlement with ConocoPhillips over the 2007 seizure resolves a drawn-out legal struggle, at least for the time being.\u201cAs a result of the settlement, ConocoPhillips has agreed to suspend its legal enforcement actions of the I.C.C. award, including in the Dutch Caribbean,\u201d ConocoPhillips said in a statement.Pdvsa, which did not comment on the agreement, is to pay the first $500 million within 90 days.ConocoPhillips is pursuing a separate arbitration case over the same seizure against the government of Venezuela before the World Bank\u2019s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which could result in another large settlement award, perhaps as high as $6 billion.That amount would probably be unpayable, experts say, but it could put ConocoPhillips in a strong position to obtain access to Venezuelan oil fields in the future if the current government eventually falls.Pdvsa\u2019s problems with creditors are far-reaching, putting its American Citgo assets, including three large refineries and a pipeline network, in jeopardy. A federal judge in Delaware recently ruled that Crystallex, a Canadian gold mining company, could seize over $1 billion in shares of Citgo as compensation for a 2008 nationalization of a mining operation in Venezuela.Citgo is appealing. If it loses, that may open the way for more claims on Citgo assets by companies whose investments have been expropriated in Venezuela, including Exxon Mobil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missouri Voters Reject Anti-Union Law in a Victory for Labor", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a succession of political setbacks in onetime strongholds and a landmark defeat in the Supreme Court, organized labor has notched a hard-won victory as Missouri voters overrode a legislative move to curb union power.A measure on the ballot on Tuesday asked voters to pass judgment on a prospective law barring private-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers who choose not to become members. The law was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin.Labor leaders argued that the rare opportunity for voters to weigh in directly on a so-called right-to-work measure \u2014 which several states have passed in recent years \u2014 revealed how little public support the policy has, at least once voters get beyond the anodyne branding.\u201cIt shows how out of touch those institutions are,\u201d said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cHow out of touch the Republican legislature in Missouri is, how out of touch the Supreme Court is.\u201dBut Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies unions at Washington University in St. Louis, cautioned against overstating the victory. A mere 8.7 percent of workers in Missouri were union members last year, below the national average and down from more than 13 percent a decade-and-a-half ago.\u201cA \u2018win\u2019 just returns the situation to the status quo,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said by email, though he acknowledged that it was \u201ca huge morale boost to a beleaguered movement.\u201dThe examples of Michigan and Indiana, where right-to-work laws took effect earlier this decade, suggest that the legislation could have cost unions thousands of members and millions in revenue.One question is the extent to which the victory could reverberate beyond Missouri.\u201cI think this will build momentum and send a message to all legislators,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cthat if you vote against the people, go against the will of the vast majority of working Americans, it\u2019s going to cost you.\u201dBut it was not immediately clear that the forces driving the impressive showing for labor in Missouri could be reproduced elsewhere.One reason is that Republican voters who buck their party on a ballot measure, as many appeared to do in Missouri, may be unwilling to vote against Republican candidates in a general election, even when those candidates are hostile to labor.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between overturning the law itself and defeating legislators who supported it,\u201d said Jonathon Prouty, a Missouri political consultant and former executive director of the state\u2019s Republican Party. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for unions to energize their base around the issue, which is right to work, rather than against candidates.\u201dT. J. Berry, a Republican state representative whose district includes some outer suburbs of Kansas City, said that many of his constituents were proud union members who opposed right to work but nonetheless voted Republican because they were conservative on issues like abortion and guns.\u201cI have four guys who are Ford workers in my Sunday school class,\u201d Mr. Berry said. \u201cAnd they fit exactly what I\u2019ve told you: Pro-life, pro-gun and pro-worker. All of them voted for Trump.\u201dLabor also appeared to enjoy a significant financial advantage in Missouri that is unlikely to recur in other states where Republicans have the wherewithal to pass right-to-work bills. According to state financial filings, the union-funded We Are Missouri coalition had spent just over $15 million on its ballot campaign as of late July, about three times what the four leading groups supporting the right-to-work legislation spent over the same period.\u201cHe was going to be the champion, then he was embroiled in controversy the whole year,\u201d Mr. Berry said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a leader, it\u2019s pretty hard to rally the troops.\u201dEven so, Mr. Prouty acknowledged that the momentum against the right-to-work effort was more than a function of labor\u2019s spending. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is energy out there.\u201dMr. Greitens had signed a right-to-work bill into law after the legislature passed it in early 2017.Supporters argued that the measure was essential to the state\u2019s economic competitiveness.\u201cCompanies that have a choice of expanding or choosing where they locate to begin with, they will generally choose \u2014 especially in the manufacturing sector \u2014 a right-to-work state,\u201d said Daniel Mehan, president and chief executive of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He cited the manufacturing boom in the South in recent decades as a key data point.But shortly after the law\u2019s passage, unions and their allies in the state started a campaign to keep it from taking effect. They submitted about three times the roughly 100,000 required signatures by last August, setting up the statewide ballot vote, then began aggressively campaigning this spring for a \u201cno\u201d vote \u2014 that is, a reversal of the legislative move.\u201cI\u2019ve been out knocking on doors, walking, since the middle of May,\u201d said Mark Staffne, an electrical construction mechanic and union member, who lives in St. Charles County, which is heavily Republican.\u201cI met both Republican voters who voted for Trump and labor Democrats who voted for Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cBy a vast majority, a huge amount of people I talked to said they\u2019re voting no.\u201dIf union fees are not mandatory, workers can enjoy the benefits of union representation without having to chip in for unions\u2019 work on their behalf, often known as the \u201cfree rider\u201d problem.These arguments appeared to resonate in Missouri, but Janice Fine, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers University, wondered whether the tendency of many unions to define their relationship with workers in narrow economic terms may be accelerating labor\u2019s decline over the long run.An overly transactional relationship might prove less compelling if workers feel they can spend their money better elsewhere \u2014 say, by joining a bowling league or a gym. The alternative would be to cultivate more of a philosophical commitment, making unions more akin to evangelical churches, albeit in the secular realm.\u201cI feel so ambivalent about that whole argument,\u201d Ms. Fine said, referring to the free-rider case against right-to-work laws.Any union that thought of itself primarily as providing benefits to members, she added, \u201chad a very thin notion of what solidarity was.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India\u2019s big outsourcing companies.India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said.\u201cIt requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. Aghi said. \u201cThese companies are creating jobs.\u201dAjay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules.\u201cOur framework will be fair to all stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Tame Health Care Spending? Look for One-Percent Solutions", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe the answer isn\u2019t something big, a group of economists is suggesting, but rather many small tweaks, such as reining in long-term care hospitals. But what if the most workable answer isn\u2019t something big, but hosts of small tweaks? A group of about a dozen health economists has begun trying to identify policy adjustments, sometimes in tiny slices of the health care system, that could produce savings worth around 1 percent of the country\u2019s $3.3 trillion annual health spending. If you put together enough such fixes, the group points out, they could add up to something more substantial. This is a shift from the kind of research that is typically rewarded by big journal editors and tenure committees, but it could turn out to have a crucial role in understanding why our health care system is so expensive, and so unusual.\u201cI think focusing on the forest misses the fact that there are trees encroaching out of the forest,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, a health economist at the Yale School of Management. \u201cAnd we need to start cutting them down.\u201dA working paper published Monday proposes one possible fix. In the 1980s, Congress carved out a small group of hospitals from its normal rules for payment. These \u201clong-term care hospitals,\u201d which treated patients with tuberculosis and chronic diseases, could earn far more money than traditional hospitals and nursing homes if they cared for patients who stayed with them for an average of 25 days. Since then, the number of these hospitals has mushroomed, from a few dozen to more than 400, most run by two for-profit chains.The researchers concluded that the health care system could probably save a lot of money \u2014 around $5 billion a year \u2014 by paying the long-term care hospitals the same prices that are paid to skilled nursing facilities, the places that most long-term patients end up in when there is no long-term care hospital nearby. The hospital industry disagrees with the paper\u2019s conclusion and disputes the notion that the extra money they get is wasteful. The American Hospital Association noted that since the study ended, Congress has changed the rules for long-term care hospitals so that fewer of their patients qualify for the highest payment rates. That means that the study results might be different if they looked at long-term hospital care in more recent years.Select Medical, one of the large chains of long-term care hospitals, said in a statement that measuring only whether the long-term care patients died or went home did not capture other, more subtle health benefits that the hospitals provided compared with other options. But the industry does not collect such measures of quality in a standardized way, making that theory hard to test.The National Association of Long Term Hospitals, a trade group, also noted that the paper\u2019s policy proposals were more extreme than those from other critics, who had suggested more minor changes to how the hospitals should be paid.Neale Mahoney, a health economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who was one of the working paper\u2019s co-authors, said the history of long-term care hospitals fit together with the economic analysis to suggest that the special hospital payment probably wasn\u2019t appropriate. \u201cWhat\u2019s convinced me that these institutions are a source of waste is a constellation of evidence rather than one piece of evidence,\u201d he said.Dr. Jeremy Kahn, a critical care physician and professor of health policy at the University of Pittsburgh, who has studied long-term care hospitals extensively, said there are some patients with particular ailments who benefit from the setting, but agreed with the economists that the hospitals are a historical accident, defined more by payment rules than patient needs. \u201cLong-term care hospitals aren\u2019t to blame here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see a dollar on the ground, you will pick it up, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here.\u201dMr. Mahoney said the economics profession is fond of broad conclusions. The typical paper takes a narrow case and tries to draw a broader conclusion about how the world works. But he increasingly thinks that there may be value in thinking small, doing more of what he calls \u201cforensic economics.\u201d\u201cI think people say that\u2019s too small \u2014 it\u2019s not going to change the trajectory \u2014 therefore we shouldn\u2019t spend time on it,\u201d said Ms. Morton, the Yale economist. \u201cAnd they are forgetting how many dollars there are.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Ships and Missiles, China Is Ready to Challenge U.S. Navy in Pacific", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALIAN, China \u2014 In April, on the 69th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s Navy, the country\u2019s first domestically built aircraft carrier stirred from its berth in the port city of Dalian on the Bohai Sea, tethered to tugboats for a test of its seaworthiness.\u201cChina\u2019s first homegrown aircraft carrier just moved a bit, and the United States, Japan and India squirmed,\u201d a military news website crowed, referring to the three nations China views as its main rivals.Not long ago, such boasts would have been dismissed as the bravado of a second-string military. No longer.A modernization program focused on naval and missile forces has shifted the balance of power in the Pacific in ways the United States and its allies are only beginning to digest.While China lags in projecting firepower on a global scale, it can now challenge American military supremacy in the places that matter most to it: the waters around Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.That means a growing section of the Pacific Ocean \u2014 where the United States has operated unchallenged since the naval battles of World War II \u2014 is once again contested territory, with Chinese warships and aircraft regularly bumping up against those of the United States and its allies.To prevail in these waters, according to officials and analysts who scrutinize Chinese military developments, China does not need a military that can defeat the United States outright but merely one that can make intervention in the region too costly for Washington to contemplate. Many analysts say Beijing has already achieved that goal.To do so, it has developed \u201canti-access\u201d capabilities that use radar, satellites and missiles to neutralize the decisive edge that America\u2019s powerful aircraft carrier strike groups have enjoyed. It is also rapidly expanding its naval forces with the goal of deploying a \u201cblue water\u201d navy that would allow it to defend its growing interests beyond its coastal waters.\u201cChina is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d the new commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, acknowledged in written remarks submitted during his Senate confirmation process in March.He described China as a \u201cpeer competitor\u201d gaining on the United States not by matching its forces weapon by weapon but by building critical \u201casymmetrical capabilities,\u201d including with anti-ship missiles and in submarine warfare. \u201cThere is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China,\u201d he concluded.Last year, the Chinese Navy became the world\u2019s largest, with more warships and submarines than the United States, and it continues to build new ships at a stunning rate. Though the American fleet remains superior qualitatively, it is spread much thinner.Only three years ago, Mr. Xi stood beside President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden and promised not to militarize artificial islands it has built farther south in the Spratlys archipelago. Chinese officials have since acknowledged deploying missiles there, but argue that they are necessary because of American \u201cincursions\u201d in Chinese waters.The People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 the bedrock of Communist power since the revolution \u2014 has actually shrunk in order to free up resources for a more modern fighting force. Since 2015, the army has cut 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel over all, compared with 1.4 million in the United States.While every branch of China\u2019s armed forces lags behind the United States\u2019 in firepower and experience, China has made significant gains in asymmetrical weaponry to blunt America\u2019s advantages. One focus has been in what American military planners call A2/AD, for \u201canti-access/area denial,\u201d or what the Chinese call \u201ccounter-intervention.\u201dA centerpiece of this strategy is an arsenal of high-speed ballistic missiles designed to strike moving ships. The latest versions, the DF-21D and, since 2016, the DF-26, are popularly known as \u201ccarrier killers,\u201d since they can threaten the most powerful vessels in the American fleet long before they get close to China.Such missiles pose a particular challenge to American commanders because neutralizing them might require an attack deep inside Chinese territory, which would be a major escalation.While all-out war between China and the United States seems unthinkable, the Chinese military is preparing for \u201ca limited military conflict from the sea,\u201d according to a 2013 paper in a journal called The Science of Military Strategy.Lyle Morris, an analyst with the RAND Corporation, said that China\u2019s deployment of missiles in the disputed Paracel and Spratly Islands \u201cwill dramatically change how the U.S. military operates\u201d across Asia and the Pacific.The best American response, he added, would be \u201cto find new and innovative methods\u201d of deploying ships outside their range. Given the longer range of the ballistic missiles, however, that is not possible \u201cin most contingencies\u201d the American Navy would be likely to face in Asia.The aircraft carrier that put to sea in April for its first trials is China\u2019s second, but the first built domestically. It is the most prominent manifestation of a modernization project meant to propel the country into the upper tier of military powers. Only the United States, with 11 nuclear-powered carriers, operates more than one.A third Chinese carrier is under construction in a port near Shanghai. Analysts believe China will eventually build five or six.The Chinese military, traditionally focused on repelling a land invasion, increasingly aims to project power into the \u201cblue waters\u201d of the world to protect China\u2019s expanding economic and diplomatic interests, from the Pacific to the Atlantic.The carriers attract the most attention but China\u2019s naval expansion has been far broader. The Chinese Navy \u2014 officially the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy \u2014 has built more than 100 warships and submarines in the last decade alone, more than the entire naval fleets of all but a handful of nations.Last year, China counted 317 warships and submarines in active service, compared with 283 in the United States Navy, which has been essentially unrivaled in the open seas since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The roots of China\u2019s focus on sea power and \u201carea denial\u201d can be traced to what many Chinese viewed as humiliation in 1995 and 1996. When Taiwan moved to hold its first democratic elections, China fired missiles near the island, prompting President Bill Clinton to dispatch two aircraft carriers to the region.As it has in its civilian economy, China has bought or absorbed technologies from the rest of the world, in some cases illicitly. Much of its military hardware is of Soviet origin or modeled on antiquated Soviet designs, but with each new wave of production, analysts say, China is deploying more advanced capabilities.China\u2019s military has encountered some growing pains. It is hampered by corruption, which Mr. Xi has vowed to wipe out, and a lack of combat experience. As a fighting force, it remains untested by combat.China\u2019s military advances have nonetheless emboldened the country\u2019s leadership.The Liaoning\u2019s battle group now routinely circles Taiwan. So do Chinese fighter jets and bombers.The recent Pentagon report noted that H-6 flights in the Pacific were intended to demonstrate the ability to strike American bases in Japan and South Korea, and as far away as Guam.\u201cCompetition is the American way of seeing it,\u201d said Li Jie, an analyst with the Chinese Naval Research Institute in Beijing. \u201cChina is simply protecting its rights and its interests in the Pacific.\u201dAnd China\u2019s interests are expanding.In 2017, it opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, saying that it will be used to support its participation in multinational antipiracy patrols off Somalia.\u201cThey soon will be able, for example, to send a squadron of ships to somewhere, say in Africa, and have all the capabilities to make a landing in force to protect Chinese assets,\u201d said Vassily Kashin, an expert with the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\u201cThe Chinese are going to be more present,\u201d Mr. Kashin added, \u201cand everyone has to get used to it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of submarines in China\u2019s naval fleet in 1995. There were 83, not three, according to Pentagon figures cited in the latest Congressional Research Service, though it noted that the figure included obsolete models.Olivia Mitchell Ryan and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The summit meeting itself helped set up this impasse. Its concluding communiqu\u00e9 committed the two leaders to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d without even defining \u201cdenuclearization,\u201d let alone explicitly agreeing on the sequence of actions to be taken. While such actions are a good beginning, they shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. Most are reversible and pale in comparison to the fact that the North continues to produce plutonium and enriched uranium, the fissile material needed for nuclear weapons, as well as to build ballistic missiles. The Americans have given up even less: Mr. Trump met with Mr. Kim in Singapore, agreed to the communiqu\u00e9 (however flawed) and suspended military exercises with South Korea. So where does that leave things? The administration\u2019s demand that North Korea take major steps toward denuclearization before the United States does anything to reciprocate is a recipe for failure. What\u2019s needed is a step-by-step process in which both sides take mutually reinforcing actions that begin to build confidence and a more stable security environment. But an interim declaration of peace is not the same as a peace treaty, which would presumably go into effect only when North Korea had denuclearized. The United States would always have the right to respond militarily if warranted. The administration doesn\u2019t have endless time to think this over. While the United States is narrowly focused on denuclearization and sanctions, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea seems set on an ambitious agenda, including pressing hard for the peace declaration and connecting the two Koreas and the wider region with a railway network. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have called for a radically different, peaceful relationship between their countries. That ambition carries big risks and potentially big gains for both leaders. To achieve their objectives, they will have to show more political will, courage and creativity than they have so far.Advertisement"}

Meanwhile, the stimulus did little to put people back to work. It was not the double-dip recession that critics feared but a long sluggish recovery that failed to affect the majority of the people.For example, it took six years (2009-15) for the unemployment rate to return to the pre-recession number. The share of income received by the top 1 percent had been 23 percent before the recession. After falling to 18 percent in 2010 it jumped back to 22 percent by 2015. Meanwhile, as late as 2015, the bottom 99 percent of the population had only recovered two-thirds of the income they had lost. Zakaria should have added a few words to his assertion that the rescue worked: It worked for the top 1 percent, not for the rest of us.The writer is an emeritus professor of economics at Western New England University.\u2666To the Editor:Fareed Zakaria\u2019s review of Adam Tooze\u2019s \u201cCrashed\u201d is an approving account of an approving book.

{"Headline": "Public Housing for Some, Instagram Selfie Backdrop for Others", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic housing estates in Hong Kong have become wildly popular destinations for photography, drawing the ire of some residents.The basketball courts at Choi Hung Estate, a public housing complex in Hong Kong, would seem the perfect place to play. Brightly painted in blue, orange, yellow and red, they are on the sunny roof of a two-story parking garage, and surrounded on three sides by equally colorful high-rise apartment buildings.But it can be hard to get a game going with all the people standing, sitting and lying down for pictures.As with so much architecture, good looks go a long way. But what many of the tourists toting selfie sticks do not realize is that the estates are miracles of public housing, creating affordable homes for millions of people in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities.\u201cA lot of Hong Kong\u2019s public housing estates were built at a time when modernism was an ascendant form of architecture,\u201d said Mr. DeWolf, 33. He said their clean lines and symmetry make them \u201cvery striking\u201d as photographic backdrops.The estates also provide a different view of Hong Kong, which is more often photographed for its iconic skyline.\u201cPosing in front of public housing complexes where so many people live creates the sense that they\u2019re in the middle of the world,\u201d said Cyrus Wong, an architectural assistant who researched the popularity of public housing on Instagram as part of his master\u2019s thesis.Sometimes, those selfie-takers are posing in the middle of a basketball game.Vincent Yeung, 23, has lived at Choi Hung Estate almost his entire life. On a recent Saturday afternoon, he was the lone basketball player on courts that were otherwise packed with photographers.\u201cThere are too many people taking photos here,\u201d he said. \u201cMy friends have gone elsewhere to play.\u201dA few months ago, he was playing a game of 3-on-3 when a couple decided to sit in the middle of the court for photos. A stray ball inevitably hit them, Mr. Yeung said, and the couple exploded in anger, cursing at him and his friends.\u201cIf we scold them, we\u2019re accused of discrimination,\u201d he said of the mainland tourists who are among the visitors to the estate. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t scold them \u2014 well, we\u2019re playing basketball here! It\u2019s really a dilemma.\u201dThere are no explicit rules against photography at the estates, but passcodes are required to enter the buildings themselves.\u201cIf almost half of the population lives in public housing, it becomes an everyday backdrop, rather than something separated and isolated,\u201d said Eric Schuldenfrei, an associate dean in the architecture department at the University of Hong Kong.Public housing has played an important role in Hong Kong\u2019s history, with government policy often reflecting the city\u2019s economic development.Hong Kong saw a huge influx of refugees from roughly 1937 to 1950, which was spurred by the Japanese invasion of China in the lead-up to World War II and continued through China\u2019s civil war. The city struggled to accommodate the newcomers, and hundreds of thousands ended up living in sprawling, overcrowded shantytowns packed with squatter huts.When a fire ripped through a squatter area on Christmas Day in 1953, displacing 53,000 people overnight, the government was forced to intervene. Temporary shelters and short-term resettlement centers were eventually replaced by permanent housing estates. One of the first was Choi Hung, built in 1964 to house some 43,000 people.Older housing estates like Choi Hung remind people of a more affordable era, Mr. DeWolf said. Many of them were built in the 1960s, when the city transformed itself into a booming manufacturing hub, and 1970s, when the economy took off.\u201cIn hindsight, there\u2019s this optimism,\u201d Mr. DeWolf said, \u201ca yearning for a time that maybe seemed more simple, when it seemed like everyone in Hong Kong had a shot at success.\u201dK. Pang, a retired civil servant in his 50s, recently returned with his family to Choi Hung, where he had spent much of his childhood.\u201cIt\u2019s nostalgic, to see an old estate like this now attracting tourists,\u201d Mr. Pang said as he watched his children pose for photos. In the old days, he said, estates like these were associated with crime, but he now appreciates that they have become a popular attraction.Nelson Yuen, 25, a lifelong resident of Choi Hung, has seen the camera-toting crowds descend on his backyard. Far from being annoyed, he decided to set up a photo stand with his girlfriend, selling Polaroid shots for 40 Hong Kong dollars, or about $5, each.\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty good, to make this place a tourist spot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than not having people here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But its most lasting impact could be to hobble the World Trade Organization.The global trade group has been thrust into an uncomfortable \u2014 and potentially damaging \u2014 role as chief judge in an intense fight among its most powerful members.At the center of the battle is whether the United States\u2019 claim that its sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs are necessary to protect national security or whether they are simply a ruse to protect American metal manufacturers from global competition. Allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union have challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs at the World Trade Organization, saying their metals pose no threat to America\u2019s national security. They have fired back with their own retaliatory tariffs, prompting the Trump administration to bring its own World Trade Organization complaints against those countries.Now, the global trade group is in the difficult position of having to make a ruling that could cause problems whatever it does.\u201cIt\u2019s putting tremendous stress on the system,\u201d said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law Center. \u201cThere are those who would go so far to say that the U.S. has almost effectively withdrawn from the W.T.O. by engaging in all the unilateral tariffs we\u2019ve seen.\u201dAny decision could prove to be the undoing of the World Trade Organization, which the United States helped establish in 1995 as a forum to settle trade disputes and to set rules that keep commerce flowing freely around the globe. A ruling against the Trump administration could prompt the United States to leave the W.T.O. entirely. But siding with the United States\u2019 claim of national security could also significantly diminish the organization\u2019s authority and prompt other countries to begin citing their own national security interests to ignore inconvenient rules on topics like intellectual property, environmental standards or farm subsidies.\u201cIf the United States has rewritten the rules of the W.T.O. system to say you can do anything you want if it\u2019s in your national security interests, be prepared for every country in the world to come up with a new definition of what is its critical national security interest,\u201d said Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council and a former deputy director general of the World Trade Organization.On Friday, the administration once again claimed national security when Mr. Trump decided to double the rate of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey. In a statement, Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, said that metal exports to the United States had not declined \u201cto levels sufficient to remove the threat to national security\u201d and that raising tariffs on Turkey would reduce that threat.Roberto Azev\u00eado, the World Trade Organization\u2019s current director general, said that while his group would rule impartially on challenges to the Trump administration\u2019s metal tariffs, any decision on such a sensitive political issue could create damaging tensions in the group.\u201cWhatever the outcome \u2014 regardless of how objective, balanced and unbiased it is \u2014 somebody is going to be very unhappy,\u201d he said last month.Mr. Trump has already undercut the World Trade Organization\u2019s authority in various ways, including publicly criticizing the body as a \u201cdisaster\u201d that has been \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the United States.The United States has also objected to the appointment of new members for a W.T.O. appeals body, a move that threatens to paralyze the group\u2019s ability to settle disputes. The Trump administration claims that the body is guilty of overreaching its mandate, especially in its opposition to levies the United States uses to combat unfair trade competition from abroad.By September, the appellate body, which typically has seven members, may dwindle to just three, the minimum needed to issue rulings. If the United States continues to withhold its approval of new appointments as members\u2019 terms expire, by the end of next year there may be only one panel member left.\u201cThe W.T.O. is obviously an important institution,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in December. \u201cBut, in our opinion, serious challenges exist.\u201dMeanwhile, the Trump administration continues to use the World Trade Organization to help fight its battles.The administration has participated in dozens of cases and filed complaints about the trade practices of China, the European Union, Mexico and others. American officials have also said they would like to improve the organization, though they have given few specifics. And the United States, the European Union and Japan are working on draft texts that would toughen rules on subsidies and state-owned enterprises \u2014 measures aimed at China, which, economists contend, uses a variety of methods to prop up its industries.Some trade experts have labeled this mixed stance pragmatic; others, hypocritical. But there\u2019s no doubt that America\u2019s ambivalent attitude toward the group has left a system in confusion, with the World Trade Organization on the brink of an existential crisis and the United States offering few clues about where its leadership \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 might lead.\u201cWhen we ask what\u2019s their plan, their answer is they don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pascal Lamy, president emeritus of the research organization the Jacques Delors Institute and director general of the World Trade Organization from 2005 to 2013. Mr. Lamy said that Mr. Trump\u2019s intention was to \u201cshake the system, and then we\u2019ll see.\u201d That, he said, was \u201cthe only explanation they gave.\u201dMr. Trump and some of his advisers argue that the United States has surrendered some of its advantage as the world\u2019s largest economy by taking part in a rules-based system. They see more advantage in negotiating with other countries one-on-one.That approach has alarmed American allies, who worry that without an organization capable of aiding trade deals and arbitrating disputes, the world would return to a survival-of-the-fittest system where only the biggest and most powerful would set the rules.\u201cIn such a world, where power has replaced rules as the basis for trade relations, it will be the smallest and poorest that will be hurt the most,\u201d Marc Vanheukelen, the European Union ambassador to the W.T.O., told a gathering of the organization\u2019s 164 members at the W.T.O.\u2019s lakeside headquarters in Geneva in late July.Mr. Vanheukelen was among dozens of members who stood to complain that the organization was on the verge of becoming dysfunctional. Many blame the Trump administration for encouraging other countries to flout long-established rules of the game and introducing a confrontational tone to an organization that has traditionally functioned by consensus and good will.The Trump administration has already supported other countries in using the same national security exemption it is citing for steel and aluminum tariffs. In late July, it revealed that it was siding with Russia in a case against Ukraine over Russian transit restrictions that cut Ukrainian exporters off from foreign markets. Like the United States, Russia claims that the World Trade Organization does not have the right to weigh in on what it considers a national security matter.The Trump administration is not the first American government to be critical of the World Trade Organization. And there is general agreement among W.T.O. members that it is badly in need of an overhaul. Most concede that the dispute arbitration system, though essential, is guilty of overreach and inefficiency.\u201cOne may not approve of what Donald Trump says, but it wouldn\u2019t be wise to ignore what he says,\u201d Mr. Azevedo said. \u201cThe U.S. is not the only one seeking to further modernize or reform the W.T.O.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Geneva, Switzerland.

They said on Thursday that 35 officials would be held accountable.\u201cVaccines are a matter of public health and national security,\u201d the Politburo Standing Committee, which Mr. Xi leads, said in a statement that was published by Xinhua, the official news agency. \u201cThis case resulted in a negative impact and exposed many loopholes.\u201dThe committee also urged the China Food and Drug Administration and local government agencies to engage in \u201cprofound self-criticism.\u201dMr. Xi\u2019s personal oversight of the punishments reflected his determination to move beyond the scandal at a difficult moment in his presidency.\u201cThere\u2019s no one else to blame when scandals like this erupt,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a political analyst who is a senior adviser and China head at Crumpton Group.The government focused its investigation on a drug producer in northeast China, Changchun Changsheng, which was accused of making 252,600 doses of ineffective vaccines. The company\u2019s chairwoman and 17 other employees were detained last month in connection with the case, according to state news reports.This past week, the government said it had discovered that Changchun Changsheng, located in Jilin Province, had produced a second batch of 247,200 faulty vaccines, for a total of 499,800 doses. Officials say the company falsified data and used expired ingredients. Most of the vaccines were given to children in eastern China.The six officials at the China Food and Drug Administration who were dismissed on Saturday were blamed for failing to catch safety violations at Changchun Changsheng.The four officials fired on Thursday include Bi Jingquan, a former head of the China Food and Drug Administration; Jin Yuhui, a vice governor of Jilin Province who oversaw food and drug safety; Li Jinxiu, another Jilin official who supervised food and drug safety; and Liu Changlong, the mayor of Changchun, the provincial capital.A former top official at the China Food and Drug Administration, Wu Zhen, was placed under investigation for corruption, Xinhua said.The government said last month that another company, the state-owned Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, had produced more than 400,000 flawed vaccines. But that company was given a relatively light punishment and was allowed to resume operations.Parents said they were still angry about the vaccines and were skeptical of the government\u2019s vow to clean up the industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t really care who has been punished,\u201d said Min Wen, a father from the southern city of Guangzhou who has pushed the government to compensate the families of children who received the bad vaccines. \u201cWe care about who will be responsible for our children.\u201dIris Zhao contributed research.Advertisement"}

Mr. Powell emphasized the difficulties of understanding America\u2019s changing economy and argued for a flexible approach.But in concentrating on why macroeconomic forecasting is hard, Mr. Powell may have passed up a high-profile opportunity to drill down on some of the forces that could have a real bearing on the economy in the coming months \u2014 and that have bedeviled Fed policymakers in the past. These include a stock market that hit an all-time high on Friday.Enticingly, Mr. Powell did refer in passing to the challenge posed by frothy financial markets. When inflation is low, it can make sense to keep monetary policy relatively loose, but doing so can drive stock and bond prices higher. \u201cWhatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell probably isn\u2019t worried about the markets.

While some asset prices are high by historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage.\u201dHis view may be correct, but Mr. Powell could explain how he arrived at that conclusion. And if stocks keep going up, and debt markets become more speculative, the Fed arguably owes it to the public to be more forthcoming.No one wants dogma from central bankers, but Hamlet-like equivocation is of limited use.

{"Headline": "Qatar Comes to Aid of Turkey, Offering $15 Billion Lifeline", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey won a measure of international support in its increasingly tense standoff with the United States on Wednesday when Qatar offered a relatively small but symbolically important financial lifeline.Qatar pledged to invest $15 billion in Turkey after a lunch in Ankara, Turkey\u2019s capital, between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, representatives of both governments said.The sum is a small fraction of what Turkey would need to shore up its faltering economy or pay its dollar debts, which have become increasing unsustainable after a sharp decline in the Turkish lira.President Trump imposed 50 percent tariffs on imported Turkish steel last week after talks to release Mr. Brunson broke down, effectively cutting off Turkish steel makers from their largest foreign market.Qatar\u2019s financial support for Turkey was another demonstration of their alliance amid the shifting geopolitical fault lines of the region, in which they have often lined up in opposition to the Trump-allied rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.While a few countries like Russia have offered rhetorical support for Turkey, Qatar is the first to pledge money.The financial support \u201cconfirms that Qatar continues to promote economic cooperation between the two countries and we have full confidence in the strength of the Turkish economy,\u201d a spokesman for the Qatari government wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday.In June 2017, Turkey was among the first countries to side with Qatar after four Arab countries, led by the Saudis and Emiratis, imposed a punishing trade and diplomatic embargo against Qatar.As most Western countries sought to keep out of the dispute, Mr. Erdogan sided firmly with Qatar, pledging to send troops to Qatar at a time when Qatari officials feared Saudi military action was imminent.Mr. Brunson, who had asked a court to free him on health grounds, was moved to house arrest last month after his initial detention 22 months ago on charges of aiding terrorist groups touched off a diplomatic dispute between the United States and Turkey.The Trump administration has pressed hard for the release of Mr. Brunson, an evangelical pastor who has lived in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir for 23 years and ran the Resurrection Church in Izmir. American officials say he is innocent of all charges.Washington ordered financial sanctions against the Turkish interior minister and justice minister after Turkey prolonged Mr. Brunson\u2019s detention in July. Days later, the Turkish lira began its precipitous fall, worsened by Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement of additional tariffs.Turkey has requested Mr. Gulen\u2019s extradition from the United States, but Washington has not moved on the request. Diplomats concur that Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers were among the leaders of the coup attempt but say there is little evidence of Mr. Gulen\u2019s involvement that would satisfy a court.American officials have accused Turkey of detaining the American citizens and consular employees as leverage in the dispute.Washington has said that he was convicted without credible evidence, though the Turkish government has defended his trial and sentence. Mr. Golge is appealing. His wife, Kubra, also a Turkish-American, is barred from traveling outside Turkey.Another Turkish-American couple who work at a private university in western Turkey have been sentenced to 10 years in prison, also for links to a terrorist organization. The husband, a business administrator, remains in high-security detention at the Sincan prison complex, where Mr. Brunson spent some of his detention.The wife, who asked that their names not be published for fear of affecting their cases, has been released pending appeal because she has a small child. If their sentences are upheld by the Supreme Court, she will have to serve her term in prison.Others who have been prosecuted include two brothers from Pennsylvania: Ismail Kul, a chemistry professor at Widener University; and his brother, Mustafa Kul, a real-estate agent. They were arrested in August 2016 at their home in Bursa, in northwest Turkey, during a summer vacation. They were accused of being members of the Gulen movement and of playing a part in the failed coup.Ismail Kul had lived in the United States since 1994, received a master\u2019s degree and doctorate from Clemson University in South Carolina and owns two patents in the United States, according to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.At his trial, which is continuing, Mr. Kul admitted knowing Mr. Gulen but exposed the shakiness of the government\u2019s charges when he explained that it was a member of the governing Justice and Development Party, Ahmet Aydin, the deputy chairman of Parliament, who first took him to meet the cleric.\u201cIn 2010, I met Ahmet Aydin at a culture festival in Philadelphia,\u201d Mr. Kul told the court, the nationalist daily newspaper Sozcu reported in January. \u201cI had breakfast with him and his detail,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThey told me that they will see Gulen and suggested that I accompany them. That\u2019s how I met Fethullah Gulen. After that, I visited Gulen four or five times.\u201dOf the Turkish employees of the American consular mission, Hamza Ulucay, who had worked for 36 years in the American Consulate in Adana, in southeastern Turkey, was detained in February 2017 and indicted on a charge of having contacts with the Gulen movement and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, known as the P.K.K. His trial is continuing.Two other employees of the American Consulate in Istanbul were also detained and have yet to be indicted. Metin Topuz, who has worked at the mission for the Drug Enforcement Administration for more than 20 years, was arrested on charges similar to those against Mr. Ulucay in October.Days after Mr. Topuz\u2019s arrest, the Istanbul police searched the home of a third employee, Mete Canturk, who has also worked for years at the Istanbul consulate.

But even as Mr. Morrison promised some continuity, it was clear from his appointments that the rift \u2014 which produced Australia\u2019s sixth prime minister since 2010 \u2014 is far from resolved and will continue to shape the country.The most significant changes in the cabinet involve Australia\u2019s relationship to the world. Julie Bishop, 62, the widely respected foreign minister under Mr. Turnbull, resigned on Sunday before Mr. Morrison\u2019s announcement, removing herself from contention after losing the three-person contest to succeed Mr. Turnbull.\u201cFuture female Liberal leaders must be looking at this result and learning that competence, loyalty and vote appeal are not enough to win the top job,\u201d said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University in the state of Queensland.She described the ouster of Mr. Turnbull, engineered by conservative male lawmakers, as \u201ca terrible display of toxic masculinity\u201d that pushed out talent and eroded faith in democracy.One lawmaker who mounted that challenge, only to lose in the final party vote \u2014 Peter Dutton, 47, a former police officer from Queensland \u2014 will return to the cabinet. He was appointed on Sunday to a role he has held before, home affairs minister, but with a redefined portfolio. Immigration will now be a ministry of its own, led by David Coleman, 44, a lawmaker from a multicultural district of New South Wales.Mr. Morrison said that Mr. Dutton would focus primarily on security and law enforcement, leaving immigration, citizenship and multicultural issues to others \u2014 signaling a demotion for the anti-immigrant politics that Mr. Dutton has become known for.Alan Tudge, 47, becomes the minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population, a position the new prime minister described as \u201cthe minister for \u2018congestion busting,\u2019\u201d as Australia seeks to manage the impact of population growth in its cities.The energy and environment portfolios are also being reorganized. They were managed by a single ministry, under Josh Frydenberg, who has been promoted and is now Mr. Morrison\u2019s deputy.But that combination of issues was Mr. Turnbull\u2019s undoing; the challenge to his leadership began after conservatives rejected Mr. Turnbull\u2019s proposal to reduce energy prices and emissions with a single piece of legislation called the National Energy Guarantee.Angus Taylor, 51, becomes energy minister, and Melissa Price, 54, environment minister. Mr. Morrison noted that the government\u2019s focus would now be on \u201cmore and new and innovative ways\u201d to reduce energy prices.He did not mention climate change or emissions at any point in his announcement.He said he would travel on Monday to western Queensland to meet farmers affected by a punishing drought that has devastated an area larger than Texas.Advertisement"}

Born in Houston, Tex., in 1951.New York City climate-change scenarios project that by 2100 water levels will rise by up to six feet. While this possibility is a long way off, what we do in the present will affect the future and determine the outcome of rising oceans.Studies reveal that electronic devices and internet use impair empathy. Conversely, natural and social tragedies like hurricanes and school shootings can rekindle it and inspire us to act, motivating students to mobilize and strangers to assist strangers. \u201cUnmoored\u201d is a downloadable app that places the phenomenon of rising sea levels within our electronic devices. Those who download the app and look up through their phones in Times Square can experience an incoming flotilla of boats of all kinds make its way around existing buildings and create a nautical traffic jam above. The boats occasionally bump into each other, breaking the silence of a surreal floating canopy. Enlarged forms of plankton appear and seem to seek connection with the human audience. Because augmented and mixed reality formats use the real world as backdrops, inserting an apparition of the future on devices puts a phenomenological experience into the hands of the individual.\u201cUnmoored\u201d is a work designed to engender a moment of awe, one that offers a glimpse into the future, witnessed through the technology of the present. Born in Albany, N.Y., in 1964.By mapping the impending crisis, I make the invisible visible. Block by block, house by house, neighbor by neighbor, I want to make the future impact of sea level rise something impossible to ignore.

One vote per household. Only individuals bringing picture IDs and proof of elevation will be allowed to vote.The Dear Climate project began with a desire to expand the social conversation about climate change by engaging people\u2019s imaginations and feelings about the nonhuman world. \u201cRetool your inner climate,\u201d one of our early slogans suggested. Moving beyond the fear and guilt that dominates the climate conversation, we wanted \u2014 as our name implies \u2014 to cultivate a sense of affection for the climate, and to recognize its ancient and complex relationship to human cultures. Our goal was to nudge aside the modern habit of thinking of nature and culture as opposites, which leads us to forget that we are earthlings, one species among many that share this planet. Dear Climate dwells on the deep entanglements of our species with not only animals, but also plants, minerals, organic matter and the bio-geo-physical systems (including climate) that govern the Earth. Highlighting this aspect of human life could help to mend the broken connections, or restore the lost understandings, that have put us on a collision course with our own home planet. This poster is meant to encourage viewers to consider the following questions: Can you give up some of your separateness? Can you take other forms and merge with other beings? Can you have less distinct edges? Can you embrace your inherent porousness as an earthly organism? Born in South Natick, Mass., in 1982.\u201cArctic Ocean\u201d is a pastel drawing on paper that depicts an aerial view of summer sea ice off the northwest coast of Ellesmere Island, Canada. The inspiration for the piece came from several flights I took with IceBridge, a NASA operation that has been mapping the ice at both poles for over a decade. The data that IceBridge collects provides crucial information on how our polar regions are responding to climate change, helping scientists to predict the effects ice melt will have on rising sea levels and the global climate system. My work, including \u201cArctic Ocean,\u201d aims to illuminate this data through a medium that can move us in a way that statistics cannot. The remote regions I draw are the keystones of climate change but are inaccessible to most people. I draw as much precise detail as I can in order to transport the viewer to a place that is otherwise distant and abstract. I convey the beauty of these vulnerable landscapes, as opposed to their devastation, to inspire viewers to help protect and preserve them.I am curious about the ways that landscape contributes to social, political and psychic ideas of space, particularly within the rural American South. I consider landscape\u2019s role in Americana and how the natural environment functions in the drama of American life. In my treatment of land, the natural environment is the central protagonist in the unfolding history of this nation and our contemporary culture. My approach to climate change focuses on how the increasing vulnerability of the environment is directly related to that of certain communities that live within it, on how climate-related natural disasters illuminate existing social and political inequality.I\u2019ve been exploring these ideas primarily in my home regions \u2014 I was born in Kentucky, raised in Florida and my maternal family\u2019s farm and homestead lies in the rural flatlands of western Tennessee. I made \u201cBrecencia and Pheasant III\u201d in North Florida, as part of an ongoing collection of works seeking to animate the land as a guide and witness by staging a series of environmental portraits. These photographs and videos feature a cast of mythical characters based on family stories and folk tales from the region. Each character responds to the changing environment in distinct ways \u2014 from curiosity, to grief, to rage.Born in London, United Kingdom, in 1969. \u201cThe Intermediaries\u201d are half-spectral things and warnings for the indifferent. We seem to be pushing our planet, and the other creatures on it, to the edge, and we turn our stories about climate change and our destruction of resources into our excuses of survival and need. Mother Nature is more powerful than us all. When she speaks we will have no choice but to listen.Born in Rockville, Conn., in 1978. This photograph was taken in Utah, at a point equidistant from Bears Ears National Monument and Daneros Uranium Mine. A recent order by President Donald J. Trump shrank the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument by nearly 700,000 acres, and it seems likely that more mining will come to the area. The text on the pine box is from Samuel Beckett\u2019s 1953 novel The Unnamable. \u201cIt is because there is nothing. It is because I have no Eyes.\u201d Here, in this context, the excerpt prompts us to ask: What do people see when they experience this land, and what is hidden? The objects in the photograph \u2014 clays used for pigments, tools containing uranium, copper used in bullets \u2014 were found in the area, and expose its contradictions: Extraction and smelting processes toxify the land and its dependents, while the extracted elements are simultaneously necessary to create the goods that sustain many ways of life. Most of my work is environmental, ranging from \u201cSwale\u201d (2016-2018) \u2014 a floating food forest on a barge (currently docked at the Brooklyn Army Terminal) where people can freely forage \u2014 to \u201cAlong the Lines of Displacement\u201d (2018), which consists of several palm trees transplanted from Florida to Storm King Art Center in New York, and speaks to climate migration while speculating on the future of the region at the turn of this century, just over 80 years from now.Climate change is a wicked problem, and it affects everything else that we are grappling with on a daily basis: social justice, housing, immigration, food and water access. Artists have the capacity to shape climate communications, solutions and engagement. We can use our unique skill sets to heal communities, tackle complex challenges and even create innovative answers. For me, comprehending the science is the first step in defining a project. Understanding the impacts, predictions, remediation and adaptation help to ground the work in reality. Much of my work is focused on the waterways that surround us. This image is based on the research I have undertaken to better understand New York City\u2019s urban waterways. This research includes the mapping of these waterways now and at the end of this century, when scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect sea levels to have risen by about six feet. I have also been mapping myriad aspects of the waterways, including how they intersect and influence one another, and I have been getting to know professionals shaping the future of the water, as well as people who use the city\u2019s waterways recreationally and who understand them through decades of experience and intimate observation. Through all of this, I aim to ignite radical ideas for the future of the waterways in light of the climate chaos we are already witnessing.Born in Neenah, Wis., in 1989.Making artwork about climate change is inextricably tied to the history of human intervention in lands and waterways. In the Southeast, where I live, that means contending with the history of colonization, war, the slave trade and mass industrialization as a backdrop to the onslaught of droughts, super storms and rising tides of the ecological future. I\u2019ve been traveling to barrier islands from the Mid-Atlantic down and around to the Gulf of Mexico, because these sites are not only rapidly changing from the acceleration of climate change and rising sea levels but also bear the marks of the violent history of America. I wanted to document this sculpture on Daufuskie Island in South Carolina, which was originally a home to indigenous Muscogee peoples before being invaded by Europeans. The island then became part of the slave plantation economy until the Civil War. Following the War, freed slaves turned the island into their home, and the Gullah Geechee identity and culture that developed throughout the Lowcountry region thrived there for decades until wealthy white vacationers began to reclaim the island as their personal playground around the 1980s. I traveled with this piece from Atlanta in a ferry down the Intracoastal Waterway and then in a rickety golf cart to the island\u2019s public beach. I washed her in the hot salty waves and then I stripped down to my underwear and flung myself into the ocean too. The water was so warm, almost bathlike, and I floated and bobbed along the shore, the McMansions behind me partially obscured by trees covered in Spanish moss, and in front of me, a horizon dotted only by a handful of tankers pulling cargo into port. My barrier island works are markers, clocks, fragile emblems, souvenirs of places that exist in conflict with their past and in defiance of their future.Born in New York, N.Y., in 1962.I first heard the words \u201cclimate change\u201d in 1994 when I asked a paleontologist friend \u201cWhat are you afraid of for our future?\u201d He mentioned climate change and told me why he was scared. I was terrified but hopeful that we could rally as a species and avoid disaster. A lot has changed since then \u2014 mainly, from an environmental perspective \u2014 for the worse. I used to hope that knowledge and information would open our eyes to environmental devastation and that we would save the world. I made art partly to cope with what I was witnessing and to support a campaign for conservation. I believed that if one could render moments of extinction, genocide, population explosion and political discord visible, then we might learn to confront and change the conditions leading to civilization\u2019s collapse. Over the past two decades, I realized we have a crucial Achilles heel: Our brains are wired to be tribal and to think only in the seasonal short term. Even someone as persuasive as Al Gore could not successfully galvanize the world with his books and films. The idea of \u201csacrificing\u201d for the future seems ridiculous to most people when they are entrenched in a daily struggle for survival. Even if they will listen, people just don\u2019t have the collective will to do much. The engine of capitalism is too powerful. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Prosperity Has Increased but Happiness Has Not ", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur well-being is local and relative \u2014 if you live in a struggling area and your status is slipping, even if you are relatively comfortable, you are probably at least a bit miserable. Mr. Rauch is the author of \u201cThe Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50.\u201dThat slap-down was an iconic formulation of a premise of the Thatcher-Reagan conservative revolution: Poverty is a social problem, but inequality, as such, is not. Governments should aim to increase the incomes and opportunities of all, especially the poor, but to worry about the gap between the rich and the rest is \u201cthe politics of envy.\u201d Morally speaking, Mrs. Thatcher and Ronald Reagan should have been right. As long as I am better off, why should I begrudge your doing better still? Yet something was amiss with this consensus \u2014 something that goes far to explain why Reagan-Thatcher conservatism has caved in under pressure from the populisms of President Trump on the right and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the left.Second, all happiness is relative. Although moral philosophers may wish Homo sapiens were wired more rationally, we humans are walking, talking status meters, constantly judging our worth and social standing by comparing ourselves with others today and with our own prior selves.In a poor country with low inequality, rising national income should make people happier, and of course reducing poverty is a good in and of itself. But in a wealthy, unequal country like today\u2019s America, gains in national income can decouple from well-being. \u201cEach person would become happier because he was richer, but less happy because other people were richer,\u201d Mr. Layard writes. \u201cThe two effects would cancel each other out, because relative income would be unchanged.\u201d In light of what happiness economists have had to say, the interesting question is not why the Reagan-Thatcher consensus finally failed but why it prevailed for two generations. Partly, I think, because its call to transcend envy is morally appealing, and partly because, in the 1980s and 1990s, pro-growth policies and free-market economics seemed to have turned around a troubled economy. But partly also because there was no viable alternative. Mainstream liberalism worried about inequality but offered only policies that much of the public viewed as discredited or unfair.Now the Reagan-Thatcherist alternative has crumbled, too. In 2008, the economic meltdown made the system look rigged and ignited a populist backlash. In 2016, the backlash coalesced behind the populisms of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders, each of whom had a compelling story to tell those suffering from real or perceived loss of status: We will de-rig the system with radical solutions like trade wars and socialized medicine. Those may be (as I believe) wrong answers to the problem of inequality, but they are answers, and their appeal is evident.Today it is free-market conservatism that is voiceless. After insisting for two generations that inequality does not matter, the heirs of Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher \u2014 people like the House speaker, Paul Ryan \u2014 have neither a coherent program to reduce inequality nor a philosophical rationale to seek one. Like it or not, inequality in today\u2019s America drives politics toward rage and polarization, and toward destabilizing and dangerous populisms of both left and right. Trumpism and Sandersism have something to say about inequality, but mainstream conservatism does not, and it will be no match for them until it does.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Martin Shubik, Economist and Game Theory Pioneer, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Shubik, an economist whose prescient visions of a computerized world and pioneering applications of game theory to everyday life enlivened what has been described as the dismal science, died on Aug. 22 at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 92.The cause was complications of inclusion body myositis, an inflammatory muscle disease, his daughter, Claire Shubik-Richards, said.Professor Shubik, the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe, was born in New York, raised in England and evacuated to Canada before the Blitz in 1940.Although he considered himself a social scientist and a \u201cmicro-microeconomist,\u201d Professor Shubik, who taught at the Yale School of Management, disdained purely theoretical analysis and was nothing if not practical. (He applied to Princeton instead of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said, mainly because the application was much shorter.)As early as the mid-1960s, he was predicting that \u201ccomputing machines\u201d would become standard in homes and schools by 1990 and that \u201csociety would fall to bits of its own weight\u201d without them.He warned, however, that the computers ultimately would be in human hands, and that the people responsible for them had better be not merely smart but also nice.Professor Shubik published hundreds of research papers, delving into subjects including terrorism, football, nuclear strategy, antitrust and the demographics of inclusion body myositis, the disease from which he suffered (in a paper he wrote with his son-in-law, Seth Richards-Shubik, also an economics professor).In the mid-1970s, he and Albert Madansky of the University of Chicago conducted a blind taste test to determine which of four Manhattan delicatessens produced the best sandwiches.When self-appointed deli mavens critiqued his methodology and stodgy economists chided his flippancy, Professor Shubik wrote that his research represented \u201ca modest attempt to preserve for the annals, before it became too late, a record of the Great American Vanishing Species known as the Pastrami and the Corned Beef Sannawiches.\u201d He also issued a warning: \u201cRun, my friend \u2014 do not walk, for time is short and the world is about to be buried in bran flakes.\u201d (In fact, all four of the delis the professors tested are now defunct.)At Princeton, they, John Nash and another mathematician were among the creators of an economic strategy game, \u201cSo Long Sucker,\u201d in which four players can make, and renege on, agreements with one another.Martin Shubik was born on March 24, 1926, in Manhattan to Joseph Shubik, who was born in Russia and was in New York working for a Scottish flax and linen company, and Sara (Soloveychik) Shubik.Two years after Martin was born, the family returned to England, where he was raised until the onslaught of German air raids, when he, his mother and his sister were sent to join relatives in Canada. He finished high school there.He did well in algebra but poorly in geometry. (\u201cI see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two,\u201d he said in an interview last year with the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.)He served in the Royal Canadian Navy as a lieutenant, graduated in 1947 from the University of Toronto with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and earned a master\u2019s in political economy there after writing his thesis on the Incas\u2019 use of knotted strings for accounting and inventory.He stumbled into game theory as a specialty after he was required in college to review a book and randomly chose \u201cThe Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,\u201d by John von Neumann and Morgenstern.After earning his doctorate at Princeton, he worked as a consultant for General Electric and for IBM, whose thinking about research scientists he later described to The New York Times: \u201cWell, these are like giant pandas in a zoo. You don\u2019t really quite know what a giant panda is, but you sure as hell know (1) you paid a lot of money for it, and (2) other people want it; therefore it is valuable and therefore it\u2019s got to be well fed.\u201dIn 1963 he joined the faculty at Yale, where he became professor of mathematical institutional economics in the School of Management. He became an emeritus professor in 2007.In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Julie (Kahn) Shubik; two grandchildren; and his sister, Irene Shubik, a television producer. His brother, Philippe, a cancer researcher, died in 2004.While he was an expert on computer modeling and wrote or contributed to a dozen books, including \u201cThe Aggressive Conservative Investor\u201d (2008), Professor Shubik explained in 1981 that it was impossible to predict any relationship between the economy and the stock market. Still, he netted several million dollars by investing more than 90 percent of his assets in stocks.In so-called war games, too, he believed that variables and alternatives left the conclusions open to human analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of comparative Rasputinology,\u201d he said in 1978, \u201ca question of which czar listens to which Rasputin.\u201dWhat Professor Shubik predicted confidently was that scientific knowledge would continue to expand exponentially, and while he was willing to cede questions like whether God exists to cosmology and theology, he said the answer might lie at a boundary within the reach of forthcoming technology.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the journey.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of a Nobel-winning economist with whom Professor Shubik collaborated. He was Lloyd S. Shapley, not Shapely.Advertisement"}

If demand for copper starts to fall off, pushing prices lower, the argument goes, then it\u2019s a good clue that industrial economies are slowing down.Concern about China, the single largest consumer of the metal, is the primary source of this weakness. The country\u2019s economic outlook has darkened since the trade war with the United States began, right around when copper prices were at their peak.\u201cThe sell-off started with the tariffs,\u201d said Natasha Kaneva, an analyst who follows copper at JPMorgan Chase in New York. \u201cAbsolutely you can say that that was the catalyst.\u201dIn the second quarter, nonperforming loans at Chinese banks notched their biggest rise in over a decade, according to research from Capital Economics. Corporate bond defaults are on the rise, and earlier this week, official reports showed Chinese investment growth, which has long been a driver of the economy, fell to its lowest level since the late 1990s.\u201cThere is a combination of things going on,\u201d said Simona Gambarini, a commodities economist at Capital Economics. \u201cA strong dollar, China slowing, concern about a trade war between China and the U.S., which doesn\u2019t bode well for China in particular but for the global economy as well.\u201dThe pressure on the Chinese economy is beginning to take its toll in other places, too. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has fallen more than 9 percent against the dollar in the last six months and China\u2019s CSI 300 index of blue chip stocks is off 19 percent this year.Such concerning signals emanating from a country that accounts for roughly 15 percent of the world economy might give some investors pause. But for now, investors in the United States seem to see China as someone else\u2019s problem.But if the slump in copper prices is a harbinger of a significant slowdown in global economic growth, American investors could eventually feel the pain.Large American companies rely on sales outside of the United States for substantial portions of their revenue. Last year, 44 percent of the revenues of companies in the S.&P. 500 came from foreign countries, with Asia being the single largest regional source of sales, according to data from S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.Investors seem broadly split over whether American markets can continue to separate themselves from worries about global growth.In early August, Bank of America Merrill Lynch surveyed 185 money managers with over $500 billion in assets. One question asked whether the American economy could continue outperform the rest of the world.Respondents were split, with 34 percent saying they thought the United States could continue to do better and 32 percent saying they expected growth in the United States to start to slow down.The majority of the fund managers, however, agreed about what could be the biggest risk to the market. About 57 percent answered that the top risk was \u201ctrade war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stock Buybacks Continue to Break Records", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple is handing cash back to its shareholders at an unprecedented rate.The iPhone maker repurchased $43.5 billion of its own stock during the first six months of this year. Not only is that up from more than $14 billion during the same period last year, but the company\u2019s repurchases in the past two quarters also rank as the biggest in history, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.& P. Dow Jones Indices.Among companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, each of the five largest quarterly stock buybacks on record was by Apple.Apple\u2019s increased spending on its own shares follows the $1.5 trillion tax cut signed into law late last year. The overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The aim was to encourage companies to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories to stimulate the American economy.Like most stock repurchase efforts, Apple\u2019s buyback program has helped bolster its share price in recent years. Apple shares are up 18 percent this year and nearly 150 percent since March 2012. By reducing the number of shares on the market, buybacks also lift a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 a key metric for investors. For instance, Apple\u2019s earning per share grew 40 percent last quarter compared with the same period last year, while its net income rose just 32 percent.Apple\u2019s buyback binge also affects the calculation of its stock market value, which is approaching $1 trillion. Based on its share count from its fiscal second-quarter filing, the company would have a market value of $984 billion Wednesday. But Apple reduced its share count by 5.5 percent during its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. That means Apple\u2019s market capitalization stands at roughly $970 billion, and its shares now need to hit $206.49 for the company to be valued at $1 trillion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Ancient River in Syria Sections Off a Modern War", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZOUR MAGHAR, Syria \u2014 On the eastern bank of the Euphrates River, Kurdish militiamen aligned with American troops burrow into sandbagged positions and eye their foes across the water.On the other side, Arab rebels backed by Turkey shoot at anyone who nears the river.For millenniums, the Euphrates has given farmers in the village of Zour Maghar water to irrigate fields of wheat, eggplant and sunflowers. Generations of families have sprawled on its banks for picnics, the older children teaching the younger to swim.But after seven years of war, the river that has fed life in Syria\u2019s parched east has become a hostile front, separating warring sides as it travels north to south. Deprived of its water, families have fled Zour Maghar, abandoning their mud-brick homes and leaving their fields idle.\u201cThe river was everything for us,\u201d said Muhammad Bozan, 35, a farmer who can no longer work his waterfront land. \u201cWe used to live from the river and now we can\u2019t.\u201dSyria\u2019s war has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions and left entire cities in smoking ruins. It has also ensnared the Euphrates, an arc of the Fertile Crescent that is considered a cradle of civilization.On a recent trip along the river, we found a wasteland dotted with depopulated towns, gutted factories and civilians struggling to get by.We mostly stayed on the east bank, an area out of Damascus\u2019s hands that is effectively stateless and boxed in by hostile powers. The only way in was to cross the Tigris River from Iraq in a shaky, seatless motorboat.As the government of President Bashar al-Assad has focused its military power on defeating rebels in the north and south, the river has emerged as the collision point for the great powers and their local allies struggling for influence in the east.On the eastern bank are mostly American-backed Kurdish-led militias. On the west, along the northern part of the river, are Turkish-backed rebels. Farther south are Syrian forces supported by Russia and Iran. The Islamic State still holds a pocket along the river near the border with Iraq.TURKEYZour MagharEuphrates RiverManbijSYRIALake AssadRaqqaTabqa DamDeir al-Zour80 milesTURKEYArea ofdetailSYRIALEBANONDamascusIRAQJORDAN100 milesBy The New York TimesFor now, the division is holding because none of the other powers wants to confront the United States, which has about 2,000 soldiers on the eastern side and whose fighter jets control the skies there.The immediate question is how long the United States will stay. President Trump has said he wants to pull out the troops, who lead an international coalition against the Islamic State. If he does, the United States\u2019 local allies fear the worst.\u201cThe mere presence of the coalition in the region gives a message to the regime and to the Turks not to interfere: \u2018This is where you stop,\u2019 \u201d said Muhammad Kheir Sheikho, a member of the civil council in Manbij. \u201cThe withdrawal of the coalition forces, and at their head the American forces, would cause complete chaos in the area.\u201dThree hulking, armored American military vehicles leave their base in the olive groves east of Manbij and rumble off to patrol the front lines. American soldiers staff gun turrets atop each vehicle, helicopters or drones fly overhead, and the convoy flies large American flags to make it clear who is driving.The Americans came to Syria in 2014 to fight the Islamic State, but the jihadist group\u2019s nearest outpost is 200 miles away. The convoy heads out several times a day to protect Manbij, a town with no resources and which few Americans have heard of, from Turkey, a NATO ally.The American presence in Manbij is a clear indication that the United States came to Syria with one goal but picked up others along the way, complicating a potential withdrawal.As the United States worked with Kurdish forces to take territory back from the Islamic State, its footprint in eastern Syria expanded. The area, about one-quarter of Syria and mostly desert, is now dotted with American military bases \u2014 housed in fields, in an out-of-use cement factory and in oil and gas facilities that the Syrian government would like to take back.The American security umbrella has allowed Manbij to become a relatively stable island in a war-torn country. It is a local economic hub, with a bustling market and about 200,000 new residents displaced from elsewhere.But Turkey sees Syria\u2019s Kurdish militia as a terrorist threat on its border and has threatened to attack it. The United States worries that a Turkish attack on Manbij would siphon off the Kurdish fighters from the battle against the Islamic State in the south. Thus the American patrols to keep the Turks at bay.But as the battle against the Islamic State winds down, the Americans will have less reason to stay.On the flat roof of a cinder-block farmhouse converted into a military base west of town, Kurdish militiamen pointed across a shallow valley at Turkish military positions and acknowledged that the Turks could storm the area quickly if they wanted. But they did not because of the American military base nearby: a few trailers surrounded by armored vehicles, the Stars and Stripes flying overhead.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Americans, there would be a disaster here,\u201d said Ibrahim Sheikh Muhammad, a Kurdish militiaman.Most of the territory held by the United States and its Kurdish allies was once ruled by the Islamic State, and the scars of the military campaign to defeat it run deep.South of Manbij stands the Tabqa Dam, which the Soviets built in 1973, creating Syria\u2019s largest body of water, Lake Assad, and generating power for much of the country.The jihadists of the Islamic State ran the dam for years but blew up its turbines when they retreated.It is now back at work, sort of. Its 350 employees work in buildings shattered by coalition airstrikes that blew holes in walls and shook tiles off the floors. Inside the hydroelectric station, rows of charred circuit boxes set alight by the jihadists sit below ceilings stained black from smoke.But three of the dam\u2019s turbines were whirring as water rushed through below, and a man with a blowtorch worked to repair a fourth. From eight damaged turbines, engineers had salvaged enough parts to rebuild three of them.The dam is a rare example of cooperation across opposing sides. A power line that connects it to a smaller dam passes through a government-controlled area, sending electricity to the station that provides drinking water to the city of Aleppo, said Mohammed Sheikho, the head of the mechanical department. And the Syrian government still pays salaries to some workers.But the dam is just limping along.New heavy electric cables cannot be installed because the German company that made them will not send its engineers into a war zone. And the country best able to fix the rest of the dam, Russia, is allied with the Syrian government.Even worse, there isn\u2019t enough water.Since the Kurds took over the area, Turkey has reduced the amount of water it allows into Syria by more than half, limiting the generation of electricity, said Muhammad Tarboush, the dam\u2019s supervisor.The situation had never been so dire, he said, even when the Islamic State was in charge.\u201cThey are boycotting us with water,\u201d he said.Raqqa was once a commercial center for Syria\u2019s breadbasket. Now, it is an orphaned city in ruins.The military campaign that drove out the jihadists in October left two-thirds of the city\u2019s buildings damaged or destroyed, local officials said. Entire city blocks were erased and apartment buildings brought to the ground. Residents have returned to find walls and ceilings missing from their homes. Some even struggle to find their homes.But the world powers who fought here, led by the United States, are staying out of reconstruction, so Raqqa\u2019s residents are largely on their own.All 32 bridges in the area were destroyed. The two major bridges spanning the Euphrates are impassable, cutting the city in half. One has a hole large enough for a tractor-trailer to fall through. Under the other, boys climb downed electrical cables to plunge in to the water below.That has left only the barges to get people across.Muhammad Jassem, a heavy-machine operator, lives on one side of the river and his elderly parents on the other. The once-simple trip to visit them now takes longer, costs more and gets his shoes and trousers wet.\u201cAs you can see, life is a bit miserable here,\u201d he said after wading ashore.Everyone relied on the boats: a woman taking her grandson to the doctor for diarrhea; a family of four crowded onto a single motorcycle; a shopkeeper hauling chips and soft drinks.Since the battle ended, the United States has put $13.7 million into Raqqa for water, electricity, rubble removal and other projects, in addition to $54 million to clear mines left by the Islamic State, according to the State Department.But it is not rebuilding the city, which Ahmed Ibrahim, the city\u2019s co-mayor, estimated would cost $5 billion.He had no idea where that money would come from and worried that a lack of support would leave a vacuum that the Syrian government or an extremist group like the Islamic State could exploit.\u201cAs long as they give concrete aid, the people will belong to them,\u201d he said.Farther south, the road along the Euphrates is strewn with the remnants of an economy blown back decades by the war: a gutted sugar factory, an idled cotton mill, a train station littered with cars blown off their tracks.The Syrian government controls Deir al-Zour, the largest Syrian city on the Euphrates, but the bridge that connects it to its eastern suburbs across the river is destroyed.The Kurds, their Arab allies and the United States hold the eastern side, with bases in the oil and gas fields to keep the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies from retaking them.In some places, opposing bases face each other across the water, so close that soldiers can see each other\u2019s flags and watch each other smoking cigarettes. At one crossing point, a local militiaman monitored the eastern side, while Syrian soldiers stood on the other, about 200 yards away, while residents rowed across in battered metal canoes.\u201cIt\u2019s like an international border,\u201d said a woman on the Deir al-Zour civil council after stepping off a metal canoe that carried her from the government side.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity so that she could continue to visit her parents on the western side, said that most of the forces on the government\u2019s side were Syrian but that she sometimes saw Russians and Iranian-backed militiamen from Iraq and Afghanistan buying items in shops.Since then, all sides have largely accepted the river as the dividing line, an understanding likely to hold until the Americans leave.The division was bad for Syria, the local councilwoman said, but she did not know how to end it.\u201cGod willing, the sides will come together again,\u201d she said.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter at @NYTBen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Develop Students\u2019 Geography Skills With Our \u2018Country of the Week\u2019 Interactive Quiz", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCountry of the WeekTo find the answers, read on \u2026Each week during the school year we take New York Times travel coverage, news reporting, photojournalism and videos, and use them to make a short quiz about a different country. After starting this feature last school year, we now have a bank of 29 evergreen quizzes \u2014 about countries including Japan, Paraguay, Ghana and Ireland \u2014 and we plan to add dozens more this year, beginning on Sept. 10.My world geography students are eagerly waiting for a new one! They love it!!I love this Country of the Week section, and regularly use these articles to build lessons in my ESL class.Here\u2019s how we format our quizzes:Each quiz begins with a map, like the one below. Go ahead, see if you can find Slovakia on this map of Europe (click or tap on your answer).Then, after students make their map selection, the rest of the quiz unfolds. We typically have questions about geography, culture, politics and the economy, but the topics always depend on Times reporting.Here\u2019s an example from our Kazakhstan quiz. See if you can choose the correct answer:Ancient traditions of Kazakhstan\u2019s nomadic origins \u2014 some say dating from the days of Genghis Khan \u2014 are making a comeback on the sports field.For example, Kazakhstan defeated Kyrgyzstan in the first _________ world championship held during Expo 2017 in Astana.We understand the limits of a multiple choice question, but we hope that simply by answering the question, students are motivated to read more. The \u201cexplanation\u201d that unfurls beneath the answer choices provides students with additional background along with a photograph to capture their imagination. Here\u2019s what students can learn about kokpar after answering the above question.Kokpar, known as buzkashi in Afghanistan, is a tough version of that gentlemanly game, polo. Instead of playing from the back of a horse with wooden mallets and a ball, riders use their bare hands and lean to pick up a headless sheep or goat from the ground. They then race to the goal clutching the dead animal.Instead of goal posts, large caldrons, a bit like inflatable backyard swimming pools, serve as goals. Riders score by heaving the dead animal over the rim of the goal.Each team plays four riders on horses, and the scrum of horses and riders pushing, colliding and surging around the goal with whips cracking creates a rough and violent contact sport.Of course, when The Times has a related engaging video, we use that. For example, when we asked students about Bogot\u00e1 in our Colombia quiz, we embedded this 360-degree video about the capital city\u2019s street art scene.Respondents who could correctly identify North Korea tended to view diplomatic and nonmilitary strategies more favorably than those who could not. They also viewed direct military engagement \u2014 in particular, sending ground troops \u2014 much less favorably than those who failed to locate North Korea.What does this all mean? And why is it important? The article continues:In \u201cWhy Geography Matters,\u201d Harm de Blij wrote that geography is \u201ca superb antidote to isolationism and provincialism,\u201d and argued that \u201cthe American public is the geographically most illiterate society of consequence on the planet, at a time when United States power can affect countries and peoples around the world.\u201dThis spatial illiteracy, geographers say, can leave citizens without a framework to think about foreign policy questions more substantively. \u201cThe paucity of geographical knowledge means there is no check on misleading public representations about international matters,\u201d said Alec Murphy, a professor of geography at the University of Oregon.For this school year, we hope even more teachers make these quizzes part of their classroom routine. And, we want to hear from educators: How have you been using our Country of the Week quizzes? How can you imagine using them with students? And, what suggestions do you have to make them better?

{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Soccer Star Aims for a New Goal: Humbling His Own Bosses", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When Mohamed Salah is on the offensive, you better watch out.That\u2019s the lesson countless soccer opponents have learned from Mr. Salah, Egypt\u2019s goal-scoring maestro and sports superstar. But this week Mr. Salah trained his devastating focus on a new target: the bungling bosses of Egypt\u2019s national soccer association.In a blistering series of Twitter messages, video posts and leaked letters, Mr. Salah, 26, vented a summer\u2019s worth of frustrations against the leadership of the Egyptian Football Association for what he called its grossly incompetent handling of Egypt\u2019s short-lived World Cup campaign in Russia in June.Autograph hunters were permitted to knock on Mr. Salah\u2019s hotel door in the middle of the night, he said, while preening Egyptian celebrities barged in on him, invading his personal space. On long plane journeys, players traveled in economy class while their managers stretched out in business-class seats. Mr. Salah, who also plays for the English club Liverpool, couldn\u2019t even make it to the breakfast buffet without being swamped by fans.A good soccer association ensures that its players are relaxed, Mr. Salah noted on Twitter. \u201cBut in reality, I don\u2019t see anything but the opposite,\u201d he added.In Egypt, Mr. Salah\u2019s outburst came across as more than just a global star railing at domestic failings: It represented a rare, frontal challenge to the authority of a national institution in a country where dissent of any kind can be highly dangerous.Among those sent to Egypt\u2019s crowded prisons last week was Masoum Marzouk, a retired diplomat who called for a referendum on the repressive rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Others imprisoned since last year include a Lebanese tourist who publicly criticized Egypt, a woman who complained about sexual harassment, and several people who waved rainbow flags at a pop concert.Mr. Salah, arguably the most popular man in Egypt, is a different matter.During the World Cup, Egyptians vested their fragile hopes in Mr. Salah, inspired by his dazzling skills and small-town origins. His golden image had been burnished by endless accounts of his generosity and devotion to Islam: every time Mr. Salah scores for Liverpool, he falls to his knees as if in prayer. Even after the Egyptian team was knocked out of the tournament after three games, his halo was undiminished.So it was all the more striking to hear Mr. Salah and his lawyer rail angrily against Egypt\u2019s soccer bosses this week. \u201cYour World Cup failure is the direct result of the incompetent management which you have displayed\u201d since last year, the lawyer, Ramy Abbas Issa, wrote in a letter to the Egyptian Football Association. \u201cSuccess on the field took a back seat ever since.\u201dIn videos posted to Facebook, Mr. Salah lashed out at the bosses who made the team travel in the cheap seats. \u201cThey make us travel in economy class, which is exhausting for every player; all the other African teams fly in business class,\u201d said Mr. Salah, stressing that he was asking for the team, not just for himself.Stunned by the attacks, Egyptian soccer officials tried to defuse the crisis by turning to the playbook often employed by Egypt\u2019s political authorities when faced with an embarrassing situation.Some officials tried to ignore Mr. Salah\u2019s demands; other sought to deflect the blame onto his hard-charging lawyer, who was repeatedly referred to as a \u201cforeigner.\u201d (He is Colombian.) Still others patronizingly referred to Mr. Salah as a son of the soil who had become egotistical, or even suggested that his public defiance constituted an act of disloyalty.At a news conference on Wednesday, Magdy Abdel Ghany, a senior soccer official who drew scorn for traveling to the World Cup in a private jet, offered his services as a conflict mediator. \u201cThis huge building must find a way to deliver its messages to the public,\u201d he said, referring to the football association\u2019s headquarters.But there were few takers.\u201cIn a real country, the Egyptian Football Association would have stepped down and apologized to the public,\u201d said Nada Alaa, a soccer fan from the Nile Delta, speaking by phone. \u201cResign and relieve us after the abject failure,\u201d the billionaire Naguib Sawiris wrote in a Twitter post, referring to the entire board.Michael Wahid Hanna, an Egypt analyst at The Century Foundation in New York, said the dispute had an indisputably political flavor in a country where free speech had otherwise withered under Mr. Sisi.\u201cI think it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Mr. Hanna said. \u201cPolitical life is so stultified in Egypt; there are no frontal challenges to the state or big national institutions. So in that context, this dispute takes on political overtones.\u201dAfter a beach vacation with his family, Mr. Salah returned to Liverpool this month for the start of the Premier League season. He offered a reminder of his formidable talents when he scored in the 19th minute of his first game. His next game for the Egyptian national team, against Niger, is scheduled for Sept. 8.But before he will play, he wants the football association to meet a list of seven demands, including posting two bodyguards outside his hotel room, and granting him the right to refuse all \u201cV.I.P.\u201d meetings. Failing that, his manager has threatened, he will publicly call for the resignation of the entire football association.\u201cYou tried, in your press conference, to say everything and make it seem like I hate my country,\u201d said Mr. Salah with a stern face this week. \u201cThank God, the people know otherwise.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshMohamed Ezz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How China Wins the Trade War", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lovely is a professor of economics and an expert on trade with China.If jobs and wealth are the metric for \u201cwinning the trade war,\u201d China, not America, will emerge the victor. China will win not because of one-party rule, although it certainly helps President Xi Jinping weather difficulties caused by trade tensions. Rather, China will win because it is playing this game more skillfully. The tariffs imposed by the United States will mostly be paid by American companies and consumers, while China is retaliating with moves that soften the blow for companies in China, including those that are foreign-owned.To \u201cwin\u201d a trade war on these terms, the United States would have to impose tariffs that somehow hurt the Chinese economy so badly that its leaders improve their treatment of American intellectual property, a longtime demand by American trade negotiators. The health of China\u2019s economy depends on exporting to the United States, so, the thinking goes, the Chinese government will capitulate to American demands.This strategy is certain to backfire.First, about 60 percent of China\u2019s exports to the United States are produced at factories owned by non-Chinese companies. Many of them produce customized inputs for American manufacturers, such as computer routers, LED fixtures and boat motors. That means the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that are directed at China actually affect many American (and European) companies that own factories in China.Reduced American demand for Chinese products does hurt China. American merchandise imports account for about 3 percent of Chinese manufacturing revenue. That\u2019s a large enough share for tariffs to do a bit of damage, but certainly not catastrophic.Moreover, much of what the United States imports from China contains value created in other locations, including America. Much of the value in an iPhone imported from China, for example, includes displays from South Korea, chips from Japan and design and programming from America. So each dollar of sales lost by a Chinese company actually has a less-than-$1 impact on the Chinese economy. In computers and electronics, which account for the largest share of China\u2019s exports to the United States, the Chinese value added in each dollar of imports is about 50 cents. Consequently, the negative effect of tariffs on Chinese manufacturing is unlikely to be large enough to have much of an impact on China\u2019s trade practices.As the trade war escalates, China\u2019s leadership appears to have deepened its commitment to international supply chains. This is the opposite of the Trump administration, which seems intent on isolating American manufacturers.To be sure, China still engages in policies that undermine fairness in the world trading system. China has failed, for example, to meet commitments to open specific sectors to foreign participation. It also continues to subsidize heavy industries that flood markets in other countries, depressing prices and causing job losses. But the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump fail to address these challenges.Instead, when the next round of tariffs hits, American households will face higher prices on computers, clothing and thousands of other products. China, not the United States, will improve its standing in the world as a place to make and build the future.Mary E.

{"Headline": "Strong Women on the March at Seattle Art Fair", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prominent placement was no coincidence.\u201cImages of strong females sell easily,\u201d said William Rau, the president of M.S. Rau Antiques, a New Orleans-based gallery that had staked out a position by the door and positioned the $198,500 piece front and center. He said that more female art buyers are out buying, and they are responding, as are men, he added, to art showing women in charge. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a \u2018me too\u2019 connection or just female equality, I can\u2019t answer,\u201d he added.But diversity is a complicated subject in a city where the white male still dominates, especially in the computer-science and engineering world that is Seattle\u2019s economic driver.And as questions of power relationships and abuse have percolated through Hollywood, politics and business, encouraging artists to make statements of race or gender runs the risk, fair organizers said, of looking cynical or crass, as if you\u2019ve thrown some diversity into the mix after meeting with your consultants, or simply awkward, because there might be no right way to do it.\u201cIf you\u2019re a man telling a woman\u2019s story, you\u2019re open for investigation,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cBut I love strong women characters in literature and art and this has inspired me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not unaware that we live in a very crazy political period, but I think it\u2019s also important not to get caught up in the \u2018nowness,\u2019\u201d he said. Indigenous people, for example, he said, have faced existential issues for generations. \u201cYou say, \u2018this is a tough political time\u2019 to an indigenous person, and they would be like, \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cIn tech, it gets simplified into numbers \u2014 how many women and minorities do we have in the company,\u201d said Professor Katyal, who is also a co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. Art can look deeper, she said, at both itself and the broader world. \u201cThe task of art is for us to say, \u2018are these numbers enough,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said.Ms. Hupfield said that for her, performance art was also an assertion of authority. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who set the terms for the audience,\u201d she said.But where lines of power, gender and tech converge, things can also be pretty messy.Mr. White\u2019s puppet installation, for example, featured a rope system that visitors were encouraged to yank on to make the hand-holding Boren sisters dance. It was also in its way a tech statement, as in low-tech. \u201cI love the fact that he made it entirely out of cardboard,\u201d said Greg Canote, 67, a fair visitor who said the Boren sisters had stolen his heart.The dancing pioneers also provided a stark contrast with a robotic project out in the parking lot by the artist Mark Pauline, whose clanking metal behemoths, looking like something from the dystopian future of the Mad Max movies, prowled their display space treating art as prey. In one performance, the robots, directed by a member of the team, methodically shredded a copy of an Andy Warhol painting.And the Rau Gallery took \u201cDevant la Mer\u201d home without selling it. One elegantly dressed woman stopped by on the fair\u2019s opening morning, assessed the Cassigneul for a long time, then asked Mr. Rau what his best price offer would be. He scribbled some numbers. She assessed again for a while and kept shopping.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s where to get a taste of the past \u2014 and present.Living on a remote island at the mercy of nature demands resiliency, and the Azores do qualify as remote: nine volcanic islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, 850 miles off the coast of Portugal, their protectorate. The Azores are known for volcanic craters, natural hot springs, 600-foot waterfalls, mountains, cerulean lagoons and dense forests.But it has not always been idyllic on the islands. Throughout their history, Azoreans have had to overcome disease, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and hurricanes that have decimated their food supply and threatened their economy and survival.But they are masters of reinvention and ingenuity: They have learned how to cultivate tea and coffee, plants that are not native to the islands but flourish in the temperate climate and mineral-rich volcanic soil. They have also preserved and perfected centuries-old traditions in cheesemaking and wine production to ensure sustainability and safeguard their culture. They proudly share their agrarian heritage with travelers seeking an authentic Azorean experience.\u201cIt\u2019s what I love to do. It\u2019s my passion. It\u2019s where I belong. I feel well here,\u201d he said (his daughter, Dina Nunes, did the translating).The plants came from Brazil, though no one knows exactly how they arrived. \u201cA lot of people immigrated to Brazil in 1800s after the 1757 earthquake, but some returned, probably with seeds or plants,\u201d Ms. Nunes said. Maria Alzira A. Nunes is renowned for a style of weaving called high point, one of the island\u2019s most famous handicrafts. On a wooden loom built by her husband, she weaves together a patchwork of predominantly red and yellow squares and rectangles, a technique passed down from her great-grandmother. \u201cPeople started coming a lot, and that was a lot of coffee,\u201d Dina Nunes said. \u201cMy father said, \u2018Work for nothing? No!\u2019 So he built the cafe in 1997.\u201d At first only locals came, but the Nunes\u2019s reputation grew, and now tourists as well as locals come to buy coffee, tour the plantation and watch the bedspreads being made. Manuel Silveira is a third-generation cheesemaker. He produces only one type, called Canada, a semihard, spicy cheese with a buttery tang similar to other cheeses produced on S\u00e3o Jorge. He sells about 3,700 pounds a year to restaurants and specialty stores on the other islands, in Portugal and at his dairy\u2019s shop, where visitors can sample the cheese and see it being made. \u201cIf you go to a restaurant here or on another island, they will ask if you want the cheese of S\u00e3o Jorge or if you want the normal cheese,\u201d Mr. Silveira told me (Dina Nunes again did the translating). \u201cNormal cheese\u201d in this case means whatever brands have been imported. Mr. Silveira makes cheese in small batches to ensure the flavor is consistent. (The cows eat lots of organic green grass, and you can taste it in the cheese.) He sends soil samples to the University of the Azores on S\u00e3o Miguel Island for analysis to determine what the land needs.\u201cWe make this cheese with intelligence, love and passion. It\u2019s very important. If S\u00e3o Jorge doesn\u2019t do it, another island will, and on S\u00e3o Jorge, we are farmers. We need this tradition to survive,\u201d Mr. Silveira said. On a clear day from S\u00e3o Jorge Island, you can see Mount Pico on Pico Island. A short ferry ride will take you there. Mount Pico is 7,713 feet tall and its towering height is one key to the island\u2019s successful viniculture. Here, the vines grow on the ground rather than on trellises. Instead of being hindered by an overabundance of volcanic rocks, the Azoreans have used them to their advantage. Black basalt walls protect the vines from harsh wind and seawater and keep them warm with heat retained from the sun \u2014 although temperatures rarely dip below 52 degrees or exceed 80 degrees. These three-foot tall rectangular pens, called currais, are visible all over the island at vineyards and farms and in backyards, where wine is produced for personal consumption. Grapes have been cultivated on Pico since the 15th century, after early settlers recognized the vines fared well in the volcanic soil. With an influx of new immigrants came different grape varieties, and a thriving export business to the United States, Europe and even Russia until the mid-1850s, when its vineyards were devastated by twin plagues of mildew and vermin.\u201cThis took production from 10 million liters to 25,000 liters by 1859,\u201d Mr. Ma\u00e7anita said.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty extreme to do grapes here but when you mix these factors \u2014 volcanic soil, proximity to the ocean, this latitude and three indigenous grapes \u2014 the taste is completely different,\u201d Mr. Ma\u00e7anita said. \u201cAuthenticity for wines is most of all a sense of place. You have no doubt when you put one of these wines to your nose what type of place it comes from.\u201dThe first tea plantation was started around 1820 by Jacinto Leite, who brought camellia-sinensis seeds to the Azores from Brazil.To make black tea, the leaves are air-dried for 10 hours, then placed in a rolling machine to remove the sap; they are oxidized, dried again and then packaged. The process for green tea is similar except the leaves are steamed before going into the roller and are not oxidized before drying. \u201cThe water comes from our stream. This energy keeps me alive now because we are in Europe, and energy is expensive. If we didn\u2019t have my energy, we would close,\u201d Ms. Mota said.Gorreana produces 40 tons of green and black tea annually from the plant camellia-sinensis; it is sold in the Azores and exported to niche markets in Canada, the United States and Europe.The company does not use chemicals, as there are no funguses that adversely affect the plants on the island. It is aromatic and smooth with a rich, full flavor.Gorreana\u2019s 86 acres are open daily. Visitors can walk the fields, take a tour, observe the tea-making process and sample tea, all at no charge. \u201cThis is my passion,\u201d Ms. Mota said. \u201cBut Gorreana is not mine. It\u2019s from the Azores, from Portugal. To pass it on to the next generation is to keep it alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is China Undermining Efforts to Disarm North Korea? Not Yet, Analysts Say", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNext month, President Xi Jinping of China is expected to make his first state visit to the North \u2014 one that could see him standing beside Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader, on the reviewing stand of a military parade.But analysts in China say that is not necessarily the case \u2014 at least, not yet.China, they say, still harbors deep suspicions about the North and Mr. Kim, despite the recent thaws in the neighbors\u2019 off-and-on relationship. And while it is giving the North some economic help around the edges, they say, China is mostly abiding by the international sanctions meant to punish Pyongyang for its nuclear pursuits.\u201cThere is no evidence that China is ceasing to cooperate with the United States on nuclear and missile issues,\u201d said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cTrump made a wild guess from his perspective that because of the trade war, China won\u2019t help with the nuclear issues.\u201dStill, he said, the intensity of the trade war with the United States, along with the increasing likelihood that it will become a protracted standoff, has led China to be more passive about assisting Mr. Trump on North Korea.\u201cChina is in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d Mr. Cheng said. \u201cIt depends on how the United States trade war goes.\u201dOn Saturday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about Washington\u2019s attitude, after Mr. Trump partly blamed China for a lack of progress in denuclearization talks and for the cancellation of the Pompeo trip.China is less interested in backing the denuclearization efforts because it feels burned by Mr. Trump on trade, according to a Western diplomat with contacts among the Chinese leadership. Its leaders had believed that Mr. Trump would not proceed with the confrontational trade policies he promised during the presidential campaign if China helped him by going along with tougher United Nations sanctions against the North last year, the diplomat said.Chinese officials said Mr. Trump had given such assurances, and they felt betrayed when he went ahead with aggressive tariffs this year, the diplomat said.Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to Pyongyang is likely to be on or near Sept. 9, the 70th anniversary of North Korea\u2019s founding, Chinese analysts said. As it does with many significant anniversaries, North Korea plans to mark it with a military parade in the capital.The Chinese government has not formally announced Mr. Xi\u2019s trip \u2014 it usually makes such declarations just days ahead of time \u2014 but Chinese analysts and Western diplomats say that preparations are underway for him to be in Pyongyang.Mr. Kim has visited China three times this year, all in an effort to win Mr. Xi\u2019s support as he entered new diplomatic territory with Mr. Trump, and the Chinese want to reciprocate, analysts said.If Mr. Xi attends the Sept. 9 ceremony in Pyongyang, he will be watching highly choreographed formations of troops and weaponry. Analysts speculated that Mr. Kim might choose to send a signal by not putting nuclear-related armaments on display, as he has in past parades.\u201cI very much expect this visit could happen, and it would greatly improve bilateral relations,\u201d Lu Chao, director of the Border Study Institute at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said of Mr. Xi\u2019s trip. Sept. 9 is a particularly meaningful date for North Korea, and Mr. Xi\u2019s presence would further strengthen a relationship that is warming but still not secure, he said.In his Friday tweets, Mr. Trump said he believed that China was no longer backing his efforts with the North as it once had, \u201cdespite the UN sanctions which are in place.\u201dMr. Cheng said that China, for its own national interest, still wanted an end to the North\u2019s nuclear program. Beijing was relieved when Mr. Kim stopped firing missiles and launching underground nuclear tests close to the Chinese border, he said.Chinese analysts said Beijing had decided not to openly flout the sanctions against the North, which it supported in a series of votes at the United Nations last year. To do so would bring criticism from all quarters, not just the United States, they said.But at the same time, China has called for easing the sanctions, and it appears to be seeking ways to increase its influence in North Korea by helping it open its economy, based on China\u2019s experiences of the past four decades.\u201cI believe Xi has committed to provide some economic help to Kim Jong-un and implement it to a degree \u2014 otherwise, China would fall back to that difficult and embarrassing position over North Korea before Kim\u2019s visit in March,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University.North Korean workers are still employed at Chinese textile factories in northeastern China, and customs inspections at the border have eased slightly after heavy enforcement last year, Chinese traders have said.China is also expected to send nearly twice as many tourists to North Korea as it did last year, with a target of 500,000, according to provincial officials in the northeast.Choe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Looking Back at the Economic Crash of 2008", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If journalism is the first rough draft of history, Tooze\u2019s book is the second draft. A distinguished scholar with a deep grasp of financial markets, Tooze knows that it is a challenge to gain perspective on events when they have not yet played out. He points out that a 10-year-old history of the crash of 1929 would have been written in 1939, when most of its consequences were ongoing and unresolved. But still he has persisted and produced an intelligent explanation of the mechanisms that produced the crisis and the response to it. We continue to live with the consequences of both today.Tooze calls it a problem in \u201cWestern capitalism\u201d intentionally. It was not just an American problem. When it began, many saw it as such and dumped the blame on Washington. In September 2008, as Wall Street burned, the German finance minister Peer Steinbruck explained that the collapse was centered in the United States because of America\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d laissez-faire approach. Italy\u2019s finance minister assured the world that its banking system was stable because \u201cit did not speak English.\u201dIn fact this was nonsense. One of the great strengths of Tooze\u2019s book is to demonstrate the deeply intertwined nature of the European and American financial systems. In 2006, European banks generated a third of America\u2019s riskiest privately issued mortgage-backed securities. By 2007, two-thirds of commercial paper issued was sponsored by a European financial entity. The enormous expansion of the global financial system had largely been a trans-Atlantic project, with European banks jumping in as eagerly and greedily to find new sources of profit as American banks. European regulators were as blind to the mounting problems as their American counterparts, which led to problems on a similar scale. \u201cBetween 2001 and 2006,\u201d Tooze writes, \u201cGreece, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, the U.K., France, Ireland and Spain all experienced real estate booms more severe than those that energized the United States.\u201dBut while the crisis may have been caused in both America and Europe, it was solved largely by Washington. Partly, this reflected the post-Cold War financial system, in which the dollar had become the hyperdominant global currency and, as a result, the Federal Reserve had truly become the world\u2019s central bank. But Tooze also convincingly shows that the European Central Bank mismanaged things from the start. The Fed acted aggressively and also in highly ingenious ways, becoming a guarantor of last resort to the battered balance sheets of American but also European banks. About half the liquidity support the Fed provided during the crisis went to European banks, Tooze observes.Before the rescue and even in its early stages, the global economy was falling into a bottomless abyss. In the first months after the panic on Wall Street, world trade and industrial production fell at least as fast as they did during the first months of the Great Depression. Global capital flows declined by a staggering 90 percent. The Federal Reserve, with some assistance from other central banks, arrested this decline. The Obama fiscal stimulus also helped to break the fall. Tooze points out that almost all serious analyses of the stimulus conclude that it played a significant positive role. In fact, most experts believe it ended much too soon. He also points out that large parts of the so-called Obama stimulus were the result of automatic government spending, like unemployment insurance, that would have happened no matter who was president. And finally, he notes that China, with its own gigantic stimulus, created an oasis of growth in an otherwise stagnant global economy.The rescue worked better than almost anyone imagined. It is worth recalling that none of the dangers confidently prophesied by legions of critics took place. There was no run on the dollar or American treasuries, no hyperinflation, no double-dip recession, no China crash. American banks stabilized and in fact prospered, households began saving again, growth returned slowly but surely. The governing elite did not anticipate the crisis \u2014 as few elites have over hundreds of years of capitalism. But once it happened, many of them \u2014 particularly in America \u2014 acted quickly and intelligently, and as a result another Great Depression was averted. The system worked, as Daniel Drezner notes in his own book of that title.Bannon is right. The crash brought together many forces that were around anyway \u2014 stagnant wages, widening inequality, anger about immigration and, above all, a deep distrust of elites and government \u2014 and supercharged them. The result has been a wave of nationalism, protectionism and populism in the West today. A confirmation of this can be found in the one major Western country that did not have a financial crisis and has little populism in its wake \u2014 Canada.The facts remain: No government handled the crisis better than that of the United States, which acted in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion in late 2008 and almost seamlessly coordinated policy between the outgoing Bush and incoming Obama administrations. And yet, the backlash to the bailouts has produced the most consequential result in the United States.Tooze notes in his concluding chapter that experts are considering the new vulnerabilities of a global economy with many new participants, especially the behemoth in Beijing. But instead of a challenge from an emerging China that began its rise outside the economic and political system, we are confronting a quite different problem \u2014 an erratic, unpredictable United States led by a president who seems inclined to redo or even scrap the basic architecture of the system that America has painstakingly built since 1945. How will the world handle this unexpected development? What will be its outcome? This is the current crisis that we will live through and that historians will soon analyze.Fareed Zakaria is a CNN anchor, a Washington Post columnist and the author of \u201cThe Post American World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Will Cause the Next Recession? A Look at the 3 Most Likely Possibilities", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe expansion is nine years old. An ill-timed end of fiscal stimulus, a corporate debt bubble and the trade war are the things that could most easily end it.But eventually something will kill it. The question is what, and when.While it\u2019s impossible to predict the details or timing of the next recession with any confidence, we can identify some emerging threats to the expansion \u2014 and with a bit of imagination, picture how the recession of 2020 (or 2022, or whatever year it ends up being) may unfold.To be clear, the economy is going gangbusters right now. The nation\u2019s G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the strongest quarter of growth since 2014. But when you speak with some of the people who fret and worry about economic risks for a living, a few factors come up repeatedly.Perhaps most worrisome, many of the culprits in ending the expansion wouldn\u2019t necessarily arise in isolation. Rather, each one could make the others worse, meaning the next recession might have multiple causes. So, with a bit of creative license, here are the three most plausible scenarios for the good times to end.The Federal Reserve has had a relatively easy time over the last year or two. Both inflation and employment have been gradually moving toward healthy levels as the Fed has gradually raised interest rates.The job facing the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, is on the verge of getting trickier. The risk that the Fed will miscalibrate interest rate policy and cause a slowdown or a recession is rising, in part because of the timing of the tax cuts and spending increases enacted this year.Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, has a term for their likely dilemma: the \u201ctrain wreck 2020\u201d scenario.The United States economy is either at or near full employment, and inflation is already near 2 percent. With growth still strong, Mr. Guha says, the Fed may soon find itself needing to raise interest rates more aggressively to keep inflation in check.But at the same time, mainstream macroeconomic models have the economic lift from tax cuts fading sometime between 2020 and 2022. That means the Fed could be raising interest rates to slow the economy just as tax policy is also working to slow the economy.Both affect the economy with unpredictable lags, so it could prove hard for the Fed to set policies that can prevent both overheating in 2019 and 2020 and a downturn in 2021 and 2022.\u201cThere is probably some kind of perfect path where the Fed could thread the needle on this,\u201d raising rates just enough to prevent overheating but not enough to leave rates so high as to risk a recession once the impact of tax cuts fades, Mr. Guha said. \u201cBut what\u2019s the likelihood that you\u2019ll thread that needle? It\u2019s not one you\u2019d want to be betting the farm on.\u201dThe last two recessions started with the popping of an asset bubble. In 2001 it was dot-com stocks; in 2007 it was houses and the mortgage securities backed by them. So it makes sense to look to various markets that might be getting bubbly in dangerous ways. And that search leads quickly to debt markets, both in the United States and overseas.The rise in debt loads overseas, especially in emerging markets, is even greater, according to McKinsey\u2019s data \u2014 as is a shift toward more debt being owed by riskier borrowers.Essentially, businesses have been in a sweet spot for years, in which profits have gradually risen while interest rates have stayed low by historical measures. If either of those trends were to change, many companies with higher debt burdens might struggle to pay their bills and be at risk of bankruptcy.The 2020 train wreck narrative could intersect with the corporate debt boom. If inflation were to get out of control and the Fed raised interest rates sharply, companies that can handle their debt payments at today\u2019s low interest rates might become more strained. Moreover, with federal deficits on track to rise in the years ahead, the federal government\u2019s borrowing needs could crowd out private borrowing, which would result in higher interest rates and even more challenges for indebted companies.Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey, does not see the rise in debt as likely to cause some macroeconomic crisis, but said it could cause distress for individual companies.\u201cI think there will be a rise in defaults, but I\u2019m not alarmed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see systemic interlinkages.\u201dThe 2007 housing downturn became a 2008 global financial crisis because mortgage-backed securities were stuffed throughout a highly leveraged global financial system. The 2000 dot-com crash became a 2001 recession because it triggered a broader pullback in corporate investment. The question is whether the potential challenges for corporate borrowers in the years ahead can remain more isolated than in those precedents. Many words have been devoted to the economic risks of the trade war with China and other trading partners.\u201cTrade just isn\u2019t that big,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. \u201cI have a very hard time coming up with numbers that would be big enough to cause a recession based on the trade math alone.\u201dFor the trade war to trigger a recession, then, it would need to escalate to a much larger scale than the limited tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar cells, washing machines and $34 billion in Chinese products currently covered.Even if it were to expand to encompass hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports, as President Trump has threatened, in order to cause a recession it would need to prompt a broader crisis of confidence.Perhaps the economic damage will be higher in other countries that are more reliant on trade than the United States, causing a slowdown in the global economy that reduces demand for American products over and beyond what tariffs might cause.A global slowdown could also cause huge losses in American stock and bond markets, as American companies\u2019 revenues abroad could plummet. That means a hit to Americans\u2019 wealth and more expensive capital for businesses. It could be the thing that triggers a popping of the corporate debt bubble.For the trade war to cause a recession, it would probably need to do major damage to business confidence, and lead companies to hold back from capital investments because of uncertainty over the future of trade policy.So a trade war alone might not directly cause a recession in the United States. But a trade war that causes a global economic slowdown, a market sell-off and an evaporation of business confidence certainly could.What are the odds of that? In a recent report, Moody\u2019s Analytics puts what it calls the \u201ctrade conflagration\u201d scenario, which includes a late 2019 recession, at 10 percent likelihood.More likely, the report argued, trade brinkmanship will continue until global financial markets weaken, leading to a deal that results in some of the most severe risks being taken off the table.Each week seems to bring alternating signals of the risks of a trade war. In mid-July, President Trump floated threats to apply tariffs to all Chinese imports, which would drastically escalate the trade war. By late July, he was making more conciliatory gestures toward the European Union about striking a deal to lower tariffs across the board.Regardless of the true odds of the three scenarios, this much we know: The seeds of the next downturn have almost certainly already been planted. The question is which of them will grow into a problem big enough to matter. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. to Restore Sanctions on Iran, Deepening Divide With Europe", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States said Monday it was reimposing economic sanctions against Iran that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear accord, ratcheting up pressure on Tehran but also worsening relations with European allies.The sanctions are a consequence of President Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from an international deal that sought to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for easing pressure on the country\u2019s shaky economy.The Trump administration is betting that backing out of it will force Iran to shut down its nuclear enrichment efforts, curb its weapons program and end its support of brutal governments or uprisings in the Middle East.In a statement, Mr. Trump said the Iranian government \u201cfaces a choice: Either change its threatening, destabilizing behavior and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation,\u201d and then he returned to the issue on Twitter on Tuesday morning.International inspectors have concluded that Tehran is complying with the accord, and European officials have said that the Iran nuclear agreement is crucial to their national security.\u201cWe are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran,\u201d the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union said in a joint statement on Monday. Russia and China also signed on to the 2015 deal.By restoring the sanctions, the United States is effectively forcing its allies to go along with the penalties, pressuring major European companies to choose between the tiny Iranian market and the huge American market.\u201cWe have suspended our activities in Iran, which were anyway very limited, until further notice according to applicable sanctions,\u201d Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, said in a statement on Monday.The sanctions ban any transactions with Iran involving United States dollar bank notes, gold, precious metals, aluminum, steel, commercial passenger aircraft and coal, and they end imports into the United States of Iranian carpets and foodstuffs.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said the sanctions would endanger ordinary Iranians \u2014 particularly those who would feel the effects of the penalties on passenger jets.The Trump administration \u201cwants the world to believe it\u2019s concerned about the Iranian people,\u201d Mr. Zarif said in a tweet on Monday. \u201cUS hypocrisy knows no bounds.\u201dEvery other signer of the nuclear deal has opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s action and argued that the agreement was the best chance at slowing, and ultimately ending, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. They now worry that once Tehran is no longer receiving any economic relief, pressure in Iran will rise to resume its nuclear activities.The current agreement prevents Iran from amassing enough fuel to build a nuclear weapon until 2030. Mr. Trump argued that was not long enough.But the other world powers have argued that delaying the problem another dozen years \u2014 after which Iran may have a new leader \u2014 is vastly preferable to the potential of provoking a conflict in the near future.He said such changes would be consistent with \u201cglobal norms,\u201d although the enrichment of nuclear material for civilian purposes and the development of rockets is, in most states, allowed under international law. Additionally, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and the United States also have forces fighting in Syria\u2019s seven-year civil war.In a conference call with reporters on Monday, senior administration officials said they wanted a change in behavior from Tehran, and were not demanding a change in government. They noted that the threat of sanctions had already had an effect on the Iranian economy \u2014 including a plunge in the value of the rial, Iran\u2019s currency; growing unemployment; and increasing protests.Some analysts worry that the Trump administration\u2019s decision to go ahead with sanctions will encourage Europe, Russia and China to find ways around the American-led financial system and undermine the success of economic penalties in other areas.The European Union on Monday updated a so-called blocking statute that seeks to protect European companies from any penalties imposed by the United States for doing business with, or in, Iran. The measure threatens companies with penalties if they comply with American sanctions, putting some in a bind.The law was originally passed in 1996 to protect companies against penalties imposed for doing business in Cuba, Libya and Iran \u2014 all of which were under American sanctions. For years, the United States largely ignored European investments in Cuba to avoid friction.But while top American officials said on Monday that they would continue talking to foreign counterparts to cooperate on sanctions, they vowed to undertake vigorous enforcement of the restored penalties against Iran \u2014 regardless of European concerns. They also said more than 100 major businesses had already announced an intent to leave Iran, ahead of the sanctions.In practice, the blocking statute is likely to be difficult to enforce.\u201cThe idea that the European Commission would come after Siemens or Total for not doing business in Iran is legally dubious and politically very tricky,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that happening.\u201dWhile European leaders insisted they would resist the sanctions, some have quietly taken actions to comply.The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, introduced a change to its rules last month that could block the transfer of hundreds of millions of euros from an Iranian bank in Hamburg back to Iran. The Bundesbank is the conduit for major international transfers of money.European leaders\u2019 powerlessness to counter American sanctions has only widened a divide over a host of issues including NATO, immigration and relations with Russia that could undercut current efforts to defuse tensions over trade.Sanctions could also further irritate China and India, both of which have significant economic relations with Iran.For Beijing, the threat of American sanctions arising from transactions with Iran is just one in a growing portfolio of disputes, including a worsening trade war, restrictions related to North Korea and military tensions in the South China Sea.Many large Chinese firms are state owned and have limited exposure to the American market, leaving them able to continue dealings with Iran. Beijing is unlikely to seriously curb economic ties with Tehran unless it receives significant concessions on other issues \u2014 something the Trump administration is unlikely to grant.India is one of the largest buyers of Iran\u2019s oil, and has pledged to invest millions in Iran\u2019s Chabahar Port. Recent demands by top American officials that India reduce its oil imports from Iran to zero by November led to hard feelings in New Delhi. Those demands were later softened, but the damage was done.An even tougher round of sanctions is scheduled to go into effect in November, including sanctions on Iran\u2019s sale of crude oil and transactions with its Central Bank.Europe could undertake the provocative step of instructing state-owned banks and energy companies \u2014 which are largely insulated from American penalties \u2014 to do business with Iran.\u201cBut I don\u2019t see Europeans ready to pull the trigger on those types of measures, so most companies are making the unhappy decision to side with the U.S.,\u201d said Peter Harrell, who was a sanctions official in the Obama administration.\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s approach to Iran is to build a coalition of the unwilling that has to pull out,\u201d Mr. Harrell said.Gardiner Harris reported from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

{"Headline": "Turkish Regulators Step In to Deal With Fall in Lira", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkey\u2019s main banking regulator curbed the ability of Turkish banks to swap liras for foreign currencies in an announcement on its website late Sunday night.A large Turkish bank, Garanti Bank, also said late Sunday that it would no longer allow customers to open new foreign exchange trading positions, a step that would make it harder for people to sell their liras for dollars, mainly, but also for euros and British pounds.The actions come at a time of rising global concern over the health of the Turkish economy, and there are fears that the currency turmoil could spread to other markets.China\u2019s central bank weakened that country\u2019s currency by 0.34 percent against the dollar on Monday morning, an indication that other emerging markets currencies might be affected by Turkey\u2019s difficulties. The central bank set the benchmark rate for Monday\u2019s trading in Shanghai at 6.8629 renminbi to the dollar, the weakest in nearly 15 months.The renminbi has now slid more than 9 percent since mid-April, on a combination of worries about trade frictions with the United States and concerns within China itself about weakness in the economy through the spring and early summer. The Beijing government tried to rein in lending and infrastructure spending last spring in a bid to limit the country\u2019s ever-rising domestic debt, but it has largely reversed those moves since the end of July in an attempt to shore up economic growth.In early futures trading on Monday morning in Asia, the Turkish lira dropped more than 20 percent to 7.2 to the dollar, before strengthening slightly to 6.8. The plunge came after a more than 13 percent decline in the currency on Friday.In recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about Turkey\u2019s high levels of foreign debt and the reluctance of the central bank to raise interest rates, the traditional approach when a currency comes under attack.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said repeatedly that higher interest rates will not bring down inflation. And on Sunday, he continued his criticism of those selling liras, lashing out at credit rating agencies and urging Turkish industrialists to refrain from swapping liras for other currencies.Over the weekend, Turkey\u2019s new finance minister, Berat Albayrak, said the government would put an action plan forward on Monday, but investors, after days of inaction, remained skeptical that the lira\u2019s slide would be halted.The country\u2019s main banking regulator said on Sunday that foreign exchange operations by Turkish banks could not exceed 50 percent of their equity. Turkish banks have been very aggressive in borrowing in dollars from foreign banks to lend to local companies and real estate developers.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amid Kremlin Victories, Putin Fails to Persuade West on Russian Sanctions", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMOSCOW \u2014 From Moscow to Washington to capitals in between, the past few days have showcased the way President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia nimbly exploits differences between the United States and its allies.Yet recent events have also highlighted the downside to Mr. Putin\u2019s geopolitical escapades and accentuated where he falls short on matters of vital importance to both himself, and ordinary Russians.It was vintage Putin, showcasing his seizure of any opportunity to divide the West.But at the same time, the Western sanctions he hoped to get lifted have only been tightened this past week, pushing the ruble down to its lowest levels in years.At home, Mr. Putin\u2019s standing with Russians is suffering as a result.But the failure to make progress in freeing the Russian economy from the sanctions is a setback for Mr. Putin both domestically and globally.\u201cMany hoped that the Helsinki summit would reset U.S.-Russia relations, and if not help lift the existing sanctions, then at least avoid further rounds,\u201d Maria Snegovaya, a United States-based Russia analyst and columnist for the newspaper Vedomosti, wrote in an email.Much to the Kremlin\u2019s dismay, however, the Trump administration has developed into a kind of pushmi-pullyu of the diplomatic world, acting toward Russia something like the two-headed llama of Dr. Doolittle fame. One head, in the form of Mr. Trump, repeatedly promises improved ties with Moscow, while the other, representing senior officials in his own administration and bipartisan sentiment in Congress, growls about new sanctions and other chastisements.In Moscow, the policy zigzags prompted both confusion and anger as the Kremlin floundered to respond.\u201cPeople are bewildered because they keep getting very mixed signals about the state of relations,\u201d said Andrei V. Kortunov, the director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research group that advises the Kremlin.The Kremlin\u2019s standard response since the Crimea annexation has been to rally Russians around the flag, depicting the country as a besieged fortress. After four years, however, ordinary Russians find that formula tiresome, analysts said, and Mr. Putin\u2019s declining popularity can be attributed partly to his inability to mend fences with the West.\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Please maintain Russia as a great power, but not at the expense of our income,\u2019\u201d said Lev D. Gudkov, the director of the Levada Center, an independent polling organization. \u201cWhen they started to sense that Putin\u2019s foreign policy became too expensive, the attitude began to change and the sense of irritation is growing.\u201dAfter the Helsinki summit meeting, 42 percent of Russians in one poll said they held a favorable view of both the United States and Europe. That is the highest level since Moscow claimed Crimea.At the same time, Mr. Putin\u2019s approval rating, still elevated by Western standards, has been sinking. In July it dropped 15 percentage points, to 64 percent from 79 percent, according to a Levada poll. The survey of 1,600 people had a margin of error of around three percentage points.A poll released on Friday by FOM, the Public Opinion Foundation, which often works for the Kremlin, showed even lower numbers. Just 45 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mr. Putin in a presidential election now, a five-year low, while the number who expressed distrust in him jumped to 35 percent from 19 percent in May. The poll, conducted this month, surveyed 3,000 respondents with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.Mr. Gudkov, the Levada pollster, cited several reasons for the suddenly more favorable view of the West.\u201cIt is a way for people to say it is time to end this confrontation,\u201d he said.Initially, it seemed that the Helsinki talks opened the door for lower-level diplomats, military officers, intelligence agents and other experts to begin discussions about cooperation between Russia and United States on at least a few issues, including the wars in Syria and Ukraine, international terrorism and nuclear proliferation.\u201cWe would slowly start moving out of this hole that we have dug for ourselves,\u201d Mr. Kortunov said.Then a bipartisan group of senators, dismayed that Mr. Trump had not publicly confronted Mr. Putin over Russia\u2019s election meddling, released draft legislation that would limit the operations in the United States of Russian state-owned banks and that would impede their use of the dollar. Passage of such a bill would impose some of the most damaging sanctions yet.On Wednesday, the State Department said it would impose new sanctions by the end of August in response to the attempted assassination in March of a former Russian spy living in Britain, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal. American law mandates such sanctions, with a second stage possible later this year, after any attack using chemical weapons.The August sanctions, targeting goods related to national security, are expected to have little effect because such trade is so low anyway.The banking sanctions threatened by the Senate are far more serious. Some Russian analysts see the lighter sanctions emerging from the State Department as an attempt by the Trump White House to head off a new, more damaging round, and to make Mr. Trump look tough on Russia before the November midterm elections.In either case, Russia has only limited means to respond without bruising its own economy \u2014 existing sanctions, including those imposed by Europe, have already damaged economic growth.The sudden dashed expectations for improved ties and the lack of options in response clearly angered and frustrated senior officials, who ratcheted up the rhetorical flourishes about United States seeking not just to punish Russia, but to destroy it.Igor Korotchenko, the editor of the Russian magazine National Defense, reflected the attitude of Kremlin hard-liners who are always suspicious of the United States when he dismissed the idea that the sanctions were merely a symptom of domestic American politics.\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to destroy the modern Russian state,\u201d he said on a heated television talk show.Dmitri A. Medvedev, the unpopular prime minister, suggested an economic war was brewing and threatened retaliation. \u201cIt would be necessary to react to this war economically, politically or, if needed, by other means,\u201d he said.The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry responded in more measured tones, saying that the new, \u201cunfriendly\u201d measures contradicted at least the spirit of the Helsinki meeting.\u201cYou can expect anything from Washington now, it is a very unpredictable international actor,\u201d said Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman.Russia has largely skirted the fallout from previous sanctions, and it has the example of countries like Iran, which survived such measures for decades.Yet each new round feeds the concern that they will be harder to escape, said Aleksandr Morozov, co-director of the Boris Nemtsov Academic Center for the Study of Russia in Prague.\u201cNow they are in a diplomatic vacuum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not clear where and how even minimal contacts can be moved.\u201dFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar.Reporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko, Lincoln Pigman and Sophia Kishkovsky from Moscow; Steven Erlanger from Brussels; and Gardiner Harris from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Republican Hypocrisy Lifts Social Democrats ", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Suderman is the managing editor at Reason.com.To be a Republican is to oppose socialism. That opposition is practically encoded in the party\u2019s DNA. Yet under Republican Party rule, socialism, or at least the conversation about it, is thriving. Although true-blooded socialists \u2014 Democratic Socialists, to be precise \u2014\u00a0remain a relatively small niche within the Democratic Party, they are having a visible impact on the party\u2019s agenda, with nearly every likely 2020 presidential contender embracing Medicare for all. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign galvanized progressive support for the idea of Democratic Socialism, and this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has embraced not only the label but also a blue-sky vision of American socialism \u2014 free public college, a jobs guarantee, guaranteed family leave and more \u2014 unbound by moderate liberal worries about government overreach or overspending.But it has also been emboldened by more conventional aspects of the Republican agenda, in particular the party\u2019s astoundingly hypocritical approach to debt and deficits. You may remember a time when Republicans pretended to care about the debt and deficits. That time was not so long ago, when Barack Obama was president. Republican governance has shown how much the party actually cares about the deficit: not one bit. One can perhaps imagine a Republican Party that could defend conventional notions of fiscal responsibility with some semblance of integrity, a conservative movement that governed according to its professed principles; even some deficit doves might find such a party useful as a pragmatic counterweight to progressive ambitions. But although Republicans will surely attack the new class of Democratic Socialists and their policies as debt-increasing budget busters \u2014 that is, after all, what Republicans do \u2014 their own actions will ensure that those criticisms have no real authority. Their opposition to the socialist agenda will be hollow, because they helped make that agenda possible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Moves Ahead With Tariffs on Canadian Newsprint", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Commerce Department said on Thursday that it would proceed with tariffs on Canadian newsprint, a blow to an already-struggling American newspaper industry.The tariffs are somewhat lower than what the department initially imposed, offering publishers a small reprieve. The agency said it would cap the tariffs at 16.88 percent, down from 22 percent, and apply them to just one Canadian manufacturer, Catalyst Paper Company. But the Commerce Department said it would also impose tariffs of up to 9.81 percent on several Canadian paper companies to counter subsidies that those manufacturers receive from the government.While the tariffs are not as severe as many in the industry had feared, much of the damage has already been done. The higher tariffs went into effect in January, after the Commerce Department issued a preliminary decision siding with a paper company in Washington State, which accused Canadian manufacturers of unfairly benefiting from government subsidies that allowed them to sell newsprint at artificially low prices.Industry executives said that the lower tariffs would ease the pain somewhat but that it was still a huge burden on an industry that cannot afford higher costs.\u201cThis is a useful and helpful step particularly as it applies to some manufacturers of newsprint,\u201d said Paul Tash, the chairman and chief executive of The Tampa Bay Times. \u201cBut the tariffs come at a time when the industry is facing a lot of headwinds.\u201dSmall newspapers catering to local communities have been hit the hardest, said Andrew Johnson, the president of the National Newspaper Association.\u201cNo one is going to work for free and no one is going to be covering the local stories that need to be told or local government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat of this tariff is still looming over us.\u201dThe Commerce Department decision is not final, and the International Trade Commission, an independent body, could ultimately overturn or change the decision when it rules next month.Behind the decision is a single American manufacturer: North Pacific Paper Company, a Washington-based paper mill funded by the private equity firm One Rock Capital Partners.Company executives have rejected newspapers\u2019 claims that they must buy cheaper Canadian newsprint to sustain their business models. Instead, they have pointed to subsidies the Canadian government provides to its companies, saying that has put American paper manufacturers at a disadvantage and helped decimate the industry here.\u201cLow-priced imports from Canada have taken sales volume from us, depressed our prices and also undersell our uncoated groundwood paper in the United States,\u201d Craig Anneberg, the chief executive officer of North Pacific Paper Company, testified before the International Trade Commission last month.On Thursday, the Commerce Department found that Canada had provided subsidies to certain companies and said it would assess tariffs of as much as 9.81 percent on newsprint from those companies in response.\u201cWhile not surprised, we\u2019re disappointed with the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s decision to keep these unwarranted duties in place, albeit at a lower rate,\u201d Ned Dwyer, the president and chief executive of Catalyst Paper, said in a statement. The company said it would face total tariffs of 20.26 percent on its exports.A number of lawmakers, including Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, have sided with the newspaper industry and tried to halt the tariffs until an impact study is completed detailing the effects of the measure. A bill introduced by Ms. Collins in May has the bipartisan support of 20 senators, and an identical bill was introduced in the House by Representative Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota. Over a dozen lawmakers testified against the measure before the trade commission last month.\u201cLocal papers offer a unique and irreplaceable public service in rural areas, such as my home district in East Tennessee,\u201d Representative Phil Roe, a Republican, testified. \u201cThese businesses remain an integral part of our regional economy,\u201d providing \u201cworkers with good-paying jobs as well as a steady stream of local revenue.\u201dNewspaper publishers hope that the International Trade Commission will rule this month that the tariffs should not apply to Canadian newsprint, in effect rolling the measure back. But many, like Mr. Johnson, are not holding their breath.\u201cThe threat of this tariff is still looming over us; even though we had a favorable ruling today, the threat is very real,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see relief coming for some time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Zimbabwe Elects Mnangagwa, the Man Who Ousted Mugabe", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARARE, Zimbabwe \u2014 Emmerson Mnangagwa, who seized power from President Robert Mugabe in a coup last year after serving as his enforcer for decades, was declared the winner early Friday of Zimbabwe\u2019s disputed presidential election, continuing nearly four decades of rule by the nation\u2019s dominant party.Officials began announcing the results late Thursday night after a largely peaceful campaign that was marred by an outbreak of violence this week that claimed six lives in Harare, the capital.Opposition party leaders, who had accused election officials of trying to rob them of victory in Monday\u2019s voting, indicated that they would not accept the results.\u201cWe will challenge the outcome through the courts,\u201d Morgan Komichi, the party\u2019s national chairman, told journalists. The opposition\u2019s response will greatly influence how the vote is assessed by Western election observers and governments, whose endorsement is necessary for the resumption of desperately needed economic assistance.The election underscored the painful process of emerging from 37 years of brutal rule under Mr. Mugabe. With Western observers still reserving judgment, it was not yet clear whether this election would pass the test and give President Mnangagwa of the governing ZANU-PF party legitimacy as a democratically chosen leader.For most Zimbabweans, who had not known any other leader than Mr. Mugabe, his ouster last year had raised expectations of a new era. But the victory by Mr. Mnangagwa, who was Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man and was behind some of his most repressive policies, underscored that power was passing from one ZANU-PF die-hard to another. Neither in Zimbabwe nor in the rest of southern Africa has a liberation party ever lost power.As the results were announced, soldiers fanned out throughout Harare to pre-empt protests.Mr. Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote compared with 44.3 percent for Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance, election officials announced. A number of other candidates split the rest of the vote.Competing against a party with a history of rigging elections, Mr. Chamisa, 40, had cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process even before Monday\u2019s vote.When opposition supporters began protesting on Wednesday, Zimbabwe\u2019s security forces responded with the brutality they have shown over the decades under Mr. Mugabe, apparently firing live ammunition to disperse protesters. Zimbabwe\u2019s national police spokeswoman, Charity Charamba, announced the arrests of 18 people in connection with the protests.\u201cWe categorically denounce the excessive use of force against unarmed civilians and wish to urge all parties to exercise restraint,\u201d John Dramani Mahama, a former president of Ghana who led observers from Commonwealth nations, said in a statement on Thursday.Mr. Mahama pointed to both the opposition and the government for the deadly violence this week. He expressed \u201cprofound sadness at the outbreak of violence by supporters of the opposition and the excessive use of force by the security services.\u201dSupporters of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance began holding angry protests on Wednesday after their leader, Mr. Chamisa, proclaimed victory and accused election officials of manipulating the results, without offering any evidence. In addition, a top aide, Tendai Biti, accused the governing party in a news conference of plotting to assassinate him and Mr. Chamisa \u2014 again without any evidence.\u201cBoth Mnangagwa and Chamisa are power-hungry,\u201d said Kundai Chauke, a private-school teacher in Westlea, a middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Harare. \u201cThey want power at any cost. You see Mnangagwa sent the army to kill protesters because he does not want them to disturb his power. Chamisa has had protesters on the streets because he wants their noise to help him take power.\u201dThough the governing party continued to use government resources like the state news media and the army to benefit its candidates \u2014 creating what the European Union described as an \u201cunlevel playing field\u201d \u2014 Zimbabweans grew excited and optimistic about the vote. In one of the largest turnouts in the nation\u2019s history, election officials said more than 75 percent of registered voters cast ballots.\u201cWhen I voted, I was so very excited thinking the elections will bring a difference,\u201d said Jessie Mhambo, a street vendor selling cellphone cards in Westlea. \u201cBut now the same stress people had during Mugabe is back. There is no hope. We are stuck with our problems.\u201dIn a strange political realignment, Mr. Chamisa also spoke favorably on a few occasions of Mr. Mugabe, who had violently suppressed his party in the past. In 2008, Mr. Tsvangirai led in the first round of the presidential election but was forced to withdraw from a runoff after Mr. Mugabe unleashed security forces on opposition supporters.On Sunday, on the eve of the vote, Mr. Mugabe said he would vote against Mr. Mnangagwa, and indicated his preference for Mr. Chamisa. Criticized by some of his supporters for his seemingly amicable ties with Mr. Mugabe, Mr. Chamisa held a news conference to distance himself from Mr. Mugabe and to deny accusations in the state media that his campaign had been financed by the former president.Mr. Mugabe, who is now 94, was ousted in November by army leaders backing Mr. Mnangagwa. Though Mr. Mnangagwa had acted for decades as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man, including orchestrating vote-rigging in previous elections, he has become known as a pragmatist. He has courted Western governments and investors, declaring that Zimbabwe is open for business.But foreign investors and governments have reserved judgment, waiting for the outcome of the election.Zimbabwe\u2019s economy collapsed after Mr. Mugabe encouraged the violent takeover of farms owned by white citizens in the early 2000s. Zimbabwe became a pariah in the West and was cut off from loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Western officials have said that they would consider the resumption of loans only after a credible election.Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.Advertisement"}

It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turks Scramble as Lira Falls and Prices Soar", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Prices have soared on imported goods, scaring buyers and sellers. Sales are off as Turks delay purchases or cut back. Everyone is quoting the exchange rate, feverishly calculating what to do with his or her savings, large and small, and watching the price of goods daily.\u201cMy pension is not enough,\u201d Zerrin Yildirim said as she sat with a friend on the steps of their apartment building in an old quarter of Istanbul, bemoaning the prices in the nearby fruit and vegetable market.Turks across the country have been thrown into a frenzy as the Turkish lira has lost 25 percent of its value since last week. A standoff between Turkey and the United States, which has imposed sanctions, accelerated a long decline in the lira this year over fears of mismanagement of the economy.But there are already signs that the quiet panic setting in among ordinary citizens is threatening to undermine Mr. Erdogan\u2019s nationalist appeals.Mrs. Yildirim, 55, a retired intensive-care nurse, blamed people who had voted for the president, even as the economic decline and rising prices could be felt before June\u2019s election.\u201cPeople always complained about prices,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they still vote for the one guy they complain about. We used to call such people sheep, but sheep are clever. When it rains they go into the barn, not under the tree. But these people are more stupid than that. They still voted him in.\u201dNow, analysts warned, one effect of the steep depreciation of the lira was almost certain to be runaway inflation, which amounts to an instant pay cut, especially for the poor and middle classes.Already at 15 percent, inflation in Turkey will soar in coming months, predicted Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, a management consultancy firm, and a political commentator.\u201cEvery 10 percent depreciation of the lira leads to a rise of inflation of 2 percent,\u201d Mr. Yesilada said. \u201cIn three months inflation will be 20 percent. That is the equivalent of losing one-third of your salary \u2014 it is a tremendous cost.\u201dMr. Erdogan has long insisted on maintaining low interest rates in his pursuit of strong growth, and rejects the widely accepted economic orthodoxy that inflation is controlled by raising interest rates. As the lira fell in the weeks before the June election he was persuaded by his senior officials to agree to a modest interest rate hike.But since then he has announced his determination to take greater control of monetary policy \u2014 and of the Central Bank \u2014 and has resisted calls for further interest rate hikes, even after the lira\u2019s dramatic fall on Friday.It is the kind of interference in the economy that has already frightened investors and contributed greatly to the drop in the lira, long before the current standoff.The fallout could hurt Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party in local elections scheduled for March of next year, Mr. Yesilada said.The party faltered in the recent parliamentary elections, even as Mr. Erdogan won the presidential election, and voters may punish the party even more in the local elections, which have long been an important base of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s power.Mr. Erdogan has tried to turn the crisis to his political advantage by pushing his nationalist stance.For now, the president\u2019s opponents have lined up behind him in his dispute with the United States over Turkey\u2019s detention of an evangelical preacher, Andrew Brunson, and some 20 other Americans swept up in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown after a failed coup two years ago.The Turks have demanded, to no avail, that the United States extradite a Pennsylvania-based Islamic preacher blamed for orchestrating the coup, Fethullah Gulen.Veterans and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters have held nationalist rallies, declaring that they will convert their dollars into Turkish lira in support of the country. Few seemed to believe that they actually would, however. Many Turks have long hedged against a decline in the lira by switching savings to foreign currencies.Mr. Erdogan may manage to ride out the crisis thanks to chance. Next week, the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha falls between two weekends, giving Turks nine days of vacation. Banks will be closed, and the government will have a chance to recover.\u201cEvery product that we buy in foreign currency from outside, we will produce them here and sell abroad,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said during a speech in Ankara, drawing applause and cheers. \u201cWe will boycott the electronics products of the U.S.\u201d\u201cIf they have the iPhone, there is Samsung\u201d as an alternative, he continued, referring to Apple\u2019s rival in the smartphone business.But it is not quite that easy.An electronics store in one of the busiest downtown markets was empty at 11:30 a.m. The shop owner, Suat Durnah, 63, leapt up from his chair in his eagerness to vent his fears and frustrations to a reporter.\u201cThe market is very slow,\u201d Mr. Durnah said. \u201cI only just made my first sale of the day.\u201d Normally he said, he would have made six or seven sales by that time.Almost everything the store sells comes from China, but it pays for goods in U.S. dollars, he said. As the lira has depreciated, the Turkish prices have doubled this year, and tripled since last year, he said.He pointed to a desk telephone. \u201cLast year, that telephone was selling for 28, 40 lira. Now it is 85, 90 lira,\u201d he said.Political analysts say Turkish voters can be unforgiving when their pockets are hit.\u201cThe people will make the choice over the hardships being forced on them, and some loose nationalist ideal being offered them,\u201d said Mr. Yesilada, the commentator.On the streets of Istanbul, the anxiety was evident. Restaurateurs and cafe owners are already struggling with a 50 percent drop in business over the past three years after terrorist attacks scared away many foreign tourists.Now other Turkish businesses are feeling the downturn.A storekeeper, Mustafa Yuksel, 30, who sells gardening equipment and insecticides, most of it imported, said he had raised his prices as soon as the lira fell on Friday.\u201cTo stand on our feet, we immediately raised our prices,\u201d he said.People who needed to buy were surprised but going ahead. But some, including the local city municipalities, were holding off, he said.Business was also down at the Sehremini Market, where the pensioners did their shopping. The salesmen attributed the fall in sales to the summer holidays, since many families leave the city, but several admitted they were worried.Few would blame it on Mr. Erdogan, however. A fruit seller, Sedat Eski, blamed it on the British, alluding to one of many conspiracy theories encouraged by Mr. Erdogan \u2014 that foreign powers were behind the currency crash in order to undermine Turkey.\u201cAll the rich people pulled out their money at 2 a.m.,\u201d Mr. Eski said. Turkey\u2019s richest people had moved their money to the United Kingdom, he said. \u201cAnd who do you think is pulling their strings.\u201dAbout the only ones who seemed to be enjoying the plunge in the lira were foreign tourists, who were snapping up sudden bargains on luxury goods in the high-end district of Nisantasi.Twenty-five tourists from Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Iran were lined up outside the Louis Vuitton store on the corner of Abdi Ipekci Street, where luxury fashion houses have their boutiques.\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of shopping,\u201d said Amanda Ibrahim, 28, an economics assistant who was on a trip from Sweden. Prices were down 40 percent because of the exchange rate, she said.\u201cA couple days ago, it was more expensive here than Sweden,\u201d she said.In the Zorlu Center, one of Istanbul\u2019s biggest shopping malls, salespeople said they had almost sold out their stock to Asian tourists paying in Turkish liras.Rachel York, 21, an American who works at Robert College of Istanbul, a private high school, was less pleased.\u201cWe agreed on getting paid in Turkish lira at the beginning of summer,\u201d she lamented, \u201cand now we regret it because we essentially lost one third of our salary.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Hit for Turkish Tourism?", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateVisitor numbers were rebounding this year, but with the recent crisis, this one economic, many wonder if another setback is looming.Erkal Aykac spent more than three decades showing Western tourists his beloved Turkey, meeting cruise ships in various ports, and shepherding groups through Hagia Sophia Church Museum and other ancient treasures in Istanbul. With four university degrees and speaking fluent English, he made enough for a comfortable life in Istanbul. He sent his daughter to boarding school, and handled the medical bills for his aging father. But the past three years have hit him hard, and with Turkey now facing an all-out economic crisis, he is bracing for the worst.The Turkish lira has dropped 35 percent over the past year, and tariffs recently announced by the Trump administration don\u2019t bode well for the troubled currency. Though the lira has fluctuated in recent days, at one point it hit record lows against the United States dollar, setting off a panic over a potential domino effect that could reach other emerging markets. Indeed, the exchange rate might lure some visitors. Even before the recent crisis, the average rate for a hotel room in Turkey in April 2017 stood at 67.4 euro, still a long ways off from its average of April 2015, which stood at 105 euro.Firuz B. Baglikaya, the president of the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies, said that tourism growth over the past year has broken all records, and he is optimistic about continued growth from all parts of the world, including Europe.\u201cWe are utterly pleased to see tangible improvement in all source markets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are expecting a record number of visitors this year. I am quite certain that we will reach the target of 40 million with $32 billion revenue by the end of the year, unless developments beyond our control have a negative deteriorating impact.\u201dThe steady pace of new visitors has kept the hotel industry in Turkey chugging along, with the Hotel Association of Turkey reporting occupancy rates in 2017 spiking over 2016, in large part thanks to the changing demographic of visitors. The Hilton Hotel group, which has 90 properties either open in Turkey or in the works across its Hilton, Conrad, Hilton Garden Inn, Doubletree and Hampton brands, reported a 62 percent rise in the number of rooms occupied by guests from Iran and nations in the Persian Gulf alone. \u201cIf you look historically at emerging markets, the geopolitical situation hasn\u2019t alway been the biggest deterrent [for investment], unless there are sanctions in place,\u201d said Mr. Moufarrige, who steered Servcorp\u2019s Asian operations through political crises in Malaysia and Thailand. \u201cIt\u2019s really only when the economy hits the fan that people get spooked.\u201d \u201cThe tourism industry here has completely changed,\u201d Mr. Aykac, the tour guide, said. \u201cFor the past two years, I haven\u2019t received a single call for business from my ordinary clients.\u201d To make ends meet, Mr. Aykac has begun working with Taiwanese groups, partnering with an English-speaking Taiwanese guide who translates his notes into Chinese. The double translation creates a barrier between himself and his tourists, Mr. Aykac said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like two blind guys conversing with each other,\u201d he said. While many Americans have hesitated to return, visitors from Iran and elsewhere have poured into the country. In 2017, 2.5 million Farsi-speaking tourists arrived in Turkey, a 50 percent increase over the previous year. Turkey shares a 310-mile land border with Iran, and on June 18, train service from the northwestern Iranian city of Tabriz resumed to the Turkish border town of Van after being halted three years ago following a bomb attack. And the increasing numbers of visitors from Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia has resulted in wider availability of halal food and Farsi- and Arab-language menus. \u201cIn Istanbul, a vast number of shops, restaurants and cafes have opened up that cater specifically to Middle Eastern tourists,\u201d said Paul Osterlund, a New Mexico native who has worked as a journalist in Istanbul for five years. And while the sights and inexpensive shopping in Turkey are part of the appeal for this new sector, it\u2019s the nation\u2019s relaxed attitudes toward alcohol and female dress that make it a particularly appealing getaway for Muslim visitors who want to let loose. Middle Eastern medical tourists \u2014 particularly those in search of cut-rate hair transplant surgeries \u2014 are also realizing that Turkish doctors offer procedures at attractive prices. But whether or not the cafes and shops are full, Turkey feels irrevocably changed, said Mr. Osterlund. \u201cThe sporadic violence and horror of 2016 is gone, [but] the air remains thick with political tension,\u201d he said. For guides who cater specifically to English-speaking tourists, times remain tough. Ansel Mullins co-founded Culinary Backstreets, his now-global gastronomic tour company, from Istanbul in 2009. The company (which employs Mr. Osterlund as a freelance writer) now runs English-language food tours in 13 international cities, but Mr. Mullins said that interest in his Istanbul offering fell 80 percent from 2015 to 2016. Numbers are creeping back up in 2018, but have yet to fully rebound. Tour groups as a whole from Western nations are not returning to Turkey yet, he said. Independent travelers are, though, and they seem less concerned about the nation\u2019s political alliances. Mr. Mullins draws a comparison to Egypt, another nation that has suffered terrorism and government instability. \u201cThere are places that have timeless beauty, and that can often trump who\u2019s in power.\u201d For Mr. Aykac, however, that uptick may not come soon enough. Frustrated by a lack of work, and rising inflation, he plans to leave Istanbul in the next few years. But he\u2019ll stay in Turkey, he said. \u201cTurkey is the highlight of all the countries in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find anything here. But with the political situation and the economics, we are releasing every last knot in our belts. We are now coming down to the last hole, and it\u2019s unbearable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cities\u2019 Offers for Amazon Base Are Secrets Even to Many City Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Evans, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of Amazon.He does, however, have one small question: What financial incentives did his city dangle in front of Amazon?\u201cWhat have I been told?\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201dAcross the country, the search for HQ2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can\u2019t find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to Amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it.\u201cThe only time the public may become aware if the city has promised Amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed,\u201d Mr. Evans said.A primary reason for the information blackout is that, in many cases, the bids were handled by local private Chamber of Commerce affiliates or economic development groups that aren\u2019t required to make their negotiations public. Many of the groups are also not covered by Freedom of Information Act or state open-records requests.But another reason is gamesmanship. Some cities say they want their Amazon proposals to remain confidential to avoid showing their hand to rivals. And Amazon required the finalists to sign nondisclosure agreements that forbid the local groups to release proprietary information about the company.\u201cI don\u2019t know what we offered Amazon in terms of financial incentives, but I believe Amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them,\u201d said Leslie Pool, a member of the Austin City Council. The city, also a finalist, submitted a bid put together by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, which had no consultations with the City Council.But that kind of transparency is the exception.\u201cWe are not releasing documents related to Amazon HQ2. We are not subject to F.O.I.A.,\u201d Michael Finney, the president and chief executive of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, a public-private partnership that handled the Amazon bid, said in an email. Similar requests to Austin, Atlanta and Indianapolis met with similar responses.And when officials in Montgomery County, Md., did respond to a request for information on their bid, they delivered, among other items, a 10-page document of incentives \u2014 with every single line of text redacted.Companies are often stealthy when searching for a location for a critical factory or relocating a headquarters, as General Electric or Bechtel have done in recent years. And it has been reported that Apple has been holding behind-closed-doors meetings with government leaders as it shops for a new corporate campus.In the case of Amazon, it is the size and scope of its search that some officials find shocking \u2014 and galling.\u201cTypically, you see companies bid a couple of places against each other as they try to land a corporate deal,\u201d said Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council who has not seen the city\u2019s proposal to Amazon. (New York is a finalist.) \u201cThis process is highly unusual. It creates a real race-to-the-bottom aspect with the potential of companies bidding multiple cities against one another.\u201dIt is unclear how much promised tax credits and financial incentives will weigh into Amazon\u2019s decision. Three of the first four questions Amazon asked cities to answer in their proposals were centered on incentives. But the e-commerce giant also sought information on possible building sites, the local labor force, transit options, computer science programs in local schools and cost-of-living data.The cities see more at stake than just the jobs and investment that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters would bring. Amazon says its presence and investment in Seattle have created an additional 53,000 jobs beyond its own direct hires and added $38 billion to Seattle\u2019s economy from 2010 to 2016.But there have also been serious downsides for the city. In a be-careful-of-what-you-ask-for address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said that housing prices in her city average $824,000, that rents have soared 57 percent in the last five years and that there are 4,000 homeless people on the streets every night.Those are the types of concerns raised by Ms. Pool, the Austin councilwoman. Ms. Pool said she thought her city lacked the infrastructure and housing to accommodate 50,000 high-paying jobs and that such fast growth would alter the city\u2019s socioeconomic makeup and quality of life.\u201cThis is a city where you want to put down roots,\u201d Ms. Pool said. \u201cThe people here are the friendliest. The parks are beautiful. But if someone like Amazon comes in, a big con is the massive amount of dislocation it causes. You put out the small businesses and longtime property owners, the very businesses and people that give the city its flavor and, I would argue, its brand.\u201dStill, the project is too good to pass up, even for some of the nation\u2019s mayors who are most focused on housing and affordability, such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.\u201cThey are about ending inequality and creating more inclusive cities,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the School of Cities and the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. \u201cNow they\u2019re in a game competing with one another to throw money at one of the most powerful companies in the world run by one of the world\u2019s richest men.\u201dMr. Florida was on the board of directors for Toronto Global, whose bid is one of the 20 finalists, but he said he resigned this year so that he could raise concerns about the general lack of transparency in the bidding.\u201cI think the lack of transparency of this whole process is galling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be all out in the public. This is taxpayer money.\u201dEventually, the taxpayers whose area wins will have to be told how much money Amazon was promised. And when they discover how much they will have to hand over, Mr. Florida said, \u201cthere is going to be hell to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Fall as Trade Tensions Cause Jitters", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican stock markets slipped early Thursday after global markets were roiled by the latest twists in the trade war between the United States and China.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average all declined in early trading, following losses in benchmark Asian and European indexes in the overnight session.China\u2019s main stock index dropped 2 percent, and in Hong Kong, an index of China\u2019s biggest listed companies, ended down slightly more than that.European stocks followed Asian markets, with indexes in Germany and Britain both edging lower.Hours before, President Trump instructed the United States trade representative to look into increasing tariffs on Chinese imports like fish, handbags and other goods to 25 percent from 10 percent, a significant step in a dispute that is beginning to take a toll on industries and consumers in both countries.\u201cIf it had not been for the sideswipe on trade, markets would have been in much better shape this week,\u201d Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Reuters.A final decision on the size and scope of the tariffs is not expected before September, but any tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports would come on top of the existing penalties on $34 billion worth of products and an additional $16 billion that are scheduled to go into effect soon.China has vowed to respond to any trade measures in kind, and it has already imposed its own tariffs on $34 billion worth of American goods.Also weighing on the markets in the region were rising United States bond yields. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which rise as prices fall, was near 3 percent, the highest level in weeks. Rising yields could make dollar-backed debt costlier to repay, especially for emerging markets.The same may not be as true for China.On Tuesday, Chinese officials called for further government spending to offset a slowdown in China\u2019s economy, which has taken place as the government tries to rein in surging debt.The Chinese currency was little changed on Thursday, but it fell to a 13-month low against the dollar earlier in the week.Advertisement"}

Opinion Columnist\u201cAirbnb, without fundamental human goodness, would not work,\u201d Chesky said. A decade later, Airbnb is in more than 190 countries. It has had more than 300 million guest arrivals. It is valued in the tens of billions of dollars.From all the data the company has accumulated, no major country anomalies, in terms of patterns of behavior, have emerged. People from Japan, Brazil, Nigeria, Russia, the United States, Mexico and France are equally respectful and honest. There are no national outliers, Chesky said, on the goodness or trustworthiness scale. There are no enemies.That is interesting. I wonder if we are looking in the wrong places to assess the state of the world. The twilight of an era, as in Vienna a little over a century ago, is always murky. With nationalism and xenophobia resurgent, examples of humanity\u2019s basest instincts abound. They grab the headlines. At the same time, community and sharing, often across national borders, through digital platforms like Airbnb, BlaBlaCar and Facebook, expand. This is the world\u2019s undercurrent. It shifts the perceptions of billions.The nation state is trumpeted. The nation state is redundant. Perhaps the trumpeting is linked to the redundancy. The natural state of politics becomes theater. Its most compelling actors, however buffoonish, prosper. They strut the stage mouthing fantasies. They babble and veer. \u201cThese platforms are an integral part of the geopolitical landscape, because in some ways and for a different set of reasons their power is approaching the power historically held by nation states,\u201d Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of \u201cThe Sharing Economy,\u201d said. \u201cWe look to Facebook for identity.\u201d He continued: \u201cMore and more people actually have a sense of understanding of others\u2019 cultures and the feeling someone I don\u2019t know can be trusted.\u201dPerhaps Airbnb is the new NATO.

Yet just about every Hungarian I met was renting out apartments or rooms to strangers through Airbnb or other platforms. A woman I got to know had just rented her place to a Kazakh. Connected to each other, individuals organize the self-defense that is cross-border community. It is closed systems that kill.Of course, we have learned that the internet can be just as good at building silos and reinforcing the algorithmic separation of people as at bringing them together. We have learned that, contrary to idealistic pronouncements, Facebook or Google may be more driven by the temptation of maximizing advertising revenue through leading you to content you have responded well to in the past than by any mind-broadening mission. We know how echo chamber effects get amplified, and how those echo chambers may be opaque, easily infiltrated by Russian trolls. The utopian view of the Internet has collapsed.The gale of nationalism is gusting against bread broken together, the arc of history bending toward justice, and all that.

Ms. Pawel is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown praised Arnold Schwarzenegger for the role that he had played a decade earlier, as governor, in starting the environmental initiative. Mr. Schwarzenegger in turn hailed Governor Brown as a visionary leader and shrewd negotiator who had cobbled together bipartisan support crucial to passing the landmark deal. But the bond between the two governors on display underscored a more fundamental, long-lasting force in the Golden State: the Party of California.Among his many friendships with Republicans, Mr. Brown cherished his friendship with Earl Warren. When Mr. Brown defeated Richard Nixon to win re-election in 1962, he and Mr. Warren toasted the victory. When Mr. Brown lost four years later to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Warren was dismayed and wrote to his friend, \u201cYou have given our state good, progressive government for eight years and that is all any man could have done.\u201dJerry Brown modeled his second act after leaders on Mr. Starr\u2019s list like Hiram Johnson, Earl Warren and his father, whom he identified as the most successful governors, \u201cthe people who built the state, who were innovators and who were not ideologues or people who were pigeonholed into one partisan box.\u201d If Gavin Newsom wins election in November, as expected, the next governor of California will be a San Francisco Democrat best known as an early champion of same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana and universal health care. His election would mark the first transition since the 19th century between two Democratic administrations in Sacramento. An open question is whether the Party of California philosophy will prevail as well.Jerry Brown often invokes the words of a famous Jesuit to express his version of that philosophy: \u201cTeilhard de Chardin said, \u2018Whatever rises, converges.\u2019 If we lift our minds and hearts and our imagination, we will converge around a sense of what\u2019s good for all of us, what\u2019s good for humanity, what\u2019s good for the future generations.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Financial Crisis Surprised Many. Except This Analyst.", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past seven years, Tim Lee has been warning that a financial crisis in Turkey would set off a wider calamity in global markets.Just about nobody listened \u2014 until now.There are signs of the rout spreading beyond Turkey. The stock prices of European banks, which have been big lenders to their Turkish counterparts, dropped sharply on Friday, with investors worried that a wave of corporate bankruptcies in Turkey would lead to a banking bust in the country. The currencies of China, Brazil and Mexico also weakened. And in the United States, major stock-market indexes fell more than 1 percent before recovering slightly.Suddenly, Mr. Lee\u2019s largely ignored prophecy \u2014 that a decade of Turkish companies and real estate developers gorging on cheap foreign debt would end badly, not just for Turkey but for the world \u2014 does not seem so outlandish.\u201cTurkey is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Mr. Lee said on Friday. \u201cWe are going have another crash that will be worse than 2008 in certain ways.\u201dThis is not a widely held view. Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, United States stock markets remain near their highs. Anxiety about trade wars with China and Europe has been largely cast aside. Even financial markets in developing countries, which tend to swoon in unison when one of their peers implodes, recently have been doing well.Mr. Lee, 58, made his initial call \u2014 that Turkey was in deep financial trouble \u2014 in 2011.He writes the newsletter, called piEconomics, from a Greenwich, Conn., office where he now works alone. The publication is simple: 10 pages of dense text supplemented with the occasional chart. His subscribers are a small cluster of European investment funds.Toward the end of 2011, Mr. Lee published an installment of the newsletter in which he predicted that Turkey would need a $100 billion bailout.At the time, central banks all over the world were pumping money into their economies, which were struggling to recuperate from the financial crisis.Mr. Lee noticed that Turkish banks were borrowing in dollars to make other loans to fast-growing Turkish companies. He also saw that, over all, Turkey\u2019s economy was growing more reliant on financing from foreign investors. It struck him as similar to what had happened to Thailand in the years before the Asian financial crisis in 1997.In his monthly notes to investors, he kept returning to the topic of Turkey and the risks there.At the time, the Turkish economy was humming. The odds of a blowup looked remote. The idea of the lira ever trading at 7.2 seemed ludicrous. It was easy for people to ignore Mr. Lee\u2019s fantastical-sounding warning.But Mr. Lee was on to something, even if his prediction was a half-decade premature. Over the next five years, the economic situation in Turkey deteriorated, as he had anticipated.One side effect of having trillions of dollars of new money sloshing around courtesy of central banks was that it became much easier for governments and companies in hot economies like Turkey\u2019s to borrow money in dollars \u2014 as opposed to their own currencies \u2014 to finance their investments or other growth plans.Today, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking trade group, corporate debt in foreign currencies is $5.5 trillion, the most ever.The threat is that as the lira loses value, it becomes more expensive for Turkish companies to repay their dollar-denominated loans. Indeed, a growing number of companies in Turkey already have said they cannot repay these loans.\u201cCompanies there just ignored all the risks and kept borrowing in dollars,\u201d Mr. Lee said.And that has the potential to spread far and wide. American investors, for example, own nearly 25 percent of outstanding Turkish bonds and more than half of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the I.I.F.Mr. Lee these days is far from the only one warning about the Turkish economy and financial system. The thing that really worries him and other bearish investors is that Turkey could be a signal for what lies ahead for assets and economies that were inflated by cheap debt.If Mr. Lee\u2019s 2011 call now looks prescient, it hasn\u2019t won him much new business.Lately, just as Turkey began its crackup, a number of his clients have left him.Yes, he might have been right on Turkey. But his persistent gloom was wearing thin, especially as the markets continued to soar.\u201cIt has been some hard sledding,\u201d Mr. Lee admitted. \u201cI have lost a lot of clients because I have been too bearish.\u201dYet he is doubling down on his doomsday message: The river of global cash will dry up, the dollar will spike and there will be a series of financial seizures. Investors, he thinks, will flee developing economies, then Europe and eventually the American stock and bond markets.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a banking crisis this time around \u2014 it will be a financial market crisis,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cAnd I am very confident that it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And nowhere on the roster of A-list Republican challengers would you have found John James. ...John is strong on crime and borders, loves our Military, our Vets and our Second Amendment. He will be a star. He has my full and total Endorsement!Now Mr. James hopes he will get the chance to pull off in the general election what he has done in the primary: turn a lopsided race into a very close contest. It will be difficult \u2014 assuming he even makes it out of the primary. His opponent, Sandy Pensler, has been campaigning with the confidence of a front-runner. Mr. Pensler has more money and boasts credentials that include running his own private equity firm and teaching economics at Harvard and Yale.Come November, the Republican nominee will have to face Senator Debbie Stabenow, a three-term incumbent who won her last re-election by 20 points. But Mr. James, 37, is a standout. He is a West Point graduate who spent eight years in the Army, including service in Iraq. He is the president of his family-run business, a global provider of logistics support for Fortune 500 companies. He is also black, a rarity in his party today. The Senate has only one black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina. Mr. James, who now lives not far from where he grew up in the Detroit suburbs, says he doesn\u2019t have \u201ca black message, or a white message.\u201d But there is little doubt he would be at a disadvantage competing in Detroit, Michigan\u2019s largest city where the population is 80 percent black. Hillary Clinton carried most precincts in the city with more than 90 percent of the vote.He talked to The New York Times about his chances of putting another crack in what was once reliably the Democrats\u2019 \u201cblue wall\u201d of Midwestern states that had been a bulwark for the party in presidential elections until Mr. Trump came along.The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.Q: I grew up not far from you. What high school did you go to?A: Brother Rice.Shut up! So did I. What class were you in? (Long pause.) Hello?Maybe I took that too literally. I graduated 1999.I graduated in 1998.How random is this?(After reminiscing about English teachers, siblings that might know each other and drama class, the conversation moved on to politics.)I actually went to the NAACP dinner this past spring, and I was pulled aside on two occasions that stick out to me. One lady said that she\u2019d been a resident of Detroit for 45 years and feels neglected by the Democratic Party. Another lady pulled me aside and said that\u2019s she\u2019s never split a ticket in her entire life, and she\u2019s finally looking forward to having a conservative to vote for. And I took that to kind of instruct me.I was raised by people who, like my father, came out of the Jim Crow South because Michigan was the place that people immigrated to from all over the world to have economic opportunity. And now after marching from Selma to Detroit and rebelling from Watts to Baltimore, people don\u2019t feel like anything has gotten better after 50 years. There\u2019s still trees growing through houses and wild dogs running through the streets in black neighborhoods. And Debbie Stabenow keeps getting re-elected. Have you spoken directly to the president?I have not. I imagine he\u2019s a pretty busy guy. But his endorsement did mean a lot. And there are going to be some people who are so blinded by their hatred of the president that they\u2019ll miss the opportunity to have someone who will do everything he can to serve everyone in the state of Michigan. I\u2019m looking forward to treating people like independent thinkers.But would you want him to campaign for you in the general election?Absolutely. In Michigan, it may not be very clear out on the coast to a lot of folks \u2026 Come on, you can\u2019t say that to me. I grew up there.I said a lot of people. I didn\u2019t say you. There\u2019s a massive disconnect. People here in Michigan feel disenfranchised and disillusioned with the situations that are going on the coasts. I actually heard on the trail somebody say Donald Trump is Rust Belt Robin Hood. And I took that to mean that we finally have a president that\u2019s listening to the people in the Midwest.Rust Belt Robin Hood? I hadn\u2019t heard that one before.The reason why he won in Michigan, despite what everybody said, is because people went to the polls in a secret ballot and voted for someone who they believed would take care of their personal economy, would help their economy grow, would help their job. We were told that manufacturing was dead. That 2 percent G.D.P. growth was the new normal. And President Trump said no way. We can do better.Michigan voters have the opportunity to basically answer the question. We keep sending lawyers and career politicians to Washington and we wonder why we\u2019re not get anything done. People want somebody who understands how to run a business before they make regulations that will affect business. They want somebody who understands what it\u2019s like to sign the front and the back of the check. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Turkey\u2019s Lira Crisis Matters Outside Turkey", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are fretting about emerging markets again.Turkey is the front-burner concern at the moment, but what really is getting people\u2019s attention is the prospect that the financial problems there could spread to other fast-growing but risky countries.If history is any indication, that has the potential to quickly turn a local crisis into a global one. Or maybe not.At first glance, this seems like a problem peculiar to Turkey, as the country\u2019s economy has weakened.At the same time, Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been seizing greater control over the country\u2019s economic policy. He appointed his son-in-law as finance minister. He has made a series of pronouncements that undercut the independence of the country\u2019s central bank, railing against the prospect of high interest rates.Turkey\u2019s economy isn\u2019t all that large, so even if it were to collapse, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily have a huge impact on the global economy.In recent years, investors in wealthier parts of the world, like the United States, Europe and Japan, have lent many billions of dollars to governments and companies in developing economies like Turkey, South Africa and Argentina.That has been an attractive proposition because interest rates in the United States and other developed markets have been incredibly low, as central banks tried to nurse their economies back to health after the last recession. The higher rates on offer in countries like Turkey have acted as magnets for foreign capital.Now, with the economy of the United States strong again, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates. As a result, keeping money invested in American markets looks like a better deal, and the dollar has strengthened.The stronger dollar is bad news for foreign countries and companies that borrowed dollars. That\u2019s because currency moves are always relative. If the dollar is up, that means other currencies are down, and vice versa. A stronger dollar therefore makes it more difficult for foreigners to pay back their dollar-based loans.Turkey is far from the only country whose economy has grown reliant on foreign lending. Argentina and South Africa are in the same boat. That\u2019s why some think that the problems underway in Turkey could be the start of something bigger.Indeed, Argentina\u2019s central bank on Monday surprised markets by raising its interest rates by five percentage points. It was an attempt to prop up its currency by encouraging foreign investors to stick around.That is certainly how it\u2019s worked at times in the past. One highly indebted, fast-growing economy starts to unravel, and others tend to follow, as fearful investors rush for the exits. In most cases, those countries\u2019 economies aren\u2019t all that large, but the chain reactions they trigger in the financial markets can have global repercussions.In 1994, the Mexican government devalued the peso, setting off a period of financial instability that came to be known as the Tequila Crisis. In 1997, the collapse of the Thai baht set off a financial crisis throughout East Asia.And in 1998, the devaluation of the Russian ruble threatened to spread instability to the heart of the developed world, when it contributed to the collapse of large American hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, sending financial markets in the United States into a panic.In past crises, one way that trouble spread was through the banking system. Foreign banks lent money to companies, investors and governments in the crisis-stricken countries. As borrowers defaulted, those loans led to deep losses that threatened to undermine the health of financial systems thousands of miles away.There are echoes of that situation in today\u2019s Turkey crisis. A number of large European banks \u2014 including Italy\u2019s UniCredit, Spain\u2019s BBVA and France\u2019s BNP Paribas \u2014 own stakes in Turkish lenders. Other western banks are exposed to Turkey via loans to Turkish companies.Those banking losses might not look likely to presage a broader crisis. But if other emerging-market countries follow Turkey into trouble, the losses could worsen.\u201cThis has the potential to be a real crisis,\u201d said Gary N. Kleiman, an emerging-market investment consultant who argues that too many developing economies have taken on too much debt. \u201cBanks are overstretched, and soon you are going to see an increase in nonperforming loans. It is going to spread.\u201dOn the other hand, events that look like they could shake the foundations of the global financial system sometimes fizzle out.But the sell-offs were relatively short lived. Markets recovered, and more important, the global financial system avoided a serious crisis.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Crisis Exposes the Perils of Strongman Rule", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterInflationary crises, like the one looming over Turkey, are bad news for any government, but they are especially dangerous for a certain subset of authoritarians: populist strongmen.Potentially catastrophic on their own, these are symptoms of a set of weaknesses and liabilities that go beyond monetary policy to the core of populist strongman rule.Before Turkey, there Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who oversaw their country\u2019s fall from prosperity to ruin, partly by plowing into an inflationary crisis.[Listen to an episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201d about how Turkey\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism helped trigger an economic crisis.]Populist strongmen \u2014 because of their relationships to their citizens, their fellow elites and to their own policymaking apparatus \u2014 tend to be different. Mr. Maduro printed more money, worsening the crisis dramatically. A decade earlier, Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe did much the same thing, to much the same effect.Whether Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ultimately follows the same path, he already is repeating the familiar patterns of a ruler constrained and guided by his system in ways not always in the country\u2019s long-term interests.Turkey\u2019s meltdown, more than just a product of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s power grabs, is a microcosm of the pathologies inherent in his style of governing, and that of other populist strongmen. And it is a reminder that, although their system seems to be rising in the world, it comes with special risks that make it, on average, more likely to collapse.Any dictator knows that inflation \u2014 which erodes legitimacy with the public and angers powerful elites who expect payouts \u2014 can pose existential risks. Elected leaders will merely lose office (most of the time), but an authoritarian state can more easily collapse outright.In 1989, workers angered by inflation in China joined idealistic students in protests that the government answered with one of the modern era\u2019s bloodiest crackdowns.Inflation can be so dangerous for authoritarians that it can also prompt otherwise unthinkable reforms.Vietnamese leaders, worried that a run of inflation in the 1980s could bring down the communist system, shifted to a more market-based economy.Iran\u2019s inflation surge, in 2013, fed into public dissatisfaction deep enough that the hard-line supreme leader stood by as voters ushered a relative moderate into the presidency.All forms of authoritarianism are susceptible: one-party states (think China or Cuba), monarchies (Saudi Arabia) or military dictatorships (Thailand today, others in the recent past).But a strongman \u2014 a charismatic leader, consolidating power for himself and smashing institutions that might challenge him \u2014 can make such crises easier to start and harder to contain.Much of that has to do with how strongmen typically come to power: by rising within a flawed democracy or, in some cases, a military or one-party regime. This leads them to dismantle the old system, which they see as a threat. That is often where the trouble starts.\u201cInsecurity over their futures can incentivize them to make choices that are bad in the long term,\u201d said Erica Frantz, a scholar of authoritarianism who teaches at Michigan State University.As they slash away at institutions and rivals, undermining their own legitimacy, they are more desperate for growth and more panicky about seeing it slide.China has seen its share of boondoggle infrastructure projects and overinvestment. But dictatorships run by an entrenched royal, military or party bureaucracy have something that strongmen often feel compelled to destroy: institutions.Even if authoritarian institutions are hardly fair or just, they are at least predictable and can be, within limits, independent. That makes them better able to manage or forestall problems. Particularly the central bank.Strongmen like Mr. Ch\u00e1vez or Mr. Erdogan, who installed his son-in-law as finance minister, tend to meddle with their central banks, both to juice short-term growth and out of a tendency to see independent institutions as threats rather than partners. Inflation rises, a precursor of worse to come.Even if rule of law is only weakened in a few sectors, this eventually catches up with central bankers, who come to act less as independent stewards than as loyal, or fearful, cronies.Bureaucratic dictatorships like China\u2019s often try to bolster their legal systems as a way to cement their rule, even if those legal systems remain deeply flawed. But a leader like Mr. Erdogan, who purged swathes of his country\u2019s judges, tends to see the judiciary as a threat.In a more bureaucratic system, at least in theory, competence trumps loyalty. Officials are held to long-term goals and the leadership feels secure enough to learn from unwelcome economic data. It\u2019s not that such leaders are more enlightened, merely that their incentives align with long-term stability over day-to-day image management.Under a strongman-style rule, even the leaders themselves grow demonstrably less competent.In her research on how dictators behave in war, Dr. Frantz found that \u201cpersonalist dictatorships don\u2019t always have access to accurate information or insightful advice,\u201d she said, using the academic term for strongmen. By isolating themselves in a bubble of sycophantic loyalists, they set themselves up for disastrous errors.This policy of partial blindness appears to limit economic decision-making as well, she said, citing data showing that \u201cinflation rates fluctuate significantly more from one year to the next in personalist dictatorships than in other forms of dictatorship.\u201dThe result is often that strongmen do not just overspend or overborrow \u2014 they do so unwisely, erratically and with little sanity imposed from central banks or other institutions. They can careen into crises that other countries would at least try to steer around.The strongman\u2019s relationship to powerful elites may make things worse. Mr. Maduro, for instance, grew more fearful of a coup as the economy declined, so he siphoned off resources to military leaders and the handful of other powerful insiders he could count on.Strongmen, dedicated as they are to crushing rivals, tend to enjoy the support of only some members of their country\u2019s elite, so need to keep them happy. That can distort the economy, as those members often belong to sectors that were lucrative when they came up but may have grown outdated. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s zeal for construction, where much of the overborrowing took place, may be instructive.Instead, the steel barons were brought to heel \u2014 something more easily done by a vast authoritarian bureaucracy than a lone strongman who needs to worry about his inner circle. Even Saudi Arabia, a monarchy with its own collectives and institutions, though deeply troubled, has forced through changes that disfavor a certain old elite.But, as the lira plummets in value, the greatest risks are borne by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s citizens, and not only in economic terms.Advertisement"}

Try chai and samosas: A bride-to-be returns to India to shop for her wedding in a bumpy, smog-filled trip, in-laws in tow.Supported byOn a Tuesday in December, from the dark corridors of the Delhi Metro, we climbed the staircase of the Chawri Bazar station single file, me last, since I had no idea where we were going. We emerged on the fringes of a traffic circle, into a thick, hazy smog that clung to our skin and throat and nostrils, and formed a film that for the next three weeks, would never really go away.Around us, on a chaotic street that used to anchor a 19th-century hardware bazaar, a million negotiations were taking place: chai vendors negotiating the ratio of tea to milk, tailors negotiating the price of stitching a blouse, drivers negotiating traffic, pedestrians negotiating drivers. My soon-to-be father-in-law, a New Delhi native and the Magellan of this city, brokered a deal of his own. He hailed two rickshaws \u2014 the three-wheel kind powered by people, not motors \u2014 told each where to go, the price he would pay \u2014 no motors, no meters \u2014 and motioned for his son and me, borderline millennials more accustomed to ride sharing than rickshaws, to hoist ourselves into one, while he and my mother-in-law expertly climbed into the other. The seats faced backward, offering an uninterrupted view of Old Delhi\u2019s traffic-thronged streets, crumbling facades and canopy of power lines.\u201cHow is this legal?\u201d I asked, staring up at a lethal-looking knot of electrical wires, not really expecting an answer. The driver started pedaling. I clutched onto the bar in front of me like a child on a roller coaster. We hit a bump in the road; I screamed.Some brides shop for their weddings while holding flutes of champagne. I could barely hold my phone long enough to take a selfie.Back in Los Angeles, where we live and much of our extended family does too, reality set in: It would be prohibitively expensive. A lot of our loved ones wouldn\u2019t be able to make the trip, what with the cost, their kids, their jobs. We\u2019d have so little control over the final product, planning a wedding from half a world away. But a \u201cpro\u201d had always been that it would be easier to find outfits and accouterments for our multiday Hindu wedding \u2014 we\u2019re culturally Hindu, if not the most religiously observant \u2014 in India than in the United States, where the selection along strips like Oak Tree Road (Edison and Iselin, N.J.) and Pioneer Boulevard (Artesia, Calif.) pales in comparison to that of shops in the motherland, where clothing rods sag with the weight of ornately beaded outfits, and proprietors pull ever more options from the back, loath to lose out on a potential sale.I knew from experience. I had been married before and purchased a gorgeous, peacock feather-festooned lehenga, the two-piece bridal gown native to North India, online. But I failed to diet or exercise enough to be comfortable showing a six-inch swath of my midriff, as the outfit did, and six weeks before my wedding in New York, panicked and bought a less revealing lehenga from a store in Jackson Heights, Queens. The photos make me cringe.There were other reasons to return to India: my fianc\u00e9\u2019s aforementioned grandfather, along with many relatives that we rarely see. My in-laws, whom I referred to with the reverential Auntie and Uncle, go back every December. If we went with them, I\u2019d have an opportunity to bond with the tight-knit family I was marrying into before I walked down the aisle again, something I knew was more important than the \u201cwow\u201d factor of the centerpieces. The memories banked during this trip could carry us through Thanksgivings and Christmases to come. My fianc\u00e9 and I would have an army to help us wade through the sea of bridal gowns, lehengas and achkans, the knee-length jacket worn by North Indian grooms, and we could also get wedding invitations made for less than we\u2019d pay in the United States.The caveat: since we were in his parents\u2019 old stomping-grounds, they would dictate the order of operations, which is why, within 12 hours of landing, we were barreling through the streets of Old Delhi in bicycle rickshaws, trying to find an alley that my father-in-law promised was lined with wedding invitation makers (many of whom also printed ornate business cards and stationery). Our goal: design the invitations and get them into production as soon as possible, so they\u2019d arrive in Los Angeles by early January.After 10 minutes that felt like much more than that, our rickshaws pulled to a stop near a stand of pomegranates. \u201cLet\u2019s check out a few shops, see the selection,\u201d my father-in-law said. (As the founder of a Los Angeles clothing manufacturing company, he\u2019s always on the hunt for a good deal.) If I was looking for Amazon, here it was: hole in the wall after hole in the wall, hundreds of them, hawking invitations as thick as hardcover books, some the size of shoe boxes.1/4 mileHaldiram'schandni chowk rd.Indu Fashionsold delhiindianai sarakjogiwaraChandni Chowkchawri bazar rd.R.

We returned to a more crowded Delhi than the one we left. Two weeks into our trip, my cousin-in-law, his parents and his girlfriend arrived, which meant there were now 11 people sharing a three-bedroom apartment. The teakettle in the kitchen started whistling at 5:30 each morning; showers ran cold after the first three. Family breakfasts of samosas, masala scrambled eggs and many, many cups of coffee got us to laugh about whatever funny thing had happened the day before \u2014 like me telling an Uber driver, \u201cno habla Hindi.\u201dWe piled back into the metro and then into rickshaws. I grumbled as we dodged mud puddles and scooters and stray dogs. Through an alley, up a dark, steep staircase, in an airless room where a graphic designer worked on a Windows desktop that couldn\u2019t have been made more recently than 1999, I understood: we had to sit there and review the invitation line by line. This part of town valued clients who communicated in person rather than over Wi-Fi.There was one more must-see on my list: Sabyasachi. Even though I had bought a gown for my sangeet and a lehenga for my wedding and loved both outfits (thought of them fondly, like pets), before leaving Delhi, I wanted to visit the place that informed what I first imagined I might look like as Bride 2.0.Four of us Ubered from the apartment to Sabyasachi\u2019s New Delhi flagship, in a gated colonial mansion shielded from the road by a row of tall hedges. On the second floor, in a low-lit room perfumed by dozens of fresh roses, there it was: the gown I\u2019d been eyeing on Instagram for months, that I had envisioned getting married in before even knowing how to pronounce the designer\u2019s name (Saab-yah-saa-chee). It was even more stunning in person, yards of velvet-studded netting and beads that folded and draped into a robe of epic effect.An attendant helped me into it; my fianc\u00e9 and soon-to-be family oohed and ahhed. But standing on a pedestal, in front of a panel of full-length mirrors, I realized the gown would be perfect for the type of wedding \u2014 and marriage \u2014 that I wasn\u2019t going to have. The dress inhibited movement and revelry. It was for standing on stage and posing for photographs, not dancing to Cardi B. I had done right to go with outfits that reflected my lifestyle, not that ephemeral \u201cwow\u201d factor.The day after the wedding, I apologized to my mother-in-law (I avoided family titles in the interim). She laughed and said, \u201cI thought it was kind of funny, but then you kept doing it and it sounded nice!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings. I didn\u2019t want to be inaccurate. I asked her what I should call her, now that I was officially her daughter-in-law.

{"Headline": "Should Coffee Come With Cancer Warnings? California Says No", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut now, the State of California has intervened, telling coffee drinkers not to worry. An agency has proposed a rule declaring that not only does coffee pose no significant risk of cancer, it may actually have health benefits.The measure will be the subject of a public hearing on Thursday in Sacramento. If the proposal goes into effect, it is expected to nullify the court ruling about coffee warnings.The reversal from suspected carcinogen to benign cup of joe is partly the result of more comprehensive scientific research. But it also reflects a rising concern that a blizzard of cancer warnings has desensitized consumers to serious health hazards.The basis of the coffee lawsuit is a California law that requires companies to warn consumers if they are exposed to hazardous substances in products. The law, which has a nationwide impact because of the size of the state\u2019s economy, already faces threats from federal legislators and legal challengers. Immunity for coffee could further destabilize it.In 2010, a small nonprofit group from Long Beach decided to take on California\u2019s coffee sellers, including Starbucks and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. In its case, the group noted that roasting coffee beans produces acrylamide, a chemical that has been linked to increased cancer risk when given to rodents in high concentrations. In 1991, the World Health Organization rated coffee as being \u201cpossibly carcinogenic.\u201dCoffee companies have said that attempts to strip acrylamide after beans were roasted were ineffective and warped the flavor. They also tried to convince Judge Elihu M. Berle in Los Angeles County Superior Court that trace amounts of the chemical in coffee were not dangerous to consumers.In March, Judge Berle ruled that coffee had to come with cancer warnings, and the coffee companies geared up for years of appeals.\u201cThere\u2019s a danger to overwarning \u2014 it\u2019s important to warn about real health risks,\u201d said Sam Delson, the office\u2019s deputy director for external and legislative affairs.The lawyer for the Council for Education and Research on Toxics, the group suing the coffee makers, described the proposal as \u201cunprecedented and bad\u201d when it was announced this summer.The state\u2019s action comes amid an escalating backlash against what is often seen as ubiquitous consumer warnings.In June, Representative Kurt Schrader, Democrat of Oregon, was a co-sponsor of a bipartisan bill in Congress to ban inaccurate cautionary signage.\u201cWhen we have mandatory cancer warnings on a cup of coffee, something has gone seriously wrong with the process,\u201d Mr. Schrader said while announcing the legislation.When California\u2019s cancer warning law passed in 1986, it was meant to inform Californians about tainted drinking water. The law, known as Proposition 65, now requires warnings for any product that exposes consumers to any one of more than 900 chemicals linked to birth defects and cancer.This includes mercury in the tooth fillings at the dentist\u2019s office and phthalates in vinyl couch cushions. Toilet paper, flip-flops, dumbbells and frozen oysters have been cited for noncompliance. There are Prop 65 warning signs at Disneyland.Consumer activists praise the law as a public health service. It has helped push companies to remove or reduce chemicals like 4-Methylimidazole from soft drinks and formaldehyde from cosmetics.Many more Prop 65 cases result in settlements than go to trial.Much of the law\u2019s \u201cmost powerful work is entirely invisible,\u201d forcing major companies around the country to be more conscientious about how they formulate their products, said Claudia Polsky, a law professor at University of California, Berkeley who worked for years on the Prop 65 enforcement team at the California attorney general\u2019s office.The law has created \u201ca cottage industry of lawyers roaming around looking for violators,\u201d said Nathan A. Schachtman, a product liability defense lawyer and a Columbia Law School lecturer. J. Jeffrey Campbell, a former chief executive of Burger King \u2014 a repeat Prop 65 defendant \u2014 has called it a \u201clegal mugging.\u201dThe number of cases has ballooned. Last year, nearly 700 Prop 65 cases were settled and $25.8 million paid out \u2014 nearly four times the number of settlements from a decade earlier and more than double the dollar amount. The number of plaintiffs has increased fourfold, with one group, Ecological Alliance, involved in 72 settlements last year alone.But recent court rulings suggest new resistance to cancer warnings.And in February, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked efforts to force Monsanto to put cancer warning labels on its herbicide Roundup. Monsanto had argued that the labels amounted to a violation of its First Amendment rights by compelling the company to express a thought it disagreed with.In coffee, however, the law\u2019s detractors found a single rallying point, said David Roe, a former Environmental Defense Fund lawyer who helped write the law.When faced with a Prop 65 complaint, most companies choose to quietly strip out the problematic ingredient rather than stick a warning on their product\u201cPeople trying to paint a bad picture of Prop 65 seized on coffee to create a poster child and say, \u2018See, what a silly law,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of either stupidity or overreaching in taking that case to trial.\u201dFor now, coffee companies are in a holding pattern. The state\u2019s proposal is expected be approved by the end of November.And Prop 65 litigation marches on. In recent months, lawyers have sent out Prop 65 violation notices to companies like Neiman Marcus, Walmart and CVS for selling products like bedsheets, kombucha and headphones.In a particularly bold move, they also targeted chocolate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Venezuela Cuts to Fight Inflation (Zeroes From Its Currency, That Is)", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 Faced with nearly incomprehensible inflation \u2014 32,714 percent as of Wednesday \u2014 Venezuelan officials thought they had a solution: They changed the color of the bank notes and increased their denomination. Then they said they would lop off three zeros. And when that didn\u2019t seem enough, they announced they would cut off two more.The tactics have left Venezuelans like Yosmar Nowak, the owner of a coffee shop in Caracas, convinced that there is no solution in sight and that the government cannot even bring down the price of a cup of coffee, an eye-watering 2 million bol\u00edvars.\u201cI imagine if we keep like this we\u2019re going to have to do the same thing in December,\u201d said Ms. Nowak, who has been forced to raise prices in her cafe at least 40 times this year.Slashing zeros from Venezuela\u2019s inflation-cursed currency, the bol\u00edvar, is the tent-pole of a set of economic changes by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as he tries to right his country\u2019s capsized economy. The five-digit inflation has earned Venezuela comparisons to the hyperinflation of Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany from the International Monetary Fund.The newly minted currency, which will be known as the \u201csovereign bol\u00edvar,\u201d will be rolled out on Monday. In addition, the president has ordered measures that his United Socialist Party has been loath to consider in the past: An increase in gas prices for some drivers and a modest ease in the currency controls that have made dollars inaccessible to most Venezuelans for years.Yet these changes haven\u2019t been enough to convince economists, who see desperation in Mr. Maduro\u2019s latest moves and view the new currency as another chapter in the decades of mismanagement that have destroyed the Venezuelan economy.\u201cIt\u2019s a cosmetic thing that\u2019s happening, the zeros,\u201d said Steve Hanke, an applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who has advised governments facing hyperinflation. \u201cIt means nothing unless you change economic policy.\u201dBy removing the zeros, Mr. Maduro is looking to solve what economists call hyperinflation\u2019s \u201cwheelbarrow problem\u201d \u2014 the point when the currency has become so worthless that a wheelbarrow of cash is necessary to make purchases.The new currency, which will be phased in as the old one is phased out, would bring the price of that cup of coffee at Ms. Nowak\u2019s shop down to the more manageable sum of 20 sovereign bol\u00edvars. But few think that price will hold for long.\u201cWe\u2019re expecting an increase in more than 1,000 percent for the minimum wage, and of course, more inflation,\u201d Ms. Nowak said. The tumult is so great, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to open Monday.\u201dThe problem isn\u2019t to do with the zeros, but rather what\u2019s causing them to appear. The Venezuelan government depends on sales from its state oil company to pay its debts. But mismanagement allowed production to sink to 1.2 million barrels a day in July \u2014 on par with the monthly rate in 1947.Faced with this shortage, the government turns to the Central Bank to order more money printed. While that may pay the government\u2019s bills in the short term, it comes at the expense of everyone who owns bol\u00edvars, as the surplus of printed cash makes existing money increasingly worthless.And paying bills is only one of Mr. Maduro\u2019s concerns.On Aug. 4, two drones exploded over a military parade Mr. Maduro was attending, in what the government said was an assassination attempt. And the president faces increasing economic isolation after he was declared the winner of an election to extend his term to 2025, a vote widely regarded as rigged.Amid this chaos, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country, finding daily life impossible in a country where grocery stores are empty and hospitals face water shortages, even in Caracas, the capital.The rollout of the currency has also been troubled, too. At first, the government said it would remove three zeros from the bills. But on July 25, with the dollar trading for nearly 3.5 million bol\u00edvars on the black market and continuing to lose value, the government said it would lop off five instead.The bol\u00edvar has only continued to lose value in the time since, with the dollar now approaching 6 million bol\u00edvars.While the changes mean prices that are less astronomical, they also create another problem for Venezuelans: Dividing by the unwieldy number 100,000. Economists say devaluations are usually done in increments of tens, thousands or millions to facilitate the math.\u201cI am confused,\u201d said Edwin Garc\u00eda, a construction worker in Caracas who tried to calculate what his earnings would be.Many stores in the capital now simply quote prices in dollars to avoid confusion.It\u2019s also unclear what backs the new currency, if anything at all.Troubled currencies are usually stabilized with a pledge from the government that they may be exchanged for a stronger one, like dollars or euros. Mr. Maduro, by contrast, has said the new bol\u00edvar will be backed by the petro, a cryptocurrency his government rolled out in February.And the petro itself, he said, is backed by oil reserves \u2014 a claim economists find troubling, given that much of the country\u2019s oil production is earmarked to pay off debt to China and Russia.\u201cYou\u2019re pegging a currency to a toxic asset which no one wants,\u201d said Daniel Lansberg-Rodr\u00edguez, a political columnist for the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional who teaches at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.Mr. Maduro\u2019s plan to raise gas prices has also been met with skepticism.Venezuelans currently pay a fraction of a cent to fill up their tanks \u2014 the lowest price in the world. Mr. Maduro has pledged to continue subsidizing fuel for those who sign up for a government identification card and register their cars with the government, but he wants Venezuelans who don\u2019t sign up to start paying the going international price.\u201cIt allows you to target the subsidy to those willing to buy into the system,\u201d said Mr. Lansberg-Rodr\u00edguez. \u201dIt\u2019s a bid for loyalty.\u201dIn gas stations in Caracas, there were more doubts about the plan. Alejandro Bol\u00edvar, a station supervisor in the suburb of El Hatillo, said no one from the government had come to reset the machines to the new currency or to explain when they would need to start verifying if buyers had government ID cards.For its part, the Venezuelan government claims inflation has been caused by an \u201ceconomic war\u201d waged by the United States and business people who oppose it.But economists said that if Venezuela is to curb hyperinflation, it will have to stop printing money.Mr. Hanke, the Johns Hopkins economist, recalls a similar situation in Yugoslavia, which he advised until 1991. Though Mr. Hanke objected to its currency changes, the country pushed ahead in 1990, removing four zeros from its bills. Its succeeding government removed another zero in 1992. In October 1993 it removed six zeros, in December nine more, and then at the start of 1994 another seven.With hyperinflation running at 313 million percent per month, the mint couldn\u2019t keep up.And that country, Mr. Hanke noted, had a world-class mint. Mr. Maduro has no working mint, and must import bank notes.\u201cIt\u2019s an impossible situation,\u201d said Mr. Hanke.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting from Caracas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Administration Gets Tough on Russia \u2014\u00a0Despite Trump", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president holds chummy meetings with Vladimir Putin, while his administration imposes new sanctions.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Certainly Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is asking for punishment when his agents use a chemical weapon against a double agent, brazenly meddle in Western elections, cheat in international sports, ruthlessly ravage Ukrainian territory or violate human rights.In fact, the sanctions announced Wednesday should not have been unpredictable. They follow a 1991 law requiring sanctions against any country that uses chemical or biological weapons. The administration should have imposed them months ago.Still, there is a value in demonstrating to Mr. Putin and his band that however friendly Mr. Trump may seem, or whatever hold Mr. Putin may have on Mr. Trump, the United States is not prepared to condone Russia\u2019s aggression or meddling. That Washington is continuing to punish Russia, despite anything Mr. Trump says or does, may also deter European leaders leaning toward lifting sanctions, like those in Hungary and Italy, from rushing to do so.Yet sanctions are a potent weapon whose effectiveness is diminished when they are not backed by united resolve. The discord in the United States, or in Europe, allows Mr. Putin to claim that Western penalties are the result not of anything Russia did, but of an internal dispute between Western hawks and doves, between those who would do anything to prevent Russia from being great and those who seek friendly relations with an important nation.Mr. Putin may even believe this, following the cynical Soviet view of international politics instilled in him in his K.G.B. years as a vicious game of thrones in which the West\u2019s concern for human rights or rules are just cynical weapons to be deployed when needed. Meddling in American and European politics is a direct product of that worldview.Sanctions may not persuade Mr. Putin or his followers that the world, or at least the West, really does get angry when he violates elemental rules of international behavior, as when Russia uses lethal chemical weapons abroad, incites violence in an independent neighbor, seizes foreign territory, cheats in the Olympic Games, murders opponents or uses cyberweapons to interfere in foreign elections. He is even less likely to be persuaded when he believes he has a kindred, or at least malleable, spirit in the White House, and hopes he can manipulate Americans to elect more of the same.What could persuade Mr. Putin is the certainty that some behaviors carry an inevitable and heavy cost. The Russians must see that any respite from sanctions depends on them, and not on the unpredictable resident of the White House or a few populist leaders in Europe.This would be a good time for Mr. Trump to declare that he is fully behind his State Department and National Security Council in demanding an accounting from Russia. An administration divided against itself only makes a mockery of sanctions. Advertisement"}

He Keeps Them Close.", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "The Republican nominee for Senate in Virginia likes to engage the racial fringes of his party, creating a dilemma for mainstream G.O.P. leaders wary of his views.Supported byWOODBRIDGE, Va. \u2014 Corey Stewart stands at the end of a long driveway that leads back in time, to his 18th century plantation manor hidden in woods behind a modern housing development. Mr. Stewart, the Republican Senate nominee from Virginia, treats the brick home like a living museum, complete with buttons from Redcoats, a Civil War soldier\u2019s belt buckle and a room dedicated to George and Martha Washington, who were once visitors.This has made him a popular figure with white nationalists, much to the horror of many Virginia Republicans. While Mr. Stewart has disavowed some on the extreme right, interviews with dozens of his friends, colleagues, supporters and fellow Republicans yielded a portrait of a political opportunist eager to engage the coarsest racial fringes of his party to advance his Trumpian appeal.\u201cI don\u2019t think he said anything bad there,\u201d Mr. Stewart, 50, said during a 90-minute interview last month. \u201cIn fact I was one of the few people in the country that actually said pretty much the same thing.\u201dHe does not accept that slavery was at the heart of the Civil War.\u201cWe can debate about the causes of the Civil War,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut the causes of it were much more complex\u201d than only slavery.\u201cThe question of what actually caused the Civil War is secondary to the result of the Civil War, which is that after the war was over, slavery was ended and the North and the South reconciled. And I think we need to respect that.\u201dHe contended that the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was a concoction of the left.\u201cThis term they literally resurrected, \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which hadn\u2019t been used in 100 years, or whatever it was,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s clearly a coordinated effort to \u2014 because they know the term \u2018racist\u2019 has been overused \u2014 they\u2019ve come up with another one which is \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 an equally ridiculous term.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body,\u201d Mr. Stewart said during a recent appearance. \u201cNot one. I challenge anybody to find a single racist statement that I\u2019ve ever made.\u201dIn an extraordinary sign of discomfort with Mr. Stewart, some Republicans have been eager behind the scenes to provide opposition research aimed at discrediting him, with disaffected party members circulating racially inflammatory tweets and Facebook postings authored by one of Mr. Stewart\u2019s advisers.But many Republican leaders haven\u2019t publicly disavowed Mr. Stewart, mindful that Mr. Trump is supporting him, and that the president has strong influence with the party base \u2014 many of whom supported Mr. Stewart in the primary.Virginia has not elected a Republican statewide since 2009 and voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016. With its strong economy and elite public university system, Virginia has become a symbol of Southern moderation and tolerance, but the far right sees an ally in Mr. Stewart who will push back against the leftward drift and demographic changes underway in the state.For his part, Mr. Stewart said he sees virtue in being provocative.\u201cI think you need to be edgy,\u201d he said.Even as a teenager growing up in Duluth, Mr. Stewart was known for his ambition.\u201cI had many kinds of debaters,\u201d his high school debate coach, Jack Armstrong said. \u201cCorey was a street smart debater,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cby the time he was a senior he was ranking with some of the best in the state.\u201dHe came from a family of Democrats. His father was a longshoreman who couldn\u2019t vote because of a felony conviction, Mr. Stewart said, adding it was \u201cprobably manslaughter\u201d stemming from a fatal car accident. The younger Mr. Stewart was the first in his family to graduate from college, initially attending St. Olaf College in Minnesota, then transferring to Georgetown.\u201cI wanted more,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing wrong with it, but I just wanted to see more.\u201dHe eventually became an international trade lawyer and moved to Virginia, working at Foley & Lardner, a prominent firm. In 2006 he was elected chairman of the Prince William County Board, a county outside Washington, D.C., that has become majority minority in recent years.In his politics, Mr. Stewart embraced expediency over ideology. He was initially anti-development, riding concerns about the pace of growth, then later allied with developers. Amid the county\u2019s shifting demographics \u2014 its Hispanic population tripled rapidly \u2014 he picked up on immigration as a hot button. \u201cI changed my focus to address what people were telling me their concerns were,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get elected.\u201dMany found the ease with which Mr. Stewart adopted hard-line views unsettling, starting with colleagues at work.\u201cSome of the partners at the firm didn\u2019t like that very much,\u201d Mr. Stewart said of his immigration stance, adding, \u201cit became uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got this guy who is a transplant coming into Virginia trying to out-Southern folks who\u2019ve been here for 400 years,\u201d said Brian Schoeneman, a Fairfax Republican and former legislative candidate.\u201cThe monuments weren\u2019t contentious until the left started taking them down,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, adding that \u201cthankfully those efforts seem to have subsided.\u201dHe claimed that \u201cthe ones who were most vehement in terms of taking down the monuments were not African-Americans. They were white liberals.\u201dBut Kevin Chandler, president of the state\u2019s N.A.A.C.P., called Mr. Stewart \u201ctreasonous\u201d for his embrace of the Confederate flag.\u201cIt symbolizes hate.

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Assails Canada Over Rights Criticism, Sending Message to West", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia lashed out at Canada on Monday for criticizing the recent arrests of Saudi rights activists, and threatened to break off trade with other Western countries if they too spoke out about political repression in the kingdom.Faced with economic troubles at home, and a restless, young population, the crown prince has carried out a crackdown that is extraordinary even by the standards of an absolute monarchy that has never allowed much room for free speech.After what once would have passed as a pro forma complaint from Canada, Saudi Arabia expelled the Canadian ambassador, withdrew its ambassador from Canada and froze new business deals and investment with Canada.\u201cOn one hand, you have this initiative to open Saudi Arabia up to the world, and on the other, you have this harder line approach to making all business with Saudi Arabia on Saudi terms,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who studies Persian Gulf politics. \u201cIt is unclear if these two tendencies will clash later on.\u201dSince beginning his ascent to power in 2015 when his father, King Salman, assumed the throne, Prince Mohammed, 32, has sought to overhaul the kingdom\u2019s ways of doing business.Even as the kingdom granted women the right to drive, it has detained more than a dozen prominent women and men who had campaigned for the right. Others were told not to speak about it in the media or face consequences.In interviews, Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials have stood up for the new approach, saying that the kingdom needs to play a more assertive role in shaping its region. The Ritz crackdown was needed to send a strong message against corruption, they said, and Iran\u2019s revolutionary ambitions had to be stopped, a view that has found support with the leaders of the United States and Israel.For decades, Saudi Arabia\u2019s relationship with Western countries rested on trade, with the kingdom selling huge amounts of oil while buying billions of dollars in weapons.The United States, a major Saudi trading partner, has occasionally criticized the Saudis on human rights but without jeopardizing its economic interests. Even such toothless criticism has largely dried up under the Trump administration.Such complaints were historically handled quietly, and the Saudis usually ignored them.The dispute with Canada broke that pattern.After the arrest of two women\u2019s rights activists last week, Chrystia Freeland, the foreign minister of Canada, called for the release of one of them, Samar Badawi, as well as the release of her brother, Raif Badawi, a blogger who was already serving a long prison term for administering a website that criticized the country\u2019s religious establishment.The ministry issued a broader statement, saying it was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the arrests of human rights activists and calling for their immediate release.It also warned that if other nations made similar criticisms, they could face similar consequences.\u201cThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not interfere in the internal affairs of other states and it won\u2019t accept any attempt to interfere in our internal affairs,\u201d Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Twitter. \u201cWe deal with that with all firmness.\u201dIn a statement on Monday, the Trump administration said it had asked Saudi Arabia for additional information on the detention of several activists.\u201cWe continue to encourage the government of Saudi Arabia to respect due process and to publicize information on the status of legal cases,\u201d Jessica Eldosoky, a State Department spokeswoman, wrote in an email. \u201cWe address these broad concerns in our annual Human Rights Report.\u201dIn Canada, how to deal with the Saudi government\u2019s human rights record has been hotly debated since 2016, when the Canadian government signed an $11.5 billion deal to export Canadian-made armored vehicles to the kingdom.Canadian criticism of the deal increased after videos emerged showing Saudi security services using the vehicles in a restive enclave of Saudi Arabia\u2019s minority Shiite population, where residents sometimes clashed with government forces.A Canadian government probe found no credible information that Saudi forces \u201ccommitted serious human rights violations\u201d there and that the ministry \u201cmade efforts to minimize civilian casualties during the operation.\u201dBut the incident further soured Canadian public opinion on the deal.\u201cPolitically, it\u2019s a win-win for Minister Freeland in terms of domestic opinion,\u201d Randall Hansen, the interim director of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto, said of the foreign minister\u2019s standing up for anti-Saudi activists.Ms. Freeland, in a statement on Monday, said Canada was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the ambassador\u2019s expulsion.\u201cCanada will always stand up for the protection of human rights, including women\u2019s rights and freedom of expression around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will never hesitate to promote these values and we believe that this dialogue is critical to international diplomacy.\u201dSaudi Arabia does not play a major role Canada\u2019s economy, making the move largely symbolic.Bilateral merchandise trade between the two countries exceeded $3 billion in 2017, making Saudi Arabia Canada\u2019s 20th largest importer. Canada imports only about 9 percent of its crude oil from the kingdom.Those trade numbers may have given the Saudis more room to act, said Mr. Ulrichsen, the scholar of Gulf politics.\u201cThe Saudis may be using the Canadian example as a way to warn other governments that they will not accept criticism any longer of their management of their internal affairs, and Canada may be a relatively low-cost example,\u201d he said.But it was not the first time that Prince Mohammed has sought to exact an economic cost for Western criticism.Saudi Arabia suspended deals with German firms and recalled its ambassador from Germany last year after the German foreign minister appeared to criticize Saudi foreign policy. The kingdom also recalled its ambassador to Sweden and stopped issuing business visas to Swedes in 2015 after human rights criticisms. Sweden, in turn, canceled an arms deal.Saudi officials say the waves of arrests under Prince Mohammed are in accordance with Saudi law, but the government has not made it clear who is it holding, whether they have been charged with any crimes or when their trials will take place.\u201cThe repression has intensified since he came to power,\u201d said Hiba Zayadin, a Saudi researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe Saudi government has never been this adamant about shutting down every space for dissent.\u201dMs. Badawi\u2019s former husband, an activist lawyer, is also in prison.Catherine Porter contributed reporting from Georgian Bay, Ontario, and Gardiner Harris from Washington.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter: @NYTBen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Sees Real Brexit Talks at Last \u2014 and Real Dangers", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 From the start of the torturous negotiations over Brexit, as Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union is known, the talks have followed an all too familiar dynamic.The Europeans set the agenda; the British push for concessions or special deals, while trying to work out among themselves what they really want. The Europeans say no, sticking to a pretty hard line.But now, with 85 percent of a deal completed, and the toughest issues remaining, European officials say they are increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government is so divided and fragile that it could collapse, scuttling a deal and inflicting damage on the Continental economy.So the Europeans are now exploring ways to finesse their position, three senior European officials say, to sign a withdrawal agreement by the end of the year so it can be ratified by the end of March, when Brexit occurs regardless.That would formally divorce Britain from the bloc after more than 40 years of marriage. But some of the hardest issues would be left for transition talks that will last another 19 months, until the end of 2020.All of the officials spoke anonymously, following diplomatic practice, and because they do not have permission to be quoted by name.Big issues remain to be resolved, with the Irish border chief among them. So the Europeans say they may agree to fuzzy language in the withdrawal agreement\u2019s political declaration \u2014 along the lines of \u201caiming to negotiate the closest possible partnership.\u201dThe aim is to reduce internal British political warfare over how to best keep the promise of no hard border between Ireland, which will remain in the European Union, and Northern Ireland, which will not.The new British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been traveling through northern Europe, lobbying for Britain\u2019s position, warning of a chaotic no deal Brexit, and urging \u201ca change in approach\u201d by Brussels. The British and European Union negotiators will meet again on Thursday and Friday, an unusual mid-vacation session.A big sticking point is how to oversee disputes between Britain and the bloc, since Mrs. May, pushed by fervent Brexiteers, does not want to give the European Court of Justice, the bloc\u2019s highest court, any authority over Britain once it leaves the European Union.But the thorniest issue is the nature of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because its status hinges on some understanding of the future trading relationship between Britain and the bloc, which remains up in the air.What was objectionable, they say, is that Britain talks of wanting an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d with the bloc that is akin to being part of the single market for goods alone.The Europeans have been clear that Britain cannot keep what it had as a member without the obligations of membership, in particular the free movement of goods, as well as capital, services and labor.Nor can it be in a formal customs union if it wishes to make its own trading deals, as Mrs. May continues to insist.Britain has failed to understand, the Europeans say, how much the European Union itself feels threatened by the world since the Brexit referendum \u2014 by the challenges of President Trump, Russia and China, as well as the rise of authoritarian leaders in Hungary and Poland and populists in general who are largely anti-Brussels, as are those in Italy.So there is even less willingness now to compromise on key European Union principles, and a desire, especially from France, to make it clear that membership in the bloc has privileges not shared by other countries.There is also a growing weariness with Britain and Mrs. May, who seems to be arguing that she is politically so weak that she cannot talk honestly with her own citizens about what Brexit actually means.\u201cThe U.K. is looking at this from the angle of the future relationship,\u201d a senior European official said. \u201cThe other 27 are looking at this as an attack on what the E.U. is.\u201d\u201cWe regret the loss of the U.K., which is a cost for everyone,\u201d the official added. \u201cBut it would be even worse if this is the occasion for compromising on the core of the E.U. \u2014 that\u2019s to say, the single market.\u201dThat understanding finally seems to be coming home to the British, the Europeans feel, but they are reluctant to specify the consequences, for fear of hurting Mrs. May and creating a new political crisis in Britain that would throw the whole Brexit process into chaos.So the Europeans are discussing vague language about a future relationship, hoping that will be enough to make Britain accept the need for a backstop to ensure there is no hard or visible border on the island of Ireland.\u201cThe aim,\u201d a second European official said, \u201cis to make what seems unacceptable merely unpalatable.\u201dEuropean officials are also searching for compromise.If a formal customs union is impossible, European officials say one solution might be a future free-trade agreement with the European Union, much as Canada and Japan now have, but one that could allow the unencumbered movement of goods across the British (and Irish) borders.But there is no guarantee that such a free-trade deal will be quick or easy. Normally such agreements take years to negotiate.There is also discussion of limiting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and European Union customs officials over Northern Ireland as part of the \u201cbackstop\u201d deal, which Ireland (with the support of Brussels) has insisted be written into the withdrawal agreement.If Britain and Brussels cannot work out their future trading relationship in time, the backstop would essentially establish a border between the entire island of Ireland and the rest of Britain for customs, regulatory standards and value-added tax.Given the difficulties, some in Britain have been forecasting no deal at all, a so-called cliff-edge Brexit. But senior European officials think that a deal is still more likely than not, if both sides are \u201creasonable.\u201dThey also say they would be willing to extend the \u201ctransition\u201d period to negotiate a new relationship with Britain past December 2020, its current end date. But a specific clause to that effect, with a time limit, must be included in the withdrawal agreement.The problem for Britain is that any extension would mean additional payments into the European Union budget and a continuation of \u201crule taking\u201d without a vote, which would outrage Brexiteers.What many European officials fear is less a cliff-edge Brexit next March than one at the end of 2020, if a final free-trade deal is not completed.To negotiate a special free-trade deal with Britain that avoids a hard border in Ireland, plus a possible second agreement on security, would ordinarily take years.But the Brexit withdrawal agreement comes first, and the remaining issues are difficult.At least now though, European officials say, the talks, at long last, can get more serious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Shrinking. That\u2019s a Problem for Everyone.", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe American stock market has been shrinking. It\u2019s been happening in slow motion \u2014 so slow you may not even have noticed. But by now the change is unmistakable: The market is half the size of its mid-1990s peak, and 25 percent smaller than it was in 1976.When I say \u201cshrinking,\u201d I\u2019m using a specific definition: the reduction in the number of publicly traded companies on exchanges in the United States. In the mid-1990s, there were more than 8,000 of them. By 2016, there were only 3,627, according to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Because the population of the United States has grown nearly 50 percent since 1976, the drop is even starker on a per-capita basis: There were 23 publicly listed companies for every million people in 1975, but only 11 in 2016, according to Professor Stulz.This puts the United States \u201cin bad company in terms of the percentage decrease in listings \u2014 just ahead of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the size of the United States, its economic development, financial development and its respect for shareholder rights,\u201d he added, one might expect that tally to be climbing, not falling.In his new paper, \u201cThe Shrinking Universe of Public Firms: Facts, Causes, and Consequences,\u201d Professor Stulz surveyed the body of academic research on the topic. In an interview, he said that the casual observer may not entirely grasp the implications of the changes that have taken place.\u201cThe headline is that the number of public firms is shrinking, but it\u2019s not just that,\u201d he said. Profits in the overall market are now divided among fewer winners. And as capital-intensive companies have been supplanted by those whose value is largely found in their intellectual property, the marketplace is less transparent \u2014 with troubling consequences.Consider these big shifts:\u25a0 The companies on the market today are, on average, much larger than the public corporations of decades ago. Fast-rising upstarts are harder to find.In 1975, 61.5 percent of publicly traded firms had assets worth less than $100 million, using inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars. But by 2015, that proportion had dropped to only 22.6 percent.Because of this, Professor Stulz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for the general public to invest in a diversified portfolio of really small, publicly traded companies in the way they could a few decades ago.\u201dIn theory, as a shareholder, you are entitled to a piece of a company\u2019s future earnings. That\u2019s one of the main arguments for buying stock in the first place. But the reality is that you often are buying a piece of a money-losing proposition. Aside from the top 200 companies, the rest of the market, as a whole, is burning, not earning, money.\u25a0 A quirk of accounting is at the root of some of that profit deficit, especially for smaller and younger companies. Increasingly, value resides in intellectual property \u2014 \u201cintangibles\u201d like software and data and biological design \u2014 rather than in the production of physical objects like cars.But under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which American companies must follow, research and development must be deducted from corporate income \u2014 and those charges can reduce or eliminate profits. (Capital expenditures \u2014 in physical things like factories \u2014 appear on corporate balance sheets, not income statements, and don\u2019t reduce profits.)Without deep knowledge of a company\u2019s critical research \u2014 which businesses may be reluctant to share, for competitive reasons \u2014 it\u2019s difficult for outsiders to evaluate a start-up\u2019s worth. That makes it harder to obtain funding, and it may be partly responsible for certain trends: why there are fewer initial public offerings these days, why smaller companies are being swallowed by the giants, and why so many companies remain private for longer.That creates opportunities for private equity firms, which have insider access to innovative start-ups that may never go directly to the public markets. Meanwhile, Main Street investors are consigned to a less diverse universe than they may realize.There\u2019s a broader problem. Our visibility into the inner workings of public companies isn\u2019t great, but we know far more about them than we do private companies, which aren\u2019t required to disclose nearly as much information.And these changing dynamics mean we know far less about many of the creators of American profits and jobs than would otherwise be the case.In a democracy in which corporations already have enormous clout, that is worth worrying about.Advertisement"}

McMaster, the former national security adviser \u2014 regarded as a grave mistake.In an email to The New York Times to promote Mr. Hook\u2019s new post, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the administration\u2019s approach.\u201cIran is a threat to the U.S. and our allies as it fuels terrorism, instability and weapons proliferation in the Middle East, Europe and beyond while the regime commits horrendous crimes against its own people,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\u201cWe have the right strategy and an Iran-focused \u2018A-Team\u2019 already here at State,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urgently need to accelerate our diplomacy and coordination with partners around the globe.\u201dThe agreement that Mr. Trump jettisoned put severe limits on Iran\u2019s ability to make nuclear fuel until 2030, but lifted them thereafter. Its scope also was limited merely to Iran\u2019s nuclear activity.France has since proposed a separate accord to limit Iran\u2019s missile testing, which has proceeded despite a United Nations resolution urging it not to conduct those tests. Iran has ignored that mandate.Mr. Hook\u2019s appointment reflects something of a reversal at the State Department. Mr. Tillerson had eliminated many \u201cspecial envoy\u201d posts after concluding that there were far too many, causing organizational chaos.Mr. Hook said the Iran problem required an official with powers to reach into many corners of the United States government.\u201cIran is about as crosscutting as it gets in foreign policy challenges,\u201d Mr. Hook said, noting its reach into policy concerns about nuclear proliferation, missiles, maritime security, human rights and terrorism.Mr. Hook and Mr. Pompeo believe that the Arab states and Israel have been enthusiastic about the American exit from the nuclear agreement. But the Europeans have argued that it unnecessarily sets up a confrontation where none is necessary: Reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirm that Iran has stayed within the restrictions, and there was no need to blow up an agreement that was working, they say.The European Union has threatened to punish firms that bend to the American threats and withdraw from Iran. But American officials are betting that Europe will not penalize companies that calculate their business interests with the world\u2019s largest economy vastly outweigh any interests in pursuing business in Iran.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Mt. Etna, Europe Makes a Last Stand for Solar", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCATANIA, Italy \u2014 The enormous glass building on the outskirts of this Sicilian city had been intended for making silicon wafers for flash memory chips. That plan got crushed by the global financial crisis.Built in the early 2000s, it was overhauled in 2011 to churn out conventional panels used to build solar farms in Greece, Italy and South Africa. Once again, the factory struggled, this time losing ground to Chinese rivals that trumped it on price, as well as on technology.Now, the facility\u2019s owner, the Italian utility Enel, is changing tack again, betting on an advanced, commercially untested system for solar panels. This time, Enel hopes it finally has what it takes to challenge the industry behemoth \u2014 China.A short distance beyond the toe of Italy\u2019s boot, Europe is making what may be its last-gasp bid to remain a player in the global solar sector.The region was an early backer of technology harnessing the sun\u2019s energy. But manufacturing of solar panels here has fallen off in the years since, as Chinese companies have cut prices and ramped up production.Enel believes that by focusing on an esoteric technology, it can afford to make panels here and avoid a price war. It hopes that its products, which can capture more energy from the sun\u2019s rays than those of rivals, will offer greater value than cheaper models.\u201cMaking solar power is not rocket science,\u201d said Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm. \u201cIt is something you can do more cheaply when you have a big manufacturing base.\u201dAt the foot of Mount Etna, Catania is known for its trove of ornate buildings fashioned from black and gray lava rock and decorated with winged cherubs. The city has also long served as an industrial and agricultural hub for Sicily, thanks in part to a busy port, which is also an entry point for thousands of migrants from North Africa, across the Mediterranean.More recently, it has fallen on harder times. And, like the city itself, the building housing the Enel factory has struggled to adapt to economic shifts. Every time it charted a path, Chinese rivals were quick to crowd it out.In the latest such instance, as prices for solar power dropped sharply in recent years, the Italian utility came to a difficult conclusion: Its panels were already a third less efficient than those developed by Chinese manufacturers, and that gap is likely to widen over time.\u201cWe said to ourselves: \u2018We have bought the company. What do we do?\u2019\u201d said Antonello Irace, the head of the Catania unit, known as EGP 3Sun.Mr. Irace eventually admitted defeat, shutting down the old production line last fall to retool the plant.Enel is spending 87.5 million euros, or about $101 million, on new equipment and other changes, of which the Italian government is chipping in \u20ac14 million. The European Union is adding an extra \u20ac9 million to help cover operating expenses.The Catania plant is likely to begin producing state-of-the-art solar panels next year, after trial runs in the coming months. It is embracing heterojunction technology, a system that has not been commercially proven. It involves adding a new, microscopic layer of silicon to solar cells, increasing their ability to gather sunlight and convert it into electricity.These new panels will also be \u201cbifacial,\u201d meaning they will be able to gather light not only directly from the sun but also from stray beams that bounce off the ground.Enel expects that panels made in the first year will be able to convert around 20 percent of sunlight to energy, which is toward the higher end of industry averages. It hopes to reach 25 percent in five years \u2014 which would help offset their higher cost.That could make a big difference in winning projects. Bids on giant solar farms worth hundreds of millions of dollars are increasingly price sensitive, and costs are falling fast.Those efforts may amount to little, however, if Enel cannot produce its panels on a larger scale, sufficient to compete with rivals from China.For now, Enel aims to produce around 500,000 panels a year, a drop in the bucket compared with its Chinese competitors. In effect, it is \u201cshipping cartons and crates,\u201d said Chris Buckland, head of technology at Lightsource BP, a British solar developer. By contrast, Chinese companies are filling \u201c40-foot containers.\u201dThe Italian utility\u2019s difficulties ramping up output point to the vastly changing fortunes of the solar sectors in Europe and China.Solar energy was largely commercialized in Europe around 20 years ago. Governments stimulated demand with generous subsidies, encouraging homeowners to install panels on their roofs and utilities to invest in larger-scale solar farms.But its popularity was limited in those early years by the high cost of the electricity that was being generated. Seeing little prospect of widespread sales, companies in the West built small factories, the largest of which had only a few hundred workers.China now makes about 65 percent of the world\u2019s solar panels, and Chinese companies build at least another 10 percent at factories in Southeast Asia, according to GTM Research, a unit of the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.Europe, by contrast, has less than a tenth of the market. Dozens of American and European companies have gone bankrupt or closed production. Factories have shut down, and equipment makers have moved to Asia.A few companies, notably Tesla, are trying to establish production lines in the West, using new technologies that Chinese factories cannot easily emulate.That is the route Enel is trying to follow in Sicily. Although heterojunction technology is not patented, Enel hopes that refinements it has made to the manufacturing process will give it a head start on rivals.\u201cWe have to manufacture modern, advanced, innovative products in their initial life cycle,\u201d said Antonio Cammisecra, the chief executive of Enel Green Power.If Enel succeeds, it will give a crucial lift to a region that has lost as much as a quarter of its industrial capacity since the financial crisis, said Armando Castronuovo, an expert on the area at the University of Catania. The city\u2019s economic backbone \u2014 agribusiness and tourism \u2014 has held up relatively well, but youth unemployment remains around 40 percent.Enel has drawn on the local university to find the advanced science graduates necessary to ensure it can continue to come up with cutting-edge technology. In all, it has preserved some 300 jobs at the plant and a nearby research center.Andrea Canino, 38, said science students like himself had benefited from close collaboration between the university and companies like Enel.Mr. Canino obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Catania in 2008, at the depths of the downturn, but managed to get work at a research institute and, later, at a small semiconductor company. Finally, in 2012, he landed his job with Enel.\u201cHere in Sicily, it is not easy to find technology work,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prepared for other possibilities.\u201dStanley Reed reported from Catania, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}

As a result, they are reluctant to allow other events that could compete with it.The involvement of so many prominent people and companies who for years maintained strong ties with China makes the decision to move the event surprising.The group did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.Its request last week came as a blow to Mr. Bloomberg, who wants to engage with China on issues such as trade and climate change.Organizers scrambled to find another site, and prominent Singaporeans agreed to host, the people familiar with planning said.

It\u2019s not clear that everyone can.\u201dThe strengthening of authoritarianism in China poses a dilemma for Westerners who want to engage with the country but also say that they champion liberal thought and freedoms, as Mr. Bloomberg does.In that context, some experts say, the move to Singapore could benefit the event.In Washington, some policymakers are taking a more skeptical view of business executives who maintain friendly ties with Beijing.Organizers of the event said in a statement on Wednesday that their Chinese partner had asked to postpone the conference until fall 2019 and that Singapore was then chosen for this year \u201cbecause of its position as one of the world\u2019s leading international and business hubs.\u201d The statement was posted online after queries from The New York Times.Most topics for the forum listed on the event\u2019s website are broad and innocuous \u2014 global governance, technology, urbanization, climate, inclusion and finance and capital markets. But one topic \u2014 trade \u2014 has new contentiousness associated with it.One person familiar with conversations between organizers and the Chinese center said the Chinese side did not object to the programming.In recent years, Mr. Bloomberg has generally tried to stay on friendly terms with Chinese officials, though the relationship is complicated.Yet Mr. Bloomberg is also committed to free trade and global issues that require working with China, including climate change. Both Mr. Bloomberg and Chinese leaders have separately criticized the Trump administration for withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

All are Republican.In a year when congressional Republicans are clinging to the president like tomato vines to a trellis, Republican governors running for re-election in the heavily Democratic states of Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and, to a lesser degree, Illinois have emerged as well-positioned incumbents who seem likely to survive an expected blue swell in November.A crucial mix of bipartisanship, aggressively mild temperaments and gentle checks on liberal proclivities have kept moderates and independents happy in their states.\u201cMy answer to anybody who doesn\u2019t like the direction our Republican Party is going is to elect good Republicans,\u201d said Jud Ashman, the Democratic mayor of Gaithersburg, Md., in the deep blue suburbs of Washington, who supports the state\u2019s Republican governor, Larry Hogan. \u201cI may be the only elected Democrat who will endorse him, but I won\u2019t be the only one to vote for him.\u201d\u201cI always did exactly what I said I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Mr. Hogan said in a recent interview here, hiding from rain under the slats of an opioid treatment center under construction. \u201cOn every issue, I\u2019ve never said, \u2018What\u2019s the Republican answer? What\u2019s the Democratic answer?\u2019 I listen to both sides. I don\u2019t care whose idea it is.\u201dIn a year that is expected to draw far more Democratic voters to the polls than the typical midterm election, Republicans in blue states will depend on the Democrats who helped them win in the first place, and who might be tempted to split their tickets this time. To woo them, most have signed on to policies that appeal to those voters.While criticizing the president can be a political death sentence for many Republicans, it is more of a life raft for governors in these states. Mr. Hogan was an early rejecter of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Scott and Mr. Baker have openly criticized the president\u2019s policies. All are rated safe or nearly so by political strategists who study governors\u2019 races.\u201cThree of the five most popular governors are Republicans in blue states,\u201d said Jennifer E. Duffy, senior editor for The Cook Political Report, an independent newsletter in Washington. \u201cThese are governors who have largely proven that they are more in sync with the voters in those states, and what they want and need, than what their party wants from them.\u201dThese Republicans might be expected to draw strong challenges from more conservative candidates, but a popular governor is not a great target, and Republican voters have largely overlooked any left-leaning proclivities their governors exhibit.\u201cI was a little disappointed when he pulled troops from the border,\u201d said Krista Hudson, 50, an admirer of Mr. Trump who lives in this rural stronghold of Mr. Hogan\u2019s. \u201cBut I still support him. This is a Democratic state, and we have always felt ignored and neglected, and we just see him a lot down here.\u201d\u201cBruce Rauner thought he could be Scott Walker when he got elected,\u201d Thomas Bowen, a Democratic strategist and former political director for Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, said, referring to the Republican governor of Wisconsin. \u201cHe forgot that Walker had a supermajority in the state legislature and he did not.\u201d\u201cThere was a playbook for how to be a Republican in Illinois that\u2019s been replayed over and over,\u201d Mr. Bowen said. \u201cBe fiscally astute, compromise and don\u2019t pick fights unnecessarily.\u201dBut under Mr. Hogan, the state has gained tens of thousands of jobs, and businesses and residents welcomed the tax relief he pushed. \u201cPeople do not want to go back in this state to rampant tax increases,\u201d said Anirban Basu, chief executive of the Sage Policy Group, an economics consulting firm in Baltimore. \u201cMany Marylanders are keenly aware that tax-based growth is suppressed by the state\u2019s high tax rates.\u201dSimply keeping their seats, however, does not guarantee a successful agenda for Republican governors. A Democratic surge this year could put more of them in the state legislatures, bringing with them more resistance to the governor\u2019s policies.\u201cIt is quite possible that Scott will get re-elected but Democrats will gain enough seats in the legislature that they get veto-proof majority,\u201d said Eric L. Davis, professor emeritus of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont, noting that Mr. Scott had made heavy use of his veto pen in his time as governor.Mr. Hogan shrugged it off. \u201cI am mostly in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot more to get done.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I've never met a Trump supporter who did not know exactly who he is.Opinion ColumnistThat\u2019s the bit of the United States the rest of the world finds hardest to fathom. Why the scorn for handouts, the equating of universal health care with socialism, the obsession with self-reliance, the refusal to see that a profusion of guns leads to a profusion of mass shootings? Of course a crowded Europe with its wounds seeks solidarity in the name of stability, while America with its wide-open spaces embraces the right to be left alone (at least until you need Medicaid) and the right, whatever its risks, to the next frontier.I said it\u2019s different in the West. It\u2019s not so different in the West, it\u2019s just that you see more clearly what the country stood for in its own mythologized self-image, what it was to be an American, what it was to aspire to some new and exemplary measure of freedom, and how far things have fallen to produce President Donald Trump.No part of the country today is immune to American fracture or the squalid Trump wars, to cultural confrontations over identity and gender and race, to the effects of stagnant incomes over decades, or to the narcissism of modernity.In a purple state, unlike in Brooklyn, N.Y., or Palo Alto, Calif., these differences press in on each other. Conversations occur that break through ideological lines. Grand Junction, in western Colorado, voted for Trump at the last election. There, I spoke to Robert Babcox, a pastor, who praised the president for sticking to his campaign promises and, \u201cfor all the bravado,\u201d getting the economy revved up.Words don\u2019t kill, I said. Some things are worse than death, he said. So, I asked, Trump\u2019s great? No, the pastor said. He only trusted Trump \u201cto a degree.\u201d Someone should take away his cellphone, he said. Americans can come together, he said, praising John F. Kennedy. \u201cI served in the Navy,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw so many taken before their time \u2014 white, black, Hispanic. It all hurt me just the same, and they all bled red, and that lesson stayed with me.\u201dIt\u2019s also why the itch to believe that the moment has come when everything starts to unravel must be viewed warily. Sure, Trump sounds more desperate. But who\u2019s the enforcer if Trump has broken the law? It\u2019s Congress \u2014 and until things change there (which could happen in November) or Republicans at last abandon a policy of hold-my-nose opportunism, Trump will ride out the storm.Trump was a symptom, not a cause. The problem is way deeper than him.For William Steding, a diplomatic historian living in Colorado, American individualism has morphed into narcissism, perfectibility into entitlement, and exceptionalism into hubris. Out of that, and more, came the insidious malignancy of Trump. It will not be extirpated overnight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady but, Defying Trump, Signals Increases to Come", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve raised its already high marks for the state of the economy on Wednesday, refusing to bow to President Trump\u2019s recent push for the central bank to pause its march toward higher interest rates.Federal Open Market Committee officials voted unanimously at the end of their two-day meeting to keep interest rates unchanged, at a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. But the statement they issued keeps the Fed on track to raise rates next month and again in December, after two rate increases in the first half of the year. Its revised assessments of economic growth and the inflation rate could signal that those coming increases are even more likely than investors previously thought.The statement declared that the job market continues to strengthen and that \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a strong rate.\u201d That is a change from the June statement, when the Fed said economic growth was \u201csolid.\u201d Officials also improved their assessment of consumer spending, saying that it has \u201cgrown strongly.\u201dIn their statement on Wednesday, Fed officials said the overall inflation rate and the rate that excludes volatile food and energy prices both \u201cremain near 2 percent,\u201d which is the Fed\u2019s target level. In June, officials said those rates \u201chave moved close to 2 percent.\u201dIn keeping with previous statements, officials continued to signal they will raise rates again soon, saying they expect \u201cthat further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201dHere are four takeaways from Wednesday\u2019s Fed statement:Mr. Powell has consistently played down the notion that the economy is close to \u201coverheating\u201d \u2014 growing so fast, with unemployment so low, that it sets off a rapid escalation in wages and consumer prices. The economy\u2019s 4.1 percent growth rate in the second quarter certainly is rapid, but its current pace for the year, about 3 percent, is only slightly above the Fed\u2019s most recent forecasts. The statement acknowledged that acceleration but expressed no concern over it.\u201cRisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced,\u201d officials wrote, meaning that the likelihood is about the same that things could get better or worse in the economy. It\u2019s standard language of late for the Fed, and in keeping with analysts\u2019 expectations.\u201cWe expect only minor changes to the policy statement to reflect the latest developments in the economy,\u201d economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday.\u201cThe escalating trade rhetoric hampers forecasters\u2019 near-term view of the economy, which is a particular problem for the Fed currently as it attempts to engineer a soft landing from the current expansion,\u201d Deutsche Bank researchers wrote this week.A question before the meeting was whether the trade war had escalated enough to merit a warning in the statement.Answer: It has not.Nothing in the statement suggested that officials are worried about growth or prepared to slow their pace of rate increases, a development that defies some recent Fed attempts to leave its options open on next policy moves.Even when the Fed is not raising or cutting rates, it still sends signals to the market about where monetary policy is headed, through subtle, but crucial, changes in language. Some of those recent changes have sent a purposefully muddy signal, apparently meant to demonstrate flexibility to respond to events in the economy.For example, in his testimony last month, Mr. Powell, the leader of the Federal Open Market Committee, said that \u201cwith a strong job market, inflation close to our objective and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the F.O.M.C. believes that \u2014 for now \u2014 the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate.\u201dAnalysts saw that phrase and honed in on \u201cfor now.\u201d\u201cThe inclusion of those words diluted the signal for continued gradual tightening, but not necessarily in a dovish or a hawkish way,\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote this week. \u201cRather, as we have been discussing, their inclusion continued the recent trend toward reduced forward guidance: The pace of tightening could be stepped up or slowed down, depending on the data.\u201dThat still seems possible, particularly from Mr. Powell\u2019s recent testimony, but the statement only points one way for now.The president, who had accused the Fed of keeping interest rates artificially low to help President Barack Obama, now appears ready to blame the central bank for trying to slow down a booming economy.Mr. Powell has insisted the Fed is an independent body that moves in response to economic data, not political pressure. The statement seems to back that up. We\u2019ll have to wait for direct questioning at the next meeting, but for now, the Fed is telling Mr. Trump, in its very Fed way, to mind his own business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big, Dangerous Bubble in Corporate Debt", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.The $30 trillion domestic stock market seems to get all the attention. When the stock market sets new highs, we instinctively feel things are good and getting better. When it tanks, as happened in the initial months of the 2008 financial crisis, we think things are going to hell.Unlike buying a stock, which is a calculated gamble, buying a bond or a loan is a contractual obligation: A borrower must repay a lender the borrowed amount, plus interest as compensation. The upside in a bond is limited to the contractual interest payments, but the downside is theoretically protected. Bondholders expect to get their money back, as long as the borrower doesn\u2019t default or go bankrupt.But for much of the last decade, risk has been mispriced to a staggering degree. In other words, the prices of bonds (and corporate loans) have not accurately reflected the riskiness of the underlying borrower\u2019s credit. A company that is a poor credit risk, because it has too much debt or is struggling, should have to pay higher rates of interest. And investors would expect a higher yield \u2014 roughly the interest rate divided by the price paid for the bond or loan \u2014 for taking on that risk. Since the financial crisis, that simple calculus has been upended. Until recently, investors have been paying higher prices for the debt of riskier companies and not getting properly compensated for that risk.For now, the bond market, like the stock market, looks robust. It has been a long bull run for both stocks and bonds, and borrower defaults have been at historically low levels for years. As has the \u201cspread\u201d\u2014 the difference between the yields \u2014 of Treasury-backed securities and riskier bonds. But as interest rates continue to rise, and some companies and other borrowers fail to meet their debt obligations, defaults will inevitably increase along with the spreads.When they do, trillions of dollars in invested capital could be lost. If that happens, as it did after September 2008, access to credit for most borrowers could dry up, setting off yet another potentially devastating economic crisis. To be sure, the growing concern about the mispricing of risk doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re on the verge of a recession. But the corporate debt bubble inevitably will play a role in causing it.Here\u2019s the crux of the problem: After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Board under Ben Bernanke decided to lower short-term and long-term interest rates. Fed officials hoped that by flooding the zone with inexpensive credit, borrowers would have access to money to build new factories, buy new equipment, hire more employees and pay them higher wages. Mr. Bernanke\u2019s idea was that the Fed could engineer an economic recovery by making sure that most businesses that wanted capital could get it at an attractive price. It largely worked. His strategy was so successful that it was envied and then copied by central banks around the world.To lower interest rates, the Fed employed two tactics. One was to cut the so-called Fed Funds rate \u2014 what the Fed charges the nation\u2019s biggest banks to borrow money on a short-term basis \u2014 to nearly zero, and keep it there for seven years. Lowering long-term rates required more creativity. Mr. Bernanke had a clever plan, what he called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d: The Fed would buy trillions of dollars of toxic securities that had marred the balance sheets of the Wall Street banks.By creating artificial demand for these securities, where there had been virtually none, the Fed helped big banks cleanse their balance sheets, reassuring investors and creditors. But like anything else, bond prices are subject to the vagaries of supply and demand; the Fed\u2019s gorging drove up not only the price of these particular bonds but also bond prices generally, lowering their yields. (When bond prices increase, yields decrease.)The plan worked, perhaps too well. Both short- and long-term interest rates were reduced to levels rarely seen in our lifetimes. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet expanded to about $4.5 trillion, from less than $900 billion before the crisis, thanks to the purchase of squirrelly assets from Wall Street. The world was awash with cheap capital. (Of course, that didn\u2019t mean it was any easier for home buyers to get a mortgage or for small businesses to get loans.)An unintended consequence of keeping interest rates artificially low for so long is the mispricing of risk. The Fed\u2019s artificial demand has kept bond prices higher than they otherwise would have been, and their yields lower. But investors have an insatiable demand for higher yields, a collective hunger that Wall Street has been only too happy to feed.Examples of mispriced risk are strewn across the financial landscape. In June, Asurion, an insurer of cellphones, closed on a $3.75 billion loan package from Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks, with minimal covenants \u2014 agreements to protect creditors by notifying them when certain red flags, like a higher than agreed-upon debt-to-cash flow ratio, are waving.The proceeds of Asurion\u2019s \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d or \u201ccov-lite\u201d loan were used to pay dividends to the three private-equity firms that own the company. Its debt load has increased to $11.3 billion, seven times its cash flow. For additional irresistible fees, Wall Street then repackaged the Asurion loans into securities and sold them to investors, who now own the debt of a highly leveraged company with far fewer protections.When junk bond yields return to more normal levels, as interest rates rise and investors\u2019 yield-fever breaks, the price of the bonds bought during the feeding frenzy will fall and billions of dollars stand to be lost \u2014 by endowments, pension funds and high-yield funds, among others \u2014 as bonds across the board are repriced by the market.When that happens, the entire credit market could start to contract, as it did after the 2008 crisis. When the pendulum swings away from fast-and-loose credit standards for corporations, lenders become more cautious. That means ordinary people will pay much higher rates for mortgages, car loans and small-business loans \u2014 if they can get them at all.It may not be too late for a course correction. Banks could tighten their underwriting standards \u2014 ratchet down the leverage, demand more covenants, nix loans that are used to pay big dividends \u2014 and investors could be more discerning about the prices they are willing to pay for high-yielding bonds. Regulators could be more vigilant about allowing such loans and bonds to be issued in the first place. Wall Street could also redesign its compensation system to reward bankers to be more cautious with their underwriting and to take fewer risks with other people\u2019s money.In the meantime, we must inure ourselves to the inevitable. It may take yet another major financial crisis for things to change, or maybe things will never change. Either way, it\u2019s a lesson we never seem to learn until it\u2019s too late.William D. Cohan is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and the author of, most recently, \u201cWhy Wall Street Matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Dream Ended on a Mountain Road: The Cyclists and the ISIS Militants", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsked why they had quit their office jobs and set off on a biking journey around the world, the young American couple offered a simple explanation: They had grown tired of the meetings and teleconferences, of the time sheets and password changes.\u201cThere\u2019s magic out there, in this great big beautiful world,\u201d wrote Jay Austin who, along with his partner, Lauren Geoghegan, gave his two weeks\u2019 notice last year before shipping his bicycle to Africa.They were often proved right.There were hardships, too, including punctured tires, snarling dogs, freezing hail and illness. But for Mr. Austin and Ms. Geoghegan, both 29, these were far outweighed by moments of human connection.Two days later, the Islamic State released a video showing five men it identified as the attackers, sitting before the ISIS flag. They face the camera and make a vow: to kill \u201cdisbelievers.\u201dAfter earning a master\u2019s degree from Georgetown University, he began working at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Convinced that many of the belongings people accrue are unnecessary, he began adopting a minimalist lifestyle, said his childhood friend Ashley Ozery.If one of his goals was to pare down his life to the bare essentials, another was to enlarge his world. Because he had no mortgage weighing him down, his miniature house meant that he could take unpaid leave from his government job and travel the globe.\u201cAt HUD at the end of each year, you could ask for a higher salary or more vacation,\u201d said Ms. Ozery. \u201cHe always chose more vacation.\u201dFirst, he took a scooter trip around the United States. That was followed by a rail voyage in Europe. Next came a stint in Namibia. Then it was a weekslong trip across India, said Ms. Ozery, who became friends with Mr. Austin in 1999 at their elementary school in Manalapan, N.J.In 2012, he met Lauren Anne Geoghegan, a native of Southern California, who like him had graduated from Georgetown and was now working in the college\u2019s admissions office.\u201cOutside-the-box.\u201d \u201cChallenges me to grow.\u201d \u201cAdventurous.\u201d That was how Ms. Geoghegan described Mr. Austin to her closest friends, said Kristen Bautz Robinson, who had known her since their first year at Georgetown.Although Ms. Geoghegan, too, was a seasoned traveler \u2014 she had spent a summer in Beirut learning Arabic and a semester in Madrid becoming fluent in Spanish \u2014 the rugged, do-it-yourself journeys that had become Mr. Austin\u2019s hallmark were new to her.Mr. Austin was a vegan. Ms. Geoghegan became a vegetarian, said her close friend Amanda Kerrigan.It was in 2016 that Ms. Geoghegan told Ms. Kerrigan that she was planning to quit her job and bike around the world. Ms. Kerrigan could not suppress a little concern. \u201cI said, \u2018This is not the Lauren I know,\u2019 \u201d she said, adding: \u201cJay changed the trajectory of Lauren\u2019s life.\u201dIf the plan seemed far-fetched, the couple was methodical in their planning. They did a monthlong test-run in Iceland, cycling across its valleys.Online, they found a deck of cards measuring just 1 inch by 1 inch. \u201cA regular deck of cards is not that big \u2014 that shows you the degree to which they planned,\u201d said Holly Geoghegan, the young woman\u2019s aunt, who was visiting them when the tiny deck arrived in the mail.They spent months saving, but then it was time for big decisions: The trip was not one that could be covered by an extended leave.\u201cI\u2019ve grown tired of spending the best hours of my day in front of a glowing rectangle, of coloring the best years of my life in swaths of grey and beige,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve missed too many sunsets while my back was turned. Too many thunderstorms went unwatched, too many gentle breezes unnoticed.\u201dThe day Ms. Geoghegan and Ms. Kerrigan said goodbye, the two friends hugged outside Ms. Geoghegan\u2019s apartment.\u201cThe minute your instinct tells you something is wrong \u2014 leave,\u201d Ms. Kerrigan told her. She was concerned for her friend, in part because of how bighearted she was and in part because she feared that Mr. Austin had a higher tolerance for danger than Ms. Geoghegan did.The couple began their voyage at the southernmost tip of Africa with a miscalculation that left them stranded.It was July 23, 2017 \u2014 winter in South Africa, when the sun sets at 5:30 \u2014 and they hadn\u2019t realized how far they would need to travel on congested freeways before they could get out of Cape Town. At dusk, they found themselves with a punctured tire on the chaotic R27. There was nowhere to pitch their tent except for a ditch adjacent to the busy freeway.In a post about why he chose to cycle \u2014 as opposed to, say, drive around the world \u2014 Mr. Austin spoke about the vulnerability of being on a bike. \u201cWith that vulnerability comes immense generosity: good folks who will recognize your helplessness and recognize that you need assistance in one form or another and offer it in spades,\u201d he wrote.Their journey was a series of tedious, and occasionally grueling, physical tests, punctuated by human kindness.They continued north, crossing deserts where the sand was so deep they had to dismount and push their bikes. In Botswana, a concerned man stopped his car to offer them ice water as they pedaled in 95-degree heat.They cycled on dirt paths, through dry riverbeds and on cracked asphalt, going days without a shower. In Morocco, a family offered the couple a room, and then sent them off the next morning with homemade bread.Days turned to weeks, and then into months. Their bodies began to break. An ear infection landed Ms. Geoghegan in the emergency room in France. They both contracted pinkeye. They shouldered on through upset stomachs and sore throats.It was winter by the time they reached Europe last December. Torrential rain soaked through their waterproof gloves. \u201cUtterly hopeless, wet and cold,\u201d they posted from Spain.But in the course of their travels, their blog posts also noted flashes of cruelty.On one mountain pass, a group of men blocked their path and tried to shove the couple off their bikes.And just 50 yards from the Spanish border in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Mr. Austin signaled to a driver that he wanted to cut into his lane. The driver let him enter and then \u2014 slowly and deliberately \u2014 began to run him over, trapping Mr. Austin\u2019s bike between the advancing car and the vehicle ahead of them.Still, by the time they reached that bend in the road in Tajikistan just over a week ago, they had embraced the notion that the world was overwhelmingly good, the dozens of annotated photographs and the thousands of words they left behind show.\u201cYou read the papers and you\u2019re led to believe that the world is a big, scary place,\u201d Mr. Austin wrote. \u201cPeople, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted. People are bad. People are evil.\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Evil is a make-believe concept we\u2019ve invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own \u2026 By and large, humans are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful and kind.\u201d\u201cNo greater revelation has come from our journey than this,\u201d he wrote.In the video released by the Islamic State after the couple\u2019s death, the men pledging allegiance to the group can be seen sitting on a stone slab, an aquamarine lake partly visible over their left shoulders. It\u2019s the kind of panorama that the young couple might have stopped to capture and post on their blog.But in the clip, when these men point to the scenery around them, they vow to slaughter the \u201cdisbelievers\u201d who have overrun their land.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Erdogan Faces a Challenge He Can\u2019t Easily Bully: Turkey\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long made clear that he considered no part of Turkish life beyond his reach, not least the economy.Now Turkey\u2019s worst economic crisis since 2001 \u2014 the currency hit another new low on Monday \u2014 has confronted Mr. Erdogan with the limits of his authoritarian approach and could end his long run of success.Turkey\u2019s economic troubles, analysts say, are largely of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s own making. They have less to do with his dispute with the United States and the prospect of greater sanctions than with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s deepening economic interference as he attempts to bend the logic of monetary policy and global financial markets to suit his political purposes.Yet while Mr. Erdogan asserts greater control over life in Turkey \u2014 including the media, the judiciary, foreign policy and political decision-making \u2014 it is far less clear that he can bully an economy increasingly beholden to global markets to submit to his will, they say.Business leaders warn that the many strands of the president\u2019s authoritarian approach are intertwined, and that Turkey will not climb out of its hole until the country enacts major structural reforms that would undo many of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s constraints.Those would include allowing a free press, an independent judiciary and returning powers to Parliament. Another step, the release of political prisoners, would help repair relations with Europe.\u201cWe have to do something at home,\u201d said Umit Pamir, a former ambassador to NATO. \u201cOnly then can investors come.\u201dWhile Mr. Erdogan could still change course, whether he will is far from certain. In the meantime, the levers available to him will not avert the economic pain that is now inevitable, they say.\u201cThe interest-rate hikes and budget cuts will be painful,\u201d said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, a management consultancy. \u201cThere will be bankruptcies.\u201dMany analysts say that, as he has accumulated power, Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly isolated, surrounding himself with advisers who reinforce his own views, while sidelining real expertise.In particular, Mr. Erdogan has insisted on following a policy of keeping interest rates low to allow a huge program of fiscal stimulus based around the construction industry to generate high growth.In May, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Mr. Erdogan explained why he wanted more control over the central bank and interest-rate policy.\u201cWhen the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince they\u2019ll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who is influential on monetary policies,\u201d he added.\u201cIt is the fundamental view of the true populist,\u201d explained Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, also known as E.D.A.M. \u201cThe fact of his being elected gives him the right to be responsible for all executive authority.\u201dYet most economists argue that the policy is no longer tenable and that the economy is already in recession amid mounting foreign debts and a current account deficit. Keeping interest rates low is driving up inflation, which is hurting people\u2019s pocketbooks.For months credit-rating agencies and investment specialists have been signaling that the political management of Turkey\u2019s economy is scaring away investment.Turkey has weathered financial storms before thanks to its size and diversity, but the outcome will depend on the \u201ccoherence and predictability of the policies that are pursued,\u201d the credit-rating agency Moody\u2019s advised in a statement in June.In July, after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election, and after he appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak to the newly combined position of treasury and finance minister, Moody\u2019s announced another downgrading of Turkey\u2019s credit rating.\u201cAny perception of encroachment into the independence of the central bank and other public institutions will likely exacerbate investor concerns,\u201d it wrote in a statement.The changes center power increasingly in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s hands, allowing him to appoint senior officials in almost every area of life. Far beyond the central bank, analysts warn, the changes represent a creeping politicization of the state.Among the changes is the elimination of senior Civil Service positions in the powerful Turkish bureaucracy.Turkey has always had a strong bureaucracy, modeled on the French system, with a senior bureaucrat, called an undersecretary, in every ministry, assisted by deputy undersecretaries. Those positions have been eliminated and the civil servant positions replaced with deputy ministers appointed by Mr. Erdogan.The change is being felt across the administration, Mr. Ulgen said. \u201cThere is no top bureaucrat who sees 360 degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all silos.\u201dAny positive gain from bringing outsiders into the administration has been tempered by the polarizing nature of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule, which has increasingly pushed out people who are seen as ideologically or politically opposed to his Justice and Development Party, and favored party loyalists.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a convergence of the party and the state, more so than in the past, and the top bureaucrat representing the state will not be there,\u201d Mr. Ulgen added. \u201cThe lower levels of the bureaucracy will be open to politicization as career advancement will be increasingly linked to political affiliation.\u201dYet relying on the party for appointees excludes a vast pool of talent, something that has also been evident with the purges of 150,000 public employees since the failed coup of 2016.The appointment of Mr. Albayrak to the post of treasury and finance minister has been taken as a signal not only of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s determination to control monetary and fiscal policy, but also of his intention to prepare a dynasty.Mr. Albayrak, 40, holds an M.B.A. from Pace University in New York, and worked as the United States representative for Calik Holdings, a Turkish construction and trading company known for its close links to the government.In 2004 he married Esra, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s eldest daughter, who studied at the University of California at Berkeley, and two years later they returned to Turkey.Mr. Albayrak entered politics in 2015, becoming a member of Parliament, and later that year was appointed energy minister. He was appointed treasury and finance minister to the new cabinet after the June 24 elections.Even as the business world regretted the departure of more experienced officials from the government, some hoped that Mr. Albayrak, being a relative, might be able to persuade Mr. Erdogan to moderate his insistence on keeping interest rates low.But so far Mr. Albayrak has not done enough to stem the damage, Mr. Yesilada said.At a news briefing Friday, Mr. Albayrak gave assurances of the independence of the Central Bank, yet that the fact that the bank failed to act to shore up the lira showed it was either not independent, or amiss at its job, he said.\u201cNo Central Bank would stand by while its currency is depreciating,\u201d he said.Mr. Albayrak was undergoing a \u201cfast on-the-job training,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the business community and banks tell him what dire straits we are navigating, he may make the right decision.\u201dAs for the immediate crisis, Mr. Yesilada called for a hefty interest rate hike of at least 5 percentage points and said that a \u201chandshake with the United States is an absolute minimum.\u201dAnkara kept asking for other options to the crisis, he said, but he predicted that Mr. Erdogan would have no option in the end.\u201cHe will wake up and smell the coffee,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Hit With Cap as New York City Takes Lead in Crackdown", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislation passed overwhelmingly by the City Council will cap the number of for-hire vehicles for a year while the city studies the booming industry. The bills also allow New York to set a minimum pay rate for drivers.Uber has become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest success stories and changed the way people across the globe get around. But it has faced increased scrutiny from government regulators and struggled to overcome its image as a company determined to grow at all costs with little regard for its impact on cities.The proposal to cap ride-hail companies led to a clash among interest groups with taxi industry officials saying the companies were dooming their business and Uber mounting a major advertising campaign to make the case that yellow cabs have a history of discriminating against people of color.Mayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said the bills will curtail the worsening traffic on the streets and improve low driver wages.\u201cWe are pausing the issuance of new licenses in an industry that has been allowed to proliferate without any appropriate check or regulation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said before the vote, adding that the rules would not diminish existing service for New Yorkers who rely on ride-hail apps.Mr. de Blasio praised the bills and said he planned to sign them into law. The cap on new for-hire vehicles would take effect immediately.\u201cMore than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, referring to the city\u2019s army of for-hire drivers. \u201cAnd this action will stop the influx of cars contributing to the congestion grinding our streets to a halt.\u201dBut Uber has warned its riders that the cap could produce higher prices and longer wait times for passengers if the company cannot keep up with the growing demand. Ride-hail apps have become a crucial backup option for New Yorkers swept up in the constant delays on the city\u2019s sputtering subway, as happened on Wednesday when signal problems again snarled train lines across a large swath of the city. Ride-hail services have also grown in neighborhoods outside Manhattan where the subway does not reach.New York is the latest city to grapple with questions over how to regulate the company. In London, Uber\u2019s most lucrative European market, Uber recently regained its taxi license after the company agreed to stricter regulations, including providing the city with the trove of traffic data that the firm collects and has often been reluctant to share. Uber has also faced regulatory battles in American cities, like Austin, Tex., and in countries like Canada, Brazil and Italy.Uber criticized the Council\u2019s decision to approve the cap, but said the company would work to keep up with the increasing appeal of its service despite the limit on new vehicles.\u201cThe City\u2019s 12-month pause on new vehicle licenses will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion,\u201d Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a software company that examines technology trends, said the cap could impact Uber\u2019s public offering if it reduces revenues and emboldens other cities to take similar action.\u201cIf it changes their growth trajectory, that could have an impact on their valuation and the narrative around the company,\u201d Mr. Sanwal said.Uber said the company would immediately reach out to tens of thousands of for-hire vehicle owners who are already licensed but work for other local car services and try to recruit them to work for Uber. The company said it would also continue to press for another solution, known as congestion pricing \u2014 a proposal to toll drivers entering Manhattan\u2019s busiest neighborhoods and that would require approval from state lawmakers.Many experts believe congestion pricing is the best way for New York City to fix congestion and secure the funds needed to fix the subway. Mr. Johnson supports the idea, but Mr. de Blasio has opposed it. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the subway, has said he will push for congestion pricing during the next state legislative session to help pay for an ambitious, multibillion dollar overhaul plan for the subway.The City Council approved the cap in a 39-to-6 vote. Councilman Eric Ulrich, a Republican from Queens, said he opposed the cap, arguing that limiting Uber to help yellow taxis was similar to regulating Netflix, the streaming service, to help Blockbuster, the video rental chain.The legislation allows for the city\u2019s taxi commission to add more licenses if there is a clear need for more vehicles in some neighborhoods. In New York, many Uber drivers work full time and the city regulates Uber vehicles as part of the for-hire vehicle industry, which is different than other cities.Lyft, the second most popular app in New York, also criticized the vote: \u201cThese sweeping cuts to transportation will bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of color and in the outer boroughs,\u201d Joseph Okpaku, a vice president at Lyft, said in a statement.The vote was a moment of vindication for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, who lost a bruising battle with Uber over a proposal for a cap in 2015. Since then, the number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 63,000 in 2015, according to the city.Elizabeth Cassarino, a yellow taxi driver, said she supports the cap and hopes it will improve business for taxis. As she drove a taxi through the clogged streets of Manhattan on Wednesday, she said her credit cards were maxed out and she had trouble making enough money to pay for food.\u201cFinally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re starving to death.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Asian-Americans Need More Movies, Even Mediocre Ones", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byViet Thanh Nguyen is a contributing opinion writer.If you are Asian-American, you have most likely heard of a movie called \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d based on the popular novel of the same title by Kevin Kwan. If you are not Asian-American, maybe you are wondering why a romantic comedy is causing so much excitement. If you are saying to yourself that it\u2019s just a movie, you probably take for granted that there are many movies that feature people like you. For Asian-Americans, however, one movie can be of enormous consequence.One of the movie\u2019s stars, Constance Wu, explained that the importance of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d with its all-Asian-American cast, comes from a desire for \u201cnarrative plenitude.\u201dI came up with that idea in my book \u201cNothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War.\u201d Narrative plenitude is what makes it possible for Hollywood to make so many Vietnam War movies. Not just \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d but also \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d and \u201cRambo.\u201d They are all set in Vietnam, and some of them are excellent works of art, but they are all dramas of white American masculinity. The Vietnamese are extras in these movies, who exist only to mutter, grunt, groan, curse and jabber incomprehensibly until they are rescued, raped or killed.But these are American movies, you might say. Of course they should be about Americans. That does not explain why blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, women or yes, Asian-Americans, all of whom served in the American military, barely appear in these movies.It matters because I, and most other Asian-Americans, grew up and still live in the opposite of \u201cnarrative plenitude.\u201d We live in an economy of narrative scarcity, in which we feel deprived and must fight to tell our own stories and fight against the stories that distort or erase us. Many Americans will take these Asian images \u2014 which are usually awful \u2014 and transfer them to any Asian-American they encounter.The most notorious examples are characters like the Japanese landlord in 1961\u2019s \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d played by a bucktoothed, slant-eyed Mickey Rooney, or the heavily accented foreign student Long Duk Dong of 1984\u2019s \u201cSixteen Candles,\u201d who was at least played by an Asian-American, Gedde Watanabe. Many Asian-Americans winced at these portrayals, knowing that they might be subjected to the slant-eyed, bucktoothed, ching-chong mockery of their classmates or random people, including adults.This is narrative scarcity \u2014 the lack of characters who looked like us, and when they looked like us, were not really human.One solution was to change how stories were told. I remember my shock and joy at reading \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d Amy Tan\u2019s best-selling novel, when I was 18. I never even knew there were Asian-American writers (there were actually many before her). Then Wayne Wang made a movie from the book, and for a moment Asian-Americans experienced what it was like to have narrative plenitude \u2014 both a book and a movie full of complex, human Asian-American characters and stories.Still, \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d was not the breakthrough that we hoped for. Mainstream movies with Asian-American leads eluded us. Meanwhile Hollywood continues to remake Asian movies with white actors, have characters with Asian names played by white actors and make movies set in Asia with white lead actors.The lesson is that telling our own stories is not enough if we do not own some of the economy as well. We had no influence in Hollywood in the 20th century, just as we had little to no influence in publishing, in politics, in the highest levels of corporations.This is why a single breakthrough work cannot, by itself, create an economy of narrative plenitude. If \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d succeeds in transforming how Hollywood perceives and represents Asians and Asian-Americans, it will be due not only to this one movie being good, or at least profitable, but also to the long, slow work done for decades in Hollywood by hundreds of Asian-American actors, writers, directors, producers, agents and more.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d should just be a feel-good entertainment about obscenely wealthy people of Chinese descent from Singapore that happens to star Asian-Americans. But we do not have enough movies about poor Asians, or sane Asians, or Singaporeans who are not Chinese, or revolutionary Asians who want to overthrow a system of global capitalism that enables the lifestyle of obscenely wealthy and oblivious Asians who would be just as problematic if they were white. So \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d becomes more than what it would have to be if it were just about crazy rich white people.For Asian-Americans, if \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d succeeds, we all do; if it fails, we all do. This is what it means to live in an economy of narrative scarcity.If and when we achieve an economy of narrative plenitude, a bad movie about Asian-Americans will just be a bad movie. An excellent movie would be great, but a mediocre one will be no big deal. A mediocre movie about Asian-Americans will not kill careers or be seen as a failure of and for Asian-Americans, just as a mediocre movie by and about white people says nothing about white people.The real test of narrative plenitude is when we have the luxury of making mediocre movies.

{"Headline": "Kim Jong-un Focuses on Economy as Nuclear Talks With U.S. Stall", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 When North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, visited a hydroelectric dam under construction last month, he reportedly \u201cflew into a rage\u201d after learning why the dam was still unfinished after 17 years of work.The dam, central to Mr. Kim\u2019s efforts to alleviate his country\u2019s chronic power shortages, suffered from a lack of workers, equipment and materials, Mr. Kim is said to have found, and he learned that officials overseeing the project hadn\u2019t even visited the construction site.\u201cWhat makes me angrier is that these officials will never fail to miss the opportunity to show their shameless faces and take credit when a ceremony is held to mark the completion of a power plant,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted by the North\u2019s Korean Central News Agency as saying. \u201cI am speechless.\u201dThe reports in the North Korean state news media about Mr. Kim\u2019s anger were a jarring contrast to their typical portrayals of such visits, which show Mr. Kim being mobbed by his adoring subjects.\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that Kim Jong-un is desperate to ease sanctions and find his own ways of boosting production and improving the lives of his people,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cAt the same time, he is shifting the blame to his underlings by criticizing lazy officials.\u201dBy showing himself focused on the economy, rather than on weapons programs, Mr. Kim may be signaling that he is willing to negotiate away his nuclear weapons if Washington offers the right incentives, Professor Koh said. But deep skepticism persists that Mr. Kim will ever give them up or that the United States will provide the kind of rewards, like a peace treaty ending the Korean War, that the North demands.When Mr. Kim met President Trump in Singapore in June, the two agreed to build \u201cnew\u201d relations and work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d But their agreement lacked details, and frustrations have since mounted on both sides over the lack of progress in carrying out the summit deal, dimming North Korea\u2019s hopes for sanctions relief and Washington\u2019s desire for rapid denuclearization of the North.In pushing economic development, Mr. Kim has a lot at stake as he seeks to cement his power over a country that suffered a devastating famine in the 1990s and has only recently seen the emergence of a nascent, aspirational middle class.The next year, he supplanted his father and predecessor Kim Jong-il\u2019s \u201cmilitary-first\u201d policy with his byungjin, or parallel advance, approach of building a nuclear arsenal and the country\u2019s economy simultaneously.But the sanctions over his weapons programs have derailed recent economic progress. While North Korea\u2019s economy grew an average 1.77 percent annually between 2012 and 2015, thanks largely to market activities, according to Kim Byung-yeon, a professor of economics at Seoul National University, in 2017 it contracted at its sharpest rate in two decades \u2014 shrinking 3.5 percent, according to the South Korean Central Bank.\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the pieces of the puzzle won\u2019t come into place until we see improvements in relations between the United States and North Korea and the easing and lifting of sanctions,\u201d said Hwang Jae-jun, a North Korea specialist at the Sejong Institute, a research think tank in South Korea.In contrast, almost all of the 30 field guidance trips Mr. Kim has made since late June were to factories, farms and construction sites. On July 17, the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea\u2019s main newspaper, published 12 pages, double its normal size, devoting the first nine pages to pictures and articles about Mr. Kim\u2019s visits to factories and farms.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bank of England Raises Interest Rates Amid Brexit Worries", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Bank of England raised interest rates on Thursday to their highest levels in nearly a decade as it seeks to tamp down inflation and make preparations for a potential economic downturn as Britain exits the European Union.But while the bank officially made the move in an effort to tackle inflation, it also clearly had another goal in mind: to give it wiggle room to cut rates in the future, particularly if Brexit, as the withdrawal from the European Union is called, deals a blow to the British economy.Economists have warned that leaving the 28-nation bloc will hurt growth by restricting Britain\u2019s access to its main trading partner. Those concerns have been amplified by a seeming lack of progress between London and Brussels on the post-Brexit trading relationship.As a result, the central bank has sought to add levers that can be used if some measure of stimulus is needed for the British economy.\u201cIt\u2019s cleaner for them to go now,\u201d said David Owen, chief European economist at the investment bank Jefferies, referring to the rate rise. Mr. Owen said that as Britain neared its withdrawal, due in March, the Bank of England would have less time to raise rates, and that the political risks surrounding Brexit would be increased.Like other central banks, the Bank of England has sought to dial back monetary stimulus put in place after the financial crisis.But its efforts have been complicated by Brexit. Soon after the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest rate in its history, and increased its bond-buying program.\u201cToday\u2019s rise in interest rates makes sense both from a short-term perspective and in terms of a sustainable long-term monetary strategy,\u201d said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at the professional services firm PwC.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Turkey\u2019s Crisis Feels Familiar for Emerging Markets: It\u2019s the Debt", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, the borrowing binge that fueled rapid growth in emerging markets and piled up returns for their investors is looking like a problem.Financial experts worry that the turmoil in Turkey, which for the better part of a year has been contained, will spread, following the path of other emerging market meltdowns like those in Mexico in 1994 and Asia in 1997.\u201cThe risk of contagion is pretty high,\u201d said Robert Subbaraman, an emerging market economist at Nomura in Singapore.\u201cTurkey is a symptom of the growing challenges for emerging markets,\u201d said Mr. Subbaraman. \u201cDue to super-low interest rates, investors have been on the hunt for yield \u2014 until this year. Now they will be blindsided by the risks.\u201dIn a research note that Mr. Subbaraman published on Monday, he pointed to South Africa, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Chile and Mexico as having the most vulnerable economies. South Africa, for example, has significant levels of dollar debt and a sizable current account deficit.A country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money \u2014 in investments and trade \u2014 from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially, and those investors could find other markets more enticing \u2014 particularly when emerging markets see their currencies lose value. That is precisely what forced Argentina to go to the I.M.F., the first major emerging market to take such a step during this period of uncertainty. Pakistan may soon have to forge its own deal with the fund for similar reasons.Mr. Subbaraman said the buildup in cheap dollar credit could ultimately threaten South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and even China, whose currency, the renminbi, weakened further against the dollar this week. But analysts have long believed that these economies are strong enough to withstand a traditional contagion attack. By his own account, Mr. Subbaraman has one of the more gloomy views on the future of these markets \u2014 earlier this year he published a report titled \u201cEnjoy the Party, but Stay Close to the Door.\u201dRegulators also took an unusual step to help troubled banks, suspending the requirement that banks book losses on the value of their plummeting securities.Global markets were shakier, though. Emerging market currencies, especially the South African rand, the Russian ruble and the Mexican peso, were down sharply against the dollar. European banks with exposure to Turkey, like BBVA in Spain, UniCredit in Italy and BNP Paribas in France sold off as well.\u201cThis development has broken the link between fickle outflows and economic catastrophe,\u201d Mr. Dehn said. \u201cBefore, a country could collapse if there were outflows \u2014 even if it did nothing wrong. That is not true anymore.\u201dTake Turkey, she said. As long ago as 2011, 70 percent of the debt held by the Turkish construction industry was in foreign currency. That figure, she contends, has surely risen since then, as the country has experienced a real estate boom.\u201cThis corporate debt issue is bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to blow up at some point.\u201dEven if the other emerging markets do not succumb to the pressures Turkey is experiencing, there is another route for trouble to spread: European banks, many of which have been enthusiastic lenders to Turkish corporations and financial institutions.Shweta Singh, an analyst at TS Lombard, a London research house, points out that the European banks with the most significant exposure to Turkey \u2014 BBVA, BNP Paribas and UniCredit \u2014 are among the weakest in the eurozone in terms of their equity cushions.During the Greek debt crisis, the panic began over concerns that large European banks holding dodgy Greek bonds would suffer bruising losses. And that\u2019s what happened.Should such banks experience the same problem with Turkish loans, \u201cthe ripple effect could be tremendous,\u201d Ms. Singh said.Advertisement"}

We are to continue on, teaching our mandated state standards and steer clear of \u2018controversial topics.\u2019 But let\u2019s be honest. What educator went in on Feb. 15\u201d \u2014 the day after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 \u201cwithout facing questions of safety, school shootings, teachers carrying guns, or a number of other concerns from their students? We are doing our children a disservice by not having critical conversations, exploring current events and issues, and building a capacity to make the world better.\u201dKendall Dunn, 18In the day and age of wealth, where consumerism is ubiquitous, it\u2019s become acceptable to compulsively fill desires through material gains, such as new clothes or electronics. After all, if we have the capability to harmlessly buy whatever we desire, then what\u2019s wrong with instant satisfaction? The problem is that we constantly reward ourselves, which in turn causes us to feel less grateful for items we receive.Just like the inhabitants of Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d we seek products to provide short bursts of satisfaction and often ignore more wholesome alternatives. Similar to the imaginary civilians in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d we are surrounded by consumables that are marketed for being quick: Amazon Prime, faster internet, minute-microwave rice, etc. Even subpar TV dinners can seem more attractive than a home-cooked meal because of its immediate nature. However, better things come to those who wait.Sera Eviner, 16Why is #MeToo happening now? Why are all of these women all of a sudden sharing their stories? These questions seem to puzzle many, yet there is a simple answer: Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion can easily explain the growth of the #MeToo movement. Newton\u2019s first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.While the initial force is debatable \u2014 whether it be President Trump\u2019s locker room talk, the growing women\u2019s rights movement, or simply women banding together against Harvey Weinstein \u2014 it is evident that a strong force had pushed this moment into action. The once silenced women gained courage and support to speak up; this cause that was once at rest, is now in motion and will remain in motion.Andrea B., 17Whether heroes take the form of a mighty Anglo-Saxon warrior like Beowulf or a fierce princess like Wonder Woman, the people who rise up to lead us out of the shadows of death are cultivated by the trials they face and the hope for a brighter future that we project upon them, which are often rooted in the injustices we experience.Victoria Li, 16Sinking into pillows with a pair of fuzzy socks hugging my feet, I lost myself in the world of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Beyond the ball gowns and fancy cars, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me. I realized that the same issues F. Scott Fitzgerald was commenting on in 1925 still exist today.We live in a society suffering from a severe lack of authenticity. There is no substance beneath our shiny exterior of purported principles. Maybe some of our historical documents provide a gilded barrier between what we say we represent and what we actually are.Abby VanLonkhuyzen, 16The motivations behind the Chinese Exclusion Act and President Trump\u2019s executive order barring people from seven Muslim countries are shockingly similar. Both were designed to limit the immigration of one particular ethnic group. But unlike the Chinese Exclusion Act, the president\u2019s executive order faced harsh criticism and was challenged in court on several occasions.Despite similarities between the two laws, the American people have learned a lot in the last 100 years. We\u2019ve learned that immigration doesn\u2019t hurt the economy \u2014 it might even help it. We\u2019ve learned that, true to American beliefs, the color of a person\u2019s skin or the religion they practice does not matter.Betsy Jenifer, 18Considering that \u201cDr. Faustus\u201d was written in the 16th century, during the Renaissance, it is surprising and even baffling that it is more relevant now than ever before. Today, everybody wants to be famous. Everyone wants to be noticed, loved and desired by everyone else. They want to raise eyebrows and swivel heads the moment they walk into a room and be important enough to make people stop chewing their food at the mention of their name.In Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play, Faustus\u2019s unbridled ambitions tragically lead to his downfall. After 24 years of enjoying all worldly pleasures, Lucifer along with his armada of devils drag Faustus into hell for eternity as he cries out.Jackson Edwards, Wesley Gow, Jack Trent, Jaya Krishnan, 17\u201cInvisible Man,\u201d Ralph Ellison\u2019s bildungsroman centered around an unnamed black protagonist (written to be symbolic of any black man), should not be relevant today.

This has resulted in everything from Instagram accounts about our society\u2019s beauty standards, to musical fund-raisers for LGBTQ+ rights groups, to creative writing pieces, artwork and political letters that urge others to help victims of police brutality, mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline.Heidi Echternacht, Princeton, N.J.Our second-grade class explored community all last year. First, we interviewed and drew portraits of each other in class. Then we interviewed people who worked at school and drew their portraits for a community art show. Next, we expanded into Princeton and toured the town, interviewing chefs, firefighters and the mayor, and had an art show in the town library featuring our interviews and portraits.After that, the kids decided to invent their own town they called \u201c2ndton.\u201d They wanted to have stores, use money and hold court to solve problems, so we did. They wanted to pay taxes, so we did that, too. We were going to have an election for mayor, but they decided against it in case people\u2019s feelings got hurt. Finally, we started our own newspaper and wrote about topics ranging from biographies of people in the N.J. Hall of Fame to national news about Donald Trump and the Women\u2019s March.We reported world news, primarily through covering the Olympics. We had subscribers and delivery routes that were coordinated by students and charged 10 cents for a subscription and a penny per paper. We put out a paper twice a week for six weeks. At the end, each student wrote an essay on community, citizenship and democracy.Julie Mann, QueensMy human rights class for high school ESL students has always been built around current events; I never know what I\u2019m going to teach until life happens.Since the new administration took over, our class has been very focused around immigrant rights: travel bans, ICE raids, DACA, the myth of the criminal immigrant, and now the separation of families. This is the first time we\u2019ve ever made our own population the focus of the human rights class, and I am guessing this is going to continue into next year.Kellyn McNamara, Charlotte, N.C.I am designing an earth and environmental science class in which students will connect a current event or issue to each unit\u2019s content. For instance, for unit 1, earth as a planet, students will explore the history of space exploration (and its funding), and prepare for a Lincoln-Douglas style debate in which they will argue either for federal funding of space exploration or for privatized space exploration.Susan Barber, AtlantaMy students would say that one of the best things they did last year was read Clint Smith\u2019s collection of poetry \u201cCounting Descent,\u201d then Skype with him when we finished. As a literature teacher, I can choose all types of texts to teach reading skills, but I love bringing in modern works and voices to help students explore current issues.Many told me they had never read anything like \u201cCounting Descent\u201d in school and it offered them, predominantly upper-middle-class white teenagers, an avenue to consider a different perspective on race and coming-of-age than what they are typically exposed to in suburban Atlanta.Savannah Lodge-Scharff, Roxbury, Mass.Mark Drago, Somerville, Mass.Elizabeth Misiewicz, Ridgefield, Conn.Last year, my middle-school students had to write speeches on topics they were passionate about, and that they could tie to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, then deliver them to an audience of around 100 made up of parents and school staff. They are finding their place in the world, and this project essentially said to them, \u201cYour opinions are important, and you deserve to be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A conversation with the former Clinton administration official, who hopes to win a seat in Congress. Update: Ms. Shalala won her primary on Tuesday night.Ms. Shalala, 77, was the secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton. That was the heyday of the \u201cNew Democrat\u201d \u2014 a nearly extinct political species that took an accommodating approach to working with Republicans on issues like trade, welfare reform and gay rights.Her opponents in the Democratic primary \u2014 Matt Haggman and State Rep. David Richardson \u2014 have tried to hang that on her, arguing that she is out of step with the party\u2019s progressive roots. In some ways, she may be. She says she is uncomfortable, for instance, with loose talk from some Democrats about impeaching President Trump. But at the same time she likes the concept of guaranteed income and wants to significantly expand the social safety net.She insists that as times change, so does one\u2019s political perspective. And nothing put this midterm election into perspective, she says, like the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Ms. Shalala talked with The New York Times ahead of her primary, which is taking place on Tuesday in one of the districts Democrats are best positioned to pick up from Republicans this year. The incumbent, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, is retiring.The following is an edited and condensed version of her interview with The Times. I\u2019m sorry, three. So why on earth would you want to go and be a freshman member of Congress?First of all, I\u2019ll never be a freshman or rookie. I just am angry at what\u2019s going on in Washington. And I think with my experience I can hit the ground running, and I can really help improve policy and stop bad things from happening because I do understand government, and I do bring fresh ideas. Over a long period of time you change your ideas. Certainly the Democratic Party that you served in the \u201990s is not the same party today. Looking back on the Clinton-era policies like cuts to welfare, more centrist positions that the current Democratic Party totally rejects, do you look back on that and think there were some mistakes that were made?This is certainly no longer Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic Party. And when you say something like \u201cguaranteed income\u201d people will inevitably say, \u201cWell that sounds like socialism.\u201dIt\u2019s not socialism. It\u2019s very far from socialism. Progressive Republicans and progressive Democrats are all talking about this kind of thing, and it\u2019s not socialism. But certainly there are elements of the Democratic Party right now that are embracing socialism. Is that a mistake?The Democratic Party has always had a big tent, and has always had people to the left, people to the right and people to the center. Whether there are more or less in each of these camps depends on what year you\u2019re talking about. The most important thing is to come together on the things that will improve the lives of Americans.You, of course, are somebody who\u2019s recently started advocating impeachment. Will that bring Americans together?Would you support the beginning of impeachment proceedings?Only if the legal evidence is there that justifies the inquiry. I believe in the rule of law, and I believe that Democrats have to be extremely careful not to politicize the process. You did go through this. You saw what it did to the country during the Clinton impeachment.I did. And I saw how they [Republicans] politicized the process. I\u2019m worried about that happening. Because this administration has undermined the rule of law. The attacks on the Justice Department, on the F.B.I., on judges, and we have to be careful that we don\u2019t join in those attacks. Democrats must be very rigorous, as we were, by the way, in the process for impeaching Richard Nixon. All right, thank you. I think you gave me everything that I needed.You don\u2019t have any other questions about substance?I think impeachment is a substantive topic, don\u2019t you?Advertisement"}

Erik Barreto, who is based in Singapore and a founder of Rascal Republic, a parent company that has hospitality projects around Indonesia, including Lombok, described the general situation in the south as stable. \u201cThere are people in affected areas that can\u2019t get food and water. But we have a site in the south where we are building villas and a hotel called Samara Bay and there was no physical damage,\u201d he said over the phone from neighboring Bali. But that doesn\u2019t mean resumption of normality will happen quickly. \u201cPlaces usually fully recover in two to three years\u201d after major natural disasters.Others are more sanguine. Steven Moloney, who owns the boutique hotel Rascals Kuta Lombok (no relation to Mr. Barreto\u2019s company), on the island\u2019s south coast, said his property is at full occupancy. \u201cPeople in south Lombok felt the earthquake like a tremor \u2014 there was a little bit of shock, and then everything went back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cSome travelers who were staying in the north have now come down to Kuta. The restaurants here are full. People forget about things like this in two or three months.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All these socialists coming out of the woodwork must have them in quite a lather. So I write today with some friendly advice for the capitalist class about said socialists.You want fewer socialists? Easy. Stop creating them.Every once in a while in history, cause and effect smack us in the face. The conditions under which the czars forced Russians to live gave rise to Bolshevism. The terms imposed at Versailles fueled Hitler\u2019s ascent. The failures of Keynesianism in the 1970s smoothed the path for supply-side economics.You\u2019ve seen the United States go from being a country that your parents \u2014 or if you\u2019re 28, more likely your grandparents \u2014 described as a place where life got better for every succeeding generation to a place where for millions of people, quite possibly including you, that\u2019s no longer true.I could go on like this for 20 paragraphs. Many more, in fact. But you get the idea. Back in the days when our economy just grew and grew, we had a government and a capitalist class that invested in our people and their future \u2014 in the Interstate highways, the community colleges, the scientific research, the generous federal grants for transportation and regional development.During this time and into the Reagan era, the broader American left \u2014 defined not by party but by belief \u2014 played a constructive role in supporting civil rights, opposing the Vietnam War and doing what it could to fight the new concentration of wealth. But, with the Cold War raging, its numbers were small and its influence negligible. I have mixed feelings about this socialism boomlet. It has yet to prove itself politically viable in general elections outside a handful of areas, and by 2021 we could wake up and see that it\u2019s been a disaster for Democrats. But I understand completely why it\u2019s happening. Given what\u2019s been going on in this country, it couldn\u2019t not have happened. And if you\u2019re a capitalist, you\u2019d better try to understand it, too \u2014 and do something to address the very legitimate grievances that propelled it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Turkish Officials Over Detained American Pastor", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe move was an extraordinary use of financial sanctions against an allied government. It is sure to inflame tensions that were already simmering over a litany of disagreements, including Washington\u2019s refusal to extradite a cleric suspected of leading a failed 2016 coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and his country\u2019s growing use of what many Western analysts have described as hostage diplomacy.\u201cThe relationship is now officially in crisis, and the only way out is for Erdogan to do what he hates the most: back down,\u201d said Julianne Smith, the deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The sanctions mark a rare public break between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan, two combative leaders and allies in the ongoing military campaign against the Islamic State.At the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said that Mr. Gul and Mr. Soylu both played \u201cleading roles\u201d in the pastor\u2019s arrest and detention, and that Mr. Trump had personally ordered the sanctions be imposed.Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, vowed on Twitter that \u201csanctions against our two ministers will not be left unanswered.\u201d The Turkish Foreign Ministry also said the sanctions \u201cwill gravely harm the constructive efforts to solve the issues between our two countries.\u201dRelations between the United States and Turkey have been bumpy for decades, suffering shocks after Turkey\u2019s military intervention in Cyprus in 1974 and its refusal to allow American troops to use bases in Turkish territory in the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war.More recently, tensions have flared over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s growing autocratic tendencies and Turkey\u2019s irritation over American support for Kurdish forces in neighboring Syria that Ankara views as part of a terrorist group.Turkish authorities have long predicted that the United States would refrain from punitive measures, in part because Turkey allows American forces to use Incirlik air base as a crucial staging ground for the air war against the Islamic State.But as relations with Turkey have worsened, American commanders have been quietly looking for alternatives to Incirlik, including in Romania and Jordan.\u201cTurkey\u2019s been using hostage diplomacy for too long, and these sanctions are an overdue recognition of that reality,\u201d said Michael Rubin, a Pentagon official in the administration of President George W. Bush. \u201cPresident Trump tried to do a deal with Erdogan, and Erdogan didn\u2019t keep his word.\u201dBefore the sanctions were announced, Mr. Erdogan told reporters in Ankara that threats against Turkey \u201cwill not be appropriate,\u201d especially given the country\u2019s \u201chighest level of solidarity at NATO\u201d for the United States.\u201cThey should know our character well,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.Mr. Brunson, 50, an evangelical pastor from North Carolina, has been imprisoned in Turkey for 21 months and is accused of aiding the failed coup attempt against Mr. Erdogan in July 2016. Last month, the Turkish government moved Mr. Brunson from jail to house arrest because of health concerns.The Treasury Department said Mr. Brunson was arrested with \u201can absence of evidence,\u201d and it accused the Turkish officials of running entities involved in human rights abuses. The two Turkish officials were sanctioned under the Global Magnitsky Act, which penalizes authorities for human rights abuses.On July 26, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with Mr. Cavusoglu, a call the State Department described in just one tough sentence: \u201cThe secretary underscored that it is well past time for this innocent pastor, Andrew Brunson, to come home.\u201dTwo days later, the two diplomats spoke again. The State Department described that call in less abrupt terms, saying the two \u201ccommitted to continued discussions to resolve the matter and address other issues of common concern.\u201dThen on Tuesday, a Turkish court rejected Mr. Brunson\u2019s appeal to be freed during his trial.But Ivo H. Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO, said the tough stand on the detention of a single American raised questions about how the administration would deal with Turkey\u2019s recent purchase of a Russian air defense system, or its threats to attack United States forces in Syria.\u201cAre we trying to get a single guy released from prison or improve our relationship with an ally with a whole host of issues at play?\u201d Mr. Daalder asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the overall strategy?\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Alan Rappeport contributed to this report.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "End Stock Buybacks, Save the Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lazonick, an economist, and Mr. Jacobson, a journalist, write about industrial policy and economics.Since the 1980s, corporate boards in the United States have embraced as dogma the position that companies should be run primarily for the benefit of their shareholders. The stranglehold of this doctrine of \u201cshareholder-value maximization\u201d over corporate decision making has been a leading cause of inequitable incomes, unstable employment, and sagging productivity.The principal tool for extracting value from companies and handing it to shareholders is the stock buyback, which usually boosts a company\u2019s stock price. Buybacks are favored by top executives, who are paid primarily in stock options and stock awards, and encouraged by ever-more-powerful hedge-fund activists. From 2008 to 2017, 466 S.&P. 500 companies distributed $4 trillion to shareholders as buybacks, equal to 53 percent of profits, along with $3.1 trillion as dividends.The growing use of stock buybacks since the mid-1980s has warped the economy, worsening inequality, distorting corporate decision making and diverting resources from investment in employees and hard assets. Congress is taking notice: the Reward Work Act introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin in March would ban stock buybacks done as open market repurchases. (It would still allow buybacks done through tender offers, which are used for different purposes.)The Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mandate includes stock market regulation, opened the floodgates to stock buybacks in 1982, when it adopted Rule 10b-18. Promulgated without public comment, the rule gives a company a \u201csafe harbor\u201d in repurchasing its own stock on the open market if it meets certain conditions, among them, restricting its buybacks on any single trading day to no more than 25 percent of the stock\u2019s average daily trading volume over the previous four weeks. If it stays within the safe harbor, a company can repurchase its stock in massive amounts without fear of being charged with manipulating the stock\u2019s price.Before the adoption of this rule, buybacks were not illegal, but companies refrained from doing them on a large scale because of the risk that the S.E.C. might bring manipulation charges. With this fear banished, buybacks began on a large scale in 1984.Corporations already had a way to provide a yield to shareholders: dividends. But by 1997, stock buybacks had surpassed dividends as a mode of distribution to shareholders.To understand the magnitude of this shift, we analyzed financial data from 232 companies in the S.&P. 500 Index that were publicly listed in 1981, before the rule, and were still public through 2016. We found that from 1981 to 1983, these companies spent 4.3 percent of profits on buybacks. In comparison, from 2014 to 2016, these same companies spent 59 percent of their profits buying back their own stock. Dividends absorbed just under half of profits in both periods.The Rule 10b-18 daily limit on stock buybacks isn\u2019t much of a limit at all. Apple, for example, could buy back $1.4 billion worth of its stock in a single day without exceeding it. And as long as Apple\u2019s board adopts a buyback program to permit it, senior executives can keep buying back similar amounts of stock, trading day after trading day.Defenders of buybacks contend that they do no harm because the funds are reallocated through financial markets and used elsewhere in the economy. A company\u2019s profits are, however, the financial foundation for investments in productive capabilities, first and foremost in employees. Investment in training and retaining employees is the key to productivity growth and innovation, for individual companies and for the economy. According to our research, when trillions of dollars of corporate cash are extracted from companies through buybacks, on top of dividends, the result is a dramatic concentration of income among the richest American households and the destruction of middle-class employment opportunities.In 2003, the S.E.C. revealed that it was aware of the use of buybacks to manipulate the stock market. The agency acknowledged, in amending Rule 10b-18 to include block trades, that \u201cduring the late 1990s, it was reported that many companies were spending more than half their net income on massive buyback programs that were intended to boost share prices \u2014 often supporting their share price at levels far above where they would otherwise trade.\u201d But its 2003 amendment was hardly a solution.From 2003 to 2007, the value of buybacks by companies in the S.&P. 500 Index quadrupled, reaching almost $600 billion in 2007. With their cash reserves depleted by this orgy of buyback activity, these companies were more vulnerable when the downturn came. Having wasted billions on buybacks, many of them incurred huge losses and required mass layoffs to avoid bankruptcy.After plummeting in 2008 and 2009, buybacks have again soared: A record $800 billion in buybacks by S.&P. 500 companies is predicted for this year.Democrats have argued that the Republican tax cuts have funded increased buybacks. While this is true, the damage done by corporate stock buybacks over the past decades has been systemic.Short of a Congressional ban on buybacks, as Ms. Baldwin proposes, the S.E.C. should immediately rescind Rule 10b-18, and confront the reality of stock market manipulation that open market repurchases entail. If Congress and regulators do not take action to rein in buybacks, the rampant economic inequality that already afflicts the United States will only get worse.William Lazonick, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is president of the Academic-Industry Research Network. Ken Jacobson is its communications director.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jack Ryan Still Just Wants to Sit at a Desk", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick: What\u2019s the first franchise you think of involving a patriotic government staffer who has to beat up bad guys in order to foil international conspiracies, and who has been played by several actors over the course of decades? Bond? James Bond?While most of the films received mixed reviews, the interest in Ryan projects has remained high in Hollywood.\u201cThey appeal to audiences because they appear to be nice guys and somebody who you want to be friends with,\u201d said Mace Neufeld, a producer on every onscreen iteration.Ryan is also different from the typical action hero. \u201cHis brain is his superpower,\u201d said Carlton Cuse, one of the show\u2019s creators with Graham Roland. \u201cThat\u2019s what distinguishes him.\u201dNow it\u2019s Mr. Krasinski\u2019s turn to inhabit the character. And this iteration will be different from past versions, focusing on Ryan at an earlier point in his career than in most of the books or movies.Developments quickly take the young analyst from his desk at Langley to Yemen, where he participates in interrogations and the occasional firefight as he pursues a terrorist mastermind in the Middle East who may or may not have ties to ISIS.\u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d played heavily on Cold War tensions. \u201cThe Sum of All Fears,\u201d based on a book from 1991 but released a year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, involved a bomb going off in a crowded part of Baltimore. The movie led by Mr. Pine had a face-off with the Russian government at a time when, in real life, relations with President Vladimir Putin were increasingly strained.Here\u2019s a look at how Ryan has evolved over the years.Directed by John McTiernan, the film is remarkably different from the others, its intrigue derived from a high-stakes chess game, rather than a mash-up of action scenes. The submarine is commanded by Marko Ramius, who is actually Lithuanian, not Russian (and is played by the Scottish Sean Connery). Ramius\u2019s intentions are a mystery to both the Americans and the Soviets, as well as to the audience. But the brash Ryan correctly surmises that Ramius is actually defecting, and averts nuclear disaster in the process.One consistent characteristic throughout the movies: Even though Ryan is simply an analyst who sits at a desk, he can handle himself in the field because, we find out at some strategic point, he\u2019s a former Marine.Mr. Ford\u2019s Ryan was retired from the C.I.A. and teaching at the United States Naval Academy. Ryan\u2019s wife was recast as Anne Archer and given a new name \u2014 in \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d she was played by Gates McFadden \u2014 but his boss stayed the same, with Mr. Jones reprising his role as Greer.The Ryan films fronted by Mr. Ford are more action-heavy, a deliberate choice, according to Mr. Neufeld. He said that having Ryan be away from the confinement of a submarine allowed for more fast-paced storytelling.Mr. Ford\u2019s Ryan prefers punching to analysis. The story\u2019s central conflict is more about settling a personal grudge than saving America.The plot is set into motion when a close friend of President Bennett (Donald Moffat) is murdered by a drug lord, Ernesto Escobedo (Miguel Sandoval, bearing a strong resemblance to Pablo Escobar). But the real villain isn\u2019t Escobedo. It\u2019s a high-level conspiracy involving his intelligence officer, Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Almeida); the U.S. national security adviser, James Cutter (Harris Yulin); and the deputy director of operations, Robert Ritter (Henry Czerny).Ryan finds out about the cabal and, after some more firefights, punching and kicking, exposes the scheme, even at great risk to his career.This film features an unusually ineffective Ryan, who, again, can\u2019t stop a nuclear bomb from detonating inside Baltimore. But after it goes off, he is able to get cooler heads to prevail and exonerate Russia just as the two countries are on the brink of nuclear war. The real culprits turned out to be neo-Nazis, who want to start a war for some reason \u2014 it\u2019s never totally clear.The Russians, given barely any depth in the film, hatch a plot to prop up the U.S. dollar in an effort to collapse it to crash the economy and then follow up with a terrorist attack. Mr. Pine\u2019s Ryan is an analyst but also a spy, and hides the true nature of his work from his fianc\u00e9e, played by Keira Knightley. However, she discovers the truth and teams up with him for an operation in Russia. This film also features the couple\u2019s first argument, which Ryan\u2019s C.I.A. handler (Kevin Costner) referees: \u201cThis is geopolitics. It\u2019s not couples therapy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Catholic Church Is Sick With Sex ", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside of condemning adulterous behavior, Christ never said anything about whom you could love. Contributing Opinion Writer One pope was a father of 10 through multiple mistresses, a man who purchased the papacy with mule-loads of silver. It is said that Alexander VI, the most debauched of the Borgia pontiffs, elected in 1492, even had an affair with one of his daughters.Another pope contracted syphilis during his reign \u2014 a \u201cdisease very fond of priests, especially rich priests,\u201d as the saying went in Renaissance times. That was Julius II, known as \u201cIl terrible.\u201d A third pope, Pius IX, added Flaubert\u2019s \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d and John Stuart Mill\u2019s book on the free market economy to the Vatican\u2019s List of Prohibited Books during his long reign in the 19th century. He also formalized the doctrine of papal infallibility.What these Holy Fathers had in common was not just that they were badly flawed men putting forth badly flawed ideas: At the root of their moral failings is Catholicism\u2019s centuries-old inability to come to grips with sex. I say this as a somewhat lapsed, but certainly listening, Catholic educated by fine Jesuit minds and encouraged by the open-mindedness of Pope Francis. The big issue behind the budding civil war in a faith of 1.3 billion people \u2014 a rift that could plunge the church back into a medieval mind-set on sexuality \u2014 is the same old thing. And most of the church\u2019s backward teachings, dictated by nominally celibate and hypocritical men, have no connection to the words of Jesus. If you\u2019re going to strike at a pope, to paraphrase the line about taking down a king, you must kill him. Right-wing Catholics, those who think allowing gay members of the faith to worship with dignity is an affront to God, have just taken their best shot at Francis. The attempted coup was disguised as an expos\u00e9 by a conscience-stricken cleric, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2. He claims that the pope must resign because he knew about the sexual abuse of young seminarians by a disgraced cardinal and did not defrock the predator. That instructive was issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, designed to do to heretics what the Inquisition once did, without the stake-burning. The bishop\u2019s letter cites Old Testament sanctions against \u201csodomites\u201d and a New Testament interpretation from St. Paul, who admitted he was not speaking with direct authority from the divine. St. Augustine, who loved sex and had plenty of it before he hated it, set the church template in the fifth century, saying, \u201cMarriage is only one degree less sinful than fornication.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing from these puritanical pronouncements, from then till now, is the figure at the center of the faith. That\u2019s because, outside of condemning adulterous behavior, Christ never said anything about whom you could love. Nothing about homosexuals. Nothing about priestly celibacy or barring women from clerical ranks, for that matter.Last year, while walking the thousand-year-old Via Francigena, I came upon many Catholics along that pilgrim\u2019s path to Rome excited about the fresh air blowing through a Vatican that hadn\u2019t opened a window in decades. The only cloud over these spiritual sojourners was the constant news about criminal clergy. The conservatives would do nothing to fix this, but would make the church a global pariah. The old guard is infuriated by statements like the one Pope Francis made on Sunday. When asked how a parent should treat a gay child, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t condemn, have dialogue, listen.\u201dThe way out of the present crisis is more light, less darkness and a few bold and dramatic moves. For starters, clerics should not be judging other clerics; let lay members, women and men, conduct the investigations.Priestly celibacy should be optional. It\u2019s an anachronism, certainly not one of the \u201cinfallible\u201d truths, and may be one of the main reasons pedophilia is thick in clerical ranks. For the first thousand years of the church, married men could become priests, as they still can in the Greek Orthodox faith. Women should be priests. Duh. When asked about this, Francis said only men could serve because Jesus chose only men as his apostles. This logic is flawed, as Jesus also chose Jews, and you don\u2019t see a lot of them being invited into the priesthood.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Cancellation of Pompeo Trip Dashes Hopes in South Korea", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The past few days have been a roller-coaster ride for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea.On Thursday, the United States secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced that he would travel to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, this coming week, raising hopes that the trip would make progress in talks over denuclearizing the North and provide the rationale for Mr. Moon to advance inter-Korean relations.To many South Koreans, the zigzag was another sign of Washington\u2019s poor coordination in its North Korea policy, and it left Mr. Moon with a difficult choice.Any major cooperative deal with Mr. Kim would also prompt a backlash from Mr. Moon\u2019s conservative enemies at home, who are always eager to portray him as a dangerous progressive.But postponing the inter-Korean projects, such as his plan to reconnect the two Koreas\u2019 railways, would be a huge setback for Mr. Moon, who has vowed to take a \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d in efforts to defuse the crisis over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons development and build peace on the Korean Peninsula.Mr. Trump could have scrapped Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip in an attempt to gain quick leverage over North Korea, and the American president may revive it soon \u2014 just as he once canceled and then reinstated his summit meeting with Mr. Kim in June, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, the South Korean capital.But if that turns out not to be the case, Mr. Moon could find himself in an awkward position when he sits down with Mr. Kim next month.\u201cHe can try to persuade Kim Jong-un to become more cooperative with denuclearization, telling him that inter-Korean relations cannot advance without it, or he can decide to press ahead with inter-Korean projects without progress in denuclearization,\u201d said Shin Beom-chul, a North Korea specialist at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \u201cIf he chooses the latter, it will bode ill for South Korean-United States relations.\u201dMr. Moon\u2019s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, talked with Mr. Pompeo on the phone on Saturday, expressing regrets over the cancellation of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip. But the allies agreed to maintain \u201cmomentum for dialogue\u201d with North Korea, Ms. Kang\u2019s office said.There was no immediate reaction from North Korea.The latest falling-out between Pyongyang and Washington came at a delicate moment in relations between Seoul and Washington.\u201cI believe in the importance of recognizing that we are the protagonists in Korean Peninsula-related issues,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cDevelopments in inter-Korean relations are not the by-effects of progress in the relationship between the North and the United States. Rather, advancement in inter-Korean relations is the driving force behind denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201dThat comment, coupled with Mr. Moon\u2019s proposal for bold new economic cooperation with North Korea and his plan to open the inter-Korean liaison office, prompted worries among conservative South Koreans that Mr. Moon\u2019s eagerness to advance ties would further complicate Washington\u2019s struggle to persuade North Korea to denuclearize.In recent weeks, Mr. Moon\u2019s once high approval ratings have begun slipping amid signs of rising public discontent about a slowing economy and high youth unemployment, so he needs breakthroughs in relations with Pyongyang. But to push for his inter-Korean economic agenda, he wanted relations between North Korea and the United States to improve enough to allow the easing of international sanctions.Officials in Mr. Moon\u2019s government have often said that Mr. Trump\u2019s unconventional approach may offer the best chance for diplomatically resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis, a problem that successive United States administrations have failed to address successfully.But even after Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim met in Singapore and agreed to work toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u201d and to build \u201cnew\u201d bilateral relations, South Koreans have lived with an abiding fear about the fragility of the diplomatic process.South Koreans also worry that Mr. Trump will be distracted by his mounting legal problems at home or that he may not survive for a second term. A diplomatic process that Mr. Moon helped create could be quickly overturned, that line of thinking goes, if a new administration were to take office in Washington with a more skeptical take on diplomatically engaging the North.But things have not moved as quickly as Mr. Moon had hoped.Two months after the Singapore summit meeting, talks remain stalemated. Washington wants the North to make bolder steps toward denuclearization, such as revealing a full inventory of its nuclear assets and starting to dismantle some of them.\u201cKim Jong-un must be watching closely not only Trump\u2019s legal problems at home and Moon Jae-in\u2019s sliding popularity ratings as he calculates his next moves,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.In recent weeks, North Korea has complained that Mr. Trump\u2019s agreement with Mr. Kim is being sabotaged by administration officials who insist on what Pyongyang called a \u201cunilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization.\u201d\u201cBut Pyongyang should realize that time actually isn\u2019t on its side either, because we don\u2019t know what Trump will do after the November midterm elections. Trump may be the only American president who is willing to deal with Kim Jong-un.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The West Hoped for Democracy in Turkey. Erdogan Had Other Ideas.", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "News AnalysisTurkey\u2019s descent into authoritarianism and crisis has destroyed whatever hopes remained that the country\u2019s president might serve as a force for moderation.Supported byIn Western capitals a decade ago, Turkey\u2019s now-paramount leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held promise as a potential beacon of democracy for a region rife with religious conflict.Turkey was a stalwart NATO ally bridging Europe and the volatile Middle East. As Mr. Erdogan sought to secure a place for his country in the ranks of the European Union, he presented himself as a moderate and modernizing Muslim leader for the post-9/11 age. He catered to perceptions that Turkey was becoming a liberal society governed by tolerance and the rule of law.For the West, Mr. Erdogan has devolved from a righteous hope \u2014 would-be proof that Islam and democracy can peacefully coexist \u2014 into another autocrat whose populism, bombast and contempt for the ledger books have yielded calamity.Regional experts contend that visions of Turkey\u2019s leader as an agent of liberal progress were always fantastical. Mr. Erdogan \u2014 who served as Turkey\u2019s prime minister for 11 years before becoming its president in 2014 \u2014 forged his political career as an Islamist intent on challenging the strictures of Turkey\u2019s state-imposed secularism. His early democratic reforms and assertion of civilian control over the military were largely about winning the welcome of the European bloc while enabling Turkey\u2019s Muslim populace to practice its religion free of state interference.\u201cFor us, democracy is a means to an end,\u201d Mr. Erdogan once declared.History is full of examples of Western nations \u2014 especially the United States \u2014 projecting their aspirations and values onto foreign leaders with their own objectives.In its effort to prevent China from falling under the control of Communists, Washington backed the Chinese Nationalist general Chiang Kai-shek, celebrating him as a courageous hero even as he brutalized opponents and profited on the spoils of American support. In Vietnam, Afghanistan and elsewhere, the United States cast flawed figures as veritable George Washingtons before writing them off as corrupt tyrants.\u201cAs much as we might fantasize about things changing and there being liberal progress, we probably got overly carried away with those sorts of visions for Turkey,\u201d said Philip Robins, a professor of Middle East politics at the University of Oxford.Yet even inside Turkey, the European Union exerted a powerful pull as a means of elevating society. It aligned commercial interests \u2014 access to a vast European marketplace \u2014 with the imperative to democratize. To win European favor, Turkey abolished notorious state security courts, elevated human rights and scrapped the death penalty.If that was ever really so, it now looks like a lost opportunity.His spending spree has bettered life for the working class Turks who make up Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political base, erecting hospitals, schools, roads and other infrastructure. But he has fueled the construction boom by supplying government credits and guarantees that have encouraged private companies to take on alarming debts.The dangers were already mounting when the global financial crisis emerged in 2008, prompting the world\u2019s largest central banks to unleash an unprecedented gusher of cheap credit. They dropped interest rates to zero while purchasing bonds to make cheap money abundant.\u201cThis was the easy way to pump up the economy,\u201d said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cHe took the money and used it for his own political purposes.\u201dYet in nourishing the economy with borrowed foreign money, Mr. Erdogan effectively ceded control of Turkey\u2019s fate to financiers who answered not to him but to the global marketplace.\u201cThis is a classical case of populism,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cIt can get you growth for some time, but there\u2019s a bill that comes due. And when the bill comes due, populists tend to get more authoritarian and oppressive.\u201dTurkey\u2019s troubles have been worsened by other problems that are at least in part influenced by decisions made in Western capitals.As the war in neighboring Syria spiraled into catastrophe, and as the Obama administration opted to largely stand aside, millions of refugees streamed into Turkey. Europe barricaded itself against this flow, leaving Turkey to contend with a crisis. The migrants competed with lesser-skilled Turks for jobs, while placing a strain on Turkish services.Amid the instability, Mr. Erdogan kept the taps open for public spending, accelerating growth and elevating the debt dangers.\u201cClearly, the dynamics in Syria did affect the Turkish economy,\u201d said Selva Demiralp, an economist who previously worked at the Federal Reserve in Washington and now teaches at Koc University in Istanbul. \u201cThe increase in unemployment put more pressure on Erdogan to press his growth agenda and his populism.\u201dAt the same time, the United States backed Kurdish forces inside Syria to pressure the Islamic State. Mr. Erdogan has long viewed the Syrian Kurds as an extension of those in southeastern Turkey, whom he portrays as a mortal threat to national security.Mr. Trump\u2019s action sent the Turkish lira plunging anew, while handing Mr. Erdogan a useful device: Here was ostensible proof that enemies of Turkey were to blame for its economic problems.Whatever the political optics, Turkey\u2019s crisis is in large part a homegrown affair. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarianism has destroyed confidence in Turkish institutions, especially its central bank, the body most crucial to arresting the economic fall.As of June, Turkish private companies carried foreign currency debts reaching $220 billion, according to government figures, or roughly one-fourth of the overall economy. Persuading international investors to extend these debts and spare companies from bankruptcy requires that the central bank lift interest rates. But Mr. Erdogan has refused to go along, claiming \u2014 contrary to basic economics \u2014 that inflation is caused by high interest rates.His unwillingness to raise rates reflects rational fears. Such a move would choke off growth and probably plunge Turkey into recession. But holding the course probably amounts to a slower, more winding path to the same destination, as investors flee Turkey and forsake the lira. That route may yet end at the doorstep of the International Monetary Fund, with a plea for a bailout.If matters come to that, Mr. Erdogan would be back in a familiar place, his national fortunes tied again to relations with Europe and the United States, though not in the way he once hoped.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a number we need for many purposes. But on its own it isn\u2019t an adequate measure of economic success. There are a number of reasons this is true, but one key issue is that it tells you only what\u2019s happening to average income, which isn\u2019t always relevant to how most people live.

To answer this question, we need \u201cdistributional national accounts\u201d that track how growth is allocated among different segments of the population. So why not do this?Some might argue that creating distributional accounts is tricky, that it requires making some educated guesses about how to pool different sources of information. But that\u2019s true of the process used to create existing national accounts, including estimates of G.D.P., too! Economic numbers don\u2019t have to be perfect or above all criticism to be extremely useful.In a reasonable world, then, something like the Schumer-Heinrich bill would become law in the near future. In the real world, of course, the proposal will go nowhere for the time being \u2014 because Republicans don\u2019t want anyone to know what distributional national accounts might reveal.And to be fair, progressives like the idea of distributional accounts in part because they believe that more knowledge in this area would help their own cause. But here\u2019s the thing: Knowledge is objectively better than ignorance. And in modern America, knowing who actually benefits from economic growth is really, truly important. So let\u2019s make finding that out, and disseminating the results, part of the government\u2019s job.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Le Corbusier Became Big in Japan", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis legacy seems to be one building in Tokyo. But most of the country\u2019s Modernism can be traced back to him \u2014 and the struggle to place his ideas into Japanese identity.The austerity of its presentation hides special, humanizing characteristics in its interior such as a characteristically Corbusian ramp that ascends to the second-floor gallery space. Built to house the collection of an early 20th-century Japanese industrialist, with special strengths in late 19th-century French art, the National Museum of Western Art employed three local architects. Their names \u2014 Junzo Sakakura, Takamasa Yoshizaka and, above all, Kunio Maekawa \u2014 would become hallowed in the emerging pantheon of Japanese Modernists. They had trained with Le Corbusier in Paris, and they were early exponents of his ideas. In Japan, they all assumed a position of pre-eminence, their own acolytes cementing the hegemony of Modernism over other forms of Japanese architecture.Though Le Corbusier helped master plan the city of Chandigarh in India, and epigones pursued this vision in Cambodia and Sri Lanka, it was Japan that would take up Corbusianism most powerfully. What was attractive about Le Corbusier was also what was repellent: his deracinated formalism; the reproducibility of his plans; his determination to have architecture exhibit the technological innovations of its era. Le Corbusier is not necessarily the first name that comes to mind when one thinks of Japanese architecture. But to understand its trajectory, he may be the most important and emblematic.In the 1920s, Modern architecture was a new field in Japan. It became distinguished from the work of artisans and general craftsmanship in the late 19th century. Despite, and perhaps a little because of this, Japan\u2019s was the earliest and most thorough engagement with Le Corbusier in all of East Asia: By the early 1930s, many of his most important books had been translated into Japanese, and several Japanese architects returned from stints in his firm to translate his ideas onto Japanese soil. It also would end up being the most lasting. After World War II, in which the Americans destroyed Tokyo in the second most vicious bombing campaign in history (the first was the American bombing of Vietnam), Modernism \u2014 especially through the medium of concrete \u2014 became the ideology of Japanese reconstruction. And Kenzo Tange, arguably the most influential postwar Japanese architect, who worked in Maekawa\u2019s office and participated in Le Corbusier\u2019s Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d\u2019Architecture Moderne (CIAM), took his cue from Le Corbusier\u2019s sculptural, expressionistic use of concrete, and he pursued and expanded Le Corbusier\u2019s early interest in comprehensive city planning.Maekawa lost the competition, as he expected to. But his Metropolitan Festival Hall ended up being built on the same site \u2014 poetic justice, if not a form of revenge.JAPANESE ANXIETY OVER modernity is a clich\u00e9 of cultural studies, and the fact that Japan in the Meiji period \u2014 roughly 1868 to 1912 \u2014 resembled Western Europe in this regard is too facile an explanation for its various forms of Modernism: There is simply no comparison between France or England and a country as isolated as Japan experiencing the onrush of capitalist industrialization. But there is something instructive in the fact that, in the 20th century, Modern architects \u2014 from Bruno Taut and Frank Lloyd Wright to Walter Gropius \u2014 toured Japan and discovered, or so they thought, the antecedents of Modern architecture. By the time he received the commission for the National Museum of Western Art, Le Corbusier\u2019s aesthetic was already mature, and the record is mostly silent on his reaction to Japanese architecture. But the architectural historian Hiroshi Matsukuma \u2014 formerly of Maekawa\u2019s firm \u2014 has pointed out that Le Corbusier was deeply influenced as a young art student by Japanese woodblock prints, and on his one visit to Japan in 1955, he toured the major temple sites in Kyoto and Nara. And in his last book, he notes, in a caption accompanying a photograph of the museum, how the excellent quality of the site-cast concrete exuded the skill and craftsmanship that can only be found in Japan. Indeed, the slim columns holding up the building are imprinted with wood slats, so that they call to mind the architectural tradition of the country.Adopting the moniker of \u201cMetabolism\u201d in a manifesto, Tange and his associates began imagining ever larger megastructures, and in Le Corbusier\u2019s spirit \u2014 but well exceeding him in ambition \u2014 they conceived of a future Japan consisting of cities in the sea and the clouds. This thinking signaled that Japanese Modernism had become a force in its own right: the international dream of Le Corbusier, in a sense, realized.Only a few years later, however, the conquering spirit seemed to have met its match. The infamous Nakagin Capsule Tower (1972), designed by the Metabolist Kisho Kurokawa, is the building that seems now like both the apogee and conclusion of Le Corbusier-style Modernism in Japan. Immediately seizing attention with its asymmetrical stacks of protruding boxes, it has become a symbol of the future that was. It was built with the intention of housing Japan\u2019s chronically busy \u201csalarymen\u201d during their weekdays at work. Each cramped, podlike capsule, outfitted with the barest of then-up-to-date bachelor necessities (such as a reel-to-reel tape player), was meant to be replaceable. But none were ever replaced, and when I visited the structure on a rainy day in October 2017, the level of decay was extraordinary, with water pouring through leaks in the stairway. Some of the capsules are occupied by artists, but most are empty.The megalomania of the Metabolists did not survive into the era of the Japanese bubble economy, let alone its bursting; the cycles of replacement did not fulfill themselves. Arata Isozaki, once of their company, designed buildings that gestured to Japanese heritage in a different way: They called to mind images of bombed-out ruins from World War II. Meanwhile, Tadao Ando, perhaps the most successful Japanese architect to come after Tange, developed an aesthetic of introversion: His houses and museums are tranquil rather than swaggering, putting up sheer, concrete faces to the world. Media architecture \u2014 glass buildings covered by digital television screens \u2014 became, for a time, the stereotypical image of Japaneseness. It is a sign of how aggressively the country seized upon the idea of modernity that its earliest Modernist buildings, once symbols of a fierce debate over what the recovering country should look like, are now among its most serene structures. In 2016, Unesco named the National Museum of Western Art to its World Heritage List, joining the Acropolis of Athens and the Alhambra, as well as the monuments of Nara and Kyoto, among the lasting achievements of architecture.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the designer of the west exit of the Shinjuku Station in Tokyo; it was designed by the architect Junzo Sakakura, not by Kenzo Tange.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canada\u2019s Strong Words on Climate Face a Test in Trump\u2019s Nafta Makeover", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump demanded a makeover of the North American Free Trade Agreement over the past year, Canada staked out a position squarely at odds with the White House: Any new pact must recognize climate change.That demand is now facing a test. Canada\u2019s calls for a trade deal to address climate change are the latest example of the ways that global warming can break on to the world stage and trigger political setbacks, even in nations already struggling to meet their targets for reducing pollution under the Paris climate agreement. For reasons like these, Canadian environmental activists and United States foreign-policy experts said Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government would have to pick and choose its priorities in the tense coming days, and many say climate change most likely will not make the cut. The Trump administration has opposed any mention of the phrase.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen at this point,\u201d said George David Banks, former international energy and environment adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Banks said neither the Trump administration nor Mexico appeared interested in pursuing climate change in Nafta.Mr. Trump has said if a compromise cannot be negotiated with Canada he will cut the country out of the deal. It\u2019s not at all clear, though, that Congress \u2014 which must sign off on any trade deal before it takes effect \u2014 would accept that. For Canada the risks are both economic and political. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, American exports to Canada have increased 165 percent since 1993, the year before Nafta came into force, and imports from Canada rose 150 percent. If Mr. Trudeau is unable to strike a deal with Mr. Trump he could come off looking weak in the eyes of his public. But if Mr. Trump imposes a 25 percent tariff on automobiles it would hit hard the economic powerhouse province of Ontario.The absence of climate change language wouldn\u2019t have an immediate effect on the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions projections from Canada, the United States or Mexico. After all, the current agreement also makes no mention of the need to drive down global warming. \u201cIt violates the norm that the environment belongs at the negotiating table,\u201d said Christopher Sands, director of the Center for Canadian Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.When it comes to Nafta, the Trudeau government has taken a similarly pliable position. In August, Ms. Freeland outlined Canada\u2019s vision for what it called \u201cprogressive elements\u201d to any new trilateral trade deal. The priorities: strengthening labor safeguards and incorporating new chapters on gender equality, indigenous rights and climate change. On climate, Mr. Trudeau maintained that he wanted to see the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to move to a low-carbon economy to be written into the new Nafta. \u201cWe are certainly looking for a better level playing field across North America on environmental protections,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said last year.Shortly after that remark, the Canadian foreign affairs minister sent the Trump administration a proposed chapter that included those elements but did not require the United States to accept or embrace the Paris Agreement.However, late last year the Trump administration declined to accept that language, according to Mr. Banks and a Canadian official who asked not to be identified.The Canadian Foreign Ministry and the office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request to discuss the role of that agenda in this week\u2019s talks.\u201cIt\u2019s a risk for Canada if they introduced concepts that could be cast as Canada complicating negotiations,\u201d Mr. Zive said. \u201cIf it became too aggressive, particularly pushing for items that are not on the U.S. or Mexico agenda, it could further the narrative of Canada being the outlier, which is clearly the narrative the administration is preparing to position with the public. The goal here is to jam Canada.\u201dMr. Banks, who accepts climate-change science and supports the overall goal of the Paris Agreement (but not the United States target for carbon reduction), said he was nevertheless bullish that in the long run there would be a merger of trade and climate policy, even under the Trump administration. \u201cAs the United States recognizes that it can take advantage of the fact that it is less carbon intensive than its competitors, including China, that bolsters the United States\u2019 competitive advantage when it comes to manufacturing,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Serving Time Should Not Mean \u2018Prison Slavery\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA national strike by prisoners is the latest iteration of demands for freedom from forced labor. Mr. Loomis is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cA History of America in Ten Strikes.\u201dWith often privatized prisons operating with maximum security and limited communication among prisoners, even discovering what is happening remains difficult, yet prisoners have organized themselves nonetheless in one of the most important labor actions in this country. The prison strike is a multiracial action, but that African-Americans make up a disproportionate number of the nation\u2019s prison population and its leadership of this movement is no accident. This strike is part of centuries\u2019 worth of labor actions to protest the compelled labor out of black bodies by a white-dominated society. We should not see the prison strike as an isolated event. It is instead the latest iteration of demands for freedom from forced labor that go back to slavery. From the beginning of black chattel slavery in what became the United States, African-American workers have sought to take control over their lives and work. Sometimes this was through slave revolts such as Nat Turner\u2019s rebellion in 1831 Virginia. But more common was individual acts of resistance \u2014 running away, slowing down in the fields, stealing food from the master. During the Civil War, slaves freed themselves by walking to Union lines. What was a trickle in 1861 became a flood by 1864, as thousands of self-emancipated slaves followed Union soldiers. What the pioneering civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois called the \u201cgeneral strike\u201d of slaves changed the outcome of the war, forcing a reluctant Lincoln administration to move toward the Emancipation Proclamation and then the 13th Amendment, all while slowing the Confederate war effort by undermining the labor force and thus the economy. Slaves could not have won the war by themselves, but their actions were crucial in deciding the war and creating its moral impact. The civil rights movement challenged this prison regime, but by no means ended it. In Texas during the 1970s, segregated prison gangs worked under overseers picking cotton for no money. This was modern slavery. In 1978, 1,500 inmates at the Canfield Prison in Ellis, Tex., refused to work in support of a lawsuit (in part against unpaid prison labor) started by a civil rights activist imprisoned in 1972 for inciting a riot during a protest against a white-owned store. They started a prison strike, which spread through the state\u2019s prison system, gained nationwide attention and lasted for two weeks. As during the current prison strike, the Texas prisoners had few illusions of immediate victories. But in 1980, the Texas prison labor system was ruled unconstitutional, and no longer would they pick cotton under overseers for no money. This was one victory in a centuries-long struggle; yet Texas has continued to exploit its prisoners for poorly paid work. Just as the public attention of the 1978 strike contributed to that 1980 decision, so might the current prison strike create changes to the current system of prison labor exploitation. That can happen if we make changes to prison labor systems a central demand of our politicians. The strike will continue until Sept. 9, and it is up to us on the outside to make our voices heard in support of these workers. Slavery still has never ended in the United States. It continues every day in our prisons. We must wash ourselves of this moral stain on our society and treat prisoners with the human rights that every person deserves. Advertisement"}

It\u2019s an elite that, rather than pushing for systemic change, only reinforces our lopsided economic reality \u2014 all while hobnobbing on the conference circuit and trafficking in platitudes.Anand Giridharadas, a former columnist for The New York Times, spoke about this phenomenon at an Aspen Institute conference in 2015, and he takes his ideas further in his entertaining and gripping new book, \u201cWinners Take All.\u201d As the Democratic Party struggles to figure out its future and global demagogy thrives, it\u2019s worth considering where we went wrong and how best to save the world from the dangerous turn it has taken. It\u2019s now very clear that globalization, technology and market liberalization did not bring their promised benefits \u2014 at least not for the vast majority of Americans and those in advanced countries around the world.For those at the helm, the philanthropic plutocrats and aspiring \u201cchange agents\u201d who believe they are helping but are actually making things worse, it\u2019s time for a reckoning with their role in this spiraling dilemma. I suggest they might want to read a copy of this book while in the Hamptons this summer.In a series of chapters centered on different individuals who are part of this rarefied class, Giridharadas exposes the rationalizations of the 0.001 percent who actually believe they are making the world a better place. The Sacklers helped create the opioid crisis but give money to important causes. The chief executive of Cinnabon thinks that being transparent about the fat and sugar she peddles offsets the harm her company creates. It\u2019s a land of PowerPoint presentations and cuddly good intentions.Giridharadas calls this prevailing ethos \u201cMarketWorld,\u201d made up of people who want \u201cto do well and do good.\u201d He beautifully catches the language of Aspen, Davos and the recently extant Clinton Global Initiative, which will doubtless reappear in the newly born Bloomberg initiative. It\u2019s a world of feel-good clich\u00e9s like \u201cwin-win\u201d and \u201cmake a difference.\u201d The rote conversations of this crowd were on recent display at the Public Theater, in the beginning of the second act of the Bruce Norris play \u201cThe Low Road.\u201d As Giridharadas describes the ethos of MarketWorld, it\u2019s made up of people like former President Bill Clinton who saw the anger bubbling up but proved unable to \u201ccall out elites for their sins: or call for power\u2019s redistribution and fundamental systemic change; or suggest that plutocrats might have to surrender precious things for others to have a mere shot of transcending indecency.\u201dLike the dieter who would rather do anything to lose weight than actually eat less, this business elite would save the world through social impact investing, entrepreneurship, sustainable capitalism, philanthro-capitalism, artificial intelligence, market-driven solutions. They would fund a million of these buzzwordy programs rather than fundamentally question the rules of the game \u2014 or even alter their own behavior to reduce the harm of the existing distorted, inefficient and unfair rules. Doing the right thing \u2014 and moving away from their win-win mentality \u2014 would involve real sacrifice; instead, it\u2019s easier to focus on their pet projects and initiatives. As Giridharadas puts it, people wanted to do \u201cvirtuous side projects instead of doing their day jobs more honorably.\u201dIn order to really have an economy with the greatest opportunity for all, the kind of economy they seem to champion, the MarketWorlders would have to pay high levels of corporate and personal income tax, offer decent wages to their workers, allow unions, fund public schools (instead of pet charter projects) and support some form of single payer health care and campaign finance reform. One simply can\u2019t arrive at a more economically equal reality when the rungs of the ladder are so far apart.At Davos and the other international conclaves where the muckety-mucks celebrate the new economic world they have helped create, which has rewarded them so amply, corporate leaders move seamlessly from sessions discussing the risks of climate change, growing inequality and financial instability, to dinners at which they praise tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and applaud proposals for deregulation. They conveniently don\u2019t mention the increases in taxes on a majority of those in the middle, the Republican moves to eliminate health insurance for some 13 million in a country where life expectancy is already in decline, the increase in pollution, the risk of another financial crisis, the ever increasing evidence of moral turpitude \u2014 whether it\u2019s Wells Fargo cheating its customers or Volkswagen cheating on its emission tests. Cognitive dissonance is intrinsic to MarketWorld.Giridharadas rightly argues that this misallocation of resources creates a grave opportunity cost. The money and time the MarketWorlders spend fixing the edges of our fraying social order could be used to push for real change. This is especially so in the political battles in which the country is currently engaged, where a majority of the Supreme Court and members of Congress seem hellbent on rewriting the rules of the American economy and political system in ways that will exacerbate economic disparities, increase monopoly power, and decrease access to health care and women\u2019s reproductive rights.Moreover, the ideology of the MarketWorlders has spread and just espousing it has come to seem like a solution instead of the distraction that it is. Giridharadas shows how this is done. One category of enabler he describes is the cringeworthy \u201cthought-leader,\u201d who nudges plutocrats to think more about the poor but never actually challenges them, thus stroking them and allowing them to feel their MarketWorld approaches are acceptable rather than the cop-outs they are. Another recent book, the historian Nancy MacLean\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in Chains,\u201d provides a salutary lesson on the dangerous ways a self-serving ideology can spread.Giridharadas embedded himself in the world he writes about, much as the journalist David Callahan (who edits the Inside Philanthropy website) did for his recent book, \u201cThe Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.\u201d And like Callahan, Giridharadas is careful not to offend. He writes on two levels \u2014 seemingly tactful and subtle \u2014 but ultimately he presents a devastating portrait of a whole class, one easier to satirize than to reform.Perhaps recognizing the intractability and complexity of the fix we are in, Giridharadas sidesteps prescriptions by giving the book\u2019s last words to a political scientist, Chiara Cordelli. \u201cThis right to speak for others,\u201d Cordelli says, \u201cis simply illegitimate when exercised by a powerful citizen.\u201d Although a more definitive conclusion would have been welcome, Cordelli does point to the real lesson of the book: Democracy and high levels of inequality of the kind that have come to characterize the United States are simply incompatible. Very rich people will always use money to maintain their political and economic power. But now we have another group: the unwitting enablers. Despite believing they are working for a better world, they are at most chipping away at the margins, making slight course corrections, while the system goes on as it is, uninterrupted. The subtitle of the book says it all: \u201cThe Elite Charade of Changing the World.\u201dJoseph E. Stiglitz was chief economist of the World Bank from 1992 to 2000 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001. He is a professor at Columbia and has been writing about inequality since the late 1960s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Afraid of Nancy Pelosi?", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinion ColumnistSo this seems like a good time to remind everyone that Pelosi is by far the greatest speaker of modern times and surely ranks among the most impressive people ever to hold that position. And it\u2019s interesting to ask why she gets so little credit with the news media, and hence with the general public, for her accomplishments.What has Pelosi achieved?First, as House minority leader, she played a crucial role in turning back George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to privatize Social Security.Then she was the key figure, arguably even more crucial than President Barack Obama, in passing the Affordable Care Act, which produced a spectacular fall in the number of uninsured Americans and has proved surprisingly robust even in the face of Trumpian sabotage. She helped enact financial reform, which has turned out to be more vulnerable to being undermined, but still helped stabilize the economy and protected many Americans from fraud.It\u2019s quite a record. Oh, and whenever you hear Republicans claim that Pelosi is some kind of wild-eyed leftist, ask yourself, what\u2019s so radical about protecting retirement income, expanding health care and reining in runaway bankers?It\u2019s probably also worth noting that Pelosi has been untouched by allegations of personal scandal, which is amazing given the right\u2019s ability to manufacture such allegations out of thin air.So how does Pelosi stack up against the four Republicans who have held the speaker\u2019s position since the G.O.P. took control of the House in 1994?John Boehner didn\u2019t do much except oppose everything Obama proposed, including measures that were crucial to dealing with the aftermath of the financial crisis.Looking at modern House speakers, then, Pelosi stands out as a giant among dwarfs. But you\u2019d never know that from her media coverage.While in office, Hastert was generally portrayed as a stolid embodiment of middle-American values. Ryan was for years the recipient of fawning media coverage, which lauded him as the ultimate serious, honest conservative long after his phoniness was obvious to anyone who paid attention. But Pelosi is typically referred to as \u201cdivisive.\u201d Why?I mean, it\u2019s true that she\u2019s a political partisan \u2014 but no more so than any of the Republicans who preceded and followed her. Her policy stances are far less at odds with public opinion than, say, Ryan\u2019s attempts to privatize Medicare and slash its funding. So what makes her \u201cdivisive\u201d? The fact that Republicans keep attacking her? That would happen to any Democrat.Or maybe it\u2019s just the fact that she\u2019s a woman \u2014 a woman who happens to have been far better at her job than any man in recent memory.Does all this mean that Pelosi should become speaker again if Democrats retake the House? Not necessarily: You can make an argument for a new face despite her extraordinary record.But her achievements really have been remarkable. It\u2019s a sad commentary on Republicans that they have nothing to run on except demonizing a politician whose track record makes them look pathetic. And it\u2019s a sad commentary on the news media that so much reporting echoes these baseless attacks.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Than Cutting Costs: Travel Managers Now Consider Employee Comfort", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesCorporate managers used to focus on one thing when it came to employee travel: saving money.But now, given the nature of travel \u2014 crowded planes, tighter seats, security hassles \u2014 corporate managers are considering employee comfort as part of the deal.Aside from seat comfort, meal service and faster Wi-Fi, there isn\u2019t much room to innovate the offerings inside the aircraft, Mr. Sheivachman said. But beyond the plane, airlines can offer perks like matching frequent-flier status earned on another airline and offering access to airport lounges, early boarding, seat upgrades and priority help with requests like midtrip ticket changes.\u201cIf you are sending someone around the world and they aren\u2019t well taken care of, that reflects badly on the company and the corporate culture,\u201d Mr. Sheivachman said.These are more than V.I.P. perks, said Mary Huddleston Tabacchi, professor emerita at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration. \u201cIdeally, a corporate flier needs to arrive well rested to do business for their employer.\u201dThe perks do have costs, so it\u2019s up to the corporate travel managers to establish policies determining who receives the benefits. \u201cIt might be the executives, it might be the road warriors who travel the most, and it might be travelers in the divisions that bring in the most money,\u201d Mr. Sabby said.Direct nonstop travel, minimizing total trip time, is as important as any perk, Mr. Landson said. Before Southwest started operating flights from the Cincinnati airport in June 2017, it spoke with travel managers from several Fortune 500 companies in the area, as well as other businesses to learn when and where their employees traveled most.There\u2019s untapped potential in helping corporations of all sizes improve their travel, Mr. Landson said. California, for example, has thousands of companies whose employees want to make day trips within the state and get back home that night. Southwest takes those factors into account when planning its flights, he said.Alaska Airlines has had a special check-in line for Microsoft employees at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for three years and added a lane for Amazon employees in the last few months.\u201cAirlines are more interested in being creative and entertaining unique requests,\u201d Mr. Sabby said. An airline, for example, might offer more intrastate upgrades for fliers in a competitive marketplace like Los Angeles.While the tool was intended for companies to use directly, \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an increase in interest in this tool from travel management companies and consultants to use with their clients,\u201d said Elizabeth West, editor in chief of Business Travel News.The focus on cost savings ebbs and flows, largely with the strength of the economy, Ms. West said, but there is value in having happy, productive business travelers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReporters and editors at The New York Times had a backstage view of Mr. McCain\u2019s decades in public life. Here are their reflections.I covered three of Senator McCain\u2019s political races \u2014 his 2008 White House race, and his 2010 and 2016 Senate re-election campaigns \u2014 and each time two Mr. McCains would show up.The first Mr. McCain was the one the public saw a lot on television: irreverent, cheerful, reverential \u2014 of veterans, senior voters, Gold Star mothers, small-business owners \u2014 and thoughtful about policy.That man dominated his successful attempt to capture the 2008 South Carolina primary, a candidate of boundless energy soaking up a blur of V.F.W. halls, vinegar barbecue joints and endless rounds of TV golf watched with Senator Lindsey Graham in the back of a bus. Reporters dragging themselves to a 6 a.m. van call would find Mr. McCain fully caffeinated, probably from a breakfast with a donor an hour earlier. \u201cCome on, jerks!\u201d Mr. McCain would bellow, his grinning, pink face poking out from under a hat.The other Mr. McCain, brooding, impatient and sometimes dismissive, seemed to surface when he was uncomfortable with the bend that politics had put in his road. In 2010, when confronted by voters who questioned Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, that Mr. McCain stared at the floor uncomfortably, unlike the one in 2008 who had steadfastly defended his opponent. As I observed him under the relentless sun of southern Arizona trying to defend his multiple immigration positions, he shot me the occasional stony glare.The two Mr. McCains surfaced on Capitol Hill over the seven years I covered him there, too. In 2015, I went to his office to discuss a large defense bill, which he would only do after I spent a good 30 minutes sitting on his couch looking at photos of Native Americans taken by his idol, Barry Goldwater.Months later, relentlessly questioned about Mr. Trump, whose fortunes had entangled his own, he would no longer talk to me about much of anything. He scowled and loped away in that specific Mr. McCain way, one arm \u2014 the one injured by torture \u2014 slightly behind the velocity of the rest of him.In South Carolina once, he sat quietly in a chair waiting to do a remote television interview with a reporter back in Washington. Spying me spying him from a corner of the room, he said, eyes fixed on the monitor before him, \u201cWill you come back and see me again, Jennifer?\u201d When I assured him that I certainly would, he asked quietly, \u201cWill you come back even if I fail?\u201d\u2014 Jennifer SteinhauerIn January 2015, when Mr. McCain had just taken over the chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 \u201cthe only job in Washington, other than being president, that he ever wanted,\u201d I wrote then \u2014 I ran into him practically skipping along in a Senate corridor. We hadn't seen one another in some time. \u201cCome see me!\" he said playfully. So I did. When I showed up at his office some days later for our interview, I found the senator in a contemplative mood.Mr. McCain, then 78, was never given to introspection, and on that day, he was combative \u2014 he said he would have \u201cof course\u201d made a better commander in chief than then-President Barack Obama \u2014 yet also unusually reflective. He told me that one by one, his fellow prisoners from the Vietnam War had been dying, and that he was acutely aware that one day, his time would come.\u201cEvery single day,\u201d he said then, \u201cis a day less that I am going to be able to serve in the Senate.\u201dI asked him what he wanted written on his tombstone. He didn\u2019t skip a beat: \u201cHe served his country.\u201d\u2014 Sheryl Gay StolbergAll these things and more, I have seen. And so will you. I will go to my grave in gratitude to my creator for allowing me to stand witness to such courage and honor. And so will you. My time is slipping by. Yours is fast approaching. You will know where your duty lies. You will know. God bless you. Semper Fi. Fair winds and following seas.I was 16 years old. My older brother Dave was graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy with the Class of 1993. Before the ceremony I asked him who the speaker would be, hoping it would be somebody \u201cbig\u201d like the young new president, Bill Clinton.He replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some senator from Arizona, I think.\u201d I was disappointed, but that changed when Senator McCain took the podium. I sat spellbound, and by the end of his speech I was ready to drop out of high school and enlist. Two years later, I entered the Naval Academy as a midshipman myself.Looking back, I thought it was strange that Senator McCain said, \u201cMy time is slipping by. Yours is fast approaching.\u201d It sounded like he was ready to retire then, but 15 years later he ran for president. Had he won he would have given another commencement speech at the academy as commander in chief, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower had spoken at his own in 1958.\u2014 John IsmayI was on an Easter-week trip to Vietnam in April 2000 with my wife, Angela, and my 18-month-old daughter, Caroline, when an editor on the foreign desk of The Times reached me at my hotel in Hanoi.Would I rush over to the Hoa Lo prison, a French colonial-era fortress known in the United States as the Hanoi Hilton, where a young aviator and future senator, John McCain, had been an inmate? Mr. McCain was visiting the prison, with his wife and 13-year-old son, Jack.Interrupted vacations are an occupational hazard for foreign correspondents. But it was hard to complain about this assignment. Mr. McCain had withdrawn from the Republican primary only a month earlier, after losing to George W. Bush, and he was still a bona fide political star.I got to the jail minutes before the senator, who was trailed by a small retinue of journalists from Washington. He welcomed me to the scrum. Mr. McCain had visited the Hanoi Hilton on one of his earlier trips to Vietnam since his release in 1973, so the story was really his son.\u201cIt\u2019s always interesting for me to be back here and show my son the place where I lived for a long time,\u201d Mr. McCain said, pausing before a faded picture of himself as a grim-faced, defiant prisoner.The tour was over in less than an hour. That evening, I wrote the story on a flight back to my base in Hong Kong. The image that stayed with me was Mr. McCain showing his son around as if the prison were his alma mater.\u201cExcept,\u201d I wrote, \u201cthe landmarks on this tour were dank cells like the one where Mr. McCain spent two years in solitary confinement, and leg irons, which he once wore as a punishment for insulting the guards.\u201d\u2014 Mark LandlerJohn McCain was doing debate prep. That\u2019s what the handful of reporters traveling with the senator were told on the morning of Sept. 24, 2008. But as we gathered at the Morgan Library in New York City that morning, it was clear something was off.Mark Salter, the senator\u2019s top adviser and speechwriter, was pacing faster than normal, two cellphones pressed to his head as he went in and out of the room where Mr. McCain and his campaign staff were holed up. In fact, what we didn\u2019t know at the time was that the senator was planning what would become one of the most significant moments of his presidential campaign.Mr. McCain had bet that a return to Washington to help pass an economic recovery bill in Congress might help his struggling campaign against Barack Obama. The look on his face that day suggested that he knew it might not. And his plans to shake up the race began unraveling almost immediately, when Mr. Obama shrewdly refused Mr. McCain\u2019s request to \u201cdelay Friday night\u2019s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis.\u201dI\u2019ve always believed that Sept. 24 was the day that cemented his loss. In the face of the economic crisis, Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign seemed off-balance and uncertain. Mr. McCain returned to Washington, but it was unclear what he was supposed to do when he got there. He had called for a meeting with President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, but when details of the meeting were quickly leaked out, they revealed that Mr. Obama had taken charge while Mr. McCain was largely silent.\u2014 Michael D. ShearMr. McCain rarely spoke in detail of his torture at the hands of his North Vietnamese captors between 1967 and 1973, but his experience informed his dogged public battle to keep the United States from embracing similar interrogation methods, even when others in his party went in a different direction. When national security hawks without his experience protested that Al Qaeda was unrestrained in their brutality, Mr. McCain would reply: \u201cIt\u2019s not about who they are. It\u2019s about who we are.\u201dIn 2005, Mr. McCain spoke at the funeral of William P. Lawrence, a retired vice admiral who, like the senator, had been held by the North Vietnamese for six years. At the pulpit of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, he gathered 23 other men who had been prisoners of war in Vietnam and declared: \u201cAll of us share the bond that was formed many years ago and far away. We had the immense privilege of serving in the company of heroes.\u201dWhen Mr. McCain ejected from his disabled jet, was injured on landing and then beaten, he was dragged to a small cell already occupied by another American, George E. Day, who thought Mr. McCain might not survive a day. \u201cHe was horribly injured,\u201d Mr. Day recounted in 2005. \u201cHe had a fractured right arm, his left arm was out of the socket, his right knee was fractured, and they\u2019d bayoneted his left leg. The Vietnamese were trying to get him to make some antiwar statements, and he\u2019d refused.\u201dMr. McCain resisted his captors\u2019 threats and bribes, including an offer of early release, sometimes with grim wit; once, when they demanded the names of members of his squadron, he listed the Green Bay Packers\u2019 offensive line. After days of torture, Mr. McCain finally signed a confession to being a \u201cblack criminal\u201d and \u201cair pirate,\u201d deliberately lacing his statement with grammatical errors and communist jargon to show it was coerced. His cellmate for the last two years, Jack Fellowes, explained that such minimal accommodations were necessary for survival. \u201cJohn McCain bent a little \u2014 we all bent a little \u2014 but he never broke,\u201d he said.The experience led to Mr. McCain\u2019s fight for passage, in late 2005, of what was called the McCain Amendment, banning the inhumane treatment of prisoners. It was his response to the revelation that the C.I.A., with the approval of President George W. Bush, had used on Al Qaeda prisoners a range of brutal interrogation methods, including waterboarding, that the United States had long considered torture.\u201cHe saw the blood lust that those who tortured him displayed,\u201d Robert Timberg, a Naval Academy graduate, Vietnam veteran and McCain biographer, said at the time. \u201cThe idea that a torturer could have an American face is difficult for him to handle.\u201d\u2014 Scott ShaneAdvertisement"}

We\u2019re talking about the natural world, so one has to be cautious. But if you look at all the destructive extreme weather buffeting the world this summer alone, it\u2019s as if Mother Nature were saying to us: \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t notice me tapping on your shoulder these past few years? O.K. Well, how about a little fire, Scarecrow? How about this:While climate scientists have long argued that you can\u2019t attribute any single weather event to climate change, a study last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded: \u201cThe science has advanced to the point that this is no longer true as an unqualified blanket statement.

Heidi Cullen, chief scientist for Climate Central, an environmental organization, was quoted as telling the Weather Channel in July that the national academies\u2019 report connecting global warming to the increased risk and severity of certain classes of extreme weather \u2014 like some of the heat waves, floods and droughts we\u2019re experiencing \u2014 carries the same scientific import as the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s 1964 report connecting smoking to lung cancer.

Now that\u2019s a platform worth running on, and it\u2019s one that can do what Democrats need most: make them the party of strengthening the working class and American security. Clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing and efficient buildings make everything we want to achieve in our society easier.

{"Headline": "White House Gives Canada More Time to Rework Nafta", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration eased off its threat to exclude Canada from the North American Free Trade Agreement, extending talks that were set to end on Friday while warning that the Canadians must be \u201cwilling\u201d to accept the United States\u2019 terms.After four days of marathon negotiations between Canadian and American officials failed to produce an agreement, the White House told Congress that it would enter into a revised trade deal with Mexico and that it was up to Canada to decide whether to remain in the trilateral Nafta pact.\u201cToday the president notified the Congress of his intent to sign a trade agreement with Mexico \u2014 and Canada, if it is willing \u2014 90 days from now,\u201d Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement.The White House agreement to keep talking has less to do with a change of heart than with political realities: Congress, which has ultimate authority over trade agreements, has warned the White House that any revised deal must include both Canada and Mexico. Canada is the major export destination for 36 American states, and many of the president\u2019s political supporters insisted that he first \u201cdo no harm\u201d to the deal. Without Canada, Republican lawmakers would be likely to scuttle any new Nafta pact, dealing Mr. Trump an embarrassing loss.Yet the political necessity of keeping Canada in Nafta did not stop Mr. Trump from poking Canada in the eye, accusing it on Friday of taking \u201cadvantage\u201d of the United States, continuing to threaten it with auto tariffs and appearing to enjoy it when disparaging comments he had made about Canada in private became public in the middle of tense negotiations.The president responded in a tweet on Friday, saying that his agreement to speak off the record had been \u201cblatantly violated,\u201d before adding, \u201cAt least Canada knows where I stand!\u201dWhether Canada and the United States can reach a deal remains to be seen. Several big sticking points remain, and the president\u2019s comments have only inflamed Canadians, who do not want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to give in to America\u2019s demands.\u201cThis idea that Canada is somehow going to get bullied into a bad deal, I can suggest to you that that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Jerry Dias, the leader of the Canadian union Unifor, said on Friday. \u201cI think if he was serious about a trade deal, he wouldn\u2019t make those types of comments, because all they do is inflame the situation, and frankly it\u2019s foolish.\u201dCanadian negotiators suggested on Friday that they were simply ignoring Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, viewing them as bluster and focusing instead on the trade officials in the negotiations.\u201cMy negotiating counterparty is Ambassador Lighthizer, and as I said he has brought good faith and good will to the table,\u201d Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, said. \u201cIt is going to take flexibility on all sides to get to a deal in the end.\u201dThe decision to move forward capped off a rocky negotiating session on Friday, as the United States and Canada struggled to reach agreement on several contentious issues, including Canada\u2019s barriers on dairy imports, its rules governing movies, books and other media, and a mechanism for settling trade disputes between the two countries, people briefed on the talks said.Canada has insisted on protections for its publishing and broadcasting industries over concerns that these businesses would be overwhelmed by the much larger United States market. It has also resisted Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated calls for Canada to overhaul its dairy industry. Unlike the United States, which directly subsidizes farmers, Canada uses a so-called supply management system to regulate the volume of imports and keep prices stable for its farmers.Canada has given foreign countries more access to its dairy market in past trade agreements, and agricultural experts said negotiators were prepared to make similar offers in the current Nafta negotiations. However, Canada\u2019s offers have failed to pass muster with the administration, which wants greater access to its market than Canada appears willing to provide.At a rally in Indiana on Thursday night, Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with Canada and its dairy protections. The president accused Canada of not treating the United States fairly and said that if negotiations failed, he would punish Canada with car tariffs.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, then we\u2019ll put tariffs on the cars coming in from Canada, and that\u2019ll be even better,\u201d Mr. Trump said, complaining about the unfairness of Canadian dairy tariffs. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s going to happen, and we\u2019ve really developed a very good relationship.\u201dAs he met with a group of supporters in Charlotte, N.C., on Friday, Mr. Trump again groused about the dairy barriers.\u201cThey\u2019ve taken advantage of our country for many years,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey have tremendous trade barriers, and they have tremendous tariffs. Dairy products are almost 300 percent tariffs. Nobody talks about that.\u201dOn Friday morning, the United States trade representative put out a statement saying that Canada had yet to make any concessions on dairy products.\u201cThe negotiations between the United States and Canada are ongoing,\u201d a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative said. \u201cThere have been no concessions by Canada on agriculture.\u201dMs. Freeland said repeatedly this week that Canada and the United States had agreed not to discuss the details of the talks in public while negotiations were taking place.The countries are also sparring over a provision of Nafta known as Chapter 19, which allows foreign countries to appeal the duties that the United States levies on them for providing subsidies and dumping products into the American market. Administration officials confirmed that they had eliminated the provision in their agreement with Mexico, but the Canadians have insisted that it is necessary to protect industries, like lumber, from biased rulings in the United States.And Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs remain an issue for both Canada and Mexico, which want those levies lifted before agreeing to a final Nafta deal.Administration officials said on Friday that Canada was welcome to stay in Nafta if it was willing to make concessions.\u201cWe continue to be in a process to work with Canada in terms of whether they want to be a part of this historical agreement,\u201d a senior administration official said in a briefing call on Friday afternoon.Mr. Lighthizer called the talks with Canada \u201cconstructive\u201d and said that \u201cour officials are continuing to work toward agreement.\u201dThe next deadline will come in 30 days, when American trade negotiators are required to submit the text of their trade agreement to Congress. By then, negotiators must know for sure whether Canada is in or out of the pact. Giving notice to Congress by Friday will allow the deal to be finalized before Mexico\u2019s new administration takes over in December.Successfully renegotiating Nafta would be a significant accomplishment for Mr. Trump, who has criticized the 25-year-old pact since its inception and promised to remake it on the campaign trail.Yet the economic effects of the agreement that was reached with Mexico this week remain unclear. Trade experts who have analyzed the preliminary details have suggested that the proposals would do little to accomplish the bold claims Mr. Trump has made about how overhauling Nafta would help the economy, including greatly expanding American manufacturing jobs or cutting the United States trade deficit with Mexico.New regulations requiring carmakers to use more domestic content and pay higher wages will most likely raise prices for consumers and could create new opportunities for automobile manufacturers in Europe and Asia to have a competitive advantage in the United States.Nafta, which was negotiated by President George Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, helped lock together the economies of North America and prompted businesses to reorganize their supply chains around the continent, making industries like automakers more globally competitive.United States trade with Canada and Mexico more than tripled in the quarter century since the deal was passed, and now many products that are imported into the United States from Mexico contain many American materials and components.Even so, economists generally believe that the deal provided just a small boost to the American economy. And while the deal created distinct winners and losers, with some American towns suffering deeply as their factories moved to Mexico, many economists say it actually had little to no effect on overall United States employment, as the gains and losses from the deal balanced out.Speaking at a university in Oshawa, Ontario, on Friday morning, Mr. Trudeau said that \u201cwe have also been very clear: We will only sign a deal if it is a good deal for Canada.\u201dCatherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto, Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington and Katie Rogers from Charlotte, N.C.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a New Book of Sketches, Fran\u00e7oise Gilot Clears Her Mind of the Past", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProfileThe 96-year-old French painter and author Fran\u00e7oise Gilot \u2014 famously known as the former lover and muse to Pablo Picasso, and the mother of two of his children, Claude and Paloma \u2014 has a book of sketches out this week that she completed during her travels to India, Senegal and Venice between 1974 and 1981.While most artists use sketchbooks to harness their impressions into material for their work \u2014 to help them remember \u2014 Ms. Gilot has used hers to forget.\u201cThings I have seen, I want to take them out of my mind,\u201d she told me as we sat in her brightly-lit living room on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. (Ms. Gilot\u2019s home doubles as a studio in which she still paints nearly every day. Canvases are hung on the two-story-high walls, stacked on the floor and displayed on easels.) \u201cArt doesn\u2019t come from what is around you, but from what is inside of you.\u201dThis philosophical approach is unmistakable in the new monograph (published by Taschen), \u201cFran\u00e7oise Gilot: Three Travel Sketchbooks,\u201d which includes drawings and watercolors that bear little stylistic resemblance to her public work. Instead, they offer an intimate glimpse into Ms. Gilot\u2019s inner life.Her distinctly whimsical sensibility permeated our conversation. When asked about her years with Picasso and the comparisons that have been made between their work, she replied with a sly grin: \u201cSometimes you need an umbrella when it rains.\u201dBut Ms. Gilot has hardly lived her life under the shelter of that umbrella. Dorothea Elkon, her New York gallery owner and longtime friend, stressed Ms. Gilot\u2019s fierce independence. While the legacy of her relationship with Picasso has endured as an undeniable presence in her life (Paloma Picasso called it a \u201cnuisance\u201d to her mother), Ms. Gilot has worked hard to maintain her autonomous presence in the art world. \u201cIt\u2019s a dedication that\u2019s essential in her life,\u201d said Ms. Picasso, who vividly recalls being a child, sitting on the balcony outside her mother\u2019s studio and watching her paint for hours.Ms. Gilot was born in a suburb of Paris in 1921. Her mother was an artist, and her father, an agronomist, insisted that his daughter pursue a law degree after she graduated from the Sorbonne in 1938 with a bachelors in philosophy. But while enrolled in law school, Ms. Gilot studied art in her free time \u2014 entering into the tutelage of the Hungarian painter Endre Rozsda, who would become a lifelong mentor and friend \u2014 and she eventually abandoned the legal track.She met Picasso at Le Catalan Restaurant in Paris, in 1943. She was 21; he was 61. During their roughly 10 years together (a period described at length in her best-selling 1964 memoir, \u201cLife with Picasso\u201d), Ms. Gilot mingled in a group that included Henri Matisse and Georges Braque, though today she claims her art is not influenced by anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in influences,\u201d she said. (Picasso\u2019s biographer John Richardson agreed: \u201cPicasso took from her rather more than she took from him.\u201d)By the fall of 1953, Ms. Gilot had ended the relationship. Picasso was displeased; after all, she was allegedly the only woman ever to have left him. He ran her out of town and turned the Paris art world against her, Ms. Elkon said. In 1955, she married the French artist Luc Simon. Their marriage lasted only a few years and produced one daughter, Aurelia. In 1970, Ms. Gilot married the virologist Jonas Salk; they were together until his death in 1995.The sketches in this latest book are a stylistic departure from her body of work, and she considers them deliberately unfinished, completed as they were in notebooks she kept while traveling with Salk when he was collecting research on the polio vaccine he developed (except for the sketches from Venice, a city that has captivated her since childhood). They contain watercolor drawings but also words, written in careful, beautiful script. For Ms. Gilot, colors, text, shapes are used interchangeably \u2014 synesthetically.\u201cIf you can think of something in words, then you can see it in images too,\u201d she said.Narrative has always been paramount to Ms. Gilot. The floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that line the walls of her apartment, which is just down the block from the Hotel des Artistes, are a testament to her literary mind. Visual monographs on Claude Monet, Francis Bacon and, yes, Picasso are shelved alongside volumes of T.S. Eliot, Shakespeare and Evelyn Waugh. She has published collections of her own verse, and even these sketchbooks contain full pages devoted solely to her handwritten text. \u201cI was always good with poetry and letters,\u201d she said.Ms. Gilot\u2019s friend, the actor and playwright Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cr\u00e9mieux, who interviewed her for the pamphlet that is included in \u201cThree Travel Sketchbooks,\u201d is the one who convinced her to publish this book. Ms. Gilot was hesitant. \u201cFran\u00e7oise said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not going to interest anyone,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Cr\u00e9mieux, who argued that readers would like to see what Ms. Gilot calls \u201cthe process.\u201dCompleted mostly on tiny, bumpy plane rides between remote corners of the world after she\u2019d taken time to reflect on the moments she\u2019d encountered, the sketches favor figures over scenes: \u201cA landscape is always there and the people are not,\u201d Ms. Gilot said.\u201cYou can call it a diary,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat I draw has meaning. In my mind, I notice what I feel, and not what is there.\u201dAurelia Engel \u2014 who, in addition to being her daughter, is also Ms. Gilot\u2019s archivist \u2014 noted that if you look through her body of work, \u201cyou can see all of the people in her life coming through, all of the friends, the men in her life, the children growing up, the places she went. You can really feel the emotion she is going through and how she reacts, and what catches her eye or memory.\u201dIntimacy aside, the sketches in this book also betray a remarkable raw talent. \u201cHer draftsmanship is exquisite,\u201d said Jill McGaughey, the owner of the Mac-Gryder Gallery in New Orleans who has represented her for the last 10 years. \u201cShe has such great control and economy of her lines. Everything has a purpose. She\u2019s got a great sense of movement in her lines and in her figures. They\u2019re lyrical.\u201dThe publication coincides with a period of particular commercial success for Ms. Gilot. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there\u2019s been a tremendous snowball of interest in her work,\u201d Ms. McGaughey said. \u201cPieces that sold for $10,000 10 to 15 years ago are twice that or more now. The market can\u2019t get enough of her.\u201dA few weeks after I met with Ms. Gilot, I visited the Elkon Gallery on the Upper East Side where several of her works are held. Two of those works had been viewed by a potential buyer that week: a painting of herself with Paloma, \u201cProtection,\u201d from 1954, and a drawing, \u201cSelf-Portrait by the Sea,\u201d from 1946, which she completed when she was 25 \u2014 the year she began living with Picasso.In the 1946 drawing, she\u2019s looking upward and there\u2019s a man in the background walking toward her. It reminded me of something she said about her art when we met: \u201cIn the work of all the generations of painters who were like Picasso, the figure is so huge, it\u2019s all over the painting,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhereas me, I have turned it the other way around. The figure is lost in a universe that is very much bigger.\u201d One could say the same about her personal outlook on life, too.A previous version of this article misstated the length of time that Fran\u00e7oise Gilot has been with the Mac-Gryder Gallery. It has been since 2017, not 1972, but Jill McGaughey, the owner of that gallery, has represented her for 10 years.A previous version of this article misstated the surname of Fran\u00e7oise Gilot\u2019s daughter Aurelia.

{"Headline": "United States and Mexico Are Nearing Nafta Compromise", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and Mexico are edging closer to agreement on how to rewrite key portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with the two countries making progress on rules related to automobiles and other remaining issues during two days of meetings that ended on Friday in Washington.A preliminary agreement between Mexico and the United States would go a long way toward accomplishing President Trump\u2019s goal of revising the quarter-century-old trade pact, which he has frequently criticized as the worst trade deal ever. But talks this week have excluded the pact\u2019s third member, Canada, leaving significant issues unresolved.\u201cThe jury is still out on whether we\u2019ll get to a final agreement,\u201d said Michael C. Camu\u00f1ez, the chief executive of Monarch Global Strategies and a former official at the Commerce Department. \u201cBut for the first time in negotiations, the U.S. seems to be negotiating from a genuine posture to get to a \u2018yes.\u2019\u201dThe Trump administration has described Canada as recalcitrant and would prefer to do a bilateral deal with Mexico first. But Mexican officials have insisted that Canada must still be part of the final agreement, which governs trade terms across the continent.But an initial agreement between Mexico and the United States could help bring Canada back to the negotiating table to resolve the remaining differences, said Lori Wallach, the director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen.\u201cI suspect their strategy to get Canada to re-engage is to settle their issues and then say to Canada, the water\u2019s nice, come on in,\u201d she said.Speaking outside of the meetings on Thursday, Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican economy secretary, said that there had been \u201cvery good advancement\u201d in the talks.One of the thorniest issues between the United States and Mexico has been the rules that govern whether automobiles qualify for zero tariffs under Nafta. On this issue, Canada and the United States have much closer stances, said Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group.\u201cSo if Mexico and the U.S. can agree on this, I think it should not be difficult for Canada to come on board,\u201d he said. Mexico and the United States do appear to be making progress on the issue, with Mexico expressing openness to a provision backed by the United States that would require a certain percentage of an automobile to be made with high-wage labor to qualify for Nafta\u2019s benefits.Negotiations over Nafta had reached a standstill this spring, with the three countries far apart on several key issues and Mexico taking a pause as it entered the final stages of its presidential campaign.But now, with the election over, the departing administration of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is eager to wrap up negotiations and secure a more business-friendly Nafta deal as part of its legacy before Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador moves into office. And Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has expressed approval of the plan, viewing Nafta talks that would linger into his tenure as a potential distraction from his more domestic-focused policy agenda, analysts say.But while Mexico may be more willing to compromise to reach a deal, the American posture toward the talks also may have started to shift.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff policies, and the retaliation they have prompted around the globe, have elicited criticism from Republican lawmakers and American industries, especially farmers, who say reduced access to foreign markets is crippling their businesses.The complaints have become a looming issue in America\u2019s midterm elections, particularly as other countries like Japan and the European Union begin to strike their own trade deals that exclude the United States. The Trump administration also appears more eager to have the help of close allies like the European Union as it tries to force China to change its practices on trade. In late July, President Trump announced that the United States would work on resolving trade issues with the European Union, and that the two would work together to make changes that target China at the World Trade Organization.But time is still running short for the current Mexican administration to reach a new Nafta agreement. Under current trade laws, the Trump administration must give Congress 90 days\u2019 notice between when it concludes negotiating a trade agreement and when it is signed. For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to sign the agreement before he leaves office on Nov. 30, the three countries must seal a final deal before Aug. 27, Ms. Wallach said.Reaching an agreement could give the Trump administration ammunition to argue that it had fulfilled another major trade promise to revise Nafta. That could help populist Republicans, who echo Mr. Trump\u2019s trade views, win bragging rights ahead of the elections. But many details remain unsettled and it is unclear just how much of a revamp Canada will be willing to accept.Mr. Trump began negotiations last August promising to swiftly overhaul Nafta, which he has long criticized for stealing American jobs. But his proposals for significantly changing the agreement, including forcing more automobile manufacturing into the United States and allowing members to more easily leave the pact, soon ran into opposition from the other governments as well as American businesses whose futures are tightly tied to Nafta.Over the past year of negotiations, the Trump administration has repeatedly said it was racing to resolve Nafta talks before a deadline that it then failed to meet.\u201cIn fairness we\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Mr. Camu\u00f1ez said of the current, more promising state of play. He said it was hard to get too excited about the possibility of a final deal until Mr. Trump had demonstrated that he was firmly behind it.\u201cThe administration giveth and the administration taketh away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president himself is prone to change his mind on a whim.\"Advertisement"}

Bush and Bill Clinton, is focused on North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program above all else. That\u2019s in large part because North Korea has been developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that would give Pyongyang the ability to strike the United States mainland with a nuclear warhead.But the two sides didn\u2019t agree on the definition of denuclearization.For President Trump\u2019s top foreign policy officials \u2014 Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser \u2014 denuclearization means North Korea halting and dismantling its nuclear weapons program.Mr. Bolton said last week that North Korea had not taken steps necessary for denuclearization, a process that American officials have said should include turning over a list of Pyongyang\u2019s atomic weapons stockpiles, nuclear production facilities and missiles.South Korea wants the United States to give Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, something significant \u2014 ideally an end-of-war declaration \u2014 to build domestic political will for denuclearization.South Korean officials also have noted that North Korea is focused on the order of points made in the joint statement from Singapore. The commitment to denuclearization was third, while the first and second points called on the United States and North Korea to establish new relations and to build \u201ca lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\u201dFor the North Koreans, that means prioritizing an end-of-war declaration and peace treaty, analysts said.Joseph Y. Yun, the former senior diplomat on North Korea at the State Department, said in an interview that Washington and Pyongyang could try for a \u201cdeclaration-for-declaration\u201d agreement: North Korea would declare its nuclear assets in exchange for the United States\u2019 supporting a declaration to end the Korean War.\u201cThe best-case scenario is that Kim Jong-un visits the United Nations with a peace declaration in hand,\u201d said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul who writes on the Korean conflict and Chinese history.The Koreas had originally considered putting together an end-of-war declaration in July, but that did not happen.Given their skepticism over North Korea\u2019s commitment to denuclearization, American officials said the timeline was much too fast.As always, the wild card is Mr. Trump. He insisted that the Singapore summit meeting be held in June, even though American officials wanted more time to prepare.Mr. Trump might aim for a similar foreign policy extravaganza in the fall, timed to the United Nations assembly and before the crucial November midterm elections in the United States.For some American officials, the troop presence in South Korea is not just a deterrent toward North Korea. It also helps the United States maintain a military footprint in Asia and a grand strategy of American hegemony.China has already begun challenging the United States\u2019 military presence in Asia, which will only be reinforced as China becomes the world\u2019s biggest economy and modernizes its military.The officials also worry that President Moon Jae-in of South Korea might try to push for a lesser American military presence, or a weakening of the alliance, after an end-of-war declaration.\u201cFor the United States, an end-of-war declaration or a peace declaration or a peace treaty has always had a broader context,\u201d Mr. Yun said.Advertisement"}

All of us need help from time to time, and the ability to ask is a learnable skill we seldom think about but one that can have a monumental impact on our goals and lives.\u201cAlthough the idea of asking for even a small amount of help makes most of us horribly uncomfortable, the truth about modern work is that we rely, more than ever, on the cooperation and support of others,\u201d Ms. Grant writes.So how do you ask? According to Ms. Grant, there are four crucial steps.This means that even if you think it\u2019s clear you need help, it\u2019s entirely possible that the people who can help you don\u2019t have any idea you need assistance. In some cases, this can even impact your ability to perceive that you need help \u2014 all the more reason to get comfortable with asking.Last, make sure the person you\u2019re asking has the time and resources to help. We\u2019re all busy, sure, but you probably don\u2019t want to ask for help from the co-worker who\u2019s juggling five different projects, moving apartments and prepping for a vacation.Have a great week!\u2014 TimAfter a series of joyless stopwatch runs, I decided I needed a new fitness goal. Instead of pursuing a faster time or a longer distance, I wanted to pursue a better mood. I wanted to finish every exercise session in that euphoric, walking-on-sunshine state that makes me shout \u201cWOOHOO!\u201dHere\u2019s my recipe for getting \u2014 and staying \u2014 in the \u201cwoohoo zone.\u201dStick to cardio: Studies show that cardio can have a direct connection to mood. Play with the intensity and duration of your cardio to see what gives you the biggest boost.Pile on the positive: Get out in fresh air, blast a killer playlist and invite that fitness buddy to join you. Nature, music and camaraderie are all scientifically backed mood-boosters.Watch the comedown: Nothing derails a runner\u2019s high faster than dehydration or improper fueling. Sip water and eat a small snack an hour beforehand. (If you\u2019re exerting yourself over an hour, consider an electrolyte drink.)Soak in it: Our brains have a negativity bias and need more time to register positive experiences. Take an extra five or 10 seconds at the end of your sweat session to reflect on it and see how that glow sticks with you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We Cannot Afford This\u2019: Malaysia Pushes Back Against China\u2019s Vision", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "A country that once courted Chinese investment now fears becoming overly indebted for big projects that are neither viable nor necessary \u2014 except to China.Supported byKUANTAN, Malaysia \u2014 In the world\u2019s most vital maritime chokepoint, through which much of Asian trade passes, a Chinese power company is investing in a deepwater port large enough to host an aircraft carrier. Another state-owned Chinese company is revamping a harbor along the fiercely contested South China Sea.Nearby, a rail network mostly financed by a Chinese government bank is being built to speed Chinese goods along a new Silk Road. And a Chinese developer is creating four artificial islands that could become home to nearly three-quarters of a million people and are being heavily marketed to Chinese citizens.Each of these projects is being built in Malaysia, a Southeast Asian democracy at the heart of China\u2019s effort to gain global influence.But where Malaysia once led the pack in courting Chinese investment, it is now on the front edge of a new phenomenon: a pushback against Beijing as nations fear becoming overly indebted for projects that are neither viable nor necessary \u2014 except in their strategic value to China or use in propping up friendly strongmen.His message throughout his meetings with officials, and in public comments, has been unambiguous.\u201cWe do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said on Monday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after meeting with Premier Li Keqiang.For a time it appeared that China\u2019s standard playbook for gaining favor was working in Malaysia. It had successfully courted Mr. Mahathir\u2019s predecessor, Najib Razak, with easy loans and showcase projects, and secured deals that were of strategic value for its ambitions.Mr. Mahathir, 93, was voted into office with a mandate that included getting the country out from under its suffocating debt \u2014 roughly $250 billion of it, some of it owed to Chinese companies.Fears are growing that China is using its overseas spending spree to gain footholds in some of the world\u2019s most strategic places, and perhaps even deliberately luring vulnerable nations into debt traps to increase China\u2019s dominion as the United States\u2019 influence fades in the developing world.\u201cThe Chinese must have been thinking, \u2018We can pick things up for cheap here,\u2019\u201d said Khor Yu Leng, a Malaysian political economist who has been researching China\u2019s investments in Southeast Asia. \u201cThey\u2019ve got enough patient capital to play the long game, wait for the local boys to overextend and then come in and take all that equity for China.\u201dIn his action in Beijing on Tuesday, Mr. Mahathir said he was halting a contract for the China Communications Construction Company to build the East Coast Rail Link, thought to have cost the government around $20 billion, along with a $2.5 billion agreement for an arm of a Chinese energy giant to construct gas pipelines. He had earlier suspended the projects, leading some analysts to believe he wanted to renegotiate the terms during his China trip. Instead, he announced that the deals were off for now.\u201cIt\u2019s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don\u2019t need these projects in Malaysia,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\u201cCountries participating in BRI could develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests,\u201d the report said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation like Sri Lanka where they couldn\u2019t pay and the Chinese ended up taking over the project,\u201d Mr. Lim said.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mahathir made clear what he thought of China\u2019s strategy.\u201cThey know that when they lend big sums of money to a poor country, in the end they may have to take the project for themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cChina knows very well that it had to deal with unequal treaties in the past imposed upon China by Western powers,\u201d Mr. Mahathir added, referring to the concessions China had to give after its defeat in the opium wars. \u201cSo China should be sympathetic toward us. They know we cannot afford this.\u201dMalaysia has long served as a prize of empire, with a geopolitical importance that belies its relatively small size. The Portuguese, Dutch and British flocked here, eager to control a fulcrum linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans. China is the latest power to try to share in the riches.Kuantan, a Malaysian city nestled on the South China Sea coast, had never been a hot spot. But then China began adding military heft to its territorial aspirations in the sea, where five other governments, Malaysia\u2019s included, have competing claims.Chinese financing began washing over Kuantan five years ago. Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group, a state-owned firm from an obscure Chinese autonomous region, won a contract supported by the Malaysian government to build a deepwater terminal and industrial park. Nearby was a planned stop on the East Coast Rail Link that would mostly be financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, a government institution.Presiding over the official launch for the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park in 2013, Mr. Najib conferred on the project a global import.\u201cChina and Malaysia remain closely connected at a time when the balance of global trade is tilting in Asia\u2019s direction,\u201d he said. \u201cOn economic cooperation \u2014 and diplomatic \u2014 I am proud to say that Malaysia is ahead of the curve.\u201dKuantan residents, though, have long worried that the city could be saddled with white-elephant projects.\u201cWe welcome foreign investment and development, but we question the huge price that we will have to pay,\u201d said Fuziah Salleh, a Kuantan lawmaker for Malaysia\u2019s new governing coalition. \u201cWho is the real beneficiary of all this financing? The Malaysians or the Chinese?\u201d\u201cI am worried that our sovereignty has been sold,\u201d Ms. Fuziah said.Mr. Mahathir, however, is not averse to standing up to the superpower of the day. He was prime minister before, from 1981 to 2003, and back then he railed against the United States and other Western countries for what he said was a plot to hold back developing nations like Malaysia.\u201cMahathir thinks China is a hegemonic force that can control economies like Malaysia,\u201d said Edmund Terence Gomez, a political economist at the University of Malaya. \u201cHe\u2019s always been worried about powerful forces. Before it was the U.S., now it\u2019s China.\u201dMr. Mahathir\u2019s administration has been in power for little more than 100 days. In that time, Malaysian officials say, they have discovered that billions of dollars in inflated Chinese contracts were used to relieve debts associated with a Malaysian state investment fund at the heart of a graft scandal that led to Mr. Najib\u2019s downfall.The United States Department of Justice has accused Mr. Najib and his family and friends of plundering billions of dollars from that fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. When the indebted fund began a fire sale of assets, two Chinese state-owned giants, the China General Nuclear Power Corporation and the China Railway Engineering Corporation, moved in, prompting speculation that Beijing was happy to keep Mr. Najib\u2019s cash-strapped government afloat.Sitting at his desk during an interview after the election, Mr. Mahathir pointed to a sheaf of papers before him. It was a proposal from a Malaysian construction company that he said contained evidence that the East Coast Rail Link could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half of the $13.4 billion contract won by the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned Chinese firm with extensive operations overseas.Notably, the bidding process for the rail contract was closed.Last week, Mr. Lim, the finance minister, told Parliament that Malaysia would not be able to cover the operational cost for the railway, much less the capital expenditure, which he estimated at nearly $20 billion rather than $13.4 billion.Neither the Chinese company nor its Malaysian partner responded to requests for comment.\u201cIt looks like not all the money is being used for building the railway line,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the East Coast Rail Link deal. \u201cThe likelihood is the money has been stolen.\u201dMalaysian investigators are looking into whether an associate of Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson may have brokered the rail deal to alleviate the debt accrued by 1MDB or to fund Mr. Najib\u2019s re-election campaign.Malaysia\u2019s new administration, which unseated a coalition that had ruled, in one form or another, since independence in 1957, has also been scrutinizing the $2.5 billion deal for a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation to build energy pipelines in Malaysia. Mr. Lim said he had discovered upon taking up his post that the Malaysian government had already disbursed more than $2 billion for the project.There was one catch. \u201cFrom what we understand,\u201d Mr. Lim said, \u201czero percent of the construction work has been carried out.\u201dWhile the role of Chinese money in bailing out Mr. Najib\u2019s indebted administration has received the most attention, another Chinese megaproject raises even sharper questions about Beijing\u2019s geopolitical aims.The Malaysian city of Malacca was once a conduit for spices and treasures that flowed from Asia to Europe. The strait named after the city is still the channel through which much of Asia\u2019s seaborne trade \u2014 and most of China\u2019s oil imports \u2014 flows.But Malacca\u2019s port silted up centuries ago and is now a backwater. Instead, nearby Singapore, which sits at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca, ranks as the world\u2019s busiest transshipment hub.A $10 billion development project \u2014 backed by PowerChina International, a major Chinese utility, and two Chinese port developers \u2014 is supposed to propel Malacca back into global significance, as a vital stop on a maritime trade route that stretches from Shanghai to Rotterdam.The plan for this project, Melaka Gateway, includes three artificial islands and an expanded natural islet, which will hold an industrial park, cruise terminal, theme park, marina, offshore financial hub and self-styled seven-star hotel.And there will be a new deepwater port, with berths large enough to host an aircraft carrier. The port operator was given a 99-year lease for the deepwater terminal, rather than the more common 30-year time frame.The local partner in Melaka Gateway is KAJ Development, which counts among its previous accomplishments building the local zoo and bird park.To explain how a little-known company was able to work with Chinese firms to transform such a strategic spot, locals have remarked on the close ties between the head of KAJ Development and Mr. Najib\u2019s party machine. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cWe have so many questions about the project but no answers,\u201d said Sim Tong Him, a former lawmaker from Malacca. \u201cHow did KAJ get the contract? What might happen if the Malaysian side can\u2019t pay up? The Chinese are so secretive about this. It leaves us with a very bad feeling.\u201dMalacca State\u2019s new chief minister has promised an investigation into the feasibility of the entire project, including the possibility that land on one island could be sold as a freehold to a Chinese state-owned company.Melaka Gateway\u2019s necessity, at least for locals, has never been clear. After all, the nearby Singaporean port is unlikely to be eclipsed. And Malaysia is already expanding other ports, even as many are running under capacity.\u201cWe are very concerned because in the first place we don\u2019t need any extra harbor,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the Malacca project.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to depend upon foreigners to come,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they build, they use foreign labor, foreign materials. What do we get? Nothing.\u201dBut Beijing has funded the building of ports across the Indian Ocean, a strategy known as the string of pearls. Military experts have raised the possibility that these ports could one day welcome Chinese warships and submarines.\u201cYou look at a map and you can see the places where China is plotting ports and investments, from Myanmar to Pakistan to Sri Lanka, on toward Djibouti,\u201d said Liew Chin Tong, Malaysia\u2019s deputy defense minister. \u201cWhat\u2019s crucial to all that? Our little Malaysia, and the Malacca Strait.\u201dUnder Mr. Najib, Malaysia conducted joint military drills with China and allowed Chinese attack submarines to make a port call. Mr. Mahathir has shifted course.\u201cI say publicly that we do not want to see warships in the Strait of Malacca or the South China Sea,\u201d he said.Forest City, he said in Mandarin, was a jewel on the South China Sea.Best of all, he said, everything in the city was designed for a Chinese clientele, from the layout of the luxury apartments to the signage in Mandarin.The development \u2014 four artificial islands covering around eight square miles, or enough space for around 700,000 people \u2014 was conceived of by Country Garden, one of the largest private Chinese property developers, in cooperation with an investment entity whose largest shareholder is the local sultan.In the sales gallery, an electronic display plays up Forest City\u2019s \u201cstrategic location\u201d and places it at the center of a map of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative projects.\u201cWe are doing something that will alter the world map,\u201d the sales pitch reads.More than any other project, Forest City helped turn local sentiment against Chinese cash, amid suspicions that a private Chinese property developer was somehow secretly plotting to reshape Malaysia\u2019s delicate ethnic balance.\u201cThis is not Chinese investment but a settlement,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said during the election campaign, using Forest City as a frequent punching bag.Forest City is not a strategic play by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army to station warships in Malaysia. Nor is it viewed as a way for Beijing to finance the excesses of a corrupt leader. Instead, it represents something even more alarming to the average Malaysian \u2014 four man-made islands on which Chinese can live as they like and, in the process, dilute the Malaysian national identity.Although the majority of Malaysians are Malay Muslims, the country\u2019s second largest ethnic group is Chinese, followed by an Indian population. Many Chinese migrated to Malaysia during the colonial era, and the feeling that they were given preferential treatment by the British lingers to this day.Affirmative action programs that gained full force during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s first stint as prime minister ensure that Malays and indigenous populations get a leg up over ethnic Chinese Malaysians.In that context, the prospect of a new wave of Chinese migration, even if only a population of part-time sunbirds, is politically sensitive in Malaysia.But what if that wave doesn\u2019t even materialize? Capital controls in China have made it far more difficult for Chinese to get their money out to pay for overseas real estate, worrying the Mandarin-speaking sales staff at Forest City. Who will buy all these condominiums, which are priced far above the local property market, if not the Chinese?\u201cWe all want Forest City to succeed, because we cannot afford for it to fail and become an empty ghost city,\u201d said Wong Shu Qi, a member of parliament for the Democratic Action Party, which is part of the governing coalition.\u201cThe reality is that wishing for a Chinese concession in Malaysia is the best thing we can hope for,\u201d she added. \u201cHow sad is that?\u201dSharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Old Zimbabwe Is the New Zimbabwe ", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZimbabwe\u2019s constitutional court has upheld the election of Emmerson Mnangagwa as the president of the country. Ms. Chigumadzi is the author of a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe.According to the official results, the incumbent ZANU-PF led by Mr. Mnangagwa narrowly won the elections \u2014 the first after the fall of Robert Mugabe \u2014 with 50.8 percent of the vote, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance led by Nelson Chamisa won 44.3 percent of the vote. Mr. Chamisa disputed the results, describing them as \u201cfraudulent, illegal and illegitimate,\u201d and claimed he had won 56 percent of the vote. On Aug. 10, he challenged the results in the constitutional court, which led to the postponement of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s inauguration. Despite the opposition\u2019s optimism, the legal challenge was not expected to succeed owing to the judiciary\u2019s tilt toward ZANU-PF since independence from British colonial rule in 1980. Mr. Mnangagwa, as mandated by the constitution, is expected to take the oath as president within 48 hours of the court\u2019s ruling. After replacing Mr. Mugabe in November, Mr. Mnangagwa has been eager to gain legitimacy and would repeatedly say in public that \u201cthe people\u2019s voice is the voice of God.\u201d The ouster of Mr. Mugabe did bring about the end of petty oppression. The police stopped harassing and taking bribes from drivers on the roads. Zimbabweans actively exercised their newfound freedom to speak out: Many energetically insulted President Mnangagwa in their comments on his social media accounts. Murehwa, my ancestral village in Zimbabwe, is a ZANU-PF stronghold. In late March, as the campaign season was picking up, my family was surprised to see Mr. Chamisa lead the first opposition rally in the area in years, without any incident. In April, I attended a performance of \u201cOperation Restore Regasi,\u201d a political satire about the ouster of Mr. Mugabe, in Harare. The play was directed by the celebrated Zimbabwean playwright Daves Guzha. Despite these tentative democratic openings, the cynicism about a fair electoral process remained. On the eve of the elections, a young cousin who supports the charismatic and young Mr. Chamisa remarked, \u201cThe boy will win, but the old man will rule.\u201d Many of us, though hopeful about change, were hard-pressed to see an outcome where the old men, the veterans of the liberation struggle of the 1970s, would cede to young Mr. Chamisa the power they consolidated after deposing Mr. Mugabe. The actions of the military and police after the elections made it clear that in Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s \u201cNew Zimbabwe,\u201d citizens enjoy their constitutional rights at the discretion of the state. Members of the opposition parties continued to be harassed, assaulted and arrested. On Aug. 4, riot police interrupted a news conference held by Mr. Chamisa in Harare. To control the bad press, Mr. Mnangagwa sent a minister to disperse the riot police, tweeted his regrets and promised an independent investigation. The police have reportedly suspended 16 officers for their conduct during the crackdown on postelection demonstrations.Police had also charged Tendai Biti, an opposition leader and former finance minister, with inciting violence and protests by proclaiming that the opposition had won the elections. A threatened Mr. Biti sought refuge in Zambia but the Zambian officials handed him over to Zimbabwean police. When Mr. Biti was produced in a Harare court, many foreign diplomats and election observers attended to observe the proceedings. Mr. Biti\u2019s case became a test of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s treatment of his political opponents and had ramifications for Zimbabwe\u2019s attempts to better its relations with the global political and business community in the post-Mugabe world. The United States, the European Union, the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees and several additional countries criticized the mistreatment of the opposition leaders and activists. To contain the fallout, Mr. Mnangagwa tweeted that he had \u201cintervened\u201d to ensure that Mr. Biti gets bail and is released. Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s announcement revealed the judiciary\u2019s lack of independence from the governing party. The new United States law insists that the recent Zimbabwean election must be \u201cwidely accepted as free and fair,\u201d and its army has to act as \u201cnonpartisan\u201d and \u201crespect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons,\u201d before the sanctions can be removed. Without shedding the sanctions, Zimbabwe cannot readily get loans from global financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The sanctions ban defense-related trade with Zimbabwe as well as government assistance for numerous programs.The postelection repression and the renewed American sanctions are derailing Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s attempts to find international acceptance and secure funding from the international community to rebuild Zimbabwe\u2019s fragile economy. Zimbabwe is rife with tales of multiple centers of power within the establishment. Many believe that Mr. Chiwenga, the army general who ensured Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ouster and Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s ascension as president, is the power behind the throne. As with Mr. Mugabe, the biggest challenge to Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s rule is likely to come from his own ranks. Panashe Chigumadzi is the author of \u201cThese Bones Will Rise Again,\u201d a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Capitalism, Socialism, and Unfreedom", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinimal government doesn\u2019t remove power from our livesOpinion ColumnistWhat, after all, were and are the selling points for low taxes and minimal regulation? Partly, of course, the claim that small government is the key to great economic performance, a rising tide that raises all boats. This claim persists \u2013 because there are powerful interests that want it to persist \u2014 even though the era of neoliberal dominance has in fact been marked by so-so economic growth that hasn\u2019t been shared with ordinary workers:The other claim, however, has been that free markets translate into personal freedom: that an unregulated market economy liberates ordinary people from the tyranny of bureaucracies. In a free market, the story goes, you don\u2019t need to flatter your boss or the company selling you stuff, because they know you can always go to someone else.What Robin points out is that the reality of a market economy is nothing like that. In fact, the daily experience of tens of millions of Americans \u2013 especially but not only those who don\u2019t make a lot of money \u2013 is one of constant dependence on the good will of employers and other more powerful economic players. Oh, and social safety net programs can do more than limit misery: they can be liberating. I\u2019ve known many people who stuck with jobs they disliked for fear of losing health coverage; Obamacare, flawed as it is, has noticeably reduced that kind of \u201clock in\u201d, and a full guarantee of health coverage would make our society visibly freer.But seriously, do the real differences between New York and Florida make New Yorkers less free? New York is a highly unionized state \u2013 25.3 percent of the work force \u2013 while only 6.6 percent of Florida workers are represented by unions. Does this make NY workers less free, or does it empower them in the face of corporate power? If you\u2019re a highly paid professional, it probably doesn\u2019t make much difference. But my guess is that most workers feel at least somewhat freer in New York than they do in FL.Now, there are no perfect answers to the inevitable sacrifice of some freedom that comes with living in a complex society; utopia is not on the menu. But the advocates of unrestricted corporate power and minimal worker protection have been getting away for far too long with pretending that they\u2019re the defenders of freedom \u2013 which is not, in fact, just another word for nothing left to lose.Advertisement"}

This would be an enormously important step toward stabilizing the global climate, fortifying indigenous communities and their cultures and protecting the fragile and incredible biodiversity of these forests.At an aquaculture farm funded by carbon credits outside the Acre capital of Rio Branco, native Amazon River fish are raised on land cleared before the state ended the destruction of its forests. Local farmers produce eight tons of fish per hectare; that same hectare would support but a single cow on the poor grass that typically grows in these cleared soils. Local youth are trained to filet the fish, returning all waste to the farm as fertilizer (even the skin is tanned into leather for Herm\u00e8s purses). Others restore land by planting banana and rubber trees, avocados, pineapples, cashew and cacao to provide food and income all year. By maximizing production of both animal protein and export crops, these innovations reduce the demands for land that drive deforestation. Income from carbon credits is also fortifying indigenous cultures. Governor Brown is already a climate hero. Leading the fight to save global forests would be a crowning achievement and fitting final chapter for his time as governor. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congress Strengthens Reviews of Chinese and Other Foreign Investments", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChinese investment in the United States is about to get a bit harder.The bill, known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, broadens the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius (pronounced SIFF-ee-yus). The committee will soon have more power to investigate, and possibly block, foreign deals.\u201cWe cannot continue to let bad actors, like China, erode our national security advantage by circumventing our laws,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican sponsoring the bill. \u201cThis bill will modernize the process and help put an end to the backdoor transfer of dual-use technology that has gone unchecked for too long.Mr. Trump has previously said an expansion of Cfius would be a powerful tool national security and economic tool \u201cthat better protects the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security \u2014 and future economic prosperity.\u201dHere is what an expanded Cfius will look like:The current committee investigates only cases in which a foreign company\u2019s attempt to acquire or merge with an American company poses a national security risk.Past rejected proposals include a planned takeover of Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker, by a Singapore rival, Broadcom. Cfius voted it down in March over concerns that it would pose a national security risk by depriving the United States of a telecommunications leader.Cfius\u2019s expanded jurisdiction will give it a say in deals beyond mergers and acquisitions. Under the bill, joint ventures, minority stakes, and real estate transactions near military bases or other sensitive national security facilities all could be investigated \u2014 and potentially squashed \u2014 by Cfius.Cfius will also be able to expand the kinds of risks it can consider \u2014 not just national security but also the United States\u2019 competitive edge in emerging industries.The committee will update its definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d it reviews to possibly include new innovations and cutting-edge technology. That way, Cfius could block a deal if it determined that such a relationship would hinder the United States\u2019 edge in technological and industrial industries, or if it posed a national security risk.There are still limits on what Cfius can review, however. The legislation does not expand investigative powers on joint ventures that pass American technology on to foreign companies of interest. Instead, it strengthens the existing export controls managed by the Commerce Department.But the committee also reviews transactions from dozens of other countries of \u201cspecial concern,\u201d and the bill gives it more leeway to review them, too. The bill describes those countries as ones that have a \u201cdemonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology\u201d that an American company possesses.Additionally, Cfius will look into cases that would give foreign governments a technological edge for a possible cybersecurity attack against the United States, such as activities \u201cdesigned to affect the outcome of any election for federal office.\u201dSupporters see the bill as an important way to prevent foreign investors from sidestepping Cfius\u2019s authority. But criticism remains, with some saying Cfius could reject a potential deal that would bolster American jobs and growth.Other opponents worry that additional investigations will unfairly limit American companies and help foreign countries, arguing that existing export laws are enough to address national security concerns.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. and China to Rekindle Trade Talks as More Tariffs Loom", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and China will return to the negotiating table late this month in an attempt to ease months of tensions that have been building since trade talks broke down this year and both countries began imposing escalating rounds of tariffs on each other.The talks come as the trade relationship between the two countries faces further deterioration. The Trump administration is preparing far more expansive tariff measures, including levies on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products that are expected to go into effect next Thursday. The administration is also scheduled to hold six days of hearings over the next two weeks to allow up to 370 witnesses to weigh in on plans for tariffs on a further $200 billion worth of Chinese products, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative said.If all of those tariffs go into effect, the United States would be taxing roughly half of the goods it imports from China each year, raising prices for a broad swath of manufacturers, retailers and other industries.The meeting between midlevel officials is a departure from the formal rounds of talks between top economic teams from the United States and China that took place during the early days of the Trump administration and the trade meetings led by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier in charge of economic policy, this spring.Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, sought to lower expectations on Thursday and insisted that President Trump had no intention of backing down on his demands.\u201cAny time you\u2019re talking, that\u2019s better than not talking,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said in an interview with CNBC.Mr. Kudlow said that the demands of the United States have not changed, and that China must lower its tariff and non-tariff barriers and cease the theft of American intellectual property.\u201cThe Chinese government in its totality must not underestimate President Trump\u2019s toughness and willingness to continue this battle,\u201d Mr. Kudlow added.Beyond tariffs, currency concerns have re-emerged as an issue in the Trump administration, and they are expected to come up during this round of talks.The value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has fallen roughly 10 percent against the dollar since the beginning of April, a change that makes Chinese products cheaper for foreigners to purchase and helps offset the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs.Economists say the currency has weakened because of market forces and the strengthening of the dollar, as well as the influence of the Chinese government, which sets a baseline for the currency and then allows its value to fluctuate within a narrow band.That drop in value will put pressure on the Treasury Department in advance of an October report in which Mr. Mnuchin is charged with deciding whether to label countries currency manipulators. So far, the Trump administration has declined to give China the label, saying that while China manipulated its currency in the past, that problem had dissipated for now.But in the last month, China\u2019s currency has once again become a target for Mr. Trump.In its coming talks, the Treasury Department will seek to pressure the Chinese to lift the value of their currency, a person briefed on the plans said. But additional American tariff measures going into effect in coming months could further push down the value of the renminbi against the dollar, complicating those efforts.The Trump administration is engaged in trade clashes on multiple fronts, as American negotiators seek to wrap up talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and hold additional talks with European and Japanese counterparts in coming months.In the meantime, talks with China have moved slowly. The White House has seemed unimpressed by China\u2019s offers to purchase tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of additional American products, which Trump administration trade officials say fall short of the substantial changes they want China to make to its partly state-run economy.Mr. Malpass is even less empowered than Mr. Mnuchin to strike a deal, and while the Treasury Department has been the agency most aggressively pushing for a trade truce, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, led by Robert E. Lighthizer, is formally charged with overseeing the lists of Chinese goods facing tariffs.At the Group of 20 summit meeting of finance ministers in Argentina last month, Mr. Mnuchin said that he had engaged only in \u201cchitchat\u201d with his Chinese counterparts and that the ball was in China\u2019s court to initiate a breakthrough.\u201cThis looks like it will be a waste of time for the two govts,\u201d Scott Kennedy, the director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on Twitter. \u201cWho thinks US Treasury Dept is empowered to make THE deal to end the trade war?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reclaiming Patriotism for the Left ", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurrendering national pride to champions of a blood-and-soil vision abdicates the fight for the soul and meaning of the American project. Mr. Cowie is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Great Exception: The New Deal and the Limits of American Politics.\u201dThe resurgence of blood-and-soil nationalism around the world seems to prove that appeals to nationhood are too racist, too tribal and too dangerous to be of value. Yet surrendering patriotism to champions of the ethno-state abdicates the fight for the soul and meaning of the American project. The American left, from the center of the Democratic Party to its insurgent challengers, needs a dose of national vision. One of the core lessons of Trumpian politics is that Americans are starved for a meaningful politics of what it means to be American. Getting rid of the vainglorious Trump administration is only a partial solution. The causes of his rise remain.In recent decades, progressive forces in the United States have split between two positions, both of which surrender a robust and hopeful sense of national citizenship. On one track can be found a cosmopolitan economic elite that embrace a multicultural world order shaped largely by the politics of corporate globalization. On the other track are radical critics of the racism and imperialism of the American state who often support local community and transnational solidarity but maintain a deep cynicism, even despair, about the American project. Both groups have abdicated the national story to their shared political enemies. What remains is a fervent hybrid of nationalism and anti-statism, an echo of the rebel yell. Globalization has further complicated the problem. In a dizzying world of oppressive economic and political inequality, global trade, immigration and technological disruption, voters seek grounding not in technocratic detail but in place, in time, in tradition and, above all, in the shared fate, history and meaning of the nation. The unhealed wounds of the 2008 financial crisis may have laid the way for Donald Trump, but the full mosaic of the American working class has long been looking desperately for routes to make America great again. As globalization expanded, it pounded foreign cars with sledge hammers, sponsored protective tariffs, promoted \u201cBuy American\u201d campaigns, tried to defeat Nafta, tried to organize unions and fought against undocumented migrant labor. But the plants closed anyway, domestic and foreign capital moved around, mass migrations happened, attacks on worker protections proceeded at a relentless pace, and the increasingly complicated world of national politics seemed more focused on Davos than Peoria. The nation is the only \u201cimagined community,\u201d as Benedict Anderson put, where everything from mass transit to health care to wealth distribution to a green economy can find traction. A rejuvenated national vision would transcend the backward-looking \u2014 and often reactionary \u2014 search for an America in arrested decay that has too often informed politics since Ronald Reagan first promised to make America great again.To be sure, the rhetoric of nationalism can be dangerous in a place with a history of settler colonialism, slavery, anti-immigrant hysteria and territorial expansion. Any civic framing risks fomenting exclusion by drawing lines between those who are in and those who are out \u2014 an especially profound problem in an era of mass migration. Yet when the American left abandons any vision of social patriotism because of the racist ugliness it has come to symbolize, it concedes the American story to the voices of exclusion and avarice. Patriotism may well be the last refuge of the scoundrel, but as a pragmatist like Mr. Rorty would tell you, it is too powerful and too important to leave to the scoundrels. Voters are in search of a place of vision for average Americans, a place of idealism in an age of cynicism, a place of unity in a time of fracture and a place where policy can be embedded in something greater than technocracy. While commentators are getting worked up over the revival of \u201csocialism,\u201d an increasing number of insurgent blue-collar Democrats across the country are looking to recapture a sense of nation. The dark-horse candidate from Kansas, the Army veteran James Thompson, for instance, promises to \u201cFight for America.\u201d As we approach midterm elections, we urgently need to hear these messages in good faith and rise to their challenge.

{"Headline": "Can DACA Survive Its Latest Legal Attack in Texas?", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration plunged thousands of migrant children into a frantic limbo this summer when it separated them from their parents in a bid to deter illegal immigration on the southwest border, igniting weeks of protest and litigation.But the chaos has obscured a much longer-running dispute over the future of another group of unauthorized immigrants: the nearly 700,000 young people who were brought to the United States as children by their parents, and who received temporary permission to live and work in the country through the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.A federal judge in Texas heard arguments on Wednesday in a bid by Texas and eight other states to end the program, which they say went beyond President Barack Obama\u2019s authority and imposed a heavy financial burden on states saddled with the costs of illegal immigration.Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Federal District Court in Houston did not say when he would rule, and a host of questions \u2014 legal, political and economic \u2014 continue to swirl around one of the few significant immigration initiatives the federal government has advanced in recent years.Where do President Trump and Congress stand on the program?The impasse has left DACA hobbled but alive, and its participants \u2014 many of whom were able to start driving legally, go to college and find jobs thanks to their temporary permits \u2014 mired in uncertainty.What\u2019s the status of DACA at the moment?A resolution to the standoff is unlikely to come anytime soon. That is because several federal courts weighing the program\u2019s future appear to be on conflicting paths, and unless Congress comes through, only the Supreme Court will ultimately be able to resolve the issue.There are several simultaneous lawsuits centered on DACA, including one in California, one in New York, one in Washington and one in Texas. Federal judges in California and New York have ordered the Trump administration to allow people who already have temporary legal status under DACA to apply for two-year renewals on their work permits, just as they would have been able to do before the administration ended the program. The government is complying with those orders, accepting and processing renewals, but it has appealed the decisions to higher courts.What happened this week in the Texas case?In Wednesday\u2019s court hearing, lawyers for Texas said that the judge should issue a preliminary injunction ending the program. (The Trump administration refused to defend the program against Texas\u2019 lawsuit, leaving the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund to intervene on behalf of 22 DACA recipients.)Texas is arguing that DACA is little different from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, and therefore deserves the same treatment from Judge Hanen. But lawyers for Maldef pointed out one big difference: DACA, unlike DAPA, has already been in effect for years, they argued in court, and Texas has not been able to show that the program has harmed the state.\u201cTexas was not able to point to evidence that DACA recipients are costing the state anything, and in fact the evidence in the case is that by being able to work and live and participate in civic society and the economy, that Texas over all is better with DACA recipients,\u201d said Nina Perales, the group\u2019s lawyer.But Todd Lawrence Disher, the Texas special counsel, said in court, \u201cNo amount of economic activity makes lawful what is otherwise unlawful.\u201dWhat does the future hold for the program?There is more uncertainty ahead.If Judge Hanen does issue an injunction forcing the government to freeze DACA, it could set up a clash between his ruling and those of the three other judges: The Trump administration could be under conflicting orders to end the program; to resurrect the program and allow new applications; and to keep the program but only for those already enrolled, allowing them to renew their two-year work permits. An appeals court is already considering the California case, and Judge Hanen\u2019s ruling, whatever it is, will probably be appealed to another appeals court. But those two appeals courts could rule differently.The Supreme Court tends to step in to referee when appellate courts disagree, but a full decision might not happen until next summer. The court could issue an emergency ruling before then, but with the court down to eight justices for the moment, the possibility of a 4-4 deadlock appears strong.If Judge Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed as the court\u2019s ninth justice, DACA seems unlikely to survive a full Supreme Court vote.Absent guidance from a higher court, officials may be left to decide how to interpret the welter of legal decisions on their own.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say how this plays out,\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, Maldef\u2019s president and general counsel, \u201cexcept that ultimately the conflict would have to be resolved at a higher level in the court system.\u201dWhat are DACA recipients doing right now?For all the sound and fury of the court battles, recipients could end up in much the same place they were last September: staring down the eventual end of the program. Every month or two has brought a jolt of hope or disappointment; confusion about whether renewals or new applications will be allowed is widespread.What is certain is that those with DACA status can currently apply for a two-year renewal at any time, regardless of when their current permit expires. Advocacy groups have been advising everyone who is eligible to renew as soon as possible so that they can hold onto their status for a little while longer, even if the program is canceled. They say it is especially urgent for people whose permissions expire before 2020 to renew, since the permits are only good for two years.\u201cThere\u2019s a door that is slowly closing, and we\u2019re trying to push as many eligible DACA recipients through that door to renew and hold onto work permits and protections while they can,\u201d said Sanaa Abrar, the advocacy director for United We Dream, a group that represents young immigrants brought to the country as children who lack full legal status.But many people who are eligible to renew cannot afford the $495 processing fee. Advocates are raising money to help cover those costs; United We Dream has raised $1.4 million in the past 10 months, Ms. Abrar said.\u201cDACA has not only allowed me to remain in the country that I have called home since I was 2 years old,\u201d Karla Perez, a 25-year-old law school graduate and DACA recipient involved in the Texas lawsuit, said after Wednesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cIt has allowed me to thrive.\u201dPaul DeBenedetto contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Technology That\u2019s Disrupting Our Jobs", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe insecure nature of work is a result of decisions by corporations and policymakers.Mr. Hyman is an economic historian.When we learn about the Industrial Revolution in school, we hear a lot about factories, steam engines, maybe the power loom. We are taught that technological innovation drove social change and radically reshaped the world of work. Likewise, when we talk about today\u2019s economy, we focus on smartphones, artificial intelligence, apps. Here, too, the inexorable march of technology is thought to be responsible for disrupting traditional work, phasing out the employee with a regular wage or salary and phasing in independent contractors, consultants, temps and freelancers \u2014 the so-called gig economy.This insight is crucial for anyone concerned about the insecurity and other shortcomings of the gig economy. For it reminds us that far from being an unavoidable consequence of technological progress, the nature of work always remains a matter of social choice. It is not a result of an algorithm; it is a collection of decisions by corporations and policymakers. Consider the Industrial Revolution. Well before it took place, in the 19th century, another revolution in work occurred in the 18th century, which historians call the \u201cindustrious revolution.\u201d Before this revolution, people worked where they lived, perhaps at a farm or a shop. The manufacturing of textiles, for example, relied on networks of independent farmers who spun fibers and wove cloth. They worked on their own; they were not employees.In the industrious revolution, however, manufacturers gathered workers under one roof, where the labor could be divided and supervised. For the first time on a large scale, home life and work life were separated. People no longer controlled how they worked, and they received a wage instead of sharing directly in the profits of their efforts.This was a necessary precondition for the Industrial Revolution. While factory technology would consolidate this development, the creation of factory technology was possible only because people\u2019s relationship to work had already changed. A power loom would have served no purpose for networks of farmers making cloth at home.The same goes for today\u2019s digital revolution. While often described as a second machine age, our current historical moment is better understood as a second industrious revolution. It has been underway for at least 40 years, encompassing the collapse, since the 1970s, of the relatively secure wage-work economy of the postwar era \u2014 and the rise of post-industrialism and the service economy.Over these four decades we have seen an increase in the use of day laborers, office temps, management consultants, contract assemblers, adjunct professors, Blackwater mercenaries and every other kind of worker filing an I.R.S. form 1099. These jobs span the income ranks, but they share what all work seems to have in common in the post-1970s economy: They are temporary and insecure.In the last 10 years, 94 percent of net new jobs have appeared outside of traditional employment. Already approximately one-third of workers, and half of young workers, participate in this alternative world of work, either as a primary or a supplementary source of income.Internet technologies have certainly intensified this development (even though most freelancers remain offline). But services like Uber and online freelance markets like TaskRabbit were created to take advantage of an already independent work force; they are not creating it. Their technology is solving the business and consumer problems of an already insecure work world. Uber is a symptom, not a cause.It\u2019s worth stressing that the \u201ctechnology\u201d of temp work \u2014 and the possibility of replacing entire work forces with it \u2014 existed for years before corporations made the decision to start adopting it. Today\u2019s smartphone app is an easy way to hire a temp, but is it really that much easier than picking up a phone was in 1950?Indeed, shortly after World War II, a Milwaukee man named Elmer Winter founded Manpower, the first major temp agency, to supply emergency secretaries. But by the end of the \u201950s, Winter had concluded that the future growth of Manpower was in replacing entire work forces. He was uniquely positioned to teach corporate America how to reduce its work forces, since nearly all of the Fortune 500 companies used his services, and he tried to do so.But persuading companies to abandon how they operated was easier said than done, even though Winter could readily demonstrate that it would be cheaper. Few companies took him up on his offer. Higher profits were possible, but not as important, in the lingering wake of the Great Depression, as the moral compact between employer and employee. What changed this? The emergence in the 1970s of a new, strictly financial view of corporations, a philosophy that favored stock and bond prices over production, of short-term gains over long-term investment. Theories of \u201clean\u201d corporate organization became popular, especially those sold by management consultants and business gurus.Big corporations had always had their critics, but no one before the \u201970s would have thought that smaller companies would be better run than large ones. Large companies had resources, economies of scale, professional managers, lots of options. Yet terms like \u201csmall\u201d and \u201cefficient\u201d and \u201cflexible\u201d would come to seem like synonyms. And with the rise of the lean corporation, work forces became expendable and jobs more precarious.I am neither for nor against temping (or consulting, or freelancing). If this emergent flexible economy were all bad or all good, there would be no need to make a choice about it. For some, the rise of the gig economy represents liberation from the stifled world of corporate America.But for the vast majority of workers, the \u201cfreedom\u201d of the gig economy is just the freedom to be afraid. It is the severing of obligations between businesses and employees. It is the collapse of the protections that the people of the United States, in our laws and our customs, once fought hard to enshrine.We can\u2019t turn back the clock, but neither is job insecurity inevitable.

The village, which is home to excellent hikes, a bucolic Main Street and scads of suburban charm, is also a launch site for some awesome kayak tours of the Hudson, including to Pollepel Island and other notable sites.But the Pollepel story is the kicker. Starting in the 1800s, a New Yorker named Francis Bannerman collected and sold surplus military equipment. A lot of it. When Bannerman\u2019s collection, which included explosive black gunpowder, became too unsafe to store in the city, he bought Pollepel Island and constructed the castle to store his supply. And with a facade reading \u201cBannerman\u2019s Island Arsenal,\u201d then clearly visible from the train, the castle functioned as an advertisement for his wares.

Erected in 1863 and opened as a museum in 1992, the building at 97 Orchard Street shares stories of its former inhabitants, mostly working-class immigrants from Russia, Ireland and Germany from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, through tours in and around their reproduced living spaces.The tours, as conversational as they are informational, are led by educators who invite visitors to chime in with questions or stories about their own histories of immigration. As a result, each tour is unique, offering an opportunity to connect with strangers over a salient issue.A gregarious guide named Daryl recently led a gaggle of tourists (and me) on such a tour, one that started walking up an outdoor stairway, past a set of recreated outhouses and ultimately through a peeling hallway and into a cramped apartment.There we met 14-year-old Victoria Confino (or the actor portraying her), one of several children in a family of Sephardic Jews from Kastoria (then a part of Turkey and now Greece) who lived at 97 Orchard.Victoria was aflutter inside the three-room, 10-person apartment, restored to its 1916 trappings, showing us her books and spices, and answering questions about where she shopped, worked, played and studied (\u201ckindergarten at age 11, blech\u201d).Before and after our encounter with Victoria, Daryl (an institution at the museum, I hear) prompted us to imagine what the Confinos\u2019 lives might have been like: How did it smell on the boat to New York? As a Sephardic family, how much or how little might the Confinos have had in common with Russian Jews in the city?And he filled us in on the Confino story after 1916: The family later moved to Spanish Harlem, Victoria\u2019s son went on to work for NASA, and, more recently, her surviving family has helped to build her story at the museum.In our city, history is very much alive.Tejal\u2019s Before and After: RestaurantsTejal\u2019s Before and After: BarsNearbyRequired ReadingExtra ExtraFrom You\u201cI am 60 years old and walk from the subway to the Queens Museum and Socrates Sculpture Park.

{"Headline": "At Florida Rally, Trump Boasts About the Economy and Takes Aim at Usual Targets", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 President Trump brought a message of a booming economy with him to Central Florida on Tuesday evening. He boasted about his administration\u2019s economic accomplishments at an event at a local high school, where a supporter cheerily praised him as \u201cthe best president.\u201d And he signed a piece of work force legislation, holding up a scrawled piece of paper for all to see.But the tone changed when Mr. Trump traveled to a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rally at a fairground auditorium in Tampa.\u201cThose people,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his perceived detractors, \u201chow they have gotten us wrong. And yet on Election Day, people were asking, \u2018Where did these people come from?\u2019\u201dMr. Trump, a former campaign firebrand, is happiest out on the trail reiterating the divisive messaging that won him the presidency. So on Tuesday, between promoting healthy job numbers and the low unemployment rate, he spent a significant amount of time riling up the crowd by drawing a firm divide between the people who support him and everyone else.In a freewheeling speech, Mr. Trump defended his hard-line stance on immigration, calling for voter ID laws just before inexplicably bragging about saving \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d as a holiday greeting. And he railed repeatedly at the news media for, among other perceived sins, dinging him for not acting presidential. \u201cI can be more presidential than any president in history except for maybe Abe Lincoln with the big hat,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI admit it, Abe Lincoln is tough.\u201dMr. Trump called the Iran nuclear deal he pulled out of this year a \u201chorror show\u201d and, referring to a comment he made on Monday about meeting with the Iranian president, said he had a \u201cfeeling they\u2019ll be talking to us pretty soon, and maybe not, but that\u2019s O.K., too.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s other usual targets included congressional Democrats, who were painted as legislative obstructionists \u201cwho will do anything they can to not help the Trump agenda,\u201d including rejecting Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court; the news media, which he repeatedly disparaged as \u201cfake news\u201d on a m\u00e9lange of topics; and even protesters, including four women who were escorted out, middle fingers raised, for demonstrating against the administration\u2019s immigration policies.\u201cToo bad,\u201d Mr. Trump said as the women left. He then turned his focus to journalists, who he said would exaggerate the protests as \u201cmassive.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you think they\u2019d get tired of these speeches, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly called journalists \u201cthe enemy of the people,\u201d said as he focused on rows of reporters covering the rally in the back of the auditorium. \u201cLook how many they have back there. They just can\u2019t get enough.\u201dThe president, who has found solace in his base of supporters in recent weeks \u2014 particularly after a widely criticized news conference with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland \u2014 brought two of his adult children, Ivanka and Eric, with him to Florida. (He said the first lady, Melania Trump, was watching the rally from home.) Mr. Trump also thanked the former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, \u201ctwo fighters\u201d who had traveled with him in the motorcade.Several Trump loyalists holding office or running for it were also rewarded with kind words, and a ride on Air Force One. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who traveled with the president alongside the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, was given a shout out at the rally.Earlier, the president called Mr. Gaetz over to greet supporters just after Air Force One landed in Tampa, and praised his TV presence at the work force development event.\u201cYou ever watch this guy on television?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd at the high school, some of them former students. \u201cHe\u2019s like a machine.\u201d\u201cI appreciate your support, Mr. President,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said from the stage, \u201cbut I appreciate more the leadership you\u2019re showing for our great country.\u201dEven when it came to his administration\u2019s achievements, Mr. Trump at times struck an inexplicably defiant tone. \u201cSorry about this, women,\u201d the president said to his female supporters, \u201cbut the unemployment rate has reached the lowest unemployment level in only 65 years.\u201d\u201cOur farmers are true patriots,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause China and others have targeted our farmers. You know what our farmers are saying? \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we can take it.\u2019\u201dAnd for extra measure, Mr. Trump promoted his status as a political outsider, telling the crowd that he had visited Washington only 17 times before running for president \u2014 mostly to visit the hotel he was building on Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cI ran for president with no experience and I won,\u201d Mr. Trump said, apparently in a reflective mood. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anybody in Washington, but now I know everybody in Washington.\u201dThe president paused.\u201cI know the wonderful people,\u201d he added, \u201cand I know the scum.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Brief History of Bull Markets, From Postwar Boom to Housing Bust", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market rally that kicked off more than nine years ago during the financial crisis is now arguably the longest on record in the United States.* The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has marched steadily higher for 3,453 days. Since bottoming out on March 9, 2009, it is up more than 320 percent. Investors have enjoyed 11 bull markets \u2014 defined as a period without a pullback of 20 percent or more \u2014 since the end of World War II. Usually driven by a strengthening economy that fuels corporate profits, bull markets often end in recession after the Federal Reserve begins to raise rates to slow rising prices and cool the economy.Here\u2019s a look at the five other longest bull markets of the past 70 years.June 1949 to August 1956GAIN: 267%In 1956, the Fed, concerned about inflation, raised interest rates. The economy cooled, and the bull market ended. The Suez Crisis and the Hungarian Revolution would help drive stocks into a bear market. But that didn\u2019t last long \u2014 the bull returned in 1957.October 1974 to November 1980GAIN: 126%The bull market of the second half of the 1970s didn\u2019t charge so much as limp.But inflation remained high, robbing investors of much of their returns. In 1979, a tough new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, finally moved to tame inflation. He raised interest rates to historically high levels, ending the bull market and helping to cause a brief recession in the early 1980s.August 1982 to August 1987GAIN: 229%Not every bull market ends in a recession. Falling interest rates, a strong economy, and a flurry of corporate mergers and public offerings fueled a bull market and the excesses of 1980s Wall Street. Even so, there were mounting concerns heading into fall 1987: The rally had pushed valuations to high levels, and the Fed, again worried about inflation, had begun to raise interest rates. Geopolitical events centered in the Persian Gulf and concerns about the trade deficit only added to investors\u2019 jitters.Then, on Oct. 19, 1987, a day that became known as Black Monday, stocks tumbled more than 20 percent. When the selling began, it was exacerbated by computerized trading, then still in its infancy, without the so-called circuit breakers that would now halt trading during such a plunge. It remains the worst one-day crash in history by percentage.As dark a moment as it was, the United States economy continued to grow for nearly three more years.October 1990 to March 2000GAIN: 417%Few thought in 1990 that stocks were about to embark on one of the most remarkable rallies ever. The economy was sluggish, banks were saddled with bad loans and Iraq had recently invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States and its allies to send forces to the Middle East. On the day the stock market began its recovery, The New York Times quoted an analyst saying that the bear market had not run its course and that any recovery in the next couple of months would be \u201ca temporary respite in a major downtrend.\u201d Within months, though, Iraq had been expelled from Kuwait, and the economy had entered a period of strong and stable growth. Corporate profits ballooned, and retail investors rushed into the market. Finally, toward the end of the decade, investors\u2019 optimism morphed into the sort of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman at the time, had described a few years earlier. The Fed, hoping to slow inflation, and perhaps to cool the stock market, began raising interest rates. But a series of increases were slow to quell investor enthusiasm, and the tech bubble continued to inflate \u2014 until, eventually, it burst. October 2002 to October 2007GAIN: 102%After the dot-com crash in 2000, the Fed slashed interest rates and borrowing took off \u2014 including among home buyers with subprime credit. Complex financial products \u2014 like the collateralized debt obligations into which those mortgages were packaged \u2014 soared. The balance sheets, profits and share prices of the banks that created and traded these products swelled. By 2006, the financial sector was the largest in the S.&P. 500. But as the economy took off, the Fed began to raise the historically low interest rates. Now the borrowed money was more expensive to pay back, and defaults climbed. By the time stocks peaked in October 2007, the era of easy lending was over and banks were taking huge losses. By December, the economy had fallen into recession, and the next summer stocks entered a bear market. By October 2008, some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest financial institutions had collapsed and the federal government had begun the bailout that helped set off the current bull market.Advertisement"}

Updated Aug. 23, 2018WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s trade war with China is about to hit home for many consumers. On Thursday, the administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products, bringing the total so far to $50 billion. Officials are now weighing a 25 percent tariff on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, including materials used in many of the consumer products that were spared in the first round.Whether you\u2019re a college student, a parent, an entrepreneur, an outdoor enthusiast or a retiree, the tariffs could ultimately affect the products you covet. Here are some of the items that the tariffs could hit and that are being discussed at the hearings, which wrap up on Aug. 27: \u2014 Written testimony of Robert Burns, TrekNo matter your brand preference, the bike you buy in America is most likely made in part or sourced entirely in China. More than 90 percent of complete bikes are sourced from China, and at least 40 percent of imported bike components come from that country. \u2014 Written testimony of John Hoge, Sea Eagle BoatsMany recreational vehicles like boats and trailers rely on Chinese components that the administration has included on its tariff list.

Several companies testifying this week say the tariffs will drive up prices, making safety products like car seats too expensive for low-income families.  \u2014 Written statement provided to the trade representative by the American Down and Feather CouncilIn 2017, American companies imported 16.4 million kilos of feathers and down. Most of that came from China, whose population is among the biggest consumers of duck and produces approximately 80 percent of the world\u2019s duck and goose feathers. \u2014 Testimony of David Mathison, Leather MiraclesFurniture manufacturers are among the companies that would face tariffs on the materials they import from China, including leather, wood, metal and other components that they rely on for their products. Companies like Leather Miracles, which employs 50 people in North Carolina, say there is no alternate source for the materials they need to continue manufacturing their products and remain in business.\u2014 Written request to testify on behalf of David Stephenson, SharkNinjaFrom vacuums to blenders to French door refrigerators, the appliances we use every day often come from China.

{"Headline": "Trump Put a Low Cost on Carbon Emissions. Here\u2019s Why It Matters.", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen federal agencies calculate the costs and benefits of climate regulations, they use a figure called the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d an estimate of the harm caused by releasing more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and increasing global warming. So how did the Trump administration conclude that global warming will be much less costly than the Obama administration assumed?First, the Environmental Protection Agency focused solely on damages from climate change that would occur within the borders of the United States rather than across the entire globe. Second, they used calculations that put less weight on the harm climate change could inflict on future generations. Trump officials contend that their carbon approach better reflects the way the government has traditionally done cost-benefit analyses. Critics argue that this approach is inappropriate for global, multigenerational problems like climate change, and that newer research suggests the social cost of carbon may be even higher than the Obama administration estimated, not much lower. Ultimately, the courts could decide which view prevails. \u201cThis will be part of the legal challenges to these regulatory rollbacks,\u201d said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. \u201cThe reasons for why the Trump administration picked these numbers for the social cost of carbon are going to be scrutinized.\u201dIn 2009, the Obama administration brought 12 federal agencies together to hash out a best estimate of the social cost of carbon. They based their answer on three widely used academic models that tried to quantify the harm to things like human health and coastal property as heat waves increased and sea-levels rose. First, the E.P.A. took the Obama-era models and focused solely on damages that occurred within the borders of the United States, rather than looking at harm to other countries as well. That change alone reduced the social cost of carbon estimate to around $7 per ton. Critics counter that this approach overlooks two key points. First, many of those climate impacts in other countries could indirectly hurt the United States, say, by roiling the global economy or by increasing the number of refugees. Second, climate change can only be solved by all countries working together. If the United States refused to consider the impacts of its emissions on other countries, other countries could respond in kind.\u201cThe United States is only 14 percent of global emissions, which means that 86 percent of the damages we face will be caused by emissions from other countries,\u201d said Richard G. Newell, president of Resources for the Future, an environmental economics think tank. \u201cIf we took this domestic-only approach to its logical conclusion, that means other countries should not worry about their impacts on us.\u201dThe discount rate is how economists value costs and benefits across time. People tend to value a dollar today more than a dollar in the future (a dollar today could be invested in the stock market and gain value, for example). The question is how much that future dollar should be discounted. A higher discount rate implies we shouldn\u2019t pay as much today to avoid harms far in the future, which, in turn, produces a lower social cost of carbon.\u201cIf you use a rate above 5 percent, you\u2019re essentially saying that we shouldn\u2019t worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now,\u201d said Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland. The Obama administration opted for lower rates of 2.5 percent, 3 percent, and 5 percent when thinking about climate change. But the Trump administration has returned to the practice of using 3 percent and 7 percent. That higher rate further reduces the social cost of carbon down to $1 per ton.Most experts agree that the social cost of carbon can be improved by taking into account newer scientific and economic research. \u201cThere\u2019s been an explosion of research on the impacts of climate change in recent years, and it hasn\u2019t been fully reflected in the estimates,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the University of Chicago who helped craft the Obama administration\u2019s original numbers.Whatever number the Trump administration ultimately comes up with, they will have to defend it in court. Once the proposed rollbacks of vehicle and power plant rules are finalized, environmental groups and states like California plan to sue, including on the process that the administration used to tally costs and benefits.\u201cTypically, an agency gets some latitude to set standards a bit more or less stringently,\u201d said Jody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School. \u201cBut if you can show the agency to be glaringly wrong in its analysis \u2014 they ignore obvious counterarguments, they cherry-pick the data to support their outcome, they make numbers up \u2014 you can get a court to strike the standards down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Few know what\u2019s going on there, including sometimes other government ministries.\u201dThe bigger question is whether Prince Mohammed will need to curb his economic ambitions. He wants to create a $500 billion megacity, and he\u2019s waging a trade war with Canada. If his kingdom is facing financial constraints, he may need to take a humbler approach.Tribune cited \u201cunnecessarily aggressive and protracted negotiations\u201d with government regulators.

If not, he could be in trouble for manipulating the carmaker\u2019s stock price. (As of this morning, he has produced no evidence of funding.)The S.E.C. was already looking into Tesla over its manufacturing and sales projections, which could have misled investors and inflated the company\u2019s value.Why bother? The World Bank says it could \u201chelp simplify raising capital and trading securities; improve operational efficiencies; and enhance regulatory oversight.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how big the bond offering will be, which means this could be more experiment than breakthrough.Owning more than 8 percent of the company\u2019s stock, the two argue that Campbell has struggled to diversify its products as customers flock to healthier offerings, and that the company should be sold.Here\u2019s one suggestion:All countries should tax both property and inheritance more. These taxes are unpopular but mostly efficient. In a world where property ownership brings windfalls that persist across generations, such taxes are desirable. A conservative first step would be to roll back recent cuts to inheritance tax. A more radical approach would be to introduce a land-value tax, the most efficient of all property taxes and one with a long liberal heritage.And a second:To stop companies shifting profits, governments should switch their focus from firms to investors. Profits ultimately flow to shareholders as dividends and buybacks. But few people are likely to emigrate to avoid taxes on their investment income.DealsPolitics and policyTechTradeBest of the restAdvertisement"}

The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the girl, Ziyanda Nkosi, a 6-year-old first grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.\u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former math teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress and was positioning himself to become South Africa\u2019s deputy president.One of the party\u2019s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. A.N.C. leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school, and Mr. Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the A.N.C., the education system has been in shambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda\u2019s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local A.N.C. leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mr. Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents \u2014 and for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mr. Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the A.N.C. tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mr. Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire A.N.C., launching him into an even more prominent post \u2014 as South Africa\u2019s deputy president, second only to the nation\u2019s leader.Mr. Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the A.N.C. is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mr. Mandela\u2019s legacy. After all, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country\u2019s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mr. Mabuza\u2019s spectacular climb, current and former A.N.C. officials say: He siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.\u201cHe didn\u2019t become what he is now because of his political capability,\u201d said Fish Mahlalela, a senior A.N.C. figure in the province and a national lawmaker.\u201cNo, no, it was out of money and the manipulation,\u201d he added. \u201cNothing else.\u201dBut to seal his new post, Mr. Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mr. Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa\u2019s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mr. Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Mr. Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country\u2019s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mr. Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the \u201ctragedies that take away the innocence of our children.\u201dHe spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a 5-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of feces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolizing the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.Yet under Mr. Mabuza\u2019s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required, and school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mr. Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to A.N.C. officials, high-ranking defectors and anticorruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled, for unexplained reasons, to $30 million each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province also became known as one of South Africa\u2019s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the A.N.C., were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new A.N.C. members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the A.N.C.\u2019s second-biggest voting bloc. Under the party\u2019s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, with a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s role as the second-most powerful politician in the country casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its bold assertions that the A.N.C. is turning the page on corruption.But the nation\u2019s poor schools are perhaps the A.N.C.\u2019s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans \u2014 some of whom have turned to burning down schools in protest.Mr. Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile; he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.But the schools also offered him a rich political opportunity, officials say. Education represents about half of provincial budgets, followed by health. Officials from the National Treasury recently warned in a parliamentary hearing that misspending and mismanagement in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province were especially rampant in those two departments.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: The new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration\u2019s future \u2014 as well as the country\u2019s \u2014 rests in the hands of Mr. Mabuza.\u201cIf there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa\u2019s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, the author of \u201cRamaphosa\u2019s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?\u201d\u201cWe are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.\u201dThe numbers just didn\u2019t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mr. Mabuza got his first big break: He became Mpumalanga\u2019s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The son of farmers, Mr. Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalled Reginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.A bright student, Mr. Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught math at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers\u2019 association.\u201cThe teachers were at the center\u201d of the movement, said Sandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mr. Mabuza into the main student organization. Mr. Mabuza quickly stood out, he said, traveling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.\u201cHe was a leader in his own right,\u201d Mr. Sukati said.But after apartheid ended, Mr. Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province\u2019s first big scandal of the democratic era.Mr. Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful A.N.C. leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former A.N.C. officials said.\u201cI am in a tight situation,\u201d Mr. Mabuza told some of the teachers, recalled Mr. Sukati, who worked under Mr. Mabuza at the education department.The next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 percent \u2014 an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to No. 2 among the nation\u2019s nine provinces.\u201cI was suspicious,\u201d said Mr. Sukati, who is now a senior education official. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t just happen like that.\u201dA whistle-blower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, the authorities announced, was under 53 percent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mr. Mabuza\u2019s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired, current and former A.N.C. officials said.An investigation was never completed. Mr. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the A.N.C. across South Africa, current and former party officials say.\u201cI think, the man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don\u2019t know what went wrong,\u201d said Ronnie Malomane, an A.N.C. official who was taught math by Mr. Mabuza in the early 1980s. \u201cThey were just giving him position after position.\u201dNationally, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Mr. Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mr. Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move \u2014 called the \u201cRapid Implementation Unit\u201d \u2014 as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.\u201cThat\u2019s how he managed to loot,\u201d said Collen Sedibe, a former A.N.C. leader who grew up on the same street as Mr. Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures \u201cincurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier.\u201dBut parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.\u201cWe are teaching because we have to teach, but proper teaching and learning is not taking place,\u201d said Bernard Shakwana, a teacher at Ziyanda\u2019s school, Mpumelelo Primary. Last year, he tried teaching the 60 students in his class under a tree because deep cracks in the school walls and floors suggested that the building might collapse.Tifonto Masuku, who taught at the school for 35 years, said she retired early because the conditions had become unbearable. The quality of education had suffered so much that she considered it even worse than under apartheid.\u201cAll this is because of the A.N.C.,\u201d Ms. Masuku said. She now runs a butcher shop.It took four days of rage before the local A.N.C. councilor showed up.The councilor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: He is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.He certainly understood the parents\u2019 anger, he said. During the 1980s, he walked more than six miles a day to school, skipping bus fare to save enough money to eat.But these days, he said, most students graduate without a command of the English language, dooming their job prospects.\u201cThe foundation before was better,\u201d he said of the quality of education in the province.By the time he got to Ziyanda\u2019s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the A.N.C.\u2019s leaders.Mr. Siboza made sure to bring a gun.Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he said. \u201cYou must stay with him,\u201d he said of his gun.The A.N.C. has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mr. Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the A.N.C. as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several A.N.C. officials said, Mr. Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the A.N.C. ensures its dominance.But Ms. Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mr. Mabuza, rejected any suggestion that the A.N.C. had failed to prioritize education.Before becoming deputy foreign minister, she served as Mr. Mabuza\u2019s education minister in the province for nearly a decade. The A.N.C., she said, had built schools in every corner of the country, making education accessible to all. The government gives students meals, books and, to the poorest, free education. It also issues monthly grants to children, pensions to the elderly and free houses to many, she said.She dismissed the argument that education had been as good, or better, during apartheid, calling it a false depiction of the nation\u2019s brutal past.\u201cIf you know the Bible, the story of the Egyptians moving from Egypt to Canaan, when they were faced with the Red Sea, they said, \u2018Why did you take us out of Egypt? It was good there,\u2019\u201d she said.Officials like Ms. Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Mr. Siboza, the local A.N.C. councilor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.\u201cThey wanted to kill me,\u201d the councilor said.Mr. Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun \u2014 firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. \u201cThis man is a church member,\u201d he said.A few days later, the A.N.C. councilor visited the children he had wounded.\u201cThe councilor said he was very sorry,\u201d said the girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councilor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she said. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy\u2019s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councilor, about $150.The boy\u2019s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplored the state of education.\u201cThey promise,\u201d she said, \u201cand they just disappear.\u201dStill, she would remain loyal to the governing party.\u201cYes, of course, I vote A.N.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our freedom.\u201dThe protests spilled into September, but the country\u2019s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Mr. Zuma as South Africa\u2019s president.The all-important A.N.C. party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the A.N.C. released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mr. Mabuza: His previously low-ranking province was now the A.N.C.\u2019s second-most powerful.Mr. Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, A.N.C. membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 percent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 percent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga\u2019s explosive growth.But Mr. Mabuza\u2019s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former A.N.C. officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money \u2014 with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that \u201cirregular expenditures\u201d more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, A.N.C. officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students\u2019 expense.As premier, Mr. Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11 million to around $30 million.Asked whether Mr. Mabuza wanted the mega schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Ms. Mhaule, his former education minister, laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dBut other officials say the mega schools were overpriced projects to reward Mr. Mabuza\u2019s allies and finance his A.N.C. membership drive.Mr. Mabuza \u201cdecided that they\u2019re going to build mega schools because that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d said Mr. Mahlalela, the senior A.N.C. official. \u201cThese small schools where there\u2019s a crisis of 16 toilets, it\u2019s not a big sum of money. So it\u2019s not easy to steal.\u201dWith the money Mr. Mabuza amassed, current and former A.N.C. officials said, his operatives signed up supporters by providing jobs, money or even just lunch, illegally inflating the party\u2019s membership rolls by paying people\u2019s annual dues with government money.Mr. Malomane, the A.N.C. official who learned math from Mr. Mabuza in high school, said his former teacher used other tricks to exaggerate the ranks of party loyalists, like \u201ccloning,\u201d in which one person appeared on several party membership rolls at once.On Mr. Mabuza\u2019s farm in Barberton, south of the provincial capital, his power was on full display, current and former A.N.C. officials said. He received contractors and took his cut before projects were awarded, they said. Those who refused to participate often faced exile.Mr. Sedibe, his former ally, recounted how young party workers went to the farm for wads of cash from Mr. Mabuza \u2014 often about $750 \u2014 to wage his recruitment drive.\u201cHe always had money in his house,\u201d said Mr. Sedibe, who is now an opposition leader.\u201cI\u2019m here to serve South Africans,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s give this government a chance.\u201dHe beamed: He now served under President Ramaphosa, who had served under President Zuma, who had served under President Thabo Mbeki, who had served under President Mandela. All of them, except for Mr. Mandela, were forced out by their successors.Asked whether Mr. Mabuza would lead the nation one day, Ms. Mhaule, his former education minister, sounded confident.\u201cHe may,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will. Not he may, he will.\u201d\u201cHe is very safe with me next to him,\u201d Mr. Mabuza has said.But back in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province, the government is in trouble. The two biggest departments in the budget \u2014 education and health \u2014 are plagued by mismanagement, the National Treasury says. The health department is at risk of being taken over by the provincial treasury. Political killings have resumed.\u201cThe center does not hold anymore,\u201d said Mr. Sedibe, the former A.N.C. leader.In June, residents furious over poor government services set four schools on fire.\u201cWhere are the children going to learn?\u201d asked Sdudla Mlambo in a township called Matsulu.The night before, a fire tore through six classrooms in her granddaughter\u2019s school. Yellow tape cordoned off the site.A neighbor, Jessica Sibiya, a 17-year-old high school student, said she used to attend the school. But with Mr. Mabuza\u2019s ascent, she said with a smile, things were looking up. Surely his hour would come.\u201cI\u2019ll be happy if D.D. becomes president,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll help this province.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Leader Proposes Broad Economic Cooperation With the North", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The president of South Korea proposed a bold expansion of economic cooperation with North Korea on Wednesday, a more assertive stand than the United States has taken in offering inducements for the North to begin relinquishing its nuclear weapons.The proposal by the president, Moon Jae-in, included joint economic zones along the North-South border, a linked rail network and other steps.If implemented, they could significantly ease tensions along the world\u2019s most heavily fortified frontier, which has divided the two Koreas for more than seven decades.But Mr. Moon\u2019s proposal, dangled as a lure for the North to start denuclearizing, also raised the risk of going well beyond what his country\u2019s most important ally, the United States, is prepared to do.Despite the goal of denuclearization pledged at the June summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, Mr. Kim has taken no meaningful steps toward that goal, an increased source of friction with the United States.Mr. Moon announced his proposal during a speech commemorating National Liberation Day, the end of Japan\u2019s colonial rule over a then-unified Korea with the Allied victory in World War II. He framed the proposal as a way for both Koreas to move forward.\u201cWe must overcome division for our survival and prosperity,\u201d Mr. Moon said.\u201cEven though political unification is still far away, building a single economic community first by settling peace and freely traveling back and forth between the two Koreas will become genuine liberation for us.\u201dHe also suggested that South Korea should be a leader, not a spectator, in resolving the dispute between North Korea and the Trump administration over the North\u2019s nuclear weapons.That appeared to be a subtle but contentious shift in South Korea\u2019s role in the diplomacy around the North\u2019s nuclear weapons. The South and the United States have both said that their relations with the North will develop at roughly the same pace.But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there will be no sanctions relief on North Korea until denuclearization is complete. American officials also have said the signing of a peace treaty with North Korea to replace the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War \u2014 a basic demand of Mr. Kim\u2019s \u2014 will not happen before the North denuclearizes.But the stalemate in the U.S.-North Korea talks risks stalling the overall diplomatic momentum that Mr. Moon helped to create. Domestically, his approval ratings have slipped in recent weeks, as some of the euphoria in the South over the two summits with Mr. Kim has dissipated.For weeks, North Korea has been accusing Mr. Moon of dragging his feet on implementing the inter-Korean agreements, suggesting that he is doing so at the Americans\u2019 bidding.But if Mr. Moon carries inter-Korean relations too far without the North\u2019s denuclearization, he will contradict American policy. His conservative political opponents in South Korea have already accused him of playing into a North Korean strategy of driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington.On Wednesday, Mr. Moon said economic cooperation with the North could begin in earnest only when \u201cpeace is established on the Korean Peninsula along with complete denuclearization.\u201d But he also said he would \u201cbuild a relationship based on deeper trust between the two Koreas\u201d and \u201csimultaneously lead efforts to promote dialogue on denuclearization between North Korea and the United States.\u201dWhile the American focus in talks with the North is on nuclear weapons, South Korea has a broader agenda. Besides its interest in a lasting peace with its neighbor, the South also sees economic exchanges as a potential source of growth and jobs, with its own economy losing momentum and its youth unemployment at a record high.Since the April summit, the Koreas have discussed a variety of exchanges, including basketball games and soccer matches. They have also agreed in principle to shut down, on a trial basis, some military guard posts within the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone along the border, Mr. Moon said on Wednesday. And they plan to open a joint liaison office in Kaesong, home to the defunct factory park.Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute near Seoul, said Mr. Moon\u2019s economic vision might look \u201ctoo idealistic\u201d but that he was being far more aggressive than any of his predecessors about genuinely engaging the North.But not everyone welcomed the latest announcements. \u201cThe aspiration to resume inter-Korean projects I found counterproductive,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at Tufts University. \u201cIt will please Pyongyang, yes, but only make Washington wary. Moon\u2019s message was, \u2018Don\u2019t stand in our way as we try to resume Mount Kumgang and Kaesong.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Economic Upturn Begun Under Obama Is Now Trump\u2019s to Tout", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy nearly every standard measure, the American economy is doing well \u2014 and better than it was a year and a half ago, before Donald J. Trump was elected president. If only the debate over who deserves most of the credit were as easily judged.The same gauges that illustrate this administration\u2019s economic successes also make clear that they are built on the achievements of the previous one, and that the economy is following the upward trajectory begun under President Barack Obama.Economists are quick to point out that presidents of both parties are assigned more credit or blame than they deserve for the economy, a colossus whose course is fashioned, bit by bit, from innumerable decisions made every day by investors, consumers, managers and merchants around the globe.Even so, Mr. Trump \u2014 through a combination of skill and circumstance \u2014 has been better able than his predecessor to spotlight the economy\u2019s gains, political scientists say. And his message never varies, no matter what the numbers show: an economy that was ruinous under Mr. Obama is \u201camazing\u201d under his own leadership.At the same time, however, both presidents have had trouble transforming their economic successes into more general support. For presidents as far back as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mr. Obama is the only one whose approval ratings fell as consumer sentiment rose, said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science and communication at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author with John Sides and Michael Tesler of a coming book on the 2016 presidential campaign.And although it\u2019s still early, Mr. Trump looks to be headed in the same direction, Ms. Vavreck said. Sunnier views of the economy have so far failed to raise Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating above 50 percent.What Mr. Trump has been particularly well positioned to do, though, is identify himself with economic success. He made his name as a celebrity tycoon. \u201cIt dovetails with a narrative about Donald Trump that has existed for a long time: that he\u2019s a businessman, that he understands the working of the economy, that he knows how to make money,\u201d said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government of George Mason University in Virginia.Mr. Obama\u2019s background was in community organizing and the public sector. \u201cNo one expects such a person to have any feel for creating good economic conditions,\u201d Mr. Rozell said. \u201cHe is more likely to be seen as riding an economic wave or trend, whereas the businessman is seen as responsible.\u201dCircumstances have also provided Mr. Trump with a tailwind. He has benefited from an additional year and a half of economic growth, which compounds the perception of the economy as resilient. The nine-year expansion has endured in the face of disruptions \u2014 from a global slowdown to trade tensions and unpredictable policy pronouncements.Even if individuals are unaware of most details, the high confidence scores reflect the collective evidence and evaluations that the economy is hardy, said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University. \u201cMarkets aggregate information,\u201d he said.The Democrats were less adept at rounding up credit for economic improvements and shaking off criticisms. \u201cPart of Obama\u2019s problem, especially in the last year, was that he was too understated,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cIn every instance, he downplayed it. It was \u2018Just the facts, ma\u2019am.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201dA widening political gap hovers over all these developments. Views of the economy have always been shaped by concrete conditions as well as party affiliation, said Jonathan Rothwell, senior economist at Gallup, the analytics and consulting firm.A Gallup poll asks respondents from both parties how they would rate economic conditions.

And he revels in being a polarizing figure.Roots of the deepening partisan divide around the economy reach further back, however. The small difference in Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 perceptions of the economy that existed during the Reagan and Bush administrations doubled during the Obama years, Mr. Curtin said. The gap doubled again under Mr. Trump, with Republicans shifting their views in greater numbers than Democrats.Whatever role personal style and leadership may play, Mr. Curtin argues that wage stagnation and income inequality, particularly among less educated workers, have contributed to the partisan rifts of the last decade. The largest fissures between Republicans and Democrats are among less educated lower- and moderate-income households.Many of these households turned to Mr. Trump in 2016, and continue to express faith in his ability to better their economic fortunes.Ms. Vavreck of U.C.L.A. argues that differences around race and ethnicity issues have amplified the partisan divide as views on immigration and diversity increasingly fall along party lines. This has spilled over into appraisals of the economy. That could be part of the reason for the unusual disconnect between favorable economic news and approval ratings for both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump.Historically, sentiments about the economy could build up or chip away at a president\u2019s support, Ms. Vavreck said, but no longer. \u201cIn a polarized age,\u201d she said, \u201cAmericans may give little credit to a president not of their own party.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTBen Casselman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Socialists", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "OpinionWhy the pitch from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders resonates in 2018.Supported byMr. Robin is a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York Graduate Center. Throughout most of American history, the idea of socialism has been a hopeless, often vaguely defined dream. So distant were its prospects at midcentury that the best definition Irving Howe and Lewis Coser, editors of the socialist periodical Dissent, could come up with in 1954 was this: \u201cSocialism is the name of our desire.\u201d What explains this irruption? And what do we mean, in 2018, when we talk about \u201csocialism\u201d?Some part of the story is pure accident. In 2016, Mr. Sanders made a strong bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Far from hurting his candidacy, the \u201csocialism\u201d label helped it. Mr. Sanders wasn\u2019t a liberal, a progressive or even a Democrat. He was untainted by all the words and ways of politics as usual. Ironically, the fact that socialism was so long in exile now shields it from the toxic familiarities of American politics.Another part of the story is less accidental. Since the 1970s, American liberals have taken a right turn on the economy. They used to champion workers and unions, high taxes, redistribution, regulation and public services. Now they lionize billionaires like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, deregulate wherever possible, steer clear of unions except at election time and at least until recently, fight over how much to cut most people\u2019s taxes. Liberals, of course, argue that they are merely using market-friendly tools like tax cuts and deregulation to achieve things like equitable growth, expanded health care and social justice \u2014 the same ends they always have pursued. For decades, left-leaning voters have gone along with that answer, even if they didn\u2019t like the results, for lack of an alternative.It took Mr. Sanders to convince them that if tax credits and insurance exchanges are the best liberals have to offer to men and women struggling to make stagnating wages pay for bills that skyrocket and debt that never dissipates, maybe socialism is worth a try.Socialism means different things to different people. For some, it conjures the Soviet Union and the gulag; for others, Scandinavia and guaranteed income. But neither is the true vision of socialism. What the socialist seeks is freedom.Under capitalism, we\u2019re forced to enter the market just to live. The libertarian sees the market as synonymous with freedom. But socialists hear \u201cthe market\u201d and think of the anxious parent, desperate not to offend the insurance representative on the phone, lest he decree that the policy she paid for doesn\u2019t cover her child\u2019s appendectomy. Under capitalism, we\u2019re forced to submit to the boss. Terrified of getting on his bad side, we bow and scrape, flatter and flirt, or worse \u2014 just to get that raise or make sure we don\u2019t get fired. The socialist argument against capitalism isn\u2019t that it makes us poor. It\u2019s that it makes us unfree. When my well-being depends upon your whim, when the basic needs of life compel submission to the market and subjugation at work, we live not in freedom but in domination. Socialists want to end that domination: to establish freedom from rule by the boss, from the need to smile for the sake of a sale, from the obligation to sell for the sake of survival. Listen to today\u2019s socialists, and you\u2019ll hear less the language of poverty than of power. Mr. Sanders invokes the 1 percent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez speaks to and for the \u201cworking class\u201d \u2014 not \u201cworking people\u201d or \u201cworking families,\u201d homey phrases meant to soften and soothe. The 1 percent and the working class are not economic descriptors. They\u2019re political accusations. They split society in two, declaring one side the illegitimate ruler of the other; one side the taker of the other\u2019s freedom, power and promise. Walk the streets of Bushwick with a canvasser for Julia Salazar, the socialist candidate running to represent North Brooklyn in the New York State Senate. What you\u2019ll hear is that unlike her opponent, Ms. Salazar doesn\u2019t take money from real estate developers. It\u2019s not just that she wants to declare her independence from rich donors. It\u2019s that in her district of cash-strapped renters, landlords are the enemy. Compare that position to the pitch that Shomik Dutta, a Democratic Party fund-raiser, gave to the Obama campaign in 2008: \u201cThe Clinton network is going to take all the establishment\u201d donors. What the campaign needed was someone who understands \u201cthe less established donors, the real-estate-developer folks.\u201d If that was \u201cyes, we can,\u201d the socialist answer is \u201cno, we won\u2019t.\u201d One of the reasons candidates like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Salazar speak the language of class so fluently is that it\u2019s central to their identities. Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton struggled to cobble together a credible self out of the many selves they\u2019d presented over the years, trying to find a personal story to fit the political moment. Today\u2019s young candidates of the left tell a story of personal struggle that meshes with their political vision. Mr. Obama did that \u2014 but where his story reinforced a myth of national identity and inclusion, the socialists\u2019 story is one of capitalism and exclusion: how, as millennials struggling with low wages and high rents and looming debt, they and their generation are denied the promise of freedom. The stories of these candidates are socialist for another reason: They break with the nation-state. The geographic references of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 or Ms. Tlaib, who is running to represent Michigan\u2019s 13th District in Congress \u2014 are local rather than national, invoking the memory and outposts of American and European colonialism rather than the promise of the American dream.Ms. Tlaib speaks of her Palestinian heritage and the cause of Palestine by way of the African-American struggle for civil rights in Detroit, while Ms. Ocasio-Cortez draws circuits of debt linking Puerto Rico, where her mother was born, and the Bronx, where she lives. Mr. Obama\u2019s story also had its Hawaiian (as well as Indonesian and Kenyan) chapters. But where his ended on a note of incorporation, the cosmopolitan wanderer coming home to America, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez aren\u2019t interested in that resolution. That refusal is also part of the socialist heritage.Arguably the biggest boundary today\u2019s socialists are willing to cross is the two-party system. In their campaigns, the message is clear: It\u2019s not enough to criticize Donald Trump or the Republicans; the Democrats are also complicit in the rot of American life. And here the socialism of our moment meets up with the deepest currents of the American past. Like the great transformative presidents, today\u2019s socialist candidates reach beyond the parties to target a malignant social form: for Abraham Lincoln, it was the slavocracy; for Franklin Roosevelt, it was the economic royalists. The great realigners understood that any transformation of society requires a confrontation not just with the opposition but also with the political economy that underpins both parties. That\u2019s why realigners so often opt for a language that neither party speaks. For Lincoln in the 1850s, confronting the Whigs and the Democrats, that language was free labor. For leftists in the 2010s, confronting the Republicans and the Democrats, it\u2019s socialism.To critics in the mainstream and further to the left, that language can seem slippery. With their talk of Medicare for All or increasing the minimum wage, these socialist candidates sound like New Deal or Great Society liberals. There\u2019s not much discussion, yet, of classic socialist tenets like worker control or collective ownership of the means of production. And of course, there\u2019s overlap between what liberals and socialists call for. But even if liberals come to support single-payer health care, free college, more unions and higher wages, the divide between the two will remain. For liberals, these are policies to alleviate economic misery. For socialists, these are measures of emancipation, liberating men and women from the tyranny of the market and autocracy at work. Back in the 1930s, it was said that liberalism was freedom plus groceries. The socialist, by contrast, believes that making things free makes people free.It\u2019s also important to remember that the traffic between socialism and liberalism has always been wide. The 10-point program of Marx and Engels\u2019s \u201cCommunist Manifesto\u201d included demands that are now boilerplate: universal public education, abolition of child labor and a progressive income tax. It can take a lot of socialists to get a little liberalism: It was socialists in Europe, after all, who won the right to vote, freedom of speech and parliamentary democracy. Given how timid and tepid American liberalism has become \u2014 when was the last time a Democratic president even called himself a liberal \u2014 it\u2019s not surprising that a more arresting term helps get the conversation going. Sometimes nudges need a nudge.In magazines and on websites, in reading groups and party chapters, socialists are debating the next steps: state ownership of certain industries, worker councils and economic cooperatives, sovereign wealth funds. Once upon a time, such conversations were the subject of academic satire and science fiction. Now they\u2019re getting out the vote and driving campaigns. It\u2019s too soon to tell whether they\u2019ll spill over into Congress, but events have a way of converting barroom chatter into legislative debate.What ultimately gives shape to socialist desire is less the specific policies in a politician\u2019s head than the men and women marching with their feet. That\u2019s why the two most important utterances of today\u2019s socialists are Ms. Salazar\u2019s demand that New York abolish the law prohibiting strikes of government workers and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call \u201cto occupy all of it.\u201d Both statements reveal what socialists have always understood: Mass action \u2014 sometimes illegal, always confrontational \u2014 will determine socialism\u2019s final form.Socialism is not journalists, intellectuals or politicians armed with a policy agenda. As Marx and Engels understood \u2014 this was one of their core insights, what distinguished them from other socialist thinkers, ever ready with their blueprints \u2014 it is workers who get us there, who decide what and where \u201cthere\u201d is. That, too, is a kind of freedom. Socialist freedom.Corey Robin is a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York Graduate Center.

{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merkel and Putin Sound Pragmatic Notes After Years of Tension", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the two countries\u2019 long history of alienation and rapprochement was also at play when Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin met for three and a half hours on Saturday at the German government\u2019s villa in Meseberg, outside Berlin. It was their second meeting in three months.The two leaders concluded the talks without issuing statements. Before the meeting began, they told reporters that bringing stability to eastern Ukraine and Syria and addressing the future of the Iran nuclear deal were the top issues on their agenda.Analysts had viewed the meeting as a chance to put relations between Berlin and Moscow on more pragmatic ground after years of increasing tensions. Mr. Putin seemed to suggest the same in his comments beforehand, saying in particular that he wanted Germany\u2019s help in rebuilding Syria\u2019s infrastructure so refugees could return to the devastated country.For years Russia has provided military backing to help prop up President Bashar al-Assad of Syria against the rebel groups seeking his demise.Ms. Merkel also pointed to a need for greater cooperation, though she suggested Moscow had a particular burden.\u201cGermany, but especially Russia, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, has a responsibility to find solutions,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cI am of the opinion that controversial issues can only be addressed in dialogue, and through dialogue.\u201dBilateral issues focusing on energy and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline were also up for discussion.Here\u2019s a look at the issues that define and influence German-Russian ties and the leaders\u2019 discussions.The two countries could be described as the ultimate international \u201cfrenemies,\u201d with economic, cultural and intellectual ties reaching back centuries. Since the 18th century, they have cycled through a series of conflicts and reconciliations, most recently World War II and the Cold War.Throughout the Soviet era, Germany was Moscow\u2019s most important trading partner, and many Germans view the strong, positive ties to Moscow as a key contributor to the end of the Cold War and German reunification. When the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reached out to Moscow, partly to help the departing Soviet bloc countries integrate into the European Union, not only strengthening political and economic ties, but also investing in civil society.Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin have still maintained regular contact. In May, the chancellor visited the Russian president at his summer residence in Sochi and she told reporters she saw Saturday\u2019s meeting as a continuation of those talks.Susan Stewart, a senior associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, cautioned that the leaders\u2019 meeting in Germany should not be viewed as a fundamental shift in German-Russian relations. Instead, it reflected hope that the two sides could compromise on Syria, energy and other key issues, while maintaining their differences over Russia\u2019s role in the conflict in Ukraine.Both Germany and Russia have problems tied to Syria.Both leaders could benefit from finding a way to ensure sufficient political stability in Syria to allow Germany to begin encouraging refugees to return, while Mr. Putin is seeking support from Berlin and the European Union to help rebuild the country, said Stefan Meister of the German Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cIt is in the domestic political interest of the German government that Syrian refugees be able to return to a stable Syria,\u201d Mr. Meister said.A common interest could bring the countries closer after a period of deteriorating relations.\u201cIf you look at the image of Germany \u2014 and Merkel in particular \u2014 in Russian political discourse, you will see that it really has deteriorated tremendously,\u201d said Sabine Fischer, head researcher on Eastern Europe at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.A survey cited on Friday by Vedomosti, a Russian business daily, reflected this trend, showing approval of Ms. Merkel among Russians plummeting to 15 percent in August 2016 from 60 percent in February 2011.\u201cThat comment clearly taps into a stereotype in Washington that because of its economic ties, Germany is \u2018weaker\u2019 on Russia,\u201d said Derek Chollet, an adviser on security and defense policy with the German Marshall Fund in Washington.On Saturday, Mr. Putin rattled off a list of statistics that speak to the strength of the two countries\u2019 economic ties, among them a 22 percent increase in trade in 2017, to $55 billion. He also addressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, insisting that it was needed to \u201cmeet the European economy\u2019s growing demand for energy resources.\u201d\u201cI want to emphasize again that Nord Stream 2 is a solely economic project and it closes no opportunities for transit shipments via Ukrainian territory,\u201d Mr. Putin said.Former Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der\u2019s close relationship to Mr. Putin and his decision to join the board of Russia\u2019s state oil company, Rosneft, has bolstered that notion that Germany is beholden to Russia.But Ms. Merkel has shown a willingness to draw a line, with her decisions to support sanctions against Russia in 2015 and to join the coordinated response to the poisoning in Britain this spring.\u201cMy sense is Merkel, who in her own way makes clear that she understands the Russians and Putin as a type as well as anyone, has no illusions about Russia or Putin and their motives,\u201d Mr. Chollet said.Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

Also, a bit about Trump\u2019s plan to freeze standards on automobile pollution.One of those niches is the Arctic, where mosquitoes play a bigger role in sustaining the ecosystem but may be threatened by the changing climate, said Lauren E. Culler, a research assistant professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.\u201cYou can collect pollen off of mosquitoes, indicating they may have a role in pollination,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that they\u2019re also food for other organisms in the food web.\u201dShe is now researching how changes in the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast than the global average, are affecting mosquitoes. \u201cLosing mosquitoes from the Arctic ecosystem could have some unanticipated impacts,\u201d she said.We\u2019re not close to losing them yet, but things are changing fast in the region.

But it was unclear whether this earlier emergence was endangering their survival.Similarly concerning is that the ponds mosquitoes depend on as spots to lay eggs are disappearing in Greenland for unknown reasons.Her study found that with the exception of the coldest ponds closest to Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, female mosquitoes were successfully reproducing above the rate required to sustain the population. At least for now.The draft plan would throttle the Obama-era fuel economy standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 back to 37 miles per gallon, and it would revoke the right of California and other states to set their own, more stringent standards. If the plan is finalized in its current form, California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has said he will lead an 18-state lawsuit against it. That could lead to the creation of two separate mileage standards, effectively splitting the nation\u2019s auto market in two.That\u2019s a nightmare scenario for automakers, parts suppliers and dealerships, who will use the draft plan\u2019s 60-day public comment period to urge the administration to go back to the drawing board and change the plan. The 18 states, as well as environmental, public health and consumer advocacy groups are expected to do the same. While some Republicans cheered the plan, most industry groups \u2014 including the oil industry, the one sector the rollback would clearly benefit \u2014 avoided public statements of support.The analysis forms the legal and technical foundation for the Trump administration\u2019s draft rules. Remarkably, among its biggest critics are senior administration officials, including Andrew Wheeler, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency.Michelle Hicks got a nasty surprise when she emailed to ask for an early check-in at the apartment her family had rented in Florida: A toxic algal bloom had hit the beach.Since last fall, the algal bloom, known as a red tide, has lingered off four counties south of Tampa. Waves and ocean spray can carry toxins into the air and cause respiratory problems in people.For Ms. Hicks, of Port Orchard, Wash., it meant major inconvenience. She canceled the apartment and scrambled to find other accommodations in Florida.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facing New Russian Hacking, Senators Signal They Are Ready to Act", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in three separate hearings on Capitol Hill, senators prodded the Trump administration to do more with its existing authorities to deter Russia and protect the United States\u2019 political infrastructure.\u201cCongress is going to act; you might as well know that,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, predicted in a meeting of the Banking Committee, which oversees sanctions law. \u201cI\u2019d rather it act in a way that has your insights about what would be helpful, but if you fail to provide insights then we will provide you with a law that ultimately takes place without your insights.\u201dBut administration officials argued that the current sanctions regime provided all the authority they needed, and they dismissed concerns that President Trump\u2019s equivocation on questions of Russian interference had harmed their efforts.\u201cIf you look at the wide range of activities that this administration has undertaken under the direction of the president, including the very significant sanctions that we have been able to launch, including the expulsion of 60 Russians out of our country, including the closing of Russian entities in the United States, what Russia sees is a United States that is very aggressively targeting malign activity,\u201d Sigal P. Mandelker, a senior Treasury Department official, told the Banking Committee.The senators\u2019 pleas took on more urgency after Microsoft Corporation revealed on Monday that it had detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian military intelligence unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the conservative Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.Both institutions have taken aim at Russian corruption, and on Tuesday the Hudson Institute said in a statement that was not the first time an authoritarian government had targeted its work, nor did it expect it to be the last. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific offices or political campaigns.\u201cTo Republicans, if you think the Russians don\u2019t have you in mind, you are making a great mistake,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said as he led a hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee focused on election security. \u201cThey are trying to undermine the democratic process.\u201dBut senators were skeptical of the administration\u2019s actions. They questioned the effectiveness of sanctions passed overwhelmingly last year to target Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors, and tried to solicit input from the officials on how to proceed. And with the latest targets being conservative groups, concern could spread.Mr. Graham said efforts to deter Russia had clearly fallen short and called on party leaders to move quickly.Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he was \u201cpersonally very interested\u201d in additional bipartisan sanctions legislation, but he cautioned that there may not be time to fully consider it before the election.\u201cThe chances of sandwiching that in, honestly, in the month of September with all the other items we have swirling around, is probably pretty slim, but we will be here longer this year,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters. \u201cIt would be high on the list for consideration for floor time.\u201dThe report from Microsoft sharpened the warnings. It said that the company had identified and shut down several websites linked to a Russian military intelligence unit that set out to influence the 2016 American elections.Amid those warnings and the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s July summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, senators from both parties have been anxiously debating how to raise the pressure on Moscow.Two approaches dominate the discussion.Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, have drafted legislation to deter Russia from further interference, putting the Kremlin on notice that the United States will enact broad economic sanctions if it does not stand down before the November elections.The competing bill, written by Mr. Menendez and Mr. Graham, would seek to immediately drop a package of what they call \u201ccrushing\u201d new punishments on the country for actions already underway.The Banking Committee appeared ready to sort through the differences.\u201cIt\u2019s not often that Congress acts together in such a strong manner, as marked by such near-unanimous votes\u201d last year, said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cBut then, Russia is a menace on so many different levels today that Congress can be compelled to act with a single voice to find solutions that will protect America and democratic values across the world.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, was more forceful, calling the latest denial by the Kremlin \u201cnonsense\u201d and insisting that Mr. Trump do the same.\u201cOur government \u2014 the president and Congress together \u2014 must right now send a more powerful and direct message to Putin and those within his circles: We know what you\u2019re doing, it must stop and if you continue, you and your government will pay a dear price,\u201d he said.The hearings were combative at times, with senators venting that administration officials were dodging simple questions.\u201cOne of the things I thought would come from this hearing is a recommendation or a set of recommendations of what Congress might consider legislatively for additional sanctions,\u201d Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said at the Banking Committee hearing. \u201cAm I to take from your unwillingness to answer that kind of question that there is opposition by the administration to additional sanctions?\u201dMs. Mandelker would not give a straight answer, repeatedly telling senators that the Treasury Department had the authority it needed.In the Foreign Relations Committee, senators were clearly frustrated with what they said was a lack of progress in curbing Russian behavior.\u201cWhy, given all the things we are doing, are we not making better progress?\u201d asked Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. \u201cI think sanctions are necessary,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s obviously not working the way we\u2019d like. What would be more effective?\u201dA. Wess Mitchell, an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, replied that \u201cthe chilling effect on the Russian economy has been significant and measurable.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is the challenge Alex Pheby has set for himself in composing his second novel, \u201cPlaythings.\u201dDaniel Paul Schreber, a prominent German judge of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, suffered three yearslong bouts of paranoid schizophrenia.

Quite the opposite, really.

Agile and wily, Pheby\u2019s sentences flit in the weather of Schreber\u2019s sanity, yet they are always buoyed by the judge\u2019s half-hampered intellect and rationality. It\u2019s the most torturous variety of mental illness \u2014 one that almost understands itself.Schreber is physically abused by an orderly whose brother was executed under one of the judge\u2019s rulings. The orderly justifies his brutality as obligation, saying: \u201cYou understand that, right? Just following the law? Right, Judge? Nothing personal. Blind justice.\u201dHierarchies and judgments \u2014 past and present \u2014 tortuously strip bodies of their autonomy; in \u201cPlaythings\u201d only children seem to notice these cruelties.

It\u2019s all perfectly fine and normal. \u2026 A little holiday, nothing more!\u201d Yet in a childhood flashback to what seems to be the revolution of 1848, Schreber accepts the lie of his white superiority and tells his Jewish neighbors, \u201cIf you were set fire to in your beds then that would be no one\u2019s fault but your own.\u201d The Jewish boy he bullied as a child is one of the visions that now haunt him.Catherine Lacey\u2019s third work of fiction, \u201cCertain American States,\u201d has just been published.Advertisement"}

Opinion Columnist\u201cThe president has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, calling it \u201ccallous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle.\u201dThen there was Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea for criminal violations of campaign-finance laws. This was soon followed by the usual casuistry from Donald Trump and his defenders explaining why the offense, as it related to the president, was legally trivial; or that the economy would collapse in the event of impeachment; or that Trump\u2019s critics were mentally deranged; or that the president was entitled to the sort of deference due to kings.It was all vintage Bill: deploying minions to lie about illicit sex (and twist the meaning of words); abusing the powers of the presidency to trash the reputations of others; converting his character flaws into a national convulsion. Clinton did all this, and so has Trump. What the former pioneered, the latter has simply taken to the next level. By the same token, liberals now calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment ought to rethink the excuses so many of them made for Clinton 20 years ago. That it was \u201cjust sex.\u201d Or that \u201clying about sex\u201d doesn\u2019t rise to the level of an impeachable offense (even if it\u2019s lying about sex under oath). Or that \u201ccharacter doesn\u2019t matter\u201d so long as the administration produces peace and prosperity. Or that the motivating animus of the president\u2019s critics is reason enough to dismiss the criticism.These excuses were toxic not because they had no merit, but because they sidestepped the core of the issue: that the survival and ennoblement of democracy depend on holding people in high office to higher, not lower, standards.Then, too, the Clinton machine\u2019s relentless efforts to delegitimize the independent counsel by claiming Starr had gone far beyond his original remit to investigate the Whitewater case mirror the Trump machine\u2019s attacks on Robert Mueller today.Yet what Starr did then is what Mueller and other prosecutors are doing now: uncovering wrongdoing where they find it. That Trump\u2019s hush money to two women has nothing to do with Russia makes the wrongdoing no less contemptible, illegal \u2014 and, because it\u2019s about the president, impeachable.Because the Clinton impeachment saga is still relatively recent, it\u2019s been depressing \u2014 and instructive \u2014 to watch the two sides in that drama conveniently adopt the other\u2019s former rationale for their own partisan convenience. (Lindsey Graham, this means you.)But anyone who now calls for Trump to be judged severely should acknowledge that we would have been in a better place today if Clinton hadn\u2019t been so fervently defended back then. Among other things, it might have dissuaded other sexual predators and congenital liars from running for high office.We can still get it right.

{"Headline": "The Trump Tax Cuts Were Supposed to Depress Housing Prices. They Haven\u2019t. ", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo far, economists see only faint effects of the new tax law in housing prices. The predicted carnage hasn\u2019t materialized. WASHINGTON \u2014 It wasn\u2019t supposed to take long for the Trump tax cuts to hobble housing prices, particularly in the high-tax, high-cost metro areas where the new law was poised to rip federal incentives to buy new homes. Nearly nine months later, those warnings have not materialized. While the nation\u2019s housing market is showing signs of weakness on several fronts \u2014 particularly in new-home construction \u2014 prices across the country are continuing to climb. That\u2019s true even in the million-dollar-plus markets of California and Washington, D.C., which appeared most at risk for a hit when the bill was pending. Economists see only faint effects from the new law so far in housing data. They\u2019re small, and they\u2019re contained to a few high-priced, highly taxed ZIP codes, largely in blue states.They\u2019re nothing close to the carnage that real estate groups warned about when the law was under debate last fall.\u201cWe thought that there would be some impact,\u201d Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said this spring, \u201cbut the market is saying, so far, there is not an impact.\u201dBut they did not raise similar alarms about falling home values \u2014 or about the impact of the tax cuts on the housing markets.Because it doubles the size of the standard deduction that most taxpayers take \u2014 and reduces the incentives for Americans to claim itemized deductions \u2014 the new tax law will reduce the number of Americans who claim the mortgage interest deduction on their income taxes. It dilutes the value of the mortgage deduction for some new, high-end buyers by limiting the tax break for interest paid to a mortgage debt of $750,000 or less. The new law also caps at $10,000 the amount of state and local taxes, including property taxes, that homeowners can deduct from their federal taxes. See if you can spot that plunge in the data:The median American home sold for nearly 6 percent more in June than it did a year ago, according to data from the online real estate firm Zillow \u2014 the same rate as the increase from June 2016 to June 2017. The strength has continued even though the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates steadily for the past year, which also dampens prices by pushing up the cost to borrow for home buyers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen buyers lower their price point\u201d as a result of the tax law, Ms. Stokes said. \u201cAll buyers are aware of it, and they\u2019re factoring it in. But they\u2019re not changing what they want to do.\u201dThat\u2019s true even though the tax law has unquestionably diminished the value of several federal subsidies for homeowners. It limits deductions for state and local taxes, including property taxes, to $10,000 per household, which hurts owners of expensive homes in high-tax states. It lowers the cap on the mortgage interest deduction, which raises housing prices by allowing homeowners to write off the interest payments from their loans, to $750,000 for new loans, down from $1 million. Existing loans are grandfathered under the old cap.The limitation on deductions for state and local tax, or SALT for short, appears to be the only change having much impact on the market, according to a detailed analysis of housing markets across the country from economists at Zillow.The analysis looked at the pace of housing value appreciation in local markets across the country, before and after the new law took effect. It isolated changes in those rates, over time, when controlling for several factors: the share of residents who itemize their deductions, who claim the mortgage deduction, or claim the SALT deduction.The first two had no effect on whether home values increased faster or slower in an area after the law took effect. But starting with the date for May, the Zillow team began to see a significant, but small, change based on the use of the state and local tax deduction. In the top 10 percent of areas that make use of the SALT deduction, growth in home values have slowed by about 0.6 percentage points since the law took effect. At the median, growth has slowed by about 0.3 percentage points. The bottom 10 percent haven\u2019t seen any slowdown.Zillow researchers say the Boston metro area illustrates the point. It straddles state lines, with one state (Massachusetts) featuring higher state income taxes that drive more residents to claim the SALT deduction. After the law passed, ZIP codes in the Boston area saw a 0.6 percentage point slowdown in home appreciation on the Massachusetts side \u2014 and a 0.1 percent acceleration on the New Hampshire side.The effect there is \u201cnot huge, it\u2019s small,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. Home sellers in areas with high use of the SALT deduction are not, in general, losing money from the law, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving up hypothetical money that otherwise they would have had.\u201d\u201cIn April, May and June, we had a flood of new homes hit the market,\u201d said Grant Long, a senior economist at StreetEasy. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say why that is.\u201d On the flip side is San Jose, Calif.: Its prices continue to skyrocket, even though Silicon Valley residents are heavy users of the SALT deduction.Experts say several forces are helping to counteract the diminished federal home-buying subsidies. Across the country, a growing economy has finally begun to entice millennials into the buying market, after years of waiting for their finances to recover from recession. Direct savings that workers are realizing from the new law\u2019s cuts in individual tax rates could be helping, too. Unlike in New York City, the supply of homes on the market \u2014 both newly built, and existing homes put up for sale \u2014 is falling for the nation as a whole, which also lifts prices. That tight supply is partially the result of a decade of caution in the home building industry following the housing crisis. It also stems from strict local curbs on new housing development, particularly in \u201chot\u201d metro areas such as Denver, Los Angeles and Washington.\u201cThere are a whole bunch of people who swallowed the \u2018tax cuts aren\u2019t going to stimulate much\u2019 story,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, the council\u2019s director. \u201cBut if you\u2019re getting a lot of income growth, the income growth increases the demand for housing, and the mortgage interest deduction reduces it. And the effects offset.\u201dEconomists caution that the changes might have a larger effect in an economy where housing inventory is more plentiful, or where income growth is slower and consumers worry more about tax preferences when making buying decisions.A dent on prices \u201cwill show up over time,\u201d Mr. Yun said. \u201cBut when is that time? Will it take one year? Two years? Three years? That is the question.\u201dAn earlier version of this article understated the number of tax filers who claimed the mortgage interest deduction last year and the number expected to claim it this year. About 14 million are expected to claim it this year versus about 32 million last year, not 14,000 this year versus 32,000 last year.Advertisement"}

During a decade-long tenure at Google, he worked on search advertising, helping perfect a powerful, data-driven advertising model. Gradually, he began to feel that his life story as he knew it was coming unglued, \u201cas though the floor was crumbling under my feet,\u201d he writes.Mr. Williams compares the current design of our technology to \u201can entire army of jets and tanks\u201d aimed at capturing and keeping our attention. And the army is winning. We spend the day transfixed by our screens, thumb twitching in the subways and elevators, glancing at traffic lights.This is us: eyes glazed, mouth open, neck crooked, trapped in dopamine loops and filter bubbles. Our attention is sold to advertisers, along with our data, and handed back to us tattered and piecemeal.  Mr. Williams, 36, was speaking on Skype from his home in Moscow, where his wife, who works for the United Nations, has been posted for the year. Mr. Williams is now concerned with overwired individuals losing their life purpose.He knew that among that his colleagues, he wasn\u2019t the only one feeling this way. Speaking at a technology conference in Amsterdam last year, Mr. Williams asked the designers in the room, some 250 of them, \u201cHow many of you guys want to live in the world that you\u2019re creating? In a world where technology is competing for our attention?\u201d \u201cNot a single hand went up,\u201d he said.Mr. Williams is also far from the only example of a former soldier of big tech (to continue the army metaphor) now working to expose its cultural dangers. In late June, Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google, took the stage at the Aspen Ideas Festival to warn the crowd that what we are facing is no less than an \u201cexistential threat\u201d from our very own gadgets. He likes a chess analogy. When Facebook or Google points their \u201csupercomputers\u201d toward our minds, he said, \u201cit\u2019s checkmate.\u201d Back in the more innocent days of 2013, when Mr. Williams and Mr. Harris both still worked at Google, they\u2019d meet in conference rooms and sketch out their thoughts on whiteboards: a concerned club of two at the epicenter of the attention economy. Since then, both men\u2019s messages have grown in scope and urgency. The constant pull on our attention from technology is no longer just about losing too many hours of our so-called real lives to the diversions of the web. Now, they are telling us, we are at risk of fundamentally losing our moral purpose.\u201cIt\u2019s changing our ability to make sense of what\u2019s true, so we have less and less idea of a shared fabric of truth, of a shared narrative that we all subscribe to,\u201d Mr. Harris said, the day after his Aspen talk. \u201cWithout shared truth or shared facts, you get chaos \u2014 and people can take control.\u201d But many of the biggest questions remain unanswered. At the top of that list, no smaller a mystery remains than \u201cthe relationship between attention and our conscious experience of the world,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, a neuroscientist whose lab at U.C.L.A. studies attention and memory. Also unclear: the consequence of all that screen time on our bedraggled neurons. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how modern technology and changes in our culture impact our ability to sustain our attention on our goals,\u201d Dr. Rissman said.Britt Anderson, a neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, went so far as to write a 2011 paper titled \u201cThere Is No Such Thing as Attention.\u201d Dr. Anderson argued that researchers have used the word to apply to so many different behaviors \u2014 attention span, attention deficit, selective attention and spatial attention, to name a few \u2014 that it has become essentially meaningless, even at the very moment when it\u2019s more relevant than ever. Despite attention\u2019s possible lack of existence, though, many among us mourn its passing \u2014 Ms. LuPone, for example, and others who command an audience, like college professors.Katherine Hayles, an English professor at U.C.L.A., has written about the change she sees in students as one from \u201cdeep attention,\u201d a state of single-minded absorption that can last for hours, to one of \u201chyper attention,\u201d which jumps from target to target, preferring to skim the surface of lots of different things than to probe the depths of just one. At Columbia University, where every student is required to pass a core curriculum with an average of 200 to 300 pages of reading each week, professors have been discussing how to deal with the conspicuous change in students\u2019 ability to get through their assignments. The curriculum has more or less stayed in place, but \u201cwe\u2019re constantly thinking about how we\u2019re teaching when attention spans have changed since 50 years ago,\u201d said Lisa Hollibaugh, a dean of academic planning at Columbia. In the 1990s, 3 to 5 percent of American school-aged children were thought to have what is now called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. By 2013, that number was 11 percent, and rising, according to data from the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health.At Tufts University, Nick Seaver, an anthropology professor, just finished his second year of teaching a class he designed called How to Pay Attention. But rather than offering tips for focusing, as one might expect, he set out to train his students to look at attention as a cultural phenomenon \u2014 \u201cthe way people talk about attention,\u201d Dr. Seaver said, with topics like the \u201cattention economy\u201d or \u201cattention and politics.\u201dAs part of their homework for the \u201ceconomy\u201d week, Dr. Seaver told his students to analyze how an app or website \u201ccaptures\u201d their attention and then profits from it. A classmate, Jake Rochford, who chose Tinder, noted the extreme stickiness of a new \u201csuper-like\u201d button. \u201cOnce the super-like button came into play, I noticed all of the functions as strategies for keeping the app open, instead of strategies for helping me find love,\u201d Mr. Rochford, 21, said.

Joe Farren, born Josef Pollak in the Jewish ghetto of Vienna, comes to Shanghai as a penniless exhibition dancer hoping to become \u201cthe city\u2019s own Flo Ziegfeld\u201d; Jack Riley, an American originally named Fahnie Albert Becker, is a former Navy seaman and wanted ex-con who shows up with a dream of making a fortune on illegal slot machines. As newcomers to this \u201ccity of reinvention,\u201d they must start at the bottom of the gangland pecking order and work their way up, eventually partnering together on a drug-running operation that proves lucrative enough to make both of them major players in Shanghai\u2019s criminal economy.Their big break, however, comes in 1937, when the Japanese invasion of Shanghai changes the geography of sin in the besieged city, isolating the international settlement and moving its main vice district to a nearby area instantly called the Badlands. Joe and Jack, filling the power vacuum left by the decampment of native Chinese crime lords, collaborate on a venue called Farren\u2019s, \u201cthe biggest, fanciest, richest nightclub and casino Shanghai has ever seen.\u201d And from there they reign over the city\u2019s reconstituted underworld \u2014 until war and Jack\u2019s criminal past catch up with them, bringing the pair down along with the bad old Shanghai they have helped to build.French, the author of \u201cMidnight in Peking,\u201d recounts all of this with great energy and brio. He writes in the knowing, slang-filled idiom of Shanghai\u2019s Shopping News, a gossipy English-language newspaper he quotes repeatedly throughout. And if the book is never quite as engrossing or entertaining as it should be, it is at least atmospheric enough to keep one turning pages. After all, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with dope, decadence and the demimonde.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Beginning of a Wave\u2019: A.I. Tiptoes Into the Workplace", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where, how and if people work in the future.But the grand work-changing projects of A.I., like self-driving cars and humanoid robots, are not yet commercial products. A more humble version of the technology, instead, is making its presence felt in a less glamorous place: the back office.New software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service. The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.\u201cThis is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,\u201d said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, \u201crobotic process automation.\u201d The programs \u2014 often called bots \u2014 fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.The companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company\u2019s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers\u2019 compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto\u2019s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: \u201cWe\u2019re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.\u201dRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. \u201cNo one misses that work,\u201d Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,\u201d said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto\u2019s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto\u2019s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.\u201cThe long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,\u201d said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company\u2019s bots as \u201cdigital colleagues.\u201d In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.\u201cBut these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,\u201d said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. \u201cFor workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.\u201dThe recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology\u2019s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of robot you can see,\u201d Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond the N.R.A.: Maria Butina\u2019s Peculiar Bid for Russian Influence", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Twelve days after a young Russian gun-rights activist gained access to some of America\u2019s most prominent conservatives, at an elegant dinner near the Capitol, a Republican operative was eager to keep the momentum going.Ms. Butina, he wrote in the email, had just met Susan Eisenhower, the granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, during a visit to Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. The Russian woman had also gotten to know the ex-wife of a supermarket heir, who had endowed an institute dedicated to furthering American-Russian relations, and the \u201csilky smooth\u201d former Russian diplomat who ran it.Then there was the recipient of the email, George O\u2019Neill Jr., a Rockefeller relative and conservative writer. He was helping pay Ms. Butina\u2019s bills, said a person familiar with their relationship, and hoped to make her the centerpiece of his own project to improve America\u2019s ties to Russia.In bringing charges against Ms. Butina, 29, last month, federal prosecutors described her activities as part of a campaign, supported by Russian intelligence, to use gun rights as a Trojan horse to make her way into conservative groups and advance Moscow\u2019s interests in the United States.While the charging documents focus on her alleged efforts to infiltrate the National Rifle Association, interviews with more than two dozen people in Russia and the United States show that her attempts at connecting with prominent American conservatives extended beyond making inroads with the gun-rights group. The interviews, along with previously unreported emails obtained by The New York Times, also reveal new details about her ties to the two older American men she relied on to make her way in the United States: Mr. Erickson, with whom she struck up a romance, and Mr. O\u2019Neill.Prosecutors allege that the relationships were nothing more than vehicles for her work on behalf of Russia, citing messages in which she told a Russian official all her activities would be \u201conly incognito! Right now everything has to be quiet and careful.\u201dYet for an alleged Russian agent funded by an oligarch, Ms. Butina hardly lived a life of fake identities, secret communications and hidden allegiances.Ms. Butina\u2019s defenders say she was an idealistic, if na\u00efve, activist, and contend that Russians\u2019 interactions with the N.R.A. were attempts at rapprochement that only appear sinister when viewed through an outdated Cold War lens.\u201cI\u2019m just amazed that in today\u2019s world, if you shake hands with a Russian, you must be an agent of the Kremlin,\u201d said David Keene, a former N.R.A. president, who met with Ms. Butina at conferences in Moscow and the United States.While saying he found \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about her, Mr. Keene suggested that there could have been more to Ms. Butina and her visits to the United States than was apparent. \u201cShe did say that they pressured her occasionally to get information when she went home, which I\u2019m sure was true,\u201d he said in a brief interview, but did not elaborate.\u201cThe government seems to be charging her with establishing relationships,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s pro-gun, fine. She\u2019s not making the N.R.A. more pro-gun. She\u2019s pro-U.S.-Russia relations \u2014 no surprise, she\u2019s Russian.\u201dThree government officials told The Times that Ms. Butina\u2019s arrest stemmed from a counterintelligence investigation predating the 2016 election that has focused on a Russian government official, Aleksandr P. Torshin, who worked closely with Ms. Butina for years. Mr. Torshin, a former senator close to Christian conservatives in Russia, has been attending N.R.A. conventions in the United States since 2011.In Ms. Butina, Mr. Torshin found someone adept at engaging with powerful conservatives. She snapped pictures with prominent Republicans, including Scott Walker and other former presidential candidates. She had Thanksgiving dinner last year at the country home of Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. She befriended Grover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader, winning an invitation to his weekly gathering of influential conservatives in Washington.She even managed to get a photo with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, whom she met at a 2016 dinner hosted by the N.R.A. in Louisville, Ky. Separately, she helped Mr. Torshin send a message to the Trump campaign proposing that Donald J. Trump meet President Putin (the campaign turned them down).\u201cIt was very clear that she was a networker and a bit of a name-dropper,\u201d said Ms. Eisenhower, who played down her own encounter with Ms. Butina. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person \u2014 and you see them in Washington and all over the place \u2014 people who have to get their picture taken with anybody of any moderate importance.\u201dBut it was Mr. Erickson and Mr. O\u2019Neill \u2014 referred to in the indictment of Ms. Butina as U.S. Persons 1 and 2 \u2014 whom she relied on most.Mr. O\u2019Neill, the Rockefeller heir, who is not accused of wrongdoing and who declined to comment for this article, met Ms. Butina at a convention for big-game hunters in Las Vegas. He has used his wealth to advocate a United States withdrawal from conflicts around the world and for better relations with Russia, as he explained to Ms. Butina in a letter in April 2016.\u201cI have no other agenda,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Butina\u2019s agenda, though, is now in question. Months later, in October 2016, she sent Mr. Torshin a direct message on Twitter, telling him that her work with Mr. O\u2019Neill was \u201ccurrently \u2018underground\u2019 both here and there.\u201dBut, she assured Mr. Torshin, \u201cWe made our bet. I am following our game.\u201dIt was a he-said, she-said scandal that divided a college campus. Ms. Butina claimed harassment by a male professor. He countered that she had offered sex for a passing grade.It happened in 2009 in the Siberian region of Altai where she grew up. The remote region was not an obvious launchpad for a young woman whose ambitions went beyond running her family\u2019s small furniture business.There, she learned to hunt with her father. In a speech years later, she referred vaguely to a childhood incident that made her feel threatened, and implied that having had a gun could have made a difference.In Russian blog posts, Ms. Butina expressed a resolve to overcome being seen as \u201can inferior girl\u201d in a male-dominated rural culture, and make a name for herself in politics.Her encounter with the college professor came after he claimed she had cheated on a test and offered to overlook the infraction if she had sex with him, according to her own writings and local news accounts. She said no and reported the professor to the administration, which fired him, only to rehire him after he sued for reinstatement. For his part, he asserted that Ms. Butina had offered sexual favors.She cited the episode on social media over the years, as evidence that women must empower themselves. Mostly, she expressed anger that many of her classmates took the professor\u2019s side.She had not been out of college long when she announced her intention to campaign for local office with Mr. Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party, prompting some commenters on her blog to accuse her of selling out her ideals. \u201cOf course, I have no illusions about the existing regime in the country and the ruling party,\u201d she responded, \u201cbut if I really want to change something for the better, then I have to try to do it in the only available version today \u2014 from within.\u201dGuns started out low on her platform, after taxes and jobs. But soon they would be all she talked about.By the end of 2011, Ms. Butina had formed an advocacy group, Right to Bear Arms, and was giving speeches and organizing demonstrations. At an event in Moscow, activists brought pots, pans and kitchen knives to show what little they had to defend themselves without guns.Mr. Torshin, 64, showed up with a horse whip. He and Ms. Butina struck up a friendship.In Russia, Mr. Torshin is powerful \u2014 the Treasury Department added him to a list of sanctioned officials in April \u2014 but not a member of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. A Communist Party functionary in the late Soviet period, he later served as deputy speaker of the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament, and was appointed deputy governor of the Russian central bank in 2015. He has also been accused by the Spanish authorities of laundering money for the Russian mafia, charges he denies.In the senate, Mr. Torshin occasionally championed causes seen as eccentric, such as mandatory chemical castration for convicted pedophiles and legalizing handguns, a non-starter in a country that tightly restricts gun ownership. \u201cThe Kremlin looked at this as his personal exotica,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, a political analyst in Moscow.Ms. Butina became an unpaid assistant to Mr. Torshin, according to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Mr. Torshin would often bring a bouquet of white lilies to their morning meetings, and he liked to tell people that Ms. Butina shared a birthday with Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, inventor of the AK-47 rifle.Mr. Torshin\u2019s introduction to the N.R.A. came through an unlikely go-between, a Nashville lawyer named G. Kline Preston IV, a Russophile who dabbled in Russian commerce and law. Mr. Preston said he met Mr. Torshin through a Russian embassy official, whom he befriended after inviting the official to a Faberg\u00e9 egg exhibition in Nashville in 2007.Mr. Torshin eventually asked Mr. Preston to connect him with leaders of the N.R.A., although Mr. Preston was not a member. After cold-calling the group\u2019s headquarters, the lawyer finally arranged a meeting at a hotel restaurant between Mr. Torshin and Mr. Keene, then the N.R.A. president, during the group\u2019s national convention in Pittsburgh in April 2011.Later, Mr. Keene sent Mr. Torshin a handwritten note pledging support for his efforts and inviting him to the N.R.A.\u2019s next annual meeting. Mr. Torshin attended the next four.In November 2013, Mr. Keene came to Moscow to speak to Ms. Butina\u2019s fledgling gun-rights group. Joining him was Mr. Erickson, who served with Mr. Keene on the board of the American Conservative Union.Mr. Erickson, 56, had worked on losing campaigns for right-wing candidates including Pat Buchanan. He had also left a trail of fraud lawsuits accusing him of peddling worthless investments in oil fields and medical equipment. Concern about his track record prompted the A.C.U. to ask him to leave the board in 2014, said Matt Schlapp, the group\u2019s chairman.Ms. Butina contacted Mr. Erickson around March 2015, seeking advice on using her gun-rights advocacy to gain access to the Republican Party ahead of the 2016 election, prosecutors say.In an email to Mr. Erickson, Ms. Butina noted that the N.R.A.\u2019s deep pockets made it especially influential in American elections. Mr. Erickson replied with an offer to help arrange meetings with \u201cpotential American contacts\u201d and advised her to get financial backing for travel to the United States.She sent a proposal for $125,000 to cover travel to the United States to a Russian oligarch, Konstantin Y. Nikolayev, a transport magnate whose wife runs a Russian gun company that Ms. Butina visited with an N.R.A. delegation in 2015, according to a person familiar with the proposal. Mr. Nikolayev did not take up that deal, but funded some of Ms. Butina\u2019s travel in support of her gun-rights efforts, the person said. In a statement, Mr. Nikolayev said he had not provided any financial support since 2014.A month later, Ms. Butina was in South Dakota, speaking to college students in Mr. Erickson\u2019s hometown, Vermillion. She justified the need for gun rights in her country with two arguments often advanced by Russian officials: that Western sanctions had weakened Russia\u2019s economy, causing more crime, and that the Ukrainian war posed a threat.She would go on to join the N.R.A., attend at least three of its conventions and get to know board members and three former presidents.During their time together, Mr. Erickson and Ms. Butina began an intimate relationship, and he once referred to her as \u201cMiss Moscow\u201d in an email. The F.B.I. said she viewed the relationship as \u201csimply a necessary aspect of her activities,\u201d citing documents in which she \u201cexpressed disdain\u201d at having to live with Mr. Erickson. The investigators also alleged that she offered to have sex with someone else \u201cin exchange for a position with a special interest organization,\u201d though they did not say when or where the incident occurred.Mr. Driscoll, her lawyer, said at a court hearing last month, \u201cWe have no idea what the government is talking about.\u201dWith Mr. Erickson opening doors, Ms. Butina met with conservatives around Washington. Some of the sessions were organized by Mr. O\u2019Neill, who once compared America\u2019s national security establishment to the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the Soviet Union.In emails with Mr. O\u2019Neill in early 2016, according to federal prosecutors, Ms. Butina mentioned \u201cbuilding this communication channel\u201d for what she termed \u201cour Russian-American project.\u201dOther messages obtained by The Times suggest a familiarity between the two. \u201cAre you coming to Florida at the end of the week?\u201d he wrote on April 11, 2016. \u201cWe just acquired another big tractor, which you will have fun driving.\u201dIn an email with a reporter last year, Mr. O\u2019Neill said \u201cany clear-thinking person\u201d should understand the benefits of better relations with Russia. \u201cOne does not have to be a \u2018useful idiot\u2019 or a \u2018Putin stooge\u2019 to hold this view, nor does one have to approve of all of Russia\u2019s or Putin\u2019s actions, which can sometimes be problematic.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump emerged as the Republican front-runner, Ms. Butina and Mr. Torshin tapped their American contacts, hoping to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.In an interview, Mr. Clay said the proposal was relayed to him by a longtime friend, Johnny Yenason, of the Military Warriors Support Foundation, who had attended a Russian National Prayer Breakfast that year where Mr. Torshin spoke. Mr. Yenason could not be reached for comment.\u201cIt had everything to do with Christian values and putting two peoples together who had the same ideas,\u201d Mr. Clay said. \u201cAt least, we thought that they did at the time.\u201dThe meeting between Mr. Torshin and Mr. Trump never occurred. But that did not dampen Ms. Butina\u2019s enthusiasm for his candidacy.As the November 2016 election results came in, Ms. Butina excitedly posted a message about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on a Russian social media site: \u201cA supporter of the rights to arms and the restoration of relations with Russia. Congratulate everyone!\u201dPrivately, according to court filings, she messaged Mr. Torshin, saying it was 3 a.m. and she was going to bed.\u201cI\u2019m ready for further orders,\u201d she said.A caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified a man pictured with Maria Butina and Donald Trump Jr. at a 2016 N.R.A. dinner.

But it\u2019s on the northern part of the Jersey Shore. \u201cPeople were just throwing this stuff out,\u201d Ms. Pisch said of the dead-stock rolls, sheets, towels and wagon covers she has salvaged from flea markets and the homes of friends' parents during regular pilgrimages to the old country. \u201cI had this feeling. Like, \u2018Oh my God, I have to save this piece of history.\u2019\u201d Ms. Pisch could have easily been talking about Asbury Park itself. For years, the area was defined by crumbling 100-year-old buildings, desolation, government corruption and poverty. The other day, Mr. Pisch was looking like a young Lou Reed in a beaten-up army jacket, blue striped shirt, round sunglasses and neatly tied neckerchief. Sweet Joey\u2019s is something of a time warp too, filled with a mix of worn oil paintings and rock memorabilia, like Bruce Springsteen\u2019s black and white \u201cNebraska\u201d poster.

Ms. Perlow has always been passionate about vintage clothes and shopping at thrift stores. She is against so-called fast fashion. And she doesn\u2019t want to buy more fabric and add more waste to the world when there is already so much waste out there, isn\u2019t there? \u201cNine out of 10 times I embroider all of the clothes I\u2019ve hoarded over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u201dm excited to get people excited about secondhand clothes.\u201dAn ironing board covered with 1960s mod fabric leaned against a bookshelf, a sewing machine sat on the kitchen table, and a ring of embroidery reading \u201cNeo Nazis Not Welcome Here,\u201d surrounded by flowers, hung on the wall. Why was she so attracted to Asbury Park? \u201cPeople here are excited about one-of-a-kind stuff,\u201d Ms. Perlow said. \u201cWhich is the very essence of vintage.\u201d  \u201cThe town has seen its darker days,\u201d Mr. Levinson said. \u201cBut you kind of bring it back to life with a little polish and give it another life.\u201dMs. Levinson winced at her husband\u2019s remark. \u201cIt depends on how you look at it,\u201d she said. She is concerned that artists, musicians and other lower-income people are going to get pushed out. \u201cWhich we know a little bit about,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rent has already gone up here quite a bit.\u201d Over the past three years, the Levinsons have moved Flux Modern from a 300-square-foot space to a 900-square-foot space, and their clientele has expanded to include set designers from \u201cThe Deuce\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201dThey use Instagram as a selling tool. \u201cI\u2019ll post something new as soon as I get it,\u201d Mr. Levinson said. \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s gone before I even take it out of my van.\u201dAlso helping them out with sales is Judy Feinstein, 83, a former pilot who showed off an Amelia Earhart medal that she wore around her neck. \u201cI\u2019m the real vintage one in here,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said, and then handed everyone cake.According to the United States census, 48.5 percent of Asbury Park\u2019s residents are black, yet store owners are predominantly white. When asked about the disproportion, Sylvia Sylvia-Cioffi, the executive director of the city\u2019s chamber of commerce, said that as redevelopment continued, particularly on the West Side, she anticipates more merchants of color would be represented. \u201cOur philosophy is that we\u2019re on the West Side,\u201d Ms. Sylvia-Cioffi said of her office building, on Springwood Avenue. \u201cIt makes a real statement that the chamber is here where the next phase of development is really needed and supported.\u201d Once a grungy punk-rock hangout, the newly rehabilitated Asbury Lanes boasts its original \u2014 and now working \u2014 neon bowling pin sign, restored by the family of the electrician who originally built it, along with other items.While decorating the hotel in 2016, Ms. Andrei said she \u201craided\u201d many of the vintage stores at the Shoppes at the Arcade. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you start restoring everything and it becomes like an imitation of the past,\u201d Ms. Andrei said. Deeply connected to the vintage community, the women ran a temporary shopping market inside the Convention Hall. Last year, they brought a Sojourn pop-up to Patriae and to the High Voltage Cafe, which had another location on Ocean Avenue.\u201cIf you are someone who sells vintage, you\u2019re automatically drawn to these older places,\u201d Ms. Leopold said. \u201cIt calls to you. Just like something you\u2019d find. And you connect with these older places,\u201d she said. Both women understood that developers have a job to do. But they have some qualms about the massive restoration they\u2019ve witnessed in the past few years.Perhaps the creative and vintage community could bridge that gap. \u201cYou have to keep the past alive,\u201d she said, \u201cto understand what the future is going to be.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Bill Nelson, the Under-the-Radar Senate Candidate in Florida. He\u2019s the Incumbent.", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe meeting on Friday was Mr. Nelson\u2019s second visit in a month. And this time, he declared, he was fighting back \u2014 not against the algae, but against the governor.\u201cI was playing nice-nice when I was here before, but I\u2019m going to lay out the truth,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cGovernor Scott, in the last eight years, has systematically dismembered and dismantled the environmental agencies of the state of Florida.\u201dMr. Nelson, rarely a firebrand, then returned to his wonky element, delivering a long history lesson on water management and environmental policy. His audience nodded in agreement. But only a dozen people sat at the table listening to him. Mr. Scott\u2019s ad, on the other hand, with its alarming footage of contaminated Lake Okeechobee juxtaposed with an unflattering image of Mr. Nelson, would reach thousands of potential voters.\u201cThe only time I see Bill Nelson is five months before every election,\u201d President Trump taunted at a rally in Tampa last week. \u201cAnd after a while, you forget: \u2018Who\u2019s the senator?\u2019\u201dPanicked Democrats started appealing to Mr. Nelson\u2019s team earlier in the summer to ratchet up the campaign. In the past, Mr. Nelson has won relatively easy re-election, but he faced weak opponents in years favorable to Democrats. In contrast, Mr. Scott has built a political brand around the state\u2019s rebounding economy and has proved to be an aggressive campaigner.The senator has recently become more visible, helped in part by heavy media coverage of the Trump administration\u2019s unpopular policy of separating families who cross the border illegally. Mr. Nelson made headlines when he led an effort to inspect a large shelter for migrant children in South Florida. But that event was something of an anomaly for Mr. Nelson: He has never been a cable news fixture with a deep national imprint.\u201cHe is so modest,\u201d said DeAnna Dean, who heads the Democratic Party in heavily Republican Sumter County, home to the state\u2019s fast-growing retirement community, The Villages. \u201cHe needs to get out there, and we need to tell people, \u2018This is the man you can trust.\u2019\u201dMr. Nelson is a low-key, gentlemanly product of an earlier Florida and a different Democratic Party. He is a politician easier to envision in the president\u2019s box at a University of Florida football game than posing for selfies in diverse South Beach. When he first won a state House seat in 1972, President Richard M. Nixon was running for re-election and Florida was effectively a one-party state controlled by white Democrats, with relatively few blacks or Latinos in their ranks. Over time, many of Florida\u2019s traditional Democratic voters drifted to the Republican Party as they did in other Southern states. The G.O.P. now controls every statewide elective office in Florida except one: Mr. Nelson\u2019s.In a brief interview after a July campaign event in Miami, Mr. Nelson put the blame for his relatively low profile on his having to spend part of each workweek in Washington, limiting his public exposure back home \u2014 though most senators must juggle a similar schedule. Florida\u2019s growing population, with newcomers moving in from other states and from abroad, also requires constant new introductions for a senator who is only on the ballot once every six years, Mr. Nelson said.\u201cIf you\u2019re a senator from Delaware, the population doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis state is growing at 1,000 people a day, and a lot of people that are already here don\u2019t identify with Florida politics. They still identify with the politics up north where they come from.\u201dMr. Nelson possesses extensive knowledge of Florida issues, ranging from the space program to commercial regulations to the environment. His political currency is a product of his five statewide electoral victories: he won terms as the state treasurer and insurance commissioner before reaching the Senate.But the race is likely to turn on whether he can energize Democrats and win over independents by harnessing widespread distaste for Mr. Trump around the state. At the recent Miami event, as Mr. Nelson tried to focus on United States policy toward Russia and control of the Supreme Court, a woman interrupted him by shouting \u201cImpeachment!\u201dMr. Nelson\u2019s plan has been to hold off running expensive television advertising until the fall, when it will matter the most, and to be ready to counter any last-minute spending by Mr. Scott, who poured $10 million of his own money into his gubernatorial campaign in the final days of the 2014 race.Mr. Nelson\u2019s strategy has so far left Mr. Scott free to set the terms of the race, as he has tried to do with the ad on the algae bloom.\u201cTake off the kid gloves,\u201d said Mike Conner, an outdoor writer and fishing guide. \u201cYou need to do it soon.\u201dMr. Scott, 65, has inched up in polls since he entered the race in April against Mr. Nelson, who is 75. Surveys point to a tight race in a state where major elections are often decided by a single percentage point.Democrats say the fact that Mr. Scott hasn\u2019t surged ahead shows that he probably isn\u2019t going to. He won his two terms as governor very narrowly, without receiving more than 50 percent of the vote either time. The Democrats expect his poll numbers to drop once Mr. Nelson starts reminding voters that Mr. Scott was a Tea Party favorite who has a friend in the White House. Mr. Scott, who headed a political action committee for Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, avoided appearing at the president\u2019s rally in Tampa last week.Unable to compete with Mr. Scott\u2019s early advertising onslaught, Democrats have instead tried to help Mr. Nelson by organizing field teams to remind voters about the race. Two women who answered the door during one young volunteer\u2019s recent canvass in heavily Democratic Broward County had at best a hazy recollection of the senator.\u201cMy mom was telling me about him,\u201d said Sandra Renninger, 53, of Sunrise.A few doors down, Susan Charboneau, 70, a retired hypnotherapist who moved to Florida from North Carolina four years ago, said she \u201cremembered something\u201d about Mr. Nelson.What may be Mr. Nelson\u2019s most serious shortfall in the race so far is his failure to keep up with Mr. Scott in campaigning to a key demographic group: the state\u2019s Latinos who tend to vote less Democratic in Florida than elsewhere in the country because many of them are Cuban Americans who historically lean Republican. Mr. Scott, who learned some Spanish before his 2014 campaign, broadcast two Spanish-language ads on Telemundo last month during the World Cup. The network drew higher ratings in South Florida than anywhere else in the country during the tournament.The same polls suggest how Mr. Nelson might win over those voters: by tying Mr. Scott to Mr. Trump, who remains unpopular among Puerto Ricans because of the federal government\u2019s slow and problematic relief efforts after the hurricane.Mr. Nelson was recently endorsed by Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz of San Juan, who became a darling of the political left after criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the storm. And at the Miami campaign event, held at a new Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Nelson was welcomed by a former mayor of Miami, Maurice Ferr\u00e9, a Puerto Rican who praised the senator for having first telephoned him a decade ago to discuss matters important to the island. Mr. Ferr\u00e9 declared that Mr. Nelson has \u201cel coraz\u00f3n boricua,\u201d a Puerto Rican heart.Even so, Armando Figueroa, a Puerto Rican sipping a Medalla beer at the bar, said he had no idea who Mr. Nelson was. Mr. Figueroa has lived in Florida for six years.\u201cWe Puerto Ricans love politics \u2014 it\u2019s like a sport \u2014 and I watch the local news; he doesn\u2019t appear on there much,\u201d said Mr. Figueroa, 41, who like many Puerto Ricans is registered to vote without a party affiliation. \u201cHe\u2019s Rick Scott\u2019s opponent? Him I know of because he has been more involved in Puerto Rican issues. I have a good impression of Rick Scott.\u201dFollow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan to Turkey: The West Is Waging \u2018Economic War\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbdullatif Sener, a former deputy prime minister to Mr. Erdogan who is now an opposition member of Parliament, said, \u201cthe entire Turkish public now thinks that the cause of the economic crisis is Trump\u2019s attack on Turkey, and this is strengthening Erdogan.\u201dBerat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law who was appointed last month to the newly combined Treasury and Finance Ministry, is a useful sidekick to the president, appearing on television daily, bounding up steps to attend meetings and stalking across conference stages, giving PowerPoint presentations.But it is Mr. Erdogan whom millions of Turks love. He won 52.6 percent of the vote in June, 22 percentage points ahead of his main challenger.At every venue, people press forward to greet him and to take photos with him. The scenes are carefully choreographed amid heavy security \u2014 snipers take up positions on the rooftops and a Black Hawk helicopter circles above \u2014 yet the people\u2019s enthusiasm is sincere.\u201cYou stand upright, do not bow your head, this nation is with you,\u201d the crowd chanted to him on Aug. 10 in the town of Guneysu, in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ancestral province, Rize, which hugs the Black Sea coast in northeastern Turkey. The province gave him his highest vote in the election, a resounding 82 percent.That day, the lira fell 13 percent against the dollar to a record low, and it continued to drop on Monday before rebounding. The currency has lost almost 40 percent of its value since mid-February, driving prices sharply higher in Turkey.But Mr. Erdogan promised that the country would pull through.\u201cWe have worked hard, and we are working hard,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhere were we 16 years ago, and now where are we? We will be better.\u201dMr. Erdogan has for years struck a chord with the working-class, conservative base of Turkish society, talking to its members in their own vernacular and addressing people simply and affectionately, as if they were family. His supporters often say they like him because he is one of them, a poor boy made good.He stirs them with historical and religious references, offering to restore Turkey to the glory of the Ottoman Empire. He frames the economic crisis as \u201cthem\u201d against \u201cus,\u201d a national struggle comparable to Turkey\u2019s war of independence against Western colonialist powers a century ago.\u201cThey didn\u2019t leave a thing undone to make our country kneel down,\u201d he said, harking back to the Allied occupation of parts of the Ottoman Empire, in a speech the same day in Bayburt, another northeastern town. \u201cThey demolished the enormous Ottoman sycamore with thousands of types of traps, tricks and alliances.\u201d\u201cThe sapling of the Republic that our nation gave life to with enormous sacrifices now again is on the way to becoming a sycamore,\u201d he added. \u201cThey tried to paralyze our democracy with coups, memorandums.\u201dHe praised Bayburt, \u201can ancient city with its plain, castle, river and mountains, and most importantly with its people with iron ankles but hearts soft as cotton,\u201d who knew the importance of independence because the city \u201cduring the Ottoman period tasted both captivity and freedom.\u201dA few days later, he told members of his Justice and Development Party that the West could not stomach Turkey\u2019s progress under his rule.\u201cThere is an obvious economic attack against Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep our political stance firm since this economic attack is not related to our real economic state; there are other intentions behind it.\u201d\u201cWe have made a big leap in the economy with 3.5 percent growth in the last 16 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is understandable that some people are uncomfortable with this.\u201dThe West also could not bear the enduring popularity of his Islamist government, he said: \u201cThe biggest change we brought was to reconcile the relationship between the state and the people. They are having a hard time digesting that our country has more strength than the distance we covered in the economy.\u201dMr. Erdogan was badly shaken by an attempted coup against him in 2016, and has become bitterly resentful of the United States for not showing him greater support at the time, said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations.His supporters came out in droves and faced down tanks in the streets on the night of the coup attempt, but 250 people were killed in the clashes, including Mr. Erdogan\u2019s campaign manager, one of his closest friends.Mr. Erdogan has accused the United States-based cleric Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup \u2014 which Mr. Gulen denies \u2014 and clings to the suspicion that the American government was seeking to remove him from power.\u201cThe Turkish establishment \u2014 and certainly Erdogan \u2014 still suspect the U.S. had a role in it,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said. \u201cThere are people in the West, and also in D.C., who wouldn\u2019t have minded if the coup had succeeded.\u201dMr. Erdogan used the failed coup as an opportunity to move against his political opponents, imprisoning more than 100,000 people, and to turn the country against Gulenists, the West and the United States in particular.In a similar manner, he has used the recent United States sanctions, and in particular President Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks about Turkey on Twitter, to whip up nationalist sentiment. Mr. Trump imposed the sanctions for Turkey\u2019s refusal to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was jailed and accused of terrorism in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday, Mr. Brunson, who is under house arrest, lost the latest in a series of appeals for his release.Even Turkey\u2019s main opposition parties signed a joint statement to condemn Washington\u2019s sanctions rather than criticize Mr. Erdogan.\u201cAs we didn\u2019t surrender to the coup makers, and stood against the tanks with our bare hands, we will not surrender to the economic hit men,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe will struggle with all we have.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters show no sign of wavering, and in his weekend visit to the northeast, he thanked them warmly and appealed for their help in propping up the lira.\u201cCome on, and exchange your dollars, euros and gold, if it exists under your pillows, for local currency, and let\u2019s give the best answer to them as a nation,\u201d he urged. \u201cAre you in?\u201dAs members of the crowd chanted back, \u201cWe are in!\u201d he commended them.\u201cThis togetherness,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will be the best answer to the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stealth Drivers of the Record Bull Market", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy has the upswing in the United States stock market lasted for so long?The simple answer: The economy and corporate profits have been growing for most of the current bull market.Still, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is up by 324 percent over nearly nine and a half years. Some things clearly went right. Here are three factors that didn\u2019t get the attention they perhaps deserve.America\u2019s financial firms often acted as engines of instability during past bull markets. Banks unleashed lending binges that fueled economic growth and increased stock prices. But when borrowers defaulted, banks pulled back sharply, making economic slowdowns and stock market crashes all the more severe. The financial excesses of the five-year bull-run that ended in 2007 illustrate the central role banks can play in creating conditions for a bust.After 2008, the Federal Reserve and Congress required changes \u2014 like safer balance sheets and lending practices \u2014 that largely stopped banks from acting in such a destabilizing manner. In the years since the financial crisis, banks have continued to lend to individuals and companies as well as raise money in the markets for their clients. And they have remained profitable. In the first quarter of this year, banks\u2019 profits were equivalent to 1.28 percent of their assets, which is significantly higher than the 1.03 percent median return since the mid-1980s, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Many investors feared that stock prices were being artificially supported by the Fed\u2019s extraordinary post-crisis monetary policies, like its enormous bond-buying programs. There were two main concerns: First, the policies might cause inflation to take off; second, once the Fed withdrew support, it could set off chain reactions that would cause the economy to slow and the stock market to fall. Neither has come to pass, at least so far.The Fed\u2019s policies may not have been as loose as they appeared. On a nominal basis, interest rates were indeed cut to historical lows. But what mattered is whether they were low after adjusting for inflation. It appears corporate borrowers did not get a huge break from the Fed: During the latest bull market, the yield on corporate bonds rated BAA by Moody\u2019s (a good and historical proxy for average corporate borrowers) was 3.7 percent on average, after adjusting for inflation. That compares with an average of 4 percent since 1950.When the United States became the epicenter of the financial crisis in 2008, it seemed unlikely that it would become a beacon for investors in the next decade. Yet, for the most part, that\u2019s what happened. Europe\u2019s economy took much longer to recover than America\u2019s, mostly because of the region\u2019s sovereign debt crises and a faltering approach to overhauling its banks. In emerging markets, a six-year slowdown that ended in 2017 deterred foreign investors.Almost by default the United States stock market became the most attractive place to invest. It only became more enticing as large American technology companies kept delivering impressive results. In 2008, United States stocks accounted for 36 percent of the total value of the world\u2019s stock markets, compared with 41 percent in 2017, according to data from the World Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zimbabwe\u2019s Dubious Election", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has yet to prove that the vote was fair, creating a problem for international donors and investors whose help is desperately needed to revive the country. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Last week\u2019s national elections in Zimbabwe were a critical test of whether President Emmerson Mnangagwa was really prepared to lead the revival of a country brought to ruin by his autocratic predecessor, Robert Mugabe. So far, the aftermath of the elections that gave Mr. Mnangagwa and the governing ZANU-PF party at least five more years in power has given little reason for celebration.Mr. Mnangagwa has pledged to investigate the violence, and it may be that he and his party did win roughly what the official vote count claimed. But victory was only one of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s goals in the elections. The other, potentially more important, was to offer free and fair elections as convincing proof to the international community that Zimbabwe was ready to start anew.That was a tough sell from the outset. Mr. Mnangagwa had been Mr. Mugabe\u2019s enforcer (hence his nickname, \u201cCrocodile\u201d) and lieutenant for decades and so shared responsibility for many of the disastrous and brutal policies that had decimated Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, despite its mineral riches and well-educated work force.Mr. Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF and the military have not yet struck out. They still benefit from the hope that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fall turned the page for Zimbabwe, and the country can finally reclaim the stability and prosperity its natural resources and educated population should have.To keep what remains of that hope alive, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s successors must urgently lift the questions and doubts that the elections only intensified. If he is to have any credibility, President Mnangagwa must urgently rein in the military, condemn and halt the harassment of his opponents and make the election tabulations publicly available.Advertisement"}

The hour has arrived for economic recovery,\u201d Mr. Maduro said.Then, an explosion erupted.One general ducked. Cilia Flores, the first lady, stumbled and reached to clutch the arm of the Supreme Court judge beside her. Security officials rushed the platform and surrounded the president with large black shields.All looked to the sky in fear.Mr. Maduro was under attack in what the government said was an assassination attempt, the first such known use of drones against a head of state.On Sunday, N\u00e9stor Reverol, the country\u2019s interior minister, said that \u201csix terrorists and hit men\u201d had been arrested, and that one had attacked the government before.The ceremony was being broadcast on live television, and the camera, instead of going dark when the attack began, panned out over the crowd of assembled troops. In a close-up, a flash of fear came across the face of a young soldier in a red beret. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the right!\u201d someone yelled in the background.Then came a second blast. Suddenly, hundreds of national guardsmen, standing in formation for the parade, abandoned the president, scrambling in a panic to find safety.Carlos Julio Rojas, an activist who was attending a small protest nearby, said he saw a stampede.\u201cI hear screams and I saw National Guardsmen with long guns on the streets, running like crazy. They even pushed an old lady who was trying to run,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine this: Our military are supposed to protect us, and then you see them running like that.\u201dMr. Maduro emerged from the attack unscathed, appearing on television that evening to declare the assassination attempt a failure. But he offered little real certainty as to who might have tried to kill him. While he blamed right-wing elements in Venezuela and the Colombian government, he offered no evidence to support that claim.A communiqu\u00e9, attributed to a shadowy group of rogue Venezuelan military men, appeared on Twitter after the attack, with vague statements denouncing the government, leading some to think that the group was accepting responsibility.And some in Venezuela turned the conspiracy back on Mr. Maduro, suggesting that his government might have had some hand in the attack to fuel a further crackdown against opponents. No special security measures were visible on Sunday around the site of the attack, raising suspicions of how serious the government viewed it and the continuing investigation.\u201cThe idea is if this was a self-inflicted attack \u2014 are they going to take advantage now to double down on a repressive wave?\u201d said Nicmer Evans, a political scientist who broke from Mr. Maduro\u2019s party and has run in opposition campaigns.At 5:41 p.m., Mr. Maduro was at the end of a ceremony commemorating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard, the troops that were on the front lines last year in his deadly crackdown against protesters.Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Chac\u00edn, who lives in front of the site of the explosion, was sitting at home near Bol\u00edvar Avenue, watching the parade out his window.\u201cWe always watch all of the events,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cI saw light and heard an explosion. It was like, bang, I had never heard a sound like that in my life.\u201dHis first instinct was to call his wife, who was out with his daughter. \u201cMaybe something happened to Maduro,\u201d he thought as he saw streams of troops fleeing the parade.As news of the attack spread, television crews sped to the scene.\u201cWe are going right now around Bol\u00edvar Avenue. You can see the images of the police and the national guard officials,\u201d said Neidy Freytes, a reporter broadcasting live on the Venezuelan channel VivoPlay, with the camera angled from the back seat of the car.Then came a knock on the window. Ms. Freytes said in an interview that National Guard troops had ordered her equipment shut off and sat on her before arresting her.Witnesses and news reports said smoke could be seen billowing from a building nearby, which seemed to have caught fire at the same time of the attack. While firefighters told reporters that the cause was a gas tank explosion, witnesses said the fire had been caused by a drone that exploded when it fell.\u201cThe flying thing was going to fall on the street, and then it collided with the building,\u201d said a young employee of a store in the area, who asked not to be named, fearing being caught in the government investigation.For more than an hour after the attack, the country waited, with only rumors on social media filling in the gaps of what had just been witnessed. What was the explosion? And had the president, who suddenly disappeared from television screens, survived the attack?He had, said Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, the communication minister, who appeared before reporters just after 7 p.m. to say that Mr. Maduro had personally asked him to \u201ccalm down the country.\u201dWhat had occurred, the minister said, was an attempt to kill the president with \u201cvarious drone-like flying devices,\u201d and while it had been unsuccessful, seven national guardsmen had been injured.Mr. Rodr\u00edguez praised the troops, saying, \u201cThe formation of the National Guard troops stayed in place.\u201d It seemed to contradict the disorderly retreat the country had just seen.Later in the evening, a new mystery emerged on Twitter: copies of a communiqu\u00e9 attributed to a shadowy group calling itself Operation Phoenix.The group\u2019s message on Saturday night derided the government as \u201ccommunists\u201d and \u201cdrug traffickers,\u201d saying the rebels would give their lives to restore democracy. But the vague statement left a key question open: Had they sent the drones?When Venezuelans saw their president again, on television around 9 p.m. on Saturday, he stood before the podium in what appeared to be the same suit and tie.He appeared unshaken, eager to explain what it had been like to be on the stage that afternoon.\u201cMy first reaction was to observe and have serenity, because I have full confidence in the people and the armed forces and God who protects me,\u201d he said.He said it had been confusing, but he spent the moments trying to untangle what was really happening before him.The culprits, the president said, were known: right-wing opponents and Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, whose term ends on Tuesday.\u201cAll the investigations point to Bogot\u00e1,\u201d he said, blaming the center-right president who has condemned him repeatedly for human rights abuses.The Colombian government called the accusation absurd. Mr. Santos, it said, had been celebrating the baptism of his granddaughter on the day of the attack.Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, a right-wing Venezuelan lawmaker, also denied involvement.\u201cWe want Maduro alive so he faces justice and answers to his people,\u201d she said on Sunday.Ana Vanessa Herrero reported from Caracas, and Nicholas Casey from Popay\u00e1n, Colombia.

{"Headline": "How Big a Deal Is Trump\u2019s Fuel Economy Rollback? For the Climate, Maybe the Biggest Yet", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo put that in context, the extra pollution in 2035 alone would be more than the current annual emissions from countries like Austria, Bangladesh or Greece, the Rhodium Group analysis found.How big a deal is that for global warming? The Trump administration claims it is negligible. By 2100, officials argued in their proposal, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would only be 0.65 parts per million higher under the rollback than they would be if the stricter Obama-era rules had stayed in place. (Current levels in the atmosphere are around 410 parts per million.)But that\u2019s the wrong way to look at it, according to Trevor Houser, lead author of the Rhodium Group report. Any single climate policy from a single country will look relatively modest in isolation. Stopping global warming will require a wide variety of efforts to cut emissions from every sector of nearly every country. \u201cIn that context, this single policy really does have a big impact,\u201d he said.His analysis estimated that the fuel-economy rollback could have a bigger effect on emissions than either Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal the Clean Power Plan \u2014 a federal rule to curb pollution from coal-fired power plants \u2014 or his efforts to scale back regulations on oil and gas operations that release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen nowhere near the same progress in transportation as we\u2019ve seen in electricity,\u201d said Jordan Stutt, a policy analyst at the Acadia Center, a group in New England that is pushing for cleaner energy.The original Obama-era standards would have required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of their new cars, pickup trucks and S.U.V.s by 2025, putting out vehicles that would average roughly 36 miles per gallon on the road. The Trump proposal would halt the rise of those standards after 2021, when new cars were expected to average around 30 miles per gallon.\u201cThe zero-emissions vehicle waiver has been the biggest catalyst to date in bringing electric vehicles to market,\u201d said Don Anair, research and deputy director of the Clean Vehicles Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.There are, however, a few important factors that could potentially counteract the climate impact of the Trump administration\u2019s rollback,\u00a0assuming that it survives any court challenge by California and other states and becomes final.First, fuel prices will matter enormously. If oil prices increase significantly over the next decade, then many drivers might opt to buy more efficient vehicles regardless of what federal standards require. (The lower emissions numbers in the Rhodium Group analysis are based on a scenario where oil prices are high.)But some of these state policies can be politically difficult and take time to enact. In the absence of stricter federal fuel economy standards, states like Connecticut and Maryland that have set legislative targets for reducing economywide emissions might struggle to meet their goals. \u201cTransportation is extremely complicated and it really takes all levels of government working together,\u201d said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center, who has been working with states on plans to cut emissions from transportation. If the federal government pulls back, she said, \u201cit\u2019s a tremendous setback.\u201dIf a future president ultimately managed to put even stricter vehicle rules in place, he said, \u201cthat would certainly reduce the magnitude of the emissions impact that we\u2019re projecting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What makes you say that?Obviously that is a relative term for anyone who works in digital media in 2018. I have an iPhone in my pocket almost all my waking hours, and spend an enormous proportion of my time, both at work and at home, looking at a screen.So I do most of my writing in Microsoft Word, the same program I used for term papers in high school. I got an iPhone a few years after everybody else because I liked my old BlackBerry so much.I also favor using different devices for different purposes, which I realize is a little old-school. When I record an interview, I bring a little Olympus digital recorder instead of using an app on my phone. I\u2019ve been using those digital recorders for my whole career and know exactly how it works \u2014 and I know it won\u2019t get messed up if somebody calls me in the middle of the interview.For the same reason, I keep a laptop in the living room for piddling around, a desktop computer in my home office for doing serious work and a Kindle for reading books. It\u2019s a bit of a psychological trick: My brain knows that each device is for a different purpose.What is your theory behind this Luddism?I think most digital technology is more mature than we think. People have been using personal computers since the 1980s, and smartphones for more than a decade. And the thing about a mature product is that improvements tend to be marginal rather than transformational.So if you go to a hardware store and pick up a hammer, it probably has a better grip and is made of a stronger material than it would have been 10 years ago, but it\u2019s still basically the same hammer. The improvements aren\u2019t enough that you would buy a new one just to upgrade \u2014 you\u2019d wait until your old one broke or got lost. I think more technology products than many tech people would like to admit are at or approaching that phase of maturity.Economics is a topic full of data. What tools do you use to parse that data? And what sites or apps do you use to keep on top of the latest economic trends?A big part of the advantage is simply that once you\u2019re familiar with the interface, which is intuitive, you don\u2019t have to relearn the data retrieval tool for each statistical agency every time. So, for example, I write about the European economy only now and again, so I have to relearn how to use the Eurostat database every time if the data isn\u2019t in Fred. That\u2019s not for the faint of heart.I generally use Microsoft Excel for data analysis, which is powerful enough to do most of the stuff I know how to do on my own. That\u2019s to say, if a project requires a bigger data set or more complex statistical techniques than Excel can handle, I probably will need help from a colleague with more advanced programming skills anyway.Or for a quick calculation of, say, percentage change I use a Texas Instruments scientific calculator I keep on my desk (see previous discussion of separate devices for separate purposes).What tech do you use a lot at home that you don\u2019t use at work?I use a Bose SoundTouch 30 speaker to play music via Pandora when I\u2019m around the house. I basically listen only to a single station that is built around songs I liked when I first set the system up seven or eight years ago.My wife makes fun of me for that, too. She was very amused that I was taking part in this exercise.Advertisement"}

Contributing Opinion Writer If anger were a volcano, and you let loose all the rage felt by people over the daily assaults on public land by the Trump administration, you\u2019d have an eruption with the fury of Mount St. Helens. A Green Wave is coming this November, the pent-up force of the most overlooked constituency in America. These independents, Teddy Roosevelt Republicans and Democrats on the sideline have been largely silent as the Trump administration has tried to destroy a century of bipartisan love of the land.That\u2019s more than mining, oil, gas and logging combined. And yet, the centerpiece of a clean and growing industry is under attack by a president with a robber baron view of the natural world. I write from the smoke-choked West, where the air quality in major cities has been worse than Beijing this month. While Trump spends his days comparing women to dogs, and tweets nonsense about rivers flowing to the sea, the biggest wildfire in California history blazes away. After the four warmest years ever recorded, scientists have now warned that the next five will be \u201canomalously warm.\u201d But Trump doesn\u2019t even understand time zones, let alone atmospheric upheaval.In the face of these life-altering changes, Trump is drafting rules to make it easier for major polluters to drive up the earth\u2019s temperature. While the orcas of Puget Sound are starving, Trump is trying to weaken the law that protects endangered species. And while lovers of the outdoors break visitation records at national parks and forests, Trump is removing land from protection.This is not green goo-goo or fantasy projection. You can see and feel the energy in places ignored by the national political press. \u201cIf D.C. comes for our public land, water or monuments again, they\u2019ll have to come through me,\u201d says Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat with an even chance of taking a longtime Republican seat in New Mexico, in an ad showing off her political chops. The revolt started after Trump shrunk several national monuments in the West last year \u2014 the largest rollback of public land protection in our history. The outdoor retailer Patagonia responded with a blank screen on its web page with the statement, \u201cThe President Stole Your Land.\u201d It was the first shot in a battle that has been raging all summer. At the big, boisterous outdoor industry\u2019s national trade show in Denver last month, retailers who sell to the 144 million Americans who participated in an outdoor activity last year, or the 344 million overall visitors to national parks, vowed to flex some muscle in the coming midterm elections.  \u201cWe hunt and fish,\u201d said Land Tawney, a Montanan who leads the fast-growing Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. \u201cAnd we vote public lands and water.\u201d You will see it in Minnesota, where the 140,000 people who work in outdoor recreation are furious at Trump\u2019s attempt to open a sulfide-ore copper mine near Boundary Waters Wilderness. You will see it in a half-dozen tossup congressional races in California, where the administration is mounting the biggest assault yet on public health, with its attack on emission rules.If it\u2019s self-interest powering the wave, such is the nature of politics. At a time of real peril for the things that most Americans love, the silent green majority has had enough. Advertisement"}

Sure enough, that\u2019s what seems to be happening.Here\u2019s the script: start with a country that, for whatever reason, became a favorite of foreign lenders, and experienced a large inflow of foreign capital over a number of years. Crucially, the debt thus incurred is denominated in foreign currency, not domestic (which is why the U.S., also a recipient of large inflows in the past, isn\u2019t similarly vulnerable \u2014 we borrow in dollars).Whatever the shock, the crucial thing is that foreign debt has made your economy vulnerable to a death spiral. Loss of confidence causes your currency to drop; this makes it harder to repay debts in foreign currency; this hurts the real economy and further reduces confidence, leading to a further decline in your currency; and so on.How it works: stop the explosion of the debt ratio with some combination of temporary capital controls, to place a curfew on panicked capital flight, and possibly the repudiation of some foreign-currency debt. Meanwhile, get things in place for a fiscally sustainable regime once the crisis is over. If all goes well, confidence will gradually return, and you\u2019ll eventually be able to remove the capital controls.Malaysia did this in 1998; South Korea, with U.S. aid, effectively did something like it at the same time, by pressuring banks into maintaining their short-term credit lines. A decade later, Iceland did very well with a combination of capital controls and debt repudiation (strictly speaking, refusing to take public responsibility for the debts run up by private bankers).Argentina also did quite well with heterodox policies in 2002 and for a few years after, effectively repudiating 2/3 of its debt. But the Kirchner regime didn\u2019t know when to stop and turn orthodox again, setting the stage for the country\u2019s return to crisis.And maybe that example shows how hard dealing with this kind of crisis is. You need a government that is both flexible and responsible, not to mention technically competent enough to implement special measures and honest enough to carry out that implementation without massive corruption.That, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t sound like Erdogan\u2019s Turkey. Of course, it doesn\u2019t sound like Trump\u2019s America, either. So it\u2019s a good thing our debts are in dollars.Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s ears.Dan Donovan, who was running for New York attorney general in 2010, said that he did not plan to be known as the \u201cSheriff of Wall Street,\u201d a sobriquet that Eliot Spitzer earned when he occupied the office.That sentiment could come back to haunt Mr. Cuomo\u2019s preferred candidate for the Democratic nomination for attorney general, Letitia James.Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham Law professor, said on Twitter that she \u201ccan\u2019t wait to be known as the Sheriff of Wall Street, the Nightwatchwoman, the Avenger: you name it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019s ready to be the Sheriff of Wall Street. You can\u2019t be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Ms. Teachout said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you are awash in corporate cash and voted to roll back Dodd-Frank regulations,\u201d she added, referring to the vote of another Democratic candidate, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney to roll back regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Maloney, New York\u2019s first openly gay congressman, called Ms. James\u2019 remarks \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cdisqualifying\u201d in an interview.\u201cYou sure as hell better be the Sheriff of Wall Street because that is the job title. You have to walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Mr. Maloney said about juggling other types of enforcement as the attorney general.Ms. James \u201ceither doesn\u2019t understand the office or have the right priorities,\u201d Mr. Maloney said.\u201cYou want to be an honest sheriff and you want to be fair, but you are the cop on the beat. To say otherwise is strange,\u201d Mr. Maloney said.Despite the controversy, Ms. James is leading in fund-raising among Democratic candidates, according to campaign finance reports. Ms. James raised more than $434,000 and now has $1.2 million on hand. Mr. Maloney has received contributions of more than $696,000, with a closing balance of $795,000.In a statement, Ms. James said that she was willing to take on Wall Street.\u201cThe attorney general cannot be a one-trick pony. I will be laser-focused on taking on Wall Street abuses \u2014 I don\u2019t need a moniker for that,\u201d Ms. James said in the statement.But she also said that other issues such as gun violence, the environment and the immigration policies of the Trump administration deserved attention.\u201cAnyone suggesting otherwise is doing a disservice to the powers of the office and the people of New York,\u201d Ms. James said in her statement.\u201cGiven the huge contribution of Wall Street to the city economy and tax rolls, it makes sense that she would want to be a balanced and thoughtful regulator as opposed to a gunslinger,\u201d Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said in an interview.But for some good government groups, Ms. James\u2019 remarks raised eyebrows, given New York prosecutors\u2019 long history of using the Martin Act to go after fraud.\u201cWe would welcome a New York attorney general who prides themselves on being the Sheriff of Wall Street,\u201d Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, a liberal consumer rights organization, said in an interview.The role of state prosecutors is more important than ever given the rollback of Dodd-Frank legislation and the less rigorous regulatory environment encouraged by the Trump administration, Mr. Naylor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Climate and Food Reporter in Alaska, a New Unease in the Air", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy grandparents came to Anchorage after the war. My parents grew up here and so did I. I never trick-or-treated without a snowsuit on. Now my kids, dressed as superheroes, run door to door on dry pavement. Rain keeps showing up in the wintertime. Snow, real snow, has begun to feel precious. My youngest son was 3 before we had enough at once to make a decent snow angel.Since I started writing about climate and wild food in Alaska four years ago, I must have collected 100 anecdotes about things that might be related to climate change. Small things. Practical inconveniences, mostly, and strange observations.There\u2019s the whale meat stored in ice cellars, old-school refrigeration units cut into the Arctic permafrost generations ago, that tastes off now because the temperature has edged up.There are the people in rural villages, used to traveling by snowmobile on rivers while hunting in winter, who have fallen through the ice. I heard a story from a cabdriver in Fairbanks who lost an uncle that way. He was taking a route that his grandparents used to travel by dog sled. But now the ice won\u2019t hold.In one village on the Arctic coast, a woman showed me a shaman grave mound that seemed to be opening by itself. She told me people kept covering it so as not to let out the bad luck. I suspected the earth underneath had gone soft because the permafrost was melting. In a way, either explanation was the same: a bad omen in the shape of new cracks in the soil.There are the off-kilter caribou migrations, the river fish spawning at the wrong time, the once predictable tides of ice that carry bearded seal to Alaska Native hunters that never appeared. More than once in the last few years, very old people in Arctic villages have told me that the sky has changed, that the stars are in a different place. What do you do with that?I\u2019m a freelancer, so I get messages from editors sometimes, asking for stories about \u201cclimate refugees\u201d or starving polar bears that they read about somewhere else. What I see, by and large, isn\u2019t so dramatic. Climate change is often a factor, not a direct cause. The shape of the narrative, though, is always the same: sad or mysterious. You can write only so many stories like that. And it\u2019s hard to know if anyone cares. What would they do if they did?Early this summer, my cousin\u2019s husband and my uncle went to the Copper for red salmon. My uncle has been getting our fish there since 1969. But this year nobody got any. Soon biologists closed the river to fishing so enough red salmon could make it upriver to spawn.Around that time I was texting with my editor, Sam Sifton. No fish this year, I wrote, it\u2019s spooky. He suggested I write something. But here\u2019s the thing: There\u2019s no way to explain what those fish mean in a news story.To get it, you\u2019d have to feel what it\u2019s like walking my children to school in January under moonlight, cold biting into my jeans. You\u2019d have to wake up every morning in the dark for 60 days and look for the sun coming up over the mountains until one day it does. And then you might understand the rush that comes when the birch leaves peek out. Next come the fish.That first red filet off the grill tastes like clay minerals and salt and everything you\u2019ve been waiting for.And even that doesn\u2019t capture it. There are whole Alaska Native communities, far off the road system, where people have been watching fish return from the ocean to the same rivers for hundreds of years. There, in the act of catching, cutting and smoking fish, elders might explain to young people the ornate patterns of the local weather, animals and geography. Words are spoken in languages that will probably disappear in a generation.Alaska Native cultures have survived starvation, plagues of disease, colonization, assimilationist boarding schools and poverty, among many other challenges. Now they must adapt to the way climate change is turning the predictable cycles of hunting and fishing inside out.As I was reporting my story, I called a government office and talked to an official who monitors Alaska Native hunting and fishing. It turned out that he was from a small mostly Aleut village called Chignik, home to about 100 people in southwest Alaska, where the cash economy is built on commercial fishing. The locals also have to fish for themselves to offset the high cost of groceries over the winter. This year is a disaster. The fish just didn\u2019t show up.Alaska Natives are survivors, he told me. If they couldn\u2019t innovate, they wouldn\u2019t still be here. Still, people were shaken, he said.\u201cWe\u2019d have to make an adjustment, a huge adjustment, to survive on something else,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel for those folks.\u201dAnd about then his voice broke, and I realized he was weeping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Civil Must America Be?", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans care about being nice. How do we disagree with our neighbors about guns?The shop\u2019s name stems from a term of derision for the teetotaling, lecture-friendly Congregationalists who settled the town in the 1850s. Those days are long over. Grinnellians now tend to keep any impulse to hector one of their neighbors under wraps.Pete Brownell, a well-known and well-liked local philanthropist, sometimes stops by Saints Rest for coffee on his way to work. He and his wife, Helen Redmond, have supported many projects in town, including a public library renovation and a residency program run by a local artists\u2019 collective. He is also the third-generation C.E.O. of Brownells, a major firearms company whose headquarters are here, which calls itself the country\u2019s \u201cleading supplier of firearm accessories, gun parts, and gunsmithing tools.\u201d Brownells sells and manufactures guns and ammunition. For much of the last year, Mr. Brownell also served as chairman of the board of the National Rifle Association.Grinnell is both progressive bastion and gun town, a place urbane and rural. It is home to an influential liberal arts college with an endowment of more than $1 billion, and also a Monsanto plant. Usually, these juxtapositions are a point of pride, if they are noteworthy at all.The first thing most everyone says is that the Brownells are good, generous people. Their children all go to school together. Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond care very much about making Grinnell a good place to live for everyone. The second thing people say is that they want to protect the family\u2019s privacy. Mr. Brownell\u2019s family did not choose his occupation, people point out. Besides, Ms. Redmond, who is president of the board of the Grinnell-Newburg Community School District, votes Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She has donated to the progressive state-level political action committee her neighbors created last year. Everyone is clear that Pete Brownell\u2019s politics are his own.And while Ms. Abrahamson quietly resigned from the board of a community arts center when she realized that the group has accepted money from the Brownells, she did not say so at the time. Then, in 2016, Brownells opened a massive new warehouse, office and retail complex on the outskirts of town. It looms over Interstate 80. In May 2017, Mr. Brownell became the president of the N.R.A.\u2019s board. \u201cEach of these things were pushing people toward discomfort,\u201d Mr. Dobe said. \u201cLas Vegas broke it open.\u201dThis disquiet eventually bubbled up online. \u201cIt was clear that people had been holding back their feelings,\u201d said Eliza Willis, a professor of political science at Grinnell. A local Facebook group gave them the space to express their feelings. \u201cAll these people came out of the community making comments and expressing unhappiness about the facility and about his election to the presidency of the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Willis said.Others expressed their disagreement and their concern for the Brownell family\u2019s privacy. \u201cIt got quite active and a little heated,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a unified feeling about this.\u201dThe fracas also underscored the fact that no one seemed to have talked to Mr. Brownell about any of it directly. A day or two after the Las Vegas shooting, Ms. Abrahamson said, she phoned his office to invite him to meet with her and another pastor, Cameron Barr, to discuss ways they might \u201cwork together to increase gun safety.\u201d She said that her overture, which she repeated in a Facebook message, received no response.A week later, other members of the Grinnellians for Change Facebook group sent a letter asking for Mr. Brownell\u2019s attention. It was signed by 170 people and published in the Grinnell Herald-Register. The group wrote: \u201cNowhere are mutuality and reciprocity more important than in a small town such as ours.\u201d Mr. Dobe characterized their message this way: \u201cNow that you\u2019re the president of the N.R.A., we think you kind of owe us a conversation.\u201dAgain, Mr. Brownell did not answer. \u201cPete Brownell did not respond as a neighbor,\u201d said Kesho Scott, an associate professor of sociology and American studies at Grinnell. Ms. Scott\u2019s and Mr. Brownell\u2019s daughters are friends and sleep over at each other\u2019s houses. The parents see each other at the bank. \u201cAll of a sudden he wasn\u2019t responding to his neighbors,\u201d Ms. Scott said. Friends of the Brownells, including the Grinnell city manager, Russ Behrens, say that neighborliness is a two-way street. Members of his family had seen the Facebook group\u2019s angry, frustrated posts and comments, a couple of which suggested confronting Mr. Brownell with a vigil at his home. \u201cThere were people that could have sat in a room and had a conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. He and other friends have talked privately in the past with Mr. Brownell about his views on gun safety. He felt things got out of hand online. \u201cBy that time Pete almost had to go to his corner because they had already kind of set the message in and made their attacks. Nothing good was going to happen from that point on.\u201d \u201cIt really prevented any type of conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said.Mr. Brownell did meet with George Drake, a former president of the college who has been working with Ms. Abrahamson and others, on the condition that Mr. Drake keep the conversation confidential. Mr. Brownell\u2019s neighbors say they want to build on whatever common ground they share with him on gun politics. First, they have to know what that might be. (He also declined to speak with me.)His public remarks have been unsurprising in the national conversation, but also strike some as unneighborly. He echoes the N.R.A.\u2019s talking points on the Second Amendment, repeating that people he characterizes as \u201canti-American\u201d are trying to take away guns, which are our national heritage. He has a familiar mix of gun politic signifiers about ecological preservation, wildlife restoration, respect for military veterans, police and emergency medical workers. He has also said that he wants the N.R.A. to be an inclusive organization that supports L.G.B.T.Q. gun owners and other marginalized groups.Mr. Brownell\u2019s tone never fully matched the most aggressive rhetoric stemming from the N.R.A., like that of Dana Loesch, of its spokeswomen. Ms. Abrahamson and others said that they had hoped Mr. Brownell was going to use his role to modulate the N.R.A.\u2019s tone over what was supposed to be a two-year term. Nothing he has said in public suggests that he did. His neighbors may want to believe that his so-called real views, the ones he would share in private, are different from what he has said publicly. They also suspect it may not really matter. Like it or not \u2014 and many do like it \u2014 gun money does a lot for Grinnell.They have also supported a robotics team at Grinnell-Newburg High School. They have contributed to the Grinnell Area Arts Council and the Poweshiek County Community Fund.Brownells Inc., the gun company, has become an integral part of the economic health of the city. Alongside the college, Grinnell Mutual Insurance Company and the Grinnell Regional Medical Center, it is among Poweshiek County\u2019s largest employers. Founded in nearby Montezuma in 1939, where its headquarters were until 2016, Brownells was a relatively small and specialized business for its first 60 years. Since Mr. Brownell joined the company as an executive vice president in 1997, Brownells has acquired three other firearms companies, become a military defense contractor, secured a patent for its online ordering system, opened a retail store and undergone two expansions, the first of which the company almost immediately outgrew upon its completion in 2011. Reversing the trend, Mr. Behrens said, was the city\u2019s primary consideration in courting the relocation. The Brownells expansion was expected to create at least 162 new jobs in Grinnell and stimulate the city\u2019s housing market. There was almost no public opposition to the Brownells project. Records say that no one appeared for the scheduled public comment session held immediately before the City Council signed an initial development agreement in November 2012. With the exception of one letter to the editor of the Grinnell Herald-Register, Mr. Behrens said, \u201cThere was no pushback from the community at all,\u201d in part because there was great value in keeping a three-generation family business \u2014 \u201chopefully soon to be fourth,\u201d he added \u2014 in Poweshiek County. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we went out and recruited some random gun manufacturer,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. \u201cThis was about the expansion of an existing industry. We today have no reservations about doing it, and we would do it again.\u201dThis, says Kirsten Klepfer, the pastor of Grinnell\u2019s First Presbyterian Church, \u201cwoke me up.\u201d A week after the shooting, she preached an uncomfortable sermon at the Sunday morning service. \u201cIf we think there\u2019s no connection between Orlando and Brownells, we\u2019re probably not thinking hard enough,\u201d she said. Ms. Klepfer told her congregation that, the day before the store opened, she had approached Brownells seeking financial support for a new behavioral health program that was having a cash flow crisis. She subsequently withdrew the request. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d she told her congregants. It had become clear to her that \u201cwe like them when they pump our community full of money, we turn our eyes when they pump our communities full of guns.\u201d She has since told another mental health organization she works with that she believes they should not take donations from Brownells.Ms. Klepfer, the church\u2019s leader for over a decade, may be the person with the strongest principled objection to what she sees as the community\u2019s complicity in the firearms industry. She may also be the person who struggles least with the moral complexity and social risk of raising such objections. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019re not a big church,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s mostly me.\u201d The Pulse shooting also moved Janet Carl, the recently retired director of the college\u2019s writing center, to action. Ms. Carl, who represented Grinnell in the Iowa Assembly for six years in the 1980s, said that the shooting prompted her to submit a letter to the Grinnell Herald-Register, the first she had ever written. After it ran, she was contacted by three other people who wanted to become more active on gun safety, colleagues who had had no idea that they shared her concerns. This was the origin of an ad hoc organizing group, which grew after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The group planned several weeks of protests and educational events to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, including a silent walk to the Brownells facility. The \u201cNewtown\u201d screening took place on the college campus but was not a school-sponsored event, and the college has largely stayed out of local politics. Every faculty or staff member I spoke to was careful to say their efforts do not represent their employer. And the students, whatever their reputation for rabble-rousing, have not participated much in this off-campus effort. It was Grinnell alumni who brought the debate to campus. Shortly after Mr. Brownell became president of the N.R.A., Alana K. Smart, a 1968 Grinnell graduate, raised the question of whether the school, founded by an abolitionist, ought to accept money from the family. Ms. Smart, a chairwoman of Colorado Faith Communities United to End Gun Violence, discovered that the Brownells had made a named gift in to the college in 2014. Their gift helped create the Ignite Program, a community engagement effort that brings local elementary and high school students to campus. Ms. Smart and her classmates formed a group called Concerned Alumni of Grinnell College and set about expressing their concerns to the school. In October, members of the campus community learned about the alumni reaction through reporting in the student newspaper. This caught the attention of some faculty members. In June 2018, representatives of the Concerned Alumni group, on campus for their 50th reunion, delivered a petition to the college on behalf of 500 signatories. They asked the college to reject further gifts from Mr. Brownell, because he represents the N.R.A.\u2019s \u201cdeleterious impacts on the quality of American life.\u201d At the meeting, Raynard S. Kington, the president of Grinnell College, declined this prospect of vetting individual donors\u2019 affiliations before accepting gifts, calling it logistically onerous and ethically murky. Mr. Kington, appointed in 2011, has previously suggested that the disagreement over the donation is part of the college\u2019s educational commitment to facilitating civil debate over conflicting viewpoints. (\u201cGrinnellians,\u201d campus marketing copy reads, \u201cask hard questions and question easy answers.\u201d) She was chastised by members of the administration during a break in the meeting, she said, for her reporting. She was approached by Angela Voos, the vice president for strategic planning and Mr. Kington\u2019s chief of staff. \u201c\u2018Really? Again?\u2019\u201d Ms. Herman said Ms. Voos said, as she waved a copy of the newspaper. Ms. Voos complained that the story\u2019s characterization of Mr. Brownell as \u201c\u2018a major benefactor of college and community programs and organizations\u2019\u201d was \u201c\u2018misleading.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kington, Ms. Herman said, joined the conversation to agree. Ms. Voos told The New York Times that her memory of the episode is different, but that \u201cthe basis of the interaction is correct.\u201d Ms. Herman, she said, \u201cchose to combine a donor\u2019s philanthropy to the college with his philanthropy to the local community and then to conclude that he is a \u2018major benefactor\u2019 of the college.\u201d (Ms. Voos added that the Ignite program also had other internal funding sources.)In any event, the college says it cannot legally disclose the details of individual contributions without permission from the donor. It is possible that Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond have made or will make additional gifts under different disclosure conditions.Ms. Willis argued that accepting Brownell\u2019s money is effectively an endorsement of the N.R.A. \u201cThe college confers legitimacy by taking that donation,\u201d she said, contravening the institution\u2019s professed commitment to social justice. (Mr. Rebelsky and many other faculty members said they disagreed.) Ms. Willis also noted that the college, committed to improved town-gown relations, had much to gain by accepting a donation to start a program \u201caiming to educate kids in this community that aren\u2019t the children of college professors.\u201dThe college, Ms. Voos said, is proud of the program: \u201cWe see it as an extension of our mission to our local public schools.\u201d She notes that about a third of local elementary and high school students live in households that are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and few have had much exposure to \u201cthe college experience,\u201d even in this college town. The program has just finished its fourth year. In other ways, the college and Brownells Inc. share similar goals as stewards of the local economy. City administrators have pinned their hopes for a revitalized downtown on both. In 2014, the city and the Brownells company jointly applied for funds from the Iowa Economic Development Authority. They were unsuccessful, but the city and the college received joint funding the following year, which was partly to support what the school calls its \u201cZone of Confluence\u201d project. A two-lane highway that divides the campus and the downtown area has long been a physical manifestation of the town-gown divide. The college and city government hope that investing in this area will connect the campus to the community and bring more money downtown. Here, it seems, everyone agrees.While he has not accepted \u2014 or rejected \u2014 invitations to speak with his neighbors, Mr. Brownell has, in his public role, spoken about them. Many of his remarks to N.R.A. members have traded on stereotypes about liberals. To the considerable anger of these neighbors, he positioned himself as the bemused and indulgent teacher of big-city professor types. In a 2010 profile that appeared on an N.R.A. website, Mr. Brownell took credit for creating what he called \u201ca gun culture\u201d at the college and for educating Grinnell students and faculty members about firearms. \u201cPrevious anti-gun sentiment at the college has been offset by an open-mindedness that never would have existed without a little push from Pete,\u201d the story said. In a 2011 interview posted on the N.R.A. YouTube channel, Mr. Brownell said that the students \u201chave never really broken through those things that somebody told them at a young age, and they\u2019ve never really experimented with changing their thoughts about just a larger picture.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, he had turned \u201ca couple of New York City professors\u201d into gun enthusiasts who visit shooting ranges when they travel. \u201cThese trips are \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Metropolitan Opera and on the way let\u2019s take our pistols.\u2019\u201d Few people had even seen these remarks until Ms. Smart unearthed them last year. Mr. Kington, the college president, agreed in June to denounce Mr. Brownell\u2019s statements about taking giddy Grinnell faculty members to the shooting range.No one I spoke to had any idea who he might have been talking about, nor did they remember Mr. Brownell ever coming to campus to discuss these issues. But they would not necessarily object if he did. Lecturing about \u201csomething he has expertise on,\u201d like the Second Amendment, Ms. Willis said, \u201cwould be completely keeping within an academic institution, the idea of critical thinking, all of that.\u201d All paths actually don\u2019t cross at Saints Rest. Anyone in Grinnell will tell you that there are three kinds of people in town: the college students, the \u201cCollege people\u201d \u2014 faculty, staff and the white-collar professionals in that orbit, which even includes clergy like Ms. Klepfer and Ms. Abrahamson \u2014 and \u201ceveryone else.\u201d There\u2019s another early-morning kaffeeklatsch at the Hardees across Highway 146, just outside of downtown. At lunchtime, farm-to-table Prairie Canary is a popular Main Street lunch spot, but lots of people head to the West Side Family Restaurant a mile away.\u201cCollege people\u201d have been the most involved in these debates. They recognize that they need to bring \u201ceveryone else\u201d into the conversation \u2014 Grinnell natives, farmers, blue-collar workers, Brownells employees, hospital staff \u2014 but have so far struggled to connect. \u201cThere are certainly people on both extremes that want to make an issue out of this,\u201d said Mr. Behrens, the city manager. But \u201cmost people in Grinnell go about their daily business. They\u2019re glad Brownells is here, they\u2019re glad the college is here.\u201d Whatever political conflict there might be \u201cnever really surfaces.\u201dSome people do cut cross all the cultures. Molly Miller\u2019s maternal grandparents owned both a farm in Poweshiek County and a diner downtown. She grew up in Iowa City, but she and her sister attended Grinnell College, and she lives and works in town. Ms. Miller, too, likes the Brownells. She also says their family\u2019s comfort comes at the expense of her family\u2019s own. In November 1991, her mother, Ann Rhodes, was a vice president at the University of Iowa when a physics graduate student shot and killed three department faculty members and a postdoctoral researcher and injured two administrators in another building, before killing himself. Ms. Rhodes, who was also the university\u2019s spokeswoman and tasked with handling the aftermath, was among the first to come upon a wounded colleague, who died the following day. Ms. Miller was just an infant at the time. She grew up knowing that the shooting had a lasting effect on her mother\u2019s physical and mental health, and on her family. \u201cI\u2019m going to inherit my family\u2019s farm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if my family\u2019s farm was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year, I think I would find a different livelihood.\u201d At the Fraternal Order of the Eagles club, I settled in for a beer ($1.75 a pint, frosted mug!) next to Steve Hardeman and his friends Teresa Coon and Roger Van Donselaar. Dr. Coon is a family physician, and engaged to Mr. Van Donselaar, a Grinnell native who has owned a farm for over 30 years. Mr. Hardeman, too, is a native who works in farming. Mr. Hardeman and Mr. Van Donselaar both grew up around firearms. Dr. Coon only recently relocated to Grinnell after more than two decades in the Quad Cities region of northwest Illinois and southeastern Iowa, a metropolitan area of nearly 400,000 people, where she ran a women\u2019s health medical practice for 25 years. Mr. Van Donselaar was pleasantly surprised when she managed to get him to have dinner at Prairie Canary. Ms. Coon does not share their views on firearms, which she cheerfully contested while jabbing Mr. Hardeman on the arm for emphasis. He was quite patient with this, up to a point.No one at the bar made fun of me when I timidly mentioned bump-fire stocks. (These accessories modify a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the firing rate of an automatic.) Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting, where a dozen bump stocks were found in the gunman\u2019s hotel room, retailers like Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stopped carrying them. Pages cached by the internet Archive and Google show that Brownells also removed the products from their online inventory sometime after Sept. 29, 2017; a company representative did not respond to a request to confirm the products\u2019 removal.For gun control advocates, this seems like a victory, and it may be \u2014 or it may not. State and local bump stock bans face legal challenges, and local ordinances banning the devices in Ohio have been overturned. More to the point, Mr. Hardeman said that he or most anyone at the bar could rig a semiautomatic firearm to simulate an automatic fire rate in 15 minutes, no bump stock needed. Brownells continues to carry parts and accessories that achieve similar results, including binary trigger modification parts, which ship to 44 states.Mr. Hardeman told me a familiar story. He is proud that he was able to contribute to his impoverished household in his boyhood by hunting small game. When he hears that gun owners are irresponsible, he tells me, he\u2019s affronted. To him, his neighbors are lumping him and his friends in with a group to which they don\u2019t belong. He said it seems impossible to talk with them. \u201cLiberals want to take my guns,\u201d he said. Virtually everyone in Grinnell has taken great care to say that they do not want to take anyone\u2019s guns. This includes Ms. Abrahamson and Ms. Scott, who says that the distinction between gun control and gun safety matters. \u201cMany of us are gun owners,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to challenge the Second Amendment. We just want to know if there\u2019s safety where there are guns. This is not an anti-movement.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s what I hear all the time,\u201d Mr. Hardeman said, throwing up his hands. Before I could ask, the bartender set another frosted mug in front of me. \u201cNo, someone else got it for you,\u201d she said when I tried to pay.After all this not talking, few people seem to have thought about what they might actually say to Pete Brownell. \u201cPeople keep telling me they want to have a conversation,\u201d said Don A. Smith, an emeritus professor of history, emphasizing the last three words. \u201cWhen I ask them what they wish to have a conversation about, they say they don\u2019t know!\u201dMany people I spoke to brought up the concept of \u201cIowa nice\u201d in our conversations. During my visit, I ferried four hardy senior ladies back downtown after a protest across the highway from Brownells. I asked them whether there\u2019s any difference between Iowa, Midwestern and Minnesota nice. Everyone laughed, and someone piped up from the back seat, \u201cNo, but ours is better!\u201d \u201cIowa nice\u201d could be the solution or the problem. The social contracts of small-town life seem rather less sturdy these days. No amount of moral clarity or urgency has made it possible to overcome the hurdle of getting people \u201con all sides\u201d to talk to one another, even as they talk to one another about dozens of other things every day. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want his family hurt \u2014 and I mean in their spirit. I don\u2019t even know if we have that kind of effect on them or not. But I just think in a small town you just have to be more careful with each other.\u201dThe person who circulates among and across all these local tribes with the most ease is Mr. Brownell \u2014 certainly because of his wealth, if not also because of his fluency in the cultures that collide or coexist here. Our cultural ideas about civility and respect incline his neighbors to accept his silence. While many debate their right to carry big guns or their complicity in the gun epidemic, Mr. Brownell is, it seems, the only one who does not need to answer.Ms. Willis, a fifth-generation Iowan, calls the phenomenon \u201cIowa polite.\u201d And she said it had been tested. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of hard to maintain, because there\u2019s a sense of frustration that he won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have maintained it.\u201d Surely it can\u2019t last. In May, Mr. Brownell declined to serve a second year as N.R.A. president and was replaced by Oliver North. He remains a member of the organization\u2019s board of directors. His work is not over. Last month, a group of Senate Democrats asked Mr. Brownell and six other N.R.A. leaders for details about a 2015 trip to Moscow. There, the delegation met Maria Butina, who was charged last month with being a covert Russian agent in an investigation unrelated to the probe by Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel.After the Parkland, Fla., shooting in February, stickers with the Brownells logo and the text \u201cBrownells, where school shootings are good for business\u201d appeared on walls and fixtures across downtown Grinnell. No one would say who was responsible for them. It was a strong breach of the oppressive contract of niceness. But it wasn\u2019t the only speech taking place in the public sphere. On my way out of town, I heard a radio spot advertising the can\u2019t-miss Brownells Second Amendment Sale that weekend.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.K. Outlines Plan to Avert Chaos of a No-Deal \u2018Brexit\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British government issued its first contingency plans on Thursday for leaving the European Union without an agreement, seeking to prepare the public for possible disruptions without spreading alarm that could undermine support for the entire undertaking.The government emphasized that it hoped and expected to hammer out a deal with the European Union. But in a series of technical documents, it warned that, without an agreement, importers and exporters could face significant new bureaucratic hurdles, that credit or debit card payments in Continental Europe could cost more, and that British citizens living in the bloc could lose access to banking and pension services.Even minutiae like the design of cigarette packs would be affected, the government said.Dominic Raab, secretary of state for Brexit, the term for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, is treading a diplomatic and political tightrope in issuing the warnings. To strengthen Britain\u2019s negotiating hand, he wants to show that it is ready to walk away from crucial Brexit talks with the European Union this year if necessary.But in trying to prove to his European interlocutors that Britain is prepared for all eventualities, Mr. Raab knows he risks frightening the British public and weakening faith in the Brexit project, which he supports.A no-deal Brexit \u201cis not what we want, it is not what we expect, but we must be ready,\u201d Mr. Raab told an audience in central London. But the ramifications of a breakdown in talks were clear from the scope of the first batch of his documents on planning for an absence of a deal: They covered financial services, the nuclear industry, blood and medical products, and exports of goods that could be used for torture.The opposition Labour Party dismissed the documents as meaningless exercises intended to cover up the government\u2019s failures and to obscure the true disaster of a no-deal Brexit. \u201cDominic Raab\u2019s speech exposes the reality that this government is simply not prepared for a no-deal scenario,\u201d said Keir Starmer, who represents the opposition on Brexit matters.\u201cThe speech was thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the E.U. without an agreement,\u201d Mr. Starmer said in a statement.Business groups did not seem reassured either. \u201cBy now, few can be in any doubt that \u2018no deal\u2019 would wreak havoc on economies across Europe,\u201d said Josh Hardie, deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. He added that those who argue that it would be acceptable to shift suddenly to trading under the rules of the World Trade Organization \u201clive in a world of fantasy, where facts are not allowed to challenge ideology.\u201dMike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said, \u201cThe dangers of a sudden and unplanned no-deal Brexit have today been laid bare,\u201d adding that \u201cthe smallest firms will be the least able to cope with a cliff-edge moment.\u201dMeanwhile, Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the council of the British Medical Association, a professional body for doctors, warned of \u201ca catastrophic impact for patients, the health work force, services and the nation\u2019s health.\u201dFor now, Britain is still part of the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union, assuring the uninterrupted flow of goods and services across international borders. Every day, thousands of trucks pass through the port of Dover in England without stopping, as part of a flow of trade to and from Continental Europe.But all that could change with a no-deal Brexit, and there have been warnings of gridlock at Dover, with supplies of some food and medicines running short within days, and of factories losing crucial supplies.\u201cThe free circulation of goods between the U.K. and E.U. would cease,\u201d one government document confirmed, adding that \u201ccustoms declarations would be needed when goods enter the U.K. (import declaration) or when they leave the U.K. (an export declaration). Separate safety and security declarations would also need to be made by the carrier of the goods.\u201dBusinesses, it added, should consider their options and \u201cwhether they should engage in the services of a customs broker,\u201d as the bureaucratic requirements might be unmanageable for smaller firms.Britain would plan to reduce dislocation in some sectors, for example by recognizing medical devices approved for the European market.But consumers could feel the effects, with the cost of some card payments likely to be affected for those using them abroad. \u201cThe cost of card payments between the U.K. and the E.U. will likely increase,\u201d one document said, noting that they would no longer be covered by the surcharging ban currently in place.For Britons living in the European Union, the documents suggest that access to British banks or pension payments might be disrupted. One paper noted that could mean they \u201close the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contacts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities.\u201dAs with cigarette packaging, logos on organic food would need to change, and exporters might not be able to market their produce as organic in Continental Europe.With Britain scheduled to quit the European Union at the end of March, talks remain deadlocked. If there is a breakthrough this year, Britain would enter a transition period during which little would change until the end of 2020.The worry is that the negotiations will fail, leading to a sudden change in trading rules, the so-called cliff edge scenario feared by many businesses.In his speech, Mr. Raab did little to suggest that Brexit was likely to reduce bureaucracy \u2014 a point often raised by critics of the European Union.Mr. Raab said that more than 7,000 British officials were working on Brexit and that funds had been allocated for a further 9,000. Around 300 extra border officers have been recruited, with plans to add 1,000 more staff members.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Booming Economy May Be Little Felt as Voters Decide ", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepublicans say the economy will help them in November. Democrats say it won\u2019t. New data says the full story is more complicated.Republicans are telling you that tax cuts and roaring economic growth are going to stop any \u201cblue wave\u201d in the midterm elections. Democrats say the lack of wage growth, even as corporate profits surge, will impel voters to change leadership in Congress.It\u2019s not that simple.A new survey of nearly 10,000 American adults shows that the strong economy is rallying Republicans and maybe swaying some independents. But many voters still aren\u2019t feeling the benefits of robust growth, and the tax overhaul passed last year looks as likely to hurt Republicans at the polls as help them.Here\u2019s a deeper dive into the latest numbers:SurveyMonkey\u2019s findings, based on five questions about Americans\u2019 financial situation and economic outlook, show consumer confidence well above the level that would indicate a neutral view of the economy. Asked how their finances have changed over the last year, Americans are twice as likely to say they are better off than worse off, and they are even more optimistic about the future.If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were held today, would you vote for the . . .?DemocratRepublican\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total36%8991029Definitely\u00a0Probably\u00a0Lean\u00a0Among those who say their finances compared to a year ago are\u2026Better off11%35111555Same1115461198Worse off621014446If the election for the U.S. House of Representatives were held today, would you vote for the . . .?\u00a0\u00a0DemocratRepublicanTotal2936%89910\u00a0DefinitelyProbably\u00a0Lean\u00a0Among those who say their financescompared to ayear ago are\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better off11%111555Same4611119815Worse off6210146Notes: Excludes respondents who aren\u2019t registered to vote, don\u2019t plan to vote or wouldn\u2019t say how they planned to vote.Source: SurveyMonkeyBy The New York TimesAmong registered voters, more than 80 percent of those who judge themselves better off now than a year ago say they are at least leaning toward voting for Republicans in the midterms. That might suggest that the strong economy is serving as a big selling point for Republican candidates.\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going to change on confidence,\u201d said Laura Wronski, a research scientist at SurveyMonkey. \u201cPeople\u2019s responses are so consistent in terms of politics that there\u2019s just not a lot of movement that\u2019s possible.\u201dDemocrats and Republicans might be too set in their opinions for the economy to affect their votes much. But what about the roughly 17 percent of Americans who don\u2019t identify with either major political party? (In this article, we\u2019re counting people who say they \u201clean\u201d toward one party or the other as members of those parties.) Though relatively small, that group could be decisive in many narrow House races.The economy appears to be a particularly significant factor for more affluent, educated independents \u2014 a group that could be crucial for Republican chances in November. When Republicans sped their $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress last year, they were certain it would work to their political advantage. (Voters, they reasoned, would be seeing fatter paychecks and turn out to thank Republicans at the polls.) Democrats said the opposite: that a bill that included large benefits for corporations and the wealthy would outrage voters and push them to throw Republicans out.When it comes to firing up base voters, both parties were right: The poll finds that 69 percent of Republicans say the law makes them more likely to vote for a Republican candidate, while 73 percent of Democrats say the law makes them less likely to vote for a Republican. (Both numbers are based on registered voters who plan to vote this fall.)When it comes to swing voters, Democrats were right, the poll suggests. Just 12 percent of independent voters say the law makes them more likely to vote for a Republican. Nearly three times as many, 32 percent, say the law makes them less likely to vote Republican. A majority, 57 percent, say it doesn\u2019t matter either way. In modern American politics, the president\u2019s party typically loses seats in a midterm congressional election. Republicans are hopeful that the accelerating economy will help them buck that trend this year. Party leaders including Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, have pointed to the 1998 midterms, when President Bill Clinton was mired in impeachment proceedings but Democrats gained seats in the House anyway, in the midst of a booming national economy.That election was an outlier. Political scientists \u2014 including Lynn Vavreck at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Seth Masket at the University of Denver, among many others \u2014 have shown that economic conditions matter far less to midterm results than presidential approval ratings. In 1950, when the economy grew at a blistering 8.7 percent for the year, President Harry Truman\u2019s party still lost 28 seats in the House.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Worried About Turkey\u2019s Economic Problems? China\u2019s Could Be Worse", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates a weakening currency and capital flight.Mr. Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Many emerging markets make themselves vulnerable to financial crisis by spending more than they can afford, and relying on foreign lenders to fund these profligate habits, but Turkey was an extreme case even before Mr. Erdogan took power in 2002. Of late, his reckless economic policies \u2014 including setting interest rates at artificially low levels, and driving up debts, deficits and inflation \u2014 have only made matters worse. Many wealthy Turks saw another crisis coming and were fleeing the country well before foreigners joined the recent rush, accelerating the fall of the Turkish lira over the past few days.Turkey\u2019s troubles are homegrown, and the economic war against it is a figment of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s conspiratorial imagination. But he does have a point about the impact of a surging dollar, which has a long history of inflicting damage on developing nations.Like many emerging world currency crises before it, this one comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, pushing up the value of the dollar. As the dollar strengthens, developing countries like Turkey have a harder time paying back their dollar debts, and eventually investors start to flee.Now the question is whether Turkey is poised to trigger a wider global crisis, the way the fall of the Thai baht did in 1997. The answer is not clear. The fall of the Turkish lira has had a negative effect on other emerging market currencies, but few of those countries share Turkey\u2019s dual problem of having large foreign debt and government policies that fuel inflation. But there is an even bigger question looming: The strong dollar that is weakening Turkey\u2019s economy may also be undermining the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China. China is vulnerable to the strong dollar for different reasons. At one level, China is far less dependent on imports than Turkey, which has to buy virtually all its raw materials, including oil from abroad. Unlike Turkey, China does not run a chronic trade deficit and does not have to borrow heavily in dollars to finance its purchases abroad. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, however, Beijing tried to keep its economy humming by ordering state banks to pump out new loans. More than half the increase in global debt over the past decade was issued as domestic loans inside China. There is now much more money circulating in China than in the United States, much of it in the hands of Chinese who are constantly on the watch for higher returns.So China also faces a serious risk of capital flight. The last bout began in 2015, amid early indications that the Federal Reserve was going to start raising interest rates. China stopped that exodus by tightening its currency controls, but controls rarely work for long. Savvy locals find creative ways to get their money out. This year, the Fed\u2019s tightening has further strengthened the dollar, while Beijing\u2019s easy money policies have further weakened the renminbi \u2014 increasing the incentive for Chinese investors to dump China\u2019s currency for dollars. Right now Chinese can earn the same interest rates in the United States for a lot less risk, so the motivation to flee is high, and will grow more intense as the Fed raises rates further. Beijing could also diminish the allure of the strong dollar by trying to raise the value of its own currency. But that would mean tightening the supply of renminbi, which is likely to derail the economy at a time when growth in China is already slowing under the burden of too much debt. More than 60 percent of the foreign currency held in reserve by central banks around the world is in dollars, and China\u2019s ambition to make the renminbi a reserve currency has attracted hardly any takers. Global central banks and investors are still wary of holding a currency that Communist authorities may slap controls on at any time \u2014 as they did in 2016.So China is in a tough spot. The strengthening dollar threatens to provoke more capital flight out of China, but any effort to shore up the renminbi in response could further slow the Chinese economy. For years Beijing has responded to signs of weakness in the economy by printing more renminbi, which worked fine when the United States was also running a very loose monetary policy. Now that the United States is raising interest rates, lowering rates in China will only give Chinese investors more reason to leave the country. The fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates this dilemma. Its $14 trillion economy is more than 15 times larger than Turkey\u2019s, representing about 16 percent of the global economy. It is pivotal. For the rest of the world, the collapse of the lira may prove to be a passing event, and China is likely to decide which way this crisis goes. Advertisement"}
