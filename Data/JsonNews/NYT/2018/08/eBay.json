{"Headline": "Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, Infowars was the No. 1 overall \u201ctrending\u201d app on the Google Play store, a metric that reflects its sudden momentum. Among news apps, Infowars was No. 3 on Apple and No. 5 on Google, above all mainstream news organizations. And the app stood at No. 66 overall on Google, excluding game apps, while on Apple it reached No. 49, above popular apps like LinkedIn, Google Docs and eBay.The Infowars app, which includes news articles and the shows of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, had likely been downloaded a few hundred to a few thousand times a day on average after its introduction last month, said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, which tracks app data. Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.The surge suggests the tech industry\u2019s recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles.\u201cThis is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,\u201d said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s gone from being niche to being mainstream.\u201dApple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed.The Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d \u201cWar Room with Owen Shroyer,\u201d and \u201cReal News with David Knight.\u201d Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News.An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store.\u201cWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines.\u201dGoogle said it deleted Mr. Jones\u2019s channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment \u2014 not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones\u2019s podcast and his Infowars app.Google said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, \u201cIf an app violates our policies, we take action.\u201dFrom July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app\u2019s rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days.Researchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula.The Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a \u201cyou\u201d tab for saved articles.)On the tab that led to the outlet\u2019s news articles, a sampling of the app\u2019s stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (\u201cDemocrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!\u201d) to sensationalist (\u201cShock: FDA Acquiring \u2018Fresh\u2019 Aborted Baby Parts to Make \u2018Humanized Mice\u2019\u201d) to humdrum (\u201cCalorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years \u2014 Study\u201d).Many of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley\u2019s removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category \u201cInfowars Exclusives\u201d on the app included no stories.The merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills.One ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with \u201ccensored\u201d tape over his mouth and said: \u201cFight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special. Shop now!\u201dThe app has earned a nearly perfect rating on Apple after 5,500 reviews. \u201cGood to have IW on the go, able to keep up with what the Democrat globalist Luciferian communist are up to at all times,\u201d one recent review said.Advertisement"}

In recent months, Uber has started talking with a few auto manufacturers about potential partnerships, including supplying Uber\u2019s autonomous driving technology for use in Toyota\u2019s minivans, according to one person familiar with the talks.With Uber\u2019s I.P.O. expected next year, the company will have to decide soon. The partnerships model looks likeliest, and employees of the unit are decamping for rivals.The economists behind the paper aren\u2019t sure why, though they suspect it has something to do with internalizing social norms.

You don\u2019t want a PayPal or an eBay or an Uber or a Facebook at the center of a lot of markets, because that gives a tremendous amount of power to those entities, greater than arguably even AT&T had when it was at the center of the phone market.\u201d\u201cIt is not a crime to be close to Wall Street,\u201d he said over bites of sea bass at the Manhattan power lunch spot San Pietro. And he added that retirement in a time of Trump isn\u2019t in the cards:Waking up wondering about my tee time and bridge game scares the hell out of me. So I\u2019m going to keep going for a while.

{"Headline": "Where Words Matter: Politics, Fiction, Romance, Scrabble", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVowsBlair Thornburgh and Josh Maxwell first met about seven years ago at a backyard party at her parents\u2019 Philadelphia house, but at the time, neither seemed the least bit romantically interested in the other.Ms. Thornbugh was home on break from the University of Chicago, where she graduated with a degree in medieval studies. Mr. Maxwell, recently elected mayor of Downingtown, Pa., was a student in the public policy graduate program that her father, David Thornburgh, ran at the University of Pennsylvania. Both had been dating other people.And then there was the age gap. \u201cI definitely thought he was cute in an offhand way, but I was also 20 and I thought, he\u2019s so old,\u201d Ms. Thornburgh said of Mr. Maxwell, who was 26 at the time.When they met again in 2016, the age concern had receded for Ms. Thornburgh, and a sense of possibility took hold. But it wasn\u2019t because Mr. Maxwell, twice-elected mayor by then, was now single and still attractive. She saw him as muse potential for a novel she was writing.She would quickly learn that the protagonist of a forthcoming book she is now working on, \u201cThe King of Jerksville,\u201d actually didn\u2019t have much in common with Mr. Maxwell. \u201cTed Dunker is basically the most unlikely candidate to become mayor of his town,\u201d she said of her character. \u201cNot really driven, not very confident, your typical teenager.\u201dOne similarity between him and Mr. Maxwell, however, was that they both found political glory at a young age.Mr. Maxwell\u2019s 2009 run for mayor of Downingtown, a borough of 10,000 about 40 miles from Philadelphia, wasn\u2019t on a lark. In 2006, just before his junior year at West Chester University, he moved back home to help his mother and three siblings after his parents split up. The move derailed his plans to attend law school. \u201cSo I decided if I\u2019m going to be there and not in law school, I\u2019m going to get involved with the town,\u201d he said.David Thornburgh, who worked directly with Mr. Maxwell on an independent study project while he was at Penn\u2019s Fels Institute, was impressed. \u201cJosh was just this very solid guy who was kind of wise beyond his years,\u201d Mr. Thornburgh said. Which is why, after Mr. Maxwell graduated, he kept in touch. In 2016, he invited Mr. Maxwell to sit on a panel for young political hopefuls in Philadelphia.\u201cThe presidential election had just happened, and there was a surge of interest in getting involved in politics among young people,\u201d Mr. Thornburgh said. The panel he put together included civic activists who could talk about the ins and outs of running for office and serving. \u201cI knew Blair was very interested in the politics of the time, so I thought she\u2019d want to come,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask her intentionally to fix her up with Josh.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cI guess I could rightfully claim to be matchmaker.\u201dDespite what she called her \u201cpedigree as a Pennsylvania Republican scion\u201d \u2014 her grandfather was attorney general under George H.W. Bush and governor from 1979-1987 \u2014 Ms. Thornburgh has long shared Mr. Maxwell\u2019s left-leaning views. She canvassed for Barack Obama in 2008. And these days, \u201cI hang on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s every word,\u201d she said, referring to the young Democratic candidate for New York\u2019s 14th congressional district.When the panel was over, she reintroduced herself to Mr. Maxwell and asked if she could interview him for her novel. Days later, they met for sandwiches.Mr. Maxwell liked that her hair, which she wears in a pixie cut, was pink. \u201cBut what I really thought is, this person has an active mind and can really hold my attention,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to spend a lot more time with her.\u201dThat, of course, is exactly what happened. By January 2017, Mr. Maxwell was whiling away weekend afternoons playing Scrabble with Ms. Thornburgh at her Philadelphia apartment. He thought of her as his girlfriend, though he hadn\u2019t yet told his mother and siblings about their deepening relationship. That changed abruptly when Mr. Maxwell, who has epilepsy, had a seizure in January 2017.Ms. Thornburgh remembers being on an exercise bike at the gym when her phone buzzed with an apology: Mr. Maxwell was being rushed to the hospital and couldn\u2019t make their date that evening. She jumped off the bike and sped to the hospital.Mr. Maxwell\u2019s three siblings were on their way, too. \u201cWe all showed up in the emergency room, and I\u2019m all sweaty in my gym clothes, and they have no idea who I am. I was like, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Blair,\u2019\u201d Ms. Thornburgh said. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s mother, Beverly Maxwell, asked one of her daughters to snap a picture so she could see the woman her son had been worried about standing up.\u201cI got Josh on the phone at the hospital and he was concerned because he didn\u2019t want this person he called his girlfriend to be upset,\u201d Ms. Maxwell said. \u201cWe were all thinking, \u2018Does he really have a girlfriend?\u2019 We weren\u2019t sure if he was confused.\u201dWhile his family wasn\u2019t sure about his relationship status, just about everyone on his train from Downingtown to Philadelphia apparently was. Mr. Maxwell made Ms. Thornburgh a coffee table at Dane Decor, a furniture shop in Downingtown where he worked part time, and he brought it to her for Valentine\u2019s Day via public transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s this big hulking piece of wood, and he carried it all the way through town,\u201d Ms. Thornburgh said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew this guy\u2019s for real. We immediately played Scrabble on it.\u201dIn the summer of 2017, \u201cWho\u2019s That Girl\u201d came out and Ms. Thornburgh completed an M.F.A. low-residency program at Hamline University. She also decided to move out of her Philadelphia apartment and give small-town living a try.Mr. Maxwell was ready to propose before Ms. Thornburgh moved to Downingtown. \u201cI remember we went out to dinner to celebrate the book coming out and I was like, \u2018Name your time, give me your time frame,\u2019\u201d he said. In November, he secured a white-gold diamond solitaire ring his grandmother, who died in 2004, had given an aunt to keep for him.On Dec. 4, Mr. Maxwell, feeling stressed out, suggested a hike in the rolling hills of Chester County. Twenty minutes in, they reached a scenic trail with no other hikers around. Mr. Maxwell paused, ready with a speech about loving her with all his heart, and pulled out the ring, which he had stuck in his pocket without a box.She said yes before he could finish proposing. \u201cI immediately started crying,\u201d she said.Later that day, a visit to the Downingtown Public Library, where the mayor was to show his support at a fund-raiser, turned into a celebration. \u201cNot to be too \u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019 but we were in this small town and everyone we wanted to share the news with was there and so happy for us,\u201d Ms. Thornburgh said. \u201cI just hope we didn\u2019t upstage the library.\u201dGinny Thornburgh, Ms. Thornburgh\u2019s grandmother, lingered in the church with her husband, Dick Thornburgh, who is now 86 and uses a wheelchair, as guests filed into the church yard to toast the couple. The longtime political wife, has been a mentor to Ms. Thornburgh and a supporter of Mr. Maxwell\u2019s political career. (She and Mr. Thornburgh had contributed to his unsuccessful campaign for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives earlier this year.)She offered some advice for her granddaughter as she embarked on a life of future campaigns and elections. \u201cIn the political world, there\u2019s going to be criticisms,\u201d she said. \u201cAlways remember to think about where the criticism is coming from. And love your husband.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeffrey Katzenberg Raises $1 Billion for Short-Form Video Venture", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffrey Katzenberg has a billion to play with for his new short-form video platform.His holding company, WndrCo, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $1 billion in its initial investment round, including funds from 10 American media companies and the Chinese technology giant Alibaba.Mr. Katzenberg, a onetime chairman of Walt Disney Studios and a founder of DreamWorks, hired Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and eBay, to run the show.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like this, but I keep saying we\u2019re two old dogs who have a new trick,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg, 67, said in a phone interview, as Ms. Whitman laughed in the background.Because of Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s track record, which also included a stint as the head of production at Paramount Pictures, any move he makes is regarded seriously.But Hollywood has remained skeptical in the year since he announced his venture. Several executives have argued that there is little evidence to support the notion that viewers are craving short programming. And beyond the initial hype, Mr. Katzenberg has been short on specifics.But now the project is coming into focus. Mr. Katzenberg announced on Tuesday that 10 major studios had signed on as backers: the Walt Disney Company, Entertainment One, 21st Century Fox, ITV, Lionsgate, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Viacom and Warner Media.Strategic partners include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Global. Ms. Whitman said the biggest investor was Madrone Capital Partners, which has connections to the Walton family of Walmart fame (the retail giant is not itself an investor).And perhaps most intriguing: Mr. Katzenberg has managed to land an investment from Alibaba, although China has remained off limits for many media companies, including Netflix.The $1 billion from investors allows NewTV to begin licensing original programs, particularly from the media companies that have come aboard. Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s company will not own the content it streams for on-the-go viewing.NewTV has also rented out a few floors at a co-working space in West Hollywood, Calif. There are seven people on staff, and Ms. Whitman said she expected that number to move past 200 by 2020. Neither Ms Whitman nor Mr. Katzenberg revealed a date for when NewTV will go live.Mr. Katzenberg insisted that his service, which will be available by subscription, is playing in a different arena. Rather than competing with Netflix or HBO, it will target viewers looking for quick-hit fare to help them pass the time when they are, for example, on the subway or waiting in line at Starbucks.Higher production values will distinguish NewTV\u2019s programming from the majority of video shorts that gain traction on YouTube, Mr. Katzenberg said. And he trusts that viewers will appreciate the difference.Writers, producers and directors have been able to please their audiences, he added, but not so much in the area of shorter content.\u201cWe keep coming up with new ways to exceed the expectation of our customers,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said, referring to the rise of cable, DVDs and streaming. \u201cExcept now, for the first time in history, we have a whole generation of customers that have a new consumption habit, with this thing called short-form content. And the professional enterprise of storytellers in Hollywood is nowhere near it.\u201cCustomers are ahead of them for the first time,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to chase and catch up with them. They\u2019re doing something and we\u2019re not a part of it. That\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For a Major Disney Collector, It\u2019s the Magic Hour", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTime to sell years of theme-park memorabilia.LOS ANGELES \u2014 In what used to be a Sports Authority store, wedged between a PetSmart and a Ross Dress for Less in the busy-by-day neighborhood of Sherman Oaks, now stands a 48-foot-long sea serpent, a talking macaw with a Mexican accent, and a temporarily grounded 800-pound flying fiberglass elephant.These colorful curiosities and hundreds more are part of a temporary exhibit called \u201cThat\u2019s From Disneyland!\u201d All of them (even the Country Bear Jamboree postcard machine and the triangular Tinker Bell parking-lot sign) belong to one man, Richard Kraft, who has been amassing big-ticket Disneyland-related objects for 25 years.Instead now there is a refurbished 16-foot red neon \u201cD\u201d that used to hang on the Disneyland Hotel, a Davy Crockett Explorer canoe that once navigated the tourist mecca\u2019s so-called Rivers of America, four large macabre portrait paintings from the Haunted Mansion\u2019s \u201cstretching room,\u201d and so much more. \u201cI have met other very dedicated Disneyland collectors, but Richard has out-collected them all, times a hundred,\u201d said Charles Phoenix, a self-described \u201cretro pop-culture humorist\u201d who wrote the book \u201cAddicted to Americana.\u201d \u201cNothing even comes close to the volume and completeness of his collection.\u201d On Aug. 25, however, he is abdicating.Starting then, he is putting his happy holdings on the auction block, with estimated prices ranging from $50 for a set of Haunted Mansion \u201chitchhiking ghost\u201d souvenir beanbags to $150,000 for a Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride vehicle. \u201cI\u2019m getting rid of everything,\u201d Mr. Kraft said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m of the philosophy that if I kept one thing, I\u2019d keep two and then we\u2019d be selling just one Mickey Mouse piece of plastic, and we don\u2019t want that.\u201dA portion of the proceeds from the two-day auction, and related events like an intimate concert by Mr. Menken on Aug. 24, will go to help children with special needs. Mr. Kraft\u2019s 4-year-old daughter was born with the genetic disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome, which can cause learning disabilities.Mr. Kraft, who is in his late 50s, began collecting Disneyana, as this genus of collectibles is called, out of nostalgia. Shortly after his older brother died, he visited Disneyland. Memories came rushing back of the fun he had in childhood on his family\u2019s annual vacations to the park from their home in Bakersfield, about three hours away. Soon after, he bought a vintage attraction poster for the Autopia ride. From there it was a quick swerve into the fast lane of collecting.\u201cI\u2019m a very obsessive person, so one poster became every poster,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cEvery poster became ride vehicles. Ride vehicles became conceptual art.\u201d \u201cThat house was exactly as you\u2019d expect, big and very beautifully appointed with collectibles,\u201d Mr. Phoenix said. \u201cIt was an enchanted place.\u201dMost particularly the former bedroom of Mr. Kraft\u2019s son Nicholas, 28, which was decorated to look like Walt Disney\u2019s Enchanted Tiki Room, as the attraction is officially called, with bamboo walls and a thatched ceiling. \u201cI think my dad used me as an excuse for collecting,\u201d Nicholas said. He had a childhood roommate: Jos\u00e9 the audio-animatronic parrot, whom no one knew could still speak until the bird was spruced up for the coming auction. \u201cNow all I can think of is what a different childhood I would have had if every morning, Jos\u00e9 had woken me up,\u201d Nicholas said.In recent years, as his father sold the Encino house and moved to another home not very far from the exhibit, the collection was mostly locked away in a half-dozen storage spaces. \u201cThe ones you drive by on the freeway with a crystal meth guy on one side, stolen goods on the other and Dumbo in the middle,\u201d Richard Kraft said.And his company, Kraft-Engel Management, now not only represents such disparate clients as Moby, Marc Shaiman, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, but also produces theatrical endeavors using their work. Mr. Kraft has overseen various Disney spectaculars at the Hollywood Bowl, including a 2016 screening and concert of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d featuring Sara Bareilles, and, this past spring, of \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d with Zooey Deschanel.\u201cAll of a sudden, making things became more interesting than owning things,\u201d Mr. Kraft said. \u201cIt all started to make sense.\u201dGiven Mr. Kraft\u2019s innate showmanship, he was bound not to simply get rid of his treasure trove, but, as he said, \u201cgive it a grand bon voyage party.\u201d Thus this large-scale exhibit overseen by Mike Van Eaton, the owner of a gallery also in Sherman Oaks, and a series of special events such as a retro-Disneyland slide show by Mr. Phoenix, a signing by the midcentury modern artist Josh Agle (known as Shag), a presentation by the film critic Leonard Maltin and various concerts.\u201cRichard is almost manic in his quest that people have a good time,\u201d Mr. Agle said. At the exhibit, he added, \u201cRichard walks up to strangers and tells them about a piece they\u2019re looking at, and many times they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s his collection. He\u2019s like Willy Wonka giving a tour of his factory.\u201dMr. Kraft is treating the exhibit as a chance to walk in the shoes of his idol, the Disney founder. \u201cThis is the closest I\u2019m ever going to get to the Walt experience, and I\u2019m really enjoying it,\u201d he said.As he toured \u201cThat\u2019s From Disneyland!\u201d on a Friday in early August, he encountered awed families, fellow collectors scoping potential purchases, and one former schoolmate from Bakersfield who didn\u2019t know him back in the day, but who began sobbing when she realized their connection. \u201cOver an Autopia poster,\u201d Nicholas Kraft said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen people cry at this exhibit,\u201d Mr. Van Eaton said. \u201cIt brings back so many memories.\u201dThat day, Mr. Kraft walked over to a large wooden keyboard from the former Swiss Family Treehouse, a musical prop that used to blare Buddy Baker\u2019s bouncy song \u201cSwisskapolka\u201d throughout Adventureland, and joked with the crowd gathered around him. \u201cI found an old vintage newsreel of Walt Disney on opening day of this attraction and there he was leaning on it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got goose bumps to think that Walt touched my organ!\u201dNicholas Kraft shook his head and smiled at his father. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him happier,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Where Fairies Are Real. (Just Squint.)", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurfacingLiving among us are hundreds of fairy gardeners, who maintain a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy by embracing miniature gardening with fairies, gnomes and other mythical figurines. Most of the hundreds of fairy gardeners gathered at a nursery near Cleveland were adults who seek a sense of childlike wonder by embracing the fantasy element of miniature gardening with fairies, gnomes and other mythical figurines.But childlike wonder was on display, too. \u201cI knew unicorns and fairies were real!\u201d a 5-year-old girl shrieked to her mother at the first Ohio Fairy Gardening Festival in Perry, Ohio. For some in attendance, what stood before her was a majestic unicorn. For others, it was a miniature horse with a dyed rainbow mane and a horn strapped firmly on its head.To embrace this festival, imagination is required.As we walk through her trail of 15 fairy gardens, she proudly points out one of her favorites: \u201cI found a fairy in a wheelchair this year, she was smiling. I made sure I put her outside the fence to show that she has mobility, that she wasn\u2019t stuck at home.\u201dRita McCroskey, 62, of Painesville, Ohio, started fairy gardening four years ago after her son died in a car crash. Her fairy garden was her sanctuary. \u201cI believe in fairies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re special \u2014 they\u2019re magical. They\u2019re very magical. That\u2019s why I believe in them. You just have to have an imagination.\u201dThe festival grew out of Ms. Cole\u2019s desire to meet the communities of fairy gardeners she oversaw on Facebook. She dismisses the notion that fairies are real, but her members do not seem to mind. \u201cI have people coming into the groups from Dubai, South Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re from all over the world. It crosses gender, race, religion \u2014 everything. We all have this in common, and it does take us away from the real world a little bit. It\u2019s a kinder, gentler place.\u201d \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my calling,\u201d said Ms. Keith, 30, who started her creations two years ago after seeing friends share their fairy creations on Facebook. It has since became a full-fledged business, selling locally in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Ms. Keith prides herself on distancing her family from screen time and embracing nature. She rides into the woods on four-wheelers with her husband and son to gather materials. \u201cPeople like fantasy world more than the real world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real world is depressing. This is pure.\u201d Art Millican Jr., 63, a former Disney Imagineer and artist involved with creating Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch, felt frustrated that the children around Blairsville, Ga., relied on technology for entertainment and did not have an outlet to create and to explore their imaginations. \u201cI never grew up,\u201d he said. With a considerable amount of land at his disposal, Mr. Millican brought the concept for Sleepy Hollow to life.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get kids to use their imaginations again,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieving in something that may or may not be real, to a child, that can stay with them forever.\u201d Strolling through Fairy Lane, a creation of colorful fairy and hobbit houses by Mr. Millican, feels as if you have been catapulted to the Mickey\u2019s ToonTown version of a fairy village. It includes life-size houses that can accommodate children and adults alike. \u201cIt\u2019s what Disney would teach you: to become part of the film,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf everything was so tiny that the kids couldn\u2019t go outside, it starts to lose the magic. If you can go inside the magical houses, it brings it that much more to life.\u201d The community is big, but the business is bigger. Mr. Millican estimates he has sold more than 20,000 fairy houses, with prices ranging from $49 to at least $500. One customer even asked Mr. Millican to create an actual fairy home to live in. He politely declined: \u201cI\u2019m not a contractor.\u201dJulie Breckel, 59, a fairy gardener from Parma Heights, Ohio, who attended Ms. Cole\u2019s workshops so she can begin making her own pieces, says she has spent over $2,000 on her fairy garden. As she has acquired more fairies, she has slowly begun taking over prime real estate in her husband\u2019s garden. \u201cYou could do a separate story on the marital problems caused by fairy gardens,\u201d another workshop attendee chimed in. The price points for materials range from thrift store scores to thousands of dollars for fairy castles on Etsy. It is possible to find fairy gardening supplies in chain stores, but that negates the very ethos for artists like Lori Tanner. \u201cI got frustrated because when you go to Michaels or Hobby Lobby, everything they have is plastic resin,\u201d said Ms. Tanner, who sells under the name Elysium Glen. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the fairies are about. They\u2019re about the natural elements; it should be as natural as possible.\u201d Shawne Keane, 46, president of Olde Towne Gardens Nursery in East Setauket, N.Y., has become known for his extravagant, themed fairy gardens and workshops, including ones based on \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d At a workshop on Star Wars Day, Mr. Keane explained to 5-year-old boys and older women that he dug into his 1977 collection and scoured eBay for used toys to create his Star Wars fairy garden.

{"Headline": "Brands Try to Convince New Generations Products Aren\u2019t Just for Their Parents", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn June, Planters\u2019 iconic Mr. Peanut popped up on social media to peddle a canister of Cheez Balls.\u201cWe got almost 1.5 billion impressions,\u201d said Eduardo Luz, president of the United States grocery business at Kraft Heinz, which owns Planters Cheez Balls. \u201cIt\u2019s a marketer\u2019s dream.\u201dTen days after the canister\u2019s sale, the company announced that Cheez Balls would return for a limited time.Planters is among a growing number of brands reintroducing products for new generations.\u201cWhat\u2019s old is new again,\u201d said Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys, a research company. \u201cBrands are trying not to be static.\u201dNaysayers contend that younger generations may be skeptical and quick to dismiss products that they identify with their parents or grandparents as outdated and boring. But others disagree.\u201cThey do not see it as nostalgia, but rather as legacy and a new experience,\u201d according to a report by NPD Group, a market research firm.But legacy brands still need to connect. Younger people want brands with a conscience \u2014 whether the companies take a stand on social issues like the environment and the #MeToo movement, or use ingredients that are environmentally friendly.\u201cThis is a generation that really values a brand that has values,\u201d said Brad Fay, chief commercial officer at Engagement Labs, a company that analyses conversations about brands.\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant, just brilliant,\u201d said Paul Friederichsen, a partner at the Blake Project, a brand marketing and consulting firm. \u201cThe emotional content is outstanding. It creates an incredible image for the product.\u201dAuthenticity certainly helps. \u201cThere are so many examples of corporations supporting nonprofits and the relationship doesn\u2019t go much further than the marketing,\u201d said JD Bergeron, executive director of International Bird Rescue. But that\u2019s not the case with Dawn, he said, adding, \u201cWe literally use the soap every single day, and it is our product of choice.\u201dSunnyD, formerly Sunny Delight, had waned in popularity since its heyday in the \u201980s and \u201990s. When Brynwood Partners acquired the brand in 2016 and merged it into its Harvest Hill Beverage unit, it saw opportunity.It started a marketing campaign in August aimed at transforming its image through new packaging, an updated logo and high-energy video ads on social media, in movie theaters and on television. The ads feature teenagers with unique talents \u2014 including a bike acrobat and a tech whiz \u2014 all holding bottles of SunnyD while the commercial\u2019s hip-hop jingle plays.\u201cWe know that today\u2019s youth are very much into individualism and embracing the unique qualities of their peers,\u201d said Jim Gerbo, vice president of marketing at Sunny Delight Beverages, which auditioned more than 100 teenagers before choosing the final six. \u201cAnd we think that SunnyD has a one-of-a-kind taste.\u201dAaron Perlut, founder and managing partner of the brand consulting firm Elasticity, thinks SunnyD is on the right track, he said. He noted that Pabst Blue Ribbon was a rare sight in bars and stores when it was acquired in 2014. But the beer\u2019s image was revamped thanks in part to an advertising blitz using National Public Radio, digital and guerrilla marketing.\u201cToday, you see it in a lot of bars, you see it on tap, you see it prominently on supermarket shelves,\u201d Mr. Perlut said.But not every refresh has worked.When Kellogg\u2019s Special K started a campaign to appeal to younger women last year, its ad showed women engaged in energetic activities, along with an affirmation: \u201cWe eat.\u201d Some found it condescending and patronizing to portray \u201ceating\u201d as some feat that women had accomplished. Others found it confusing since everybody eats.Special K wound up pulling the ads and changing the slogan to \u201cwe fuel ourselves.\u201d\u201cWe listened and responded to reactions in real time,\u201d said Christie Crouch, director of Special K Brand Marketing.Then there was IHOP, which faced a backlash on social media when it said it was changing its name to IHOB, after adding a new line of burgers to its menu. Later it claimed the name change was a joke, leaving some customers feeling duped.IHOP may have gotten \u201cmillions of dollars in unpaid media exposure,\u201d Mr. Friederichsen of the Blake Project said. \u201cBut I think long term they\u2019ve done damage to their brand.\u201dIt\u2019s critical that brands refresh and reach out to new generations. Their future depends on it.\u201cIt\u2019s essential,\u201d Mr. Perlut of Elasticity said. \u201cAs audiences age, they die, and you need to continually refresh your consumer base. And if you\u2019re not doing that, your product ends up being just a footnote in history.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the business unit that SunnyD was merged into when it was acquired by Brynwood Partners in 2016. It is Harvest Hill, not Heritage Hill.Advertisement"}
