{"Headline": "They\u2019re Falsely Accused of Shoplifting, but Retailers Demand Penalties", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Walmart and other companies are using aggressive legal tactics to get the money back, demanding payments even when people haven\u2019t been convicted of wrongdoing.Supported byMOBILE, Ala. \u2014 Crystal Thompson was at home watching the Rose Bowl parade when a county sheriff came to arrest her for shoplifting from the local Walmart.Ms. Thompson, 43, was baffled and scared. An agoraphobic, she had not shopped at a Walmart in more than a year. She was taken to a Mobile jail, searched, held in a small room and required to remove her false teeth, something she didn\u2019t even do in front of her husband.Four days after she returned home, the letters from Walmart\u2019s lawyer started to arrive. The lawyer demanded that Ms. Thompson pay the company $200 or face a possible lawsuit. She received three letters over two months in early 2016.Shoplifting is an intractable problem for retailers, costing stores more than $17 billion a year, according to an industry estimate. To get the money back, many companies employ aggressive legal tactics and take advantage of loosely written state laws, pushing for restitution even when people have not been convicted of wrongdoing.Many of the laws were established so retailers could pursue shoplifters without clogging up the courts. Retailers, though, often move on both fronts, pressing criminal charges against suspects, while demanding that they pay up before cases are resolved.In many states, retailers do not have to return the money they collect if the cases are ultimately dismissed or the people are cleared. A Walmart executive, in a court deposition, acknowledged that the company did not follow up to check on whether people it sought money from had been convicted of shoplifting.Walmart and other companies have created well-oiled operations, hiring law firms to send tens of thousands of letters a year. Walmart set a collection goal of about $6 million in 2016 for one of its go-to firms, Palmer Reifler & Associates, according to a court paper filed as part of a lawsuit Ms. Thompson brought against the retailer. The firm also pointed out to Walmart that minors tended to pay off more frequently, the filing said.\u201cIt is my word against this company,\u201d said Ms. Thompson, whose criminal case was dismissed after no one from Walmart appeared at a hearing to testify against her. \u201cI\u2019m nobody special. I didn\u2019t feel like I had a prayer.\u201dWalmart declined to comment on individual cases, citing continuing litigation.\u201cWhile there are multiple steps that our associates follow before initiating a civil claim against a customer, people can make mistakes,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are deeply sorry when that happens. We continually evaluate the effectiveness and benefit of our programs.\u201dStarting decades ago, the retail industry lobbied state legislatures for legal recourse to pursue shoplifters with fines. Retailers argued that the penalties would go a long way toward deterring future theft, and that rampant shoplifting ate into already thin profit margins, potentially raising prices for consumers.In Illinois, a 2015 proposal to reduce the penalties that retailers can demand from shoplifting suspects died in the legislature. One of the bill\u2019s sponsors said an industry lobbyist had warned him that the issue was a \u201cthird rail\u201d among retailers with deep political influence in the state.\u201cThere is no evidence that these laws have decreased shoplifting or decriminalized petty crime at all,\u201d said Ryan Sullivan, an assistant professor at the Nebraska College of Law who studies the impact of shoplifting laws.Yatarra McQueen got ensnared in the system after she exchanged an inflatable mattress for a grill at a Walmart in Montgomery, Ala.Store employees suspected that she had stolen the mattress. But they let her make the exchange and leave the store.A few days later, Ms. McQueen found an arrest warrant in her mailbox. She drove to a detention center, where she was searched and made to wear a blue jump suit.At the same time, Walmart forwarded her name to Palmer Reifler. The firm sent her two letters demanding that she pay $200 or face a potential lawsuit on top of the criminal charge, according to a suit she later filed against Walmart. Ms. McQueen said she was scared of being sued, but she did not have the money to pay.\u201cThe most powerful company in the world called me a thief,\u201d Ms. McQueen said in a court document. \u201cI was terrified.\u201dNo one from Walmart showed up at her criminal trial, and the case was dismissed. While she was awaiting trial, Ms. McQueen said, her temporary nursing license was put on hold for nearly six months.\u201cThis is an unpopular constituency,\u201d said Christian Schreiber, a lawyer who filed a lawsuit in California state court against Home Depot over the practice. The suit resulted in a settlement for about 3,500 people who received demand letters from Palmer Reifler. \u201cThese are people accused of theft, so there is not a big interest in their rights.\u201dIn Burlington, N.C., Anna Marie Martin said two police officers \u201cthrew\u201d her on a couch, handcuffed her and took her to jail, according to a lawsuit she filed against Walmart. Her alleged crime: stealing a Bryan Adams CD and two others, totaling $25.62, then hitting a car in the Walmart parking lot and driving away.Palmer Reifler sent her two letters demanding that she pay $150 within 20 days. \u201cYou may be held civilly liable\u201d for as much as $1,000, the letters said.Both letters were sent before the authorities determined that Ms. Martin had been \u201cmistakenly charged\u201d and dropped the criminal case, according to her suit. A Walmart employee had told the police that she was \u201c80 percent sure\u201d that Ms. Martin was the thief.Ms. Martin recently settled her suit with Walmart for an undisclosed sum.For many, a mere charge of shoplifting can do damage.Lesleigh Nurse was accused of stealing groceries from a self-checkout line at a Walmart outside Mobile while she shopped with her husband and two children. She said that Walmart refused to show her video surveillance footage of the alleged crime. In the weeks after her arrest, Ms. Nurse said she got at least two letters from Palmer Reifler demanding $200, but she was advised by her lawyer not to pay.Ms. Nurse appeared in court three times. No witnesses from Walmart ever showed up, she said, and her case was eventually dismissed. The letters stopped coming to Ms. Nurse once her case was dropped.But Ms. Nurse has still had to repair her reputation. The day after she reported to jail, an internet police blotter posted her mug shot on a popular Facebook feed. Her husband said he had to pay more than $100 to the site\u2019s operator to take down her photo.\u201cI can\u2019t erase what people think of me in the back of their mind,\u2019\u2019 she said in an interview.In a deposition this year in Ms. Thompson\u2019s civil case, a senior Walmart manager at the time, said Walmart did not audit whether the people who received the demand letters had committed a crime.He said such due diligence was the responsibility of Walmart\u2019s outside law firms, which had \u201cexpertise\u201d in the area.\u201cWhat investigations do you expect the law firms to conduct to determine whether these allegations are true?\u201d Ms. Thompson\u2019s lawyer David McDonald asked the executive in a deposition.The executive replied: \u201cWe do not get involved in their processes because they are an independent contractor.\u201dIn Alabama, Palmer Reifler hired a lawyer who had not practiced law in 27 years to sign letters sent to shoplifting suspects. The lawyer said he was employed part time at a funeral home while also working for Palmer Reifler. In a deposition, he said he was typically paid a retainer of $200 a month to sign collection letters.The law firm did not return calls seeking comment.In Ms. Thompson\u2019s suit, a Walmart employee acknowledged in a deposition that he mistakenly accused her of shoplifting in December 2015.He said it had appeared that one of Ms. Thompson\u2019s daughters failed to scan about $70 worth of groceries at the self-checkout line.The employee followed Ms. Thompson\u2019s daughter out to the parking lot and wrote down the license plate of her car, which was registered to her mother. Based in part on the license plate, Walmart sought a criminal complaint against Ms. Thompson.Mr. McDonald said that if Ms. Thompson\u2019s daughter took the groceries without scanning them properly, it was by mistake. Video surveillance, reviewed by The New York Times, shows her daughter trying to scan and rescan groceries at the checkout machine for about 17 minutes.Walmart has not filed shoplifting charges against Ms. Thompson\u2019s daughter.\u201cThey are playing games with people\u2019s future,\u201d Ms. Thompson said.Advertisement"}

But the truth is we just don\u2019t enjoy unnecessary socializing that much.

The Upper East Side, where he lived in the mid-20th century, went from gritty to glam. Hot spots like El Morocco vanished. Yet it would be a mistake to say his images are about nostalgia. If anything, they have a certain quiet urgency, drawn out through faces, lines and tones, that still offer lessons on how to see the world around us.\u201cIn all his pictures, people did not look uncomfortable,\u201d said John Broderick, his son-in-law, who is in charge of the archive. \u201cYou get drawn in. You can tell, besides the empathy, you can tell he had a tremendous respect for the people he photographed, no matter what they did or who they were. He would take a picture of someone, and you, by looking at that, you become that person. You feel that person.\u201dMr. Weiner was raised in an immigrant, blue-collar family in East Harlem. When he told his parents he wanted to be a painter, the declaration did not go well.\u201cHis father, Isidore, who was a Romanian immigrant, thought that was not an acceptable profession and threw him out of the house,\u201d Mr. Broderick said. Undeterred, he studied painting at the Art Students League, where he started taking portraits to pay for art supplies. He switched to photography in the early 1940s, worked as an assistant and joined the Photo League, where he studied under such influential photographers as Paul Strand and Sid Grossman. He met his wife, Sandra, at the League, and later opened his own studio. She collaborated with him on many assignments.He worked here and abroad for magazines, which he felt failed to place world events and social movements in greater context. As a result, much of his later work was self-assigned.\u201cPhotography is too often used for its decorative and entertainment qualities,\u201d he said during an interview with Louis Lyons for WGBH television in Boston in the late 1950s. \u201cMy generation is probably the first in history to become conscious of the great forces that are at work in our society, through the visual media rather than the written word. And this I can never forget.\u201dThe New York photos on exhibit show private moments in public settings, where the viewer feels part of the scene. \u201cIn these pictures, you see the personality of that person,\u201d Mr. Broderick said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t use long lenses. He\u2019s up against them but seems invisible. He must have had some gift to make people completely comfortable around him.\u201dThough Mr. Weiner photographed for only about 15 years, Mr. Broderick said, he did \u201clifetimes of work\u201d in that brief span. Among his notable works were a book he did in South Africa with Alan Paton, the author of \u201cCry, the Beloved Country,\u201d and his coverage of the Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama. Of that second assignment, he bemoaned how the images were published in a way that failed to place this critical social movement in a greater, more powerful context.\u201cI believe the photographic interpretation of the world around us has too often avoided the central issues of our times,\u201d he said in his conversation with Mr. Lyons (which also included W. Eugene Smith).With the centennial of Mr. Weiner\u2019s birth next year, Mr. Broderick intends to put the photographer in historical context, too. \u201cMy goal is to really put Dan into the pantheon where he belongs,\u201d Mr. Broderick said. \u201cHe is one of the masters.

My father just wants to lead a good life with his family. Ms. Pinos is 16.I couldn\u2019t believe it. My father, who came here more than two decades ago and is undocumented, has no criminal record, has always paid his taxes and has three children who are American citizens \u2014 me, my 13-year-old sister and my 5-year-old brother. Two weeks later, I watched as an officer snapped a monitor onto my father\u2019s right ankle. When we got home, we wept in each other\u2019s arms.Going to Ecuador would be devastating for our family. My siblings and I were born in New Haven and our entire life is here. We\u2019re a close family doing exactly what most other American families do: working and studying hard, having fun. My little brother and sister hardly know how to speak Spanish. In two years I\u2019ll be able to go to college, and my father didn\u2019t want to ruin all that by taking us back to Ecuador. We told my little brother that our father was working at the church. He kept asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t dad come home at night?\u201d and would cry every time he left the church. I know someone whose father was deported when he was 7, and even though he is 18 now, he still thinks his father abandoned him. My mother tries to be strong, but I can tell this is all too much for her. I try to help, but she just looks so tired. They used to do everything together. My family now can spend money on only what is necessary. My little sister doesn\u2019t understand that. There are times she will ask our father for something, like a new pair of sneakers, and he will say: \u201cI can\u2019t help you. I am so useless.\u201d I\u2019ve been working at McDonald\u2019s to save up money for braces, but instead I decided to buy those sneakers for my sister. My dad, who worked in a factory, has always pushed us to do well in school. \u201cDon\u2019t be like me, who didn\u2019t finish school,\u201d he would say to me if I got a B. It was harder than usual to do well in school this year. I felt constantly distracted but was determined to get good grades because my father made me promise to not let his situation get in the way of school. When we visit him at the church, he cracks jokes and tries to make us feel like nothing is going on. But I know he is really sad and feels alone. He is stressed and doesn\u2019t sleep at night. The worst part is seeing him feel powerless. He always says: \u201cWhat am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t do anything about this.\u201d My sister asked me if some days I feel like I want to scream. And I do, but mostly I just cry. I miss our family cookouts and trips to a little farm where we fed the animals. Or just being in the living room together, all of us bunched up watching a movie and laughing. We believe that God is with us and that he will help us stay together because he loves us. My father is waiting for the Board of Immigration Appeals, an office in the Justice Department, to decide whether to stay his deportation. But sometimes at night, when I can\u2019t sleep, I feel scared that my father will give up hope and leave the church and be deported by ICE. When my father told me about the immigrant parents and children who were separated at the border and detained, I knew that their experience was way more painful than ours. I have not been forced into a cage or an \u201cicebox,\u201d and as long as my father stays trapped in the church, I can still see him. But I also can relate to those kids, because the government is trying to separate me from my parent, too. I really don\u2019t understand why people in this country hate us so much. This year, I\u2019ve realized that there aren\u2019t as many good people as I thought there were. The truth is I\u2019ve never seen so much hatred. The people who support the deportation of undocumented immigrant parents with no criminal records still think we are all rapists or gang members. They don\u2019t see the good. We work hard. We do the jobs Americans don\u2019t want to do. My father cares for this country and his community, and all he wants is to have a better life for his family. He is just trying to raise three good children. Sometimes, I get asked to speak at rallies or meetings, to represent my family. When I do that, I feel like I\u2019m speaking not just for myself but for everyone going through this. I hope that what I say catches someone\u2019s attention and really inspires them to do something about how immigrants are being treated in this country. I beg people to please have a heart.

{"Headline": "A Dwindling Catch Has Alaskans Uneasy", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "Red salmon, a summertime pleasure that feeds residents through the winter, has failed to show up this season in most rivers.Supported byANCHORAGE \u2014 After just a few hours of letting the current comb through his net in the Copper River, Shane Cummings knew that something wasn\u2019t right. Dr. Cummings, a sports medicine specialist, had driven 250 miles east of Anchorage with a seasoned fishing party, including a few men who had gone to the river every summer since the 1960s. They motored between sandbars to a familiar spot, and slid the wide hoops of their nets into the steel-colored water. In a good year, they could pull 70 or 80 red salmon from the river, which they would later brine in sugar and salt and bathe in alder smoke, their Little Chief smokers puffing in their driveways. They would carry Ziplocs of fish to the neighbors and set long tables in their backyards, pulling fillet after fillet off the grill. But as the hours passed on this day in early June, nobody on the river netted a red, or even saw one. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t usual at all,\u201d Dr. Cummings said.Like many people around the world in an era of climate change and pollution, Alaskans have seen startling disruptions in the fisheries that sustain them \u2014 in this case, the salmon that return to rivers in warmer months to spawn after feeding in the open sea. In the last decade or so, king salmon \u2014 large, muscular fish prized for their mild flavor and oil-rich flesh \u2014 have been smaller, and their numbers have fallen well below expectations.People here have more or less adapted to their disappearance somewhat, by catching other fish. But the loss of red salmon is something different. Smaller than king salmon, with a saltier flavor and flesh as bright as raspberry jam, red salmon are what high summer in Alaska tastes like. This summer, though, has turned into one of the worst for red-salmon fishing that anyone here can remember. Susitna RiverCopper RiverALASKAAnchorageCookInletPrince William SoundKodiakBristolBay Gulf of AlaskaKodiak I.Chignik   100 milesBy The New York Times\u201cIt\u2019s totally out of everyone\u2019s wheelhouse,\u201d said Stormy Haught, the state\u2019s biologist for Prince William Sound and the Copper River area. \u201cI had calls \u2014 \u2018Really? The reds aren\u2019t running? Are you sure the sonar is even working?\u2019 It was very unexpected for the general public.\u201dState wildlife managers closed river after river to fishing in July so enough salmon could reach their spawning grounds. From commercial boats to restaurant kitchens to backyard barbecues, people are uneasy.Fishing has its natural ups and downs, and this year is not as dire as it feels to some, Mr. Evridge said. Over all, Alaska\u2019s commercial red-salmon catch was just above the five-year average at the end of July, thanks to record catches this summer in one area: Bristol Bay, the world\u2019s largest wild red-salmon fishery, in Southwest Alaska. That fishery is far from the state\u2019s population base, however, and most of its catch is shipped out of state and around the world. For restaurants and cooks outside Alaska, the main impact of this year\u2019s red-salmon disruption has been an increase in prices. Here in Alaska, though, the effects have rippled into daily routines and livelihoods.In the rural Aleut fishing village of Chignik, the fishing fleet, the town\u2019s economic lifeblood, has sat idle, as have the locals who smoke and freeze fish throughout the winter instead of buying expensive groceries that have to be shipped in. The village may need food aid to weather the cold months.\u201cThat\u2019s a good chunk of my family\u2019s recipes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt weighs on your mind. Is this how it\u2019s going to be?\u201dMr. Evridge, the economist, grew up in Kodiak and usually fishes the Copper River himself. This year, he said, people don\u2019t just miss food \u2014 they miss an experience that\u2019s intertwined with their connection to the vast, wild place.\u201cUnloading the four-wheeler, the dusty road, perching on the rocks at the river, hauling fish back up, bringing it home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I sit down to the table in November and look at a piece of salmon, there\u2019s a story attached.\u201d\u201cSome researchers are pointing toward warmer water, but it kind of depends on which populations we\u2019re talking about and where they are,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, massive changes in all kinds of things,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be one thing only, it\u2019s going to be a combination of insults that cause these problems.\u201d Water off much of Alaska\u2019s coast has cooled this year, but warmth persists in the Bering Sea, which is home to some of the world\u2019s largest fisheries.\u201cThey would have hit some very warm ocean water right in a critical life stage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey out-migrated into a marine environment wasn\u2019t really conducive to sockeye development and survival.\u201d Higher temperatures can harm the plankton that salmon eat, Mr. Templin said, but there isn\u2019t enough data to explain whether that has affected the red salmon.At Bear Tooth, where chefs and managers taste their dishes every week, Ms. Johnson said they noticed that this season\u2019s red salmon were not only smaller, but tasted slightly different. Other chefs have noticed it, too, as have some fishermen. Some say the fish tastes off; others say it has more of an umami flavor. \u201cIt\u2019s not as clean and not as rich in a way \u2014 a little bit briny,\u201d said Ms. Johnson. \u201cI can taste what summer red tastes like in my mouth in the winter.\u201d \u201cYou know how you know it\u2019s summer in Alaska? It smells like smoking salmon and mud and two-stroke oil,\u201d Mr. Apling-Gilman said. \u201cTo not have that, or to have it be so compromised and so restricted, it\u2019s super scary. It puts everything in perspective, ecologically, politically.\u201d The fishing was good, they said, but there was always anxiety about letting customers down.\u201cWe have to believe the tide will rise, the fish will come back,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cWe\u2019re fishermen; we\u2019re eternal optimists, right?\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified the Anchorage body of water where many people were shown fishing. It is Ship Creek, not Fish Creek.An earlier version of the article misstated the year when the smolt, or young salmon, for this year\u2019s red-salmon runs headed to the sea.

{"Headline": "For Catholics, Gradual Reform Is No Longer an Option", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, there is still holiness in the church. But the sin is so pervasive and corrosive that it is irresponsible to talk about anything else.Dr. Cummings is a historian of Catholicism.I often use a handy metaphor to explain to my students how feminists have historically differed among themselves in their approaches to bringing about change in patriarchal institutions. Some feminists seek a place at the table; others want to reset the table. The former hope to promote gradual progress from within an existing framework of norms and organizational structures; the latter demand nothing less than radical, wholesale reform.When it comes to the Roman Catholic Church, I have always been a \u201cplace at the table\u201d kind of feminist. When asked how to integrate women more fully into the life of the church, I offer reasonable strategies. Bishops could, for example, recognize that the call for leadership might flow as much from the sacrament of baptism as from that of ordination, and appoint more women to leadership positions at all levels of church governance.Long before I was a historian and a professor, I was a child in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The parish and the schools and the priests and the sisters formed me as a person of faith. I am still blessed by the grace of all the many sacraments I received there: baptism, first communion and then twice-weekly Eucharist, regular confession, a memorable confirmation (during the blizzard of 1983) and many years later, matrimony. I treasure memories of equally sacramental moments experienced during annual service trips, weekly volleyball games of the Catholic Youth Organization and daily laughter-filled conversations with the boys and girls who became lifelong friends.In 2005 a grand jury report from Philadelphia tainted those memories, naming as it did two sexually abusive priests who had served at my parish and several more who taught at my high school. Even in the midst of so much grace, it turned out, sin had abounded, and I wept for the victims, who had been my classmates and neighbors.Tuesday\u2019s grand jury report, which involves six other Pennsylvania dioceses, has also devastated me personally. Many names are familiar: I attended college in one diocese, and have researched and written about two others. Above all, I know Pennsylvania Catholics, who are generally more inclined than Catholics from elsewhere to place Father or Monsignor or Bishop on a pedestal and deem him above criticism or even suspicion. The consequences of gullibility, to our shame, are made manifest in the report.I mourned privately 13 years ago, but today I state publicly that the church must come to terms with the sins of its past and reform itself so thoroughly that they will never be repeated in the future. People can point out, and they surely will, that the Catholic Church has not cornered the market on sexual abuse of children and young people. Yes, I realize that. Nonetheless, it is clear that the scale of the abuse is magnified in an institution whose leaders time and again chose self-preservation over the protection of the most vulnerable people entrusted to their care. People will say that there is still holiness in the church, that there are many priests and bishops with good and pure hearts, and they are right. But there are times when the sin is so pervasive and corrosive that it is irresponsible to talk about anything else, and this is one of those times. My once-polite requests for incremental reform have morphed overnight into demands that church leaders voluntarily relinquish their place at the head table.Imagine hearing abdications of power along the following lines in Sunday homilies, in diocesan news conferences, or in statements from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops:\u201cWe were granted privileges because we were meant to represent Jesus Christ on earth. But Jesus said that we should humble ourselves like little children if we want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and also that anyone who harms a little one \u2018would be better drowned in the depths of the sea with a great millstone around his neck.\u2019 We are no longer worthy of your sacred trust.\u201cWe are ready to listen humbly, first of all to victims and their advocates, who might tell us how to begin to ease suffering and to make recompense. We welcome prosecutors and lawyers and historians into our archives, so that the full truth, however damning, might be known. We acknowledge that our system of seminary education is deeply flawed, and ask how it might be reformed so as to produce leaders who thrive as human beings. We submit to new layers of oversight, because the ones we ourselves imposed failed so miserably. We are listening. We are learning. We ask for God\u2019s mercy, and yours.\u201dWill we hear statements like these? Unlikely. But we are owed nothing less from our ordained leaders as collective atonement for the sins of their brothers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Codes That Bind Us, and Set Us Apart", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big IdeasI try to remember that every living thing arose from essentially the same genetic foundation. Ms. Wojcicki is a co-founder of the genetics company 23andMe.I was 5 years old when I first learned about DNA. My mother was talking to my sister about her \u201cgenes.\u201d I was confused. She was wearing shorts, not jeans. But as soon as our mother explained that the genes you inherit have the same basic code, how all of earth\u2019s living creatures are built from the same chemical foundation, I was hooked.Forty years later, I still find DNA to be the most fascinating scientific discovery.DNA was first identified by Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician, in 1869. Over the next 140 years, the scientific community made monumental discoveries that have led to our understanding of DNA and have shaped our ability to decode life on earth. But what has always amazed me most about these genetic discoveries is the simplicity and commonality of life. As humans we often notice the differences among us, and between us and other species, but the larger truth is that we are all made of the same fundamental building blocks. Every living being is made from some combination of four chemicals: adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine (or AGCTs), and only through a simple reworking of this combination of letters do we have the spectacular diversity of species on our planet. Even with three billion letter combinations in nearly every one of our cells, there is just a 0.5 percent difference between my DNA and the DNA of any other person on the planet. And the larger variations that do exist in genetic coding are responsible for the diversity of the world\u2019s species. While a banana, a mouse and a chimp look quite different from each other, as well as from you and me, their biological foundation and ours is still built from those four chemical letters: A, G, C and T. In fact, humans share about 60 percent of their DNA with a banana, 80 percent with a mouse and 96 percent with a chimp. A few simple switches in lettering and your AGCTs could have been the AGCTs of your neighbor or those of a banana.Potentially just as fascinating is the fact that DNA is not merely linked together by unchanging chemical chains; it evolves. Our DNA holds on to the past, learns from it and advances from one generation to the next. If we trace human DNA back thousands of years, we are able to identify common ancestors. This is why you can identify the particular paths followed by the women or men of your heritage based on your \u201chaplogroup,\u201d or the families of lineages that descend from a common ancestor. If we trace our genetic heritage back millions of years, we can use DNA to identify primate ancestors. Move back even farther \u2014 billions of years \u2014 and our DNA makes it possible for us to identify the origins of life on earth. Effectively, DNA is like a code book that contains the story of our entire genetic history, demonstrating how connected we are both to each other and to other forms of life on earth. I am passionate about deciphering the code and understanding exactly how those four letters, having evolved over millions of years, are able to account for our similarity and also our spectacular diversity. It is incredibly exciting to study life\u2019s blueprint during a time when it is within our grasp to understand what it really means.We must also recognize, however, that humans differ from all other living creatures in a fundamental way: Humans have the ability to imagine, innovate and create. This ability has allowed us to pioneer in extraordinary ways, but it has also led to impacts on the rest of our global community.So what makes us human? Although there is a clear scientific definition of the human species, our chemical foundations are no different than earth\u2019s other organisms. Rather than fixating on the differences, I focus on the similarities. Ultimately though, humans are differentiated from the rest of life on earth by our ability to think and advance. As we pioneer we have a responsibility \u2014 a moral imperative \u2014 to not only understand the effect we are having on this world but also to step up and own that responsibility. I like to think that is what makes me human.Anne Wojcicki is a co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, a personal genomics and biotechnology company.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Debt-Shaming of Stacey Abrams", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur pernicious double standard on politicians who owe money.Opinion ColumnistThis line of attack throws a pernicious political dynamic into high relief. The financial problems of poor and middle-class people are treated as moral failings, while rich people\u2019s debt is either ignored or spun as a sign of intrepid entrepreneurialism. With left-wing groups intent on recruiting nontraditional candidates, issues of personal debt and financial instability are likely to come up more often. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a trend now of more working-class folks, especially more people of color and women of color, run for office,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Abrams, Williams and Bryce. Naturally, said Mitchell, some of them \u201care dealing with a lot of the issues that regular working people deal with every single day.\u201d The question is whether voters will relate to these candidates, or if they'll be hurt by the stigma around economic distress.It remains to be seen whether voters will recognize the double standard. Mitchell is convinced that attacks on candidates for their financial troubles will prove counterproductive, since many Americans find shouldering their debt a challenge. \u201cWhen folks raise this as a moral issue, it\u2019s actually enraging\u201d to most people, he said.That may be especially true among young people. Amanda Litman, a founder and the executive director of Run for Something, which helps progressive millennials run for office, told me that while older voters might look down on candidates with messy finances, \u201cfor 20- and 30-somethings, it\u2019s the norm.\u201d Indeed, according to Litman, many Run for Something candidates want to go into politics in part to address the stifling burden of student loan debt. \u201cIt\u2019s something that really inspires them to take on the system,\u201d she said. As the system stands, people with thousands of dollars in debt are shamed, while those with millions of dollars in debt rule the world. There are reasons people want to keep it this way, but they have nothing to do with fiscal responsibility.  Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Governor Faces a Tough Choice: A Senator Made From McCain\u2019s Mold or Trump\u2019s", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cOut of respect for the life and legacy of Senator John McCain and his family, Governor Ducey will not be making any announcements about an appointment until after the senator is laid to rest,\u201d said Daniel Ruiz II, an adviser to Mr. Ducey.With Republicans clinging to a 50-49 Senate majority, hearings on the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh looming and Mr. Trump under intensifying legal scrutiny, Gov. Ducey\u2019s choice carries enormous implications in Washington.And it is coming at a moment, in Arizona and beyond, when the Republican Party has rallied to the sort of nationalist and at-times nativist politics that Mr. Trump embodies and Mr. McCain scorned.The governor\u2019s appointee will represent the state through most of 2020, when there will be a special election to fill the rest of Mr. McCain\u2019s term, and Republicans close to Mr. Ducey indicated he is likely to pick a replacement who intends to run again rather than a caretaker to temporarily fill the seat. Among the names under consideration, according to Arizona Republicans, are Mr. McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy; a former Arizona senator, Jon Kyl; and two former Arizona House members, John Shadegg and Matt Salmon.Other possibilities include Kirk Adams, Mr. Ducey\u2019s top aide and a former state legislator; the state treasurer, Eileen Klein; a member of the state Board of Regents, Karrin Taylor Robson; and Barbara Barrett, a business executive and former United States ambassador to Finland.But even as the governor sought to put off the inevitable debate over who should take the place of one of Arizona\u2019s and America\u2019s most towering political figures, and fill a seat that Barry Goldwater held before Mr. McCain succeeded him, the ferocious debate over Mr. Trump that has consumed the Republican Party for over three years quickly rose to the fore.Mr. McCain\u2019s admirers made clear their wishes that Mr. Ducey tap somebody as independent and willing to criticize the president as the departed senator, whose last high-profile moment in public life was to excoriate Mr. Trump\u2019s July meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president.\u201d\u201cI like senators whose minds weren\u2019t captured,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, the state\u2019s other senator, repurposing Mr. Trump\u2019s caustic attack on Mr. McCain\u2019s Vietnam service and appealing to his party to \u201cget away from this personality cult.\u201dSome of Arizona\u2019s pro-Trump conservatives say that Mr. Ducey\u2019s top priority should be to appoint somebody who is unwaveringly loyal to the president.\u201cI think it should be a conservative, someone that supports President Trump \u2014 I think that should be the main issue,\u201d said Joe Arpaio, the former county sheriff whom Mr. Trump pardoned last year and who is currently running for the seat now held by Mr. Flake, who is not seeking re-election. \u201cI want somebody in there who will protect the back of our president and somebody that will not pursue impeachment if there is impeachment.\u201dThe Republican establishment\u2019s favorite, Representative Martha McSally, has linked herself to the president as she tries to fend off far-right challenges from Mr. Arpaio and Kelli Ward, a onetime state senator who won nearly 40 percent of the vote in a 2016 primary against Mr. McCain. To do that, Ms. McSally has avoided any connection to Mr. McCain, a gambit that has infuriated the late senator\u2019s family. (For her part, Ms. Ward suggested in a Friday Facebook post that the McCain family had timed their announcement about the senator stopping his treatment to undermine her campaign.)Since Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis last year, Mr. Ducey has handled questions about succession with the utmost caution, chiding those Republicans who talked openly about the matter while the senator was still alive.But Arizona Republicans familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking suggest he would like to appoint an individual who, in addition to running again in 2020, would be acceptable both to the conservative grass roots of the party he will need in November, and to Mr. McCain\u2019s friends and family.That search for a safe consensus pick has already left Mr. McCain\u2019s allies deflated.\u201cLike with everything else in politics, these days we\u2019ll end up with mediocrity,\u201d said Grant Woods, Mr. McCain\u2019s first congressional chief of staff and a former Arizona attorney general.The McCains did not offer any guidance, let alone make suggestions about a successor, to Mr. Ducey in the days leading up to the senator\u2019s death. If he had died earlier in the year, Ms. McSally would have been a leading choice, but selecting her now, immediately after she is expected to claim the nomination for Mr. Flake\u2019s seat, would effectively hand that seat to the Democrats, and their expected candidate, Representative Kyrsten Sinema.Arizona Republicans are skeptical Mr. Ducey would pick Mr. McCain\u2019s widow, in part because of questions about whether she would want to seek the nomination in 2020, but also because it could anger the pro-Trump voters that the governor will need to win in November. To those voters, Ms. McCain would almost certainly be viewed as too politically moderate.Officials close to Mr. Ducey said that, as of Sunday, the White House had not weighed in on the appointment; the only guidance they have received from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was to pick somebody with whom the leadership can work.This close to the election, the governor may be inclined to err on the side of caution and pick the most inoffensive appointee. Some of Mr. McCain\u2019s oldest friends are already resigned to that, but in a state that has produced the likes of Mr. McCain, Mr. Goldwater and the former House minority leader John Rhodes, whom Mr. McCain replaced in the House, the specter of elevating a run-of-the-mill political mortal is hard to swallow.Mr. Woods recalled that when Mr. McCain entered the House in 1983, Mr. Goldwater represented Arizona in the Senate, the legendary Democrat Morris Udall was in the House, future Democratic presidential hopeful Bruce Babbitt was governor and a former Arizona state senator named Sandra Day O\u2019Connor had two years earlier taken her seat on the Supreme Court.\u201cNow it\u2019s really hard to attract the best and the brightest into this mess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not another John McCain out there. But I\u2019d hope that whoever goes in there would have same dedication to country over party that John McCain always had.\u201dMr. Flake recalled that he and Mr. McCain had a long discussion one day this year at the late senator\u2019s beloved ranch near Sedona about some of those titans of Arizona politics.\u201cWill people like that rise up again?\u201d he asked on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s tough with the incentives in politics right now. There\u2019s just no reward for someone who wants to work across the aisle and will say something good about his opponent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan Bee: The Rise of Alternative Pollinators", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "Honeybees are under siege, straining the business of farming. Now growers are turning to other bee species to help their crops. Supported byOMAK, Wash. \u2014 Jim Freese grows apples, pears and cherries on 45 acres in the north-central part of this state, on sagebrush-studded land his grandfather bought in 1910.Walking among trees laden with shiny red cherries, Mr. Freese recalled that four years ago his trees were not producing well and his farm was financially struggling. Like many growers, he had been relying on rented honeybees to pollinate his cherry trees every spring, along with wild bees and other insects.But that year, spring was expected to be cool. \u201cHoneybees will just sit in the hive in cooler weather,\u201d Mr. Freese said. He needed a way to ensure more flowers would develop into fruit than in the past.At a horticulture meeting, he learned that blue orchard bees \u2014 a native species that doesn\u2019t make honey or live in hives \u2014 could be used to supplement honeybee pollination. Blue orchard bees will fly at cooler temperatures. Mr. Freese bought 12,000 cocoons and set them in his orchard to emerge when the trees bloomed. His investment paid off. \u201cWe doubled our cherry production from any previous record year,\u201d he said. His wife, Sandee Freese, said: \u201cThe little bees have been a godsend.\u201dThe Freese orchard is one of many commercial agricultural operations around the United States considering pollination with alternative bee species now that the honeybee is beset by problems. Some years that number is even higher, according to Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia and author of several books on bees. \u201cIs there another agricultural enterprise that accepts an annual loss of 40 to 45 percent of its animals?\u201d he asked.These losses drive up prices for farmers who rent honeybees to pollinate their crops, straining their businesses. Honeybee prices have nearly quadrupled since 2004, even as demand for pollination services is growing. One-third of our food \u2014 including almonds, apples, blueberries, pears and tomatoes \u2014 must be pollinated in order to grow. Some scientists warn of risks to agricultural food supplies if there aren\u2019t enough pollinators.As honeybee prices continue to rise, farmers are turning to other types of bees \u2014 like the blue orchard bee, the bumblebee and alfalfa leafcutter \u2014 that have proven to be effective pollinators of some crops in certain settings.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of having the right bee at the right time,\u201d said Theresa Pitts-Singer, a research entomologist at the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Logan Bee Lab.Dr. Pitts-Singer and researchers across the country have been studying how so-called integrated crop pollination \u2014 or combinations of varying bee species \u2014 can help growers ensure reliable pollination. The Integrated Crop Pollination Project, a public-private partnership funded by the Department of Agriculture, has explored habitat enhancement for wild bees, improving farm management practices, and the use of diverse or \u201calternative\u201d bee species.The bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, can be an effective alternative to honeybees for pollinating watermelons and lowbush blueberries. The alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, is responsible for pollinating most of the alfalfa grown for seed production. The ground-nesting alkali bee, Nomia melanderi, also pollinates alfalfa, and the blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria, is effective for tree fruits and nuts.Blue orchard bees are natives to this continent, and were here long before Europeans arrived with honeybee hives. Pollination in large almond and cherry orchards increased when they were used alongside honeybees, recent studies showed. There\u2019s a particular synergy between the two bee species, which have very different behaviors.Honeybees forage widely, self-propagate and live in large colonies that are easy to move. Blue orchard bees are solitary, and all females function as both queens and workers. They fly about four to six weeks in early spring. Better pollination can lead to bigger yields, as in Mr. Freese\u2019s case, which can mean more profit. To explore the economics, Dr. Pitts-Singer and other scientists conducted a cost-benefit analysis of using blue orchard bees and honeybees to pollinate almond trees in California.In the wild, blue orchard bees make nests in small cracks or holes. But in agricultural settings, artificial nesting blocks or paper tubes are used. \u201cIf I double my cherries, I\u2019ll do the extra work,\u201d Mr. Freese said.Rufus Isaacs, professor of entomology at Michigan State University and director of the I.C.P. project, sums up bees\u2019 needs this way: \u201cProvide a house and food, and don\u2019t kill them.\u201dWith cherry and almond blooms lasting only a short time, bees in orchards need other flowering plants nearby for food.Dr. Pitts-Singer encourages farmers and orchardists to pick the right bees for their region and to get the cleanest bees possible. Mr. Freese pays far more to buy blue orchard bees \u2014 50 cents each \u2014 than he does to rent honeybees from a local beekeeper. But he said that the cost of honeybees is going up, and the cost of blue orchard bees is going down. Effectiveness is the deciding factor. \u201cYou could say the most expensive pollinator is the one that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. His supplier, Jim Watts of Watts Solitary Bees in Bothell, Wash., has worked with leafcutter bees all his life and started propagating blue orchard bees a decade ago. While the blue orchard bee industry is very small, it is growing rapidly.One of the largest distributors of solitary bees in the country, Mr. Watts meets with farmers throughout the West about pollination. Based on their crops and acreage, he provides bees, materials and consulting time to answer questions. \u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve the first year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cAs people get better at it, they get a better return on their investment.\u201d \u201cOur approach is to consider the possibility of increased yield but also risk management,\u201d Mr. Watts added. \u201cTwo bees together work better. They pollinate differently. By diversifying your bees, you\u2019ll get way more consistent pollination over time.\u201d Dr. Isaacs, of Michigan State, agrees that diversity is important for reliable results. \u201cUsing wild bees and managed bees is an insurance policy against honeybee declines,\u201d he said, adding that a suite of pollinators also hedges against weather extremes.At a time when human food needs are growing and honeybees are threatened, farmers may be looking for just such an insurance policy.How can we save the pollinators if we don\u2019t even recognize them?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can I Contact the Grandkids I Discovered on a DNA Website?", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistI recently found out that I am a grandfather, but I did not find out in the usual way. A few years ago I had my DNA tested using an ancestry website. Some time later, the website showed I was closely related to two other registered users, and I found the person who managed their accounts. By looking that person up on social media, I soon realized the two ancestry-website accounts were probably those of my grandchildren. The first thing I thought was that everyone in my family knew but me. I called my ex-wife, and she was just as shocked as I was. The woman\u2019s Facebook page let me figure out which of our sons might be the father, given that some details of their lives overlapped. My initial reaction was that my son didn\u2019t want anyone to know, so I shouldn\u2019t ask him about it. Then I changed my mind and emailed the mother through the website. She was shocked that her identity had been discovered and said that there was an agreement with the father not to disclose any information and that he wasn\u2019t involved in their lives, though it sounded like his wish more than hers. She would not tell me who the father was.I was hesitant to contact my son for several reasons, but my ex-wife decided to ask him anyway. He admitted it, but he said he was helping out friends as a sperm donor and didn\u2019t want anyone in our family to know. He was upset that he had been found out. It doesn\u2019t change the situation if, as you suspect, the birth mother would be happy for your son to play a role in the children\u2019s lives. She agreed not to involve him, and it would be wrong for her to go back on her word. People discover all the time that it\u2019s harder than they anticipated to keep their promises. That doesn\u2019t relieve them of their obligations. If she wants to change the terms, she should discuss it with your son. It isn\u2019t for you to intervene.Of course, the children here could develop an interest later in finding out about their paternal biological relatives. The parents, biological and legal, most likely considered this possibility before entering into the arrangement; either way, this development could one day occasion another discussion. The children\u2019s interest in knowing who their father is, assuming they haven\u2019t been told, has a substantial weight. If he has kept his paternity from them, I\u2019d urge him to reconsider this decision, at least when they\u2019re older, whether or not he wants a relationship with them.But to argue that the kids have a right to a relationship with their father \u2014 or even a right to learn his identity \u2014 is to argue for a system in which many current sperm and egg donors wouldn\u2019t participate. (The same goes for many of the recipients.) Without these agreements, that is to say, these and many other children wouldn\u2019t have existed. And that is one thing we have to weigh when deciding if such agreements should be respected.Nobody \u2014 not grandparents, not uncles and aunts, not cousins \u2014 has an automatic right to be in the lives of those to whom they\u2019re genetically related. Otherwise every adoption would come with a crowd of compulsory genetic relatives. If we want adoptions to occur, it\u2019s unwise to burden adoptive families with all these obligations, absent some affirmative reason for doing so. It has to be a choice.Your son made a decision he was entitled to make and wanted to keep it private. You have managed to find out about it. He has told you he didn\u2019t want you or the family to know and doesn\u2019t want this to go further. Keeping confidences is difficult in families, needless to say. But think about it: Do you really want all your kinfolk to know everything that an investigator searching the available sources could unearth about you?The answer to your final question is: no. Don\u2019t tell anyone else what you\u2019ve learned unless your son gives you permission. Even if you gained a relationship with a pair of grandchildren, it could be at the price of ending one with your son.My family shares a summer home with relatives. We love it there, but as our children get older we are facing a quandary. Their uncle self-medicates his debilitating anxiety with drinking and pot-smoking, though he rarely appears truly intoxicated. He steps outside to smoke, but even so, he reeks, as do his bedroom and belongings. We\u2019ve encouraged him to seek treatment over the years.Now that our children are older, they can recognize smells and notice his drinking.

That\u2019s because \u201chate\u201d is a dangerously elastic label, one that has long been used in America to demonize unpopular expression. If we become overzealous in our efforts to limit so-called hate speech, we run the risk of setting a trap for the very people we\u2019re trying to defend.There\u2019s no question that black nationalists often argue for racial separation or that many have engaged in bigotry. But it\u2019s false equivalence to label black nationalists and white supremacists alike as hate groups. Doing so ignores the centuries of racial terror that gave rise to black nationalism, as well as the power imbalance that keeps it alive. And it gives a powerful tool to people who want to silence radical perspectives. They can call these viewpoints hate speech.If people engaged in a boycott can be silenced, even criminalized, for discriminating against the group they accuse of discrimination, we begin to see how problematic it is to punish \u201chate\u201d speech. It can devolve into the politics of choosing sides, and that is usually bad news for people who lack political clout to begin with.It is difficult to imagine a more ridiculous outcome. But it speaks to one of the most serious perils of limiting speech: a measure to protect minority perspectives can instead be used to further marginalize them. If we allowed these voices to be silenced on grounds that they promote hate, we\u2019d find ourselves scrambling to defend the radical poets, musicians, filmmakers and other artists who have pushed the boundaries of expression into what could arguably amount to hate speech, but who have done so from the vanguard of social and political protest. And that\u2019s the inherent danger in attempting to limit something like hate. It can be so broadly defined that our efforts to counteract it will be broad, too. If that happens, we risk silencing the voices and perspectives we can least afford to lose. That\u2019s not a triumph over hate. That\u2019s falling victim to it.Advertisement"}

The lake has been unusually balmy and cloudy, with thick mats of algae blanketing the shoreline.\u201cI have never seen it that warm,\u201d said Mr. Estain, a former Coast Guard member who guides fishing, cave and kayak tours year-round. \u201cEverybody was talking about it.\u201dBut it was not just recreational observers along the shores of the lake who noticed the changes with concern. Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes with more than 2,700 miles of shoreline, is the latest body of water to come under increased scrutiny by scientists after the appearance this summer of the largest mass of green, oozing algae ever detected on the lake.Starting in August in Lake Superior, reports of the thick, green algae stretching along about 50 miles of the southern shore reached Robert Sterner, the director of the Large Lakes Observatory at the University of Minnesota Duluth, and his team.\u201cWe believe it to be the largest, most intense bloom yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been emphasizing we are talking about a small volume of Lake Superior, but it is a very highly prized, recreational part of the lake.\u201dDr. Sterner said that while scientists did not completely understand the causes and frequency of blooms, they start with warmer water. And Lake Superior, he said, \u201cis one of the fastest-warming lakes on earth.\u201dAlgae blooms are a natural occurrence, but certain species can be toxic. While the species of algae found in Lake Superior can become toxic, Dr. Sterner said, tests showed that none of its commonly occurring toxins were found in hazardous concentrations.Harmful algal blooms are a \u201cnational problem,\u201d Donald M. Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in Washington on Tuesday.\u201cTheir increasing frequency and intensity are impacting the economics and environmental health of communities, states, tribes and regions around the nation,\u201d he testified.In an interview on Wednesday, Dr. Anderson said that scientists were seeing outbreaks surging in places they had not appeared before.\u201cThe fresh water problem has exploded in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even on the marine side, we are seeing events larger in scale.\u201dScientists and National Park Service employees were unaware of any noticeable blue-green algae blooms in Lake Superior before July 2012, when visitors reported surface scum along a 15-mile stretch of shore near the Apostle Islands, Dr. Sterner said.In July, Mr. Estain noticed algae around the Apostle Islands, in the western part of the lake, and he said it took up to three weeks to break up, longer than usual.\u201cWe saw the formation of large green surface blooms of cyanobacteria,\u201d said Brenda Lafrancois, a National Park Service ecologist, using the term for blue-green algae.\u201cThe surface blooms are a concern for aesthetic reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the bigger picture, the concern is that the blooms might be a symptom of broader changes, like increases in nutrients and warmer temperatures.\u201dDr. Sterner said his team had yet to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d about the triggers for the Lake Superior algal bloom, but he noted a possible link to warmer temperatures.\u201cSo we think we might be hitting some temperature threshold,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething out there has changed, and the one thing we know securely is that the lake is warming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "If Two People Claim a Lost Cat, Who Should Get It?", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistDriving home late one night, I saw a cat run into the street and get hit by a car. I stopped and picked him up. He had no collar or tag. Our local emergency vet pronounced him in stable condition but wouldn\u2019t keep him because he was a stray: no collar, no tag, no microchip. All local shelters were closed until noon the next day, so I took him home. I posted photos on nextdoor.com that night and on a Facebook \u201clost pets\u201d page the next morning. When my vet\u2019s office opened, I took him in and dropped him off.When I spoke to the office later that afternoon, they said the cat had been a victim of neglect. He was recently neutered, but he was filthy and covered in fleas; it appeared from his condition that he had been living outside for quite some time (probably both before and after the neutering).The vet\u2019s office said they knew of a potential adopter who would give the cat an excellent home. I hadn\u2019t received any response to my online posts, so I agreed and paid for the exam.The next day, two different people responded to the Facebook post and claimed that the cat was theirs. I thought long and hard about the right thing to do. A few of the things I considered were the cat\u2019s condition (indicating neglect), as well as the fact that he had no collar, no tag and no microchip: How to know which claimant to believe? Meanwhile, the cat has been living with the adopter found by the vet, and by all accounts, he is happy and getting healthier in his new home and is being kept indoors.Faced with bad options on all sides, I decided I didn\u2019t want to send the cat back to a neglectful environment, so I have not yet replied to the Facebook inquiries. Do I owe either claimant an explanation? If so, how should I respond to the two claims of ownership? Alternately, was my decision not to facilitate reunification wrong, and were the previous owners\u2019 claims paramount, despite the cat\u2019s neglected condition? Should I not have allowed the private adoption and instead insisted that the cat go to a shelter? Name WithheldIt was good of you to take such care of this cat. Let\u2019s be sure, though, that you face the quandary you describe. It\u2019s possible to imagine less malign scenarios. The vet thinks that the cat was neutered recently but was living outside for longer. Yet sometimes when people encounter a free-roaming cat, they arrange for it to be neutered and released. (T.N.R., for \u201ctrap-neuter-return,\u201d is the term of art here.) Or conceivably, the cat escaped from its owner a year ago, and all this happened since. As for the two claimants: Maybe they\u2019re co-owners. Maybe one has lots of pictures that would establish ownership. Or maybe one has made an honest mistake, which a closer examination would put right. If you\u2019re going to be depriving somebody of a pet, you want to be certain of your conclusions. Suppose, though, that the cat\u2019s owner establishes his or her claim and that you confirm your suspicions that the cat was neglected at home. (Which, as I say, now sounds like a premature inference.) All states have laws against animal cruelty, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals can help you find the right local agency to contact. Nobody\u2019s property rights in a pet include the right to abuse it. I am going on a weeklong, privately chartered cruise. I began planning this trip in the fall of 2017 while torridly in love with a dear friend who had become much more. We included his friends and mine on our boat, and there are about half a dozen of us. After we chartered our boat, the boyfriend and I broke up. One of the many reasons we broke up is that I learned he had not recovered from his extreme binge-drinking habits. As the trip approaches, I am becoming increasingly concerned that my ex-boyfriend may exhibit troubling behavior toward my female friends. Although he is compassionate and charming, and a respected professional, he has demonstrated physically and sexually aggressive behavior toward women during his binge-drinking episodes. In the past, I have witnessed him cornering women in bars and parties and grabbing their hair. These episodes never escalated to serious battery or frank sexual assault, but their inappropriateness and inherent danger do not escape me. As I recall these episodes, I feel ambivalence about having him on our trip. It is too late to \u201cevict\u201d him, but I am unsure of my responsibility to the other women. On one hand, I do not want to bias them toward a person who may not behave badly at all. On the other hand, I am fearful that not warning them may be unfair.Have I made a grave error in planning this trip with my ex, who despite his goodness is a potentially dangerous presence for women? Should I warn the women of his tendencies or practice extreme vigilance and ensure that his behavior does not escalate into aggression?Name WithheldIt\u2019s a vacation on a yacht. There will be drinking. If a member of your party gets unpleasant or abusive when that happens, people need to know at the start. It may not make for a great holiday spirit, but you owe it to them to be straight about what has happened. If you feel you can safely do so, why not first tell your ex-boyfriend that, given what you\u2019ve witnessed, you\u2019ll have to warn the others? He can decide whether he wants to stick with his plans.  My 19-year-old son has been working for a local landscaper during his summer break from college. The crew chief for his group of workers uses racist, homophobic and other offensive language on a regular basis. After a few weeks, my son took a different job, in part because of this unpleasant work environment. I\u2019m sure the crew chief is a valued employee and works hard. But should either of us inform the owner of the company that their crew chief uses this language? Name WithheldYour son has no beef with the company, just with the atmosphere created by the crew chief. That atmosphere has contributed to the loss of a steady worker. Maybe your son could find a way to convey his concerns to the actual offender. If not, it would be a courtesy to tell the owner what happened. (I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no reason to fear retaliation.) But let it be your son\u2019s decision.

But they struggle with small talk. In Ireland, small talk is just that \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s tiny.What the seemingly meaningless exchange means is we can relax. The person we\u2019re inches away from for the afternoon is not dangerous. At the end of the trip we\u2019ll nod and smile, and I won\u2019t be left wondering why his father said that one thing in 1994 that meant he never had the confidence to pursue a career in architecture.The last kids\u2019 birthday party I attended was in Brooklyn, where the adults stick around and it kind of blends into the evening. I was chatting with this one cool-guy dad with a pale ale in his hand, and he opened up within 30 seconds. \u201cSomething people don\u2019t talk about enough is how hard parenting really is, and sometimes you\u2019re just not going to like your kids,\u201d he said. All I\u2019d asked was whether he was in line for the bouncy castle. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that, actually, two other people at the same party had said more or less the same thing to me just minutes earlier. Was this disgruntled trio just unlucky, with a slew of particularly unlikable children between them? No. They were simply saying what was on their minds. You see, there\u2019s nothing Americans don\u2019t talk about. That should come as a relief to me, growing up in a repressed, Catholic country where my mother explained rape to us as \u201cwhen someone loves you, but you don\u2019t want them to.\u201d In truth, this extraordinary level of openness I find here is a relief, but it also feels a little like a loss. I understand that openness beats secrecy and that taboos should be challenged. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t always want to dive right in. Time and energy are resources, and New Yorkers never have enough of either because of capitalism and self-absorption. Their technique is to get straight to it, and that can be off-putting. Besides, believing and acting on this no-nonsense \u201cwho exactly are you?\u201d school of conversation neglects the fact that small talk, when done correctly, is actually an extremely efficient way of getting acquainted with people. You may not find out where they work, or who they know, or how their relationship is with their family, but you\u2019ll get some idea of that odd-shaped part of a human being that\u2019s invisible to the eye and impossible to articulate. Are they kind, hurting, silly or bad? Some combination of all of those? You can find out, if you ask them about the party food, or tell them about your blouse, or bring up the oddly cloudless sky outside, and simply take it from there.In one fateful 20-minute Google session a few years ago, I applied for and was accepted into both a yoga teacher-training course and a mentoring program for girls. The same week in September saw the first day of both courses, yoga on Saturday mornings, mentoring on Saturday afternoons. It was all falling into place; soon I\u2019d be some kind of supple superhero flanked by a bevy of intellectually powerful young women who would look upon me favorably after they\u2019d taken over the world. That first Saturday, I noticed the same woman in both courses, a serene-looking person with a resting saint face. I was struck by what I thought was an incredible coincidence \u2014 can you even imagine two nice, helpful white writer ladies who are also interested in deepening their yoga practice?That is how it came to pass that, instead of some small talk leading to an easy quietness, Warrior One sat beside Warrior Two in tense silence as they both scrolled through their phones. My reluctant companion believed that conversation had to be all or nothing, either teetering on ice or plunging into the unknown waters beneath. She didn\u2019t know she just had to pull on a pair of skates and twirl around for a while. That elegance was not accessible to her, I thought, as I spied a dog in a bag under the seat opposite us. His little black eyes shone. I get it; words are laughably inadequate when it comes time to express ourselves. My brain is so close to my mouth, yet in the time it takes for a thought to travel between the two and become a sentence, the meaning is diluted and fudged to something I don\u2019t really mean at all. But words are all we have when it comes to telling someone who we are, so we are duty-bound to at least try. I didn\u2019t want a vapid exchange, and in-depth conversation wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate either, and I had no intention of launching into either. The perfect in-between connection was small talk, but we missed that connection, so I was just a woman alone on the subway, smiling at a schnauzer.Advertisement"}

Just as our bodies learned how to sprint around the curve of a track, our muscles learned to tense up when men honked their horns as they passed us. And just as we learned to use that nervous feeling in our gut before a race to propel us across the finish line, we also recognized the gut feeling that told us a trail wasn\u2019t safe to run on alone. We know that we can never totally zone out on a run, to enter that magical out-of-body Zen space fueled by endorphins, without keeping at least part of our mind firmly on earth. We know we have a set of rules about personal safety of which our male runner friends are, for the most part, unaware.

Instead, in news reports and online discussions, the response to Ms. Tibbetts\u2019s death has seemed to put the onus back on women to be more careful while running, rather than addressing the real issue of violence against women. Here are pepper sprays small enough to fit in your running shorts. No, you can\u2019t run with headphones. You are taking a risk when you run alone, in the dark. When my sister and I talked about Ms. Tibbetts on the phone, everything we needed to say was in our silence.

With all the polls showing that I would easily win this October\u2019s elections, Brazil\u2019s extreme right wing is seeking to knock me out of the race. A linchpin of the case against me was the testimony of a witness whose sentence was reduced as part of a plea deal. In other words, it was in his personal interest to tell the authorities what they wanted to hear.Mr. Moro has been lionized by Brazil\u2019s right-wing news media. He has become untouchable.

I have been in jail before, under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, for nothing more than defending workers\u2019 rights. That dictatorship fell. The people who are abusing their power today will also fall. I don\u2019t ask to be above the law, but a trial must be fair and impartial. These right-wing forces convicted me, imprisoned me, ignored the overwhelming evidence of my innocence and denied me habeas corpus only to try to stop me from running for the presidency. I ask for respect for democracy. If they want to defeat me for real, do it in the elections. According to the Brazilian Constitution, the power comes from the people, who elect their representatives. So let the Brazilian people decide. I have faith that justice will prevail, but time is running against democracy. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is the former president of Brazil.A previous version of this article misstated a fact about Mr. da Silva's case. One witness's testimony was a key part of the prosecution, but it was not the only evidence.Advertisement"}

Ten people are being investigated for giving the Hitler salute, they said.The violence first broke out on Sunday, after nationalists and far-right soccer fans called on supporters, including on social media, to take to the streets to \u201cdefend\u201d their country from immigrants after the killing of a 35-year-old German man.Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences to the victim\u2019s family and condemned the violence, telling reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that she had seen videos of demonstrators \u201cgoing after people, riotous assemblies and hate in the streets.\u201d\u201cI can only stress that this has nothing to do with the rule of law in this country,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThere can be no place in our streets for such rioting.\u201d She also welcomed the offer by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to support the authorities in Saxony in ensuring the rule of the law in Chemnitz.A 21-year-old Iraqi and a 22-year-old Syrian were arrested on Monday on suspicion of having stabbed the victim during an altercation with him and two other men, both of whom were injured, Christine M\u00fccke, a prosecutor in Chemnitz, said on Monday. The case was later taken over by a special prosecutor for handling extremism in the state of Saxony.Chemnitz was celebrating its 875th anniversary over the weekend, but a street festival had to be shut down on Sunday. Police officers trying to ensure security at the festival were overwhelmed as hundreds of people joined the protests and counterprotests, and the police scrambled to call in reinforcements.Initially, only 50 to 80 officers were on duty Sunday, said Jana Ulbrich, a spokeswoman for the Chemnitz police. \u201cAfter the call-out on Facebook for a gathering, we tried to get more forces,\u201d she said.After a tense lull in the violence most of Monday, the confrontations resumed in force late in the day. Videos from Monday night showed several thousand demonstrators brandishing German flags and shouting, \u201cWe are the people\u201d and \u201cChemnitz is ours \u2014 foreigners out,\u201d and neo-Nazis gathered in the city, raising their right arms in the Nazi salute.On the opposite side of a wide boulevard from the anti-immigrant forces, a smaller group shouted \u201cNazis out.\u201d In the middle of the thoroughfare, the police appeared outnumbered and overwhelmed, struggling to keep the groups apart. As the night wore on, bottles and fireworks flew, and demonstrators broke through police cordons.\u201cThe right to use force lies uniquely and solely with the state,\u201d Hans Strobl, general prosecutor for the state of Saxony, said on Monday. \u201cWe will take consequent action against all of those who do not accept this.\u201dSaxony has long struggled with far-right and nativist extremism. Part of the former East Germany, it borders the Czech Republic to the south and Poland to the east.The state is also home to a strong faction of the Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD. Recent polls show the party firmly in place as the second-strongest force in the state, closing in on Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives.Advertisement"}

It is wrong to support the church.Mr. Nathaniel is a former editor and videographer at The New York Times. ATLANTA \u2014 Last Sunday, I did something that no properly raised Catholic ever does. I stood up in the middle of Mass and called out the priest.The priest addressed the report. He said he was surprised that people showed up for that day\u2019s service. He said the church had to change. Then he began to move on. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I stood up and yelled out: \u201cFather!\u201d He turned. I asked him, simply: \u201cHow?\u201dHe responded that I should write to the nuncio, the pope\u2019s representative in the United States. I told him that this was a bureaucratic answer. As the priest answered, I became aware of the other families around me. I knew so many of them, and I was reminded of how I had always felt so at home at Mass. It always gave me such pride when my family would take up most of a pew in church. Now I\u2019m angry. I feel betrayed.I wouldn\u2019t exist without Catholicism. My parents\u2019 interracial marriage was condoned by their families because they shared the religion. I was an altar boy and attended Catholic school. I played church-organized youth sports, and I was an Eagle Scout in the parish troop.The repugnant stories of abuse touched my peers. I blamed the clergy. My wife and I moved abroad, and I stopped attending Mass regularly. But as I traveled in the developing world, I was proud to see Catholic missionaries working in the most desperate situations driven by our shared faith. I have still occasionally felt the pull of Sunday Mass. It was the church\u2019s own teachings that made me stand up on Sunday and question the priest. Catholics are taught that it\u2019s imperative to help others. We are told to protect the innocent. The church has profoundly failed to abide by these basic principles by allowing the sins of sexual abuse to continue. Aside from my family, two institutions helped form my character: the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts. Both organizations encouraged me to stand up for what is right and to use our strength to aid those in need. Just before my son was old enough to join the Scouts, the head of the organization, Robert Gates, ended the unjust prohibitions against gay members, just as he had done as secretary of defense. I enthusiastically signed up my son and became cub master of our local pack. I\u2019m not someone to quit and run. I\u2019m proud that I spoke out against the injustice of the Scouts and helped instigate change from inside an organization that had lost its way. In a letter on Monday to the congregation, Father Mark Horak, the Jesuit priest I confronted, wrote: \u201cIf you love the church, remain within and work for its fundamental reform.\u201d But the church can\u2019t be changed from the inside. It has already tried that. But we should go further and demand that every ordained member of the Catholic Church resign, including the pope. If any other organization had covered up the rampant sexual abuse of children, the government would rightly shut it down. Why should the Catholic Church be any different?I\u2019m mad at the church administration, as I was in 2002. But now I\u2019m also angry at the congregation. I\u2019m upset with the people who aren\u2019t demanding that every member of the clergy resign. Catholics cannot keep on filling the pews every Sunday. It is wrong to support the church.At the end of last Sunday\u2019s service, before the recessional, the priest stopped us and kindly told my son that he had a good dad. Then the father looked at me and said the most honest thing I\u2019ve ever heard in a church: \u201cYou and I have no influence.\u201d He was right. And if congregants like me have no influence, and if parents like me no longer feel safe and comfortable bringing our sons and daughters to make Communion, then the Catholic Church is beyond redemption.

{"Headline": "Advice I Never Wanted to Give", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI talked about everything in my life on stage. But suicide was definitely not funny.Mr. Cayton-Holland is a comedian.Everybody wants to talk to me about suicide. It\u2019s my own fault, I suppose. Or maybe it\u2019s my little sister Lydia\u2019s fault. But there\u2019s no point in assigning blame.Mostly I just miss her. When are we going to talk about it? How are we going to deal with this?At the time of her death, I had been doing stand-up comedy for nearly eight years. I got on stage and talked about fast-food slogans and Montessori schools and bird-watching, and people seemed to enjoy it. But I didn\u2019t know how to joke about what happened to Lydia. And I didn\u2019t want to. Something felt so cheap about that \u2014 unloading a hot 10 minutes on suicide for guys drinking buckets of Bud Lights. It felt beneath Lydia. And yet the desire to express my feelings about everything that happened was overwhelming me.So I wrote about it. I wrote down everything that happened to me and I shared it online. Suddenly my inbox filled with gut-wrenching messages from people who had similarly awful experiences, or knew someone who had. Many of them asked for advice. I didn\u2019t have anything to offer. Nor did I feel qualified.It was as if a train had barreled through my house, devastating my entire family in the process, and all anyone could think to do was ask me to tell them more about this train.I don\u2019t know anything about trains! I\u2019m just trying to put my house back together!Eventually, I started responding.I was terrified I\u2019d say the wrong thing. But I couldn\u2019t just ignore them. So I began firing off a different answer based on how I was feeling at that exact moment.I like to remember her constantly; I try not to think of her at all.I focus on helping my family members; I avoid them for weeks on end.I think about people who have had it far worse than me; I rage because no one\u2019s ever had it this bad.I cry until I hurt; I don\u2019t allow myself to cry.I never watch any TV show that Lydia and I loved together; I binge on them for weeks.If one were to collect the advice I\u2019ve offered to the people who have reached out to me, it\u2019d be a contradictory mess. You name it, I\u2019ve tried it, am trying it, will try it. I don\u2019t know what to tell people about coping because the hurt is never gone. I tell them matter-of-factly that it is terrible and it will always be terrible and that the sooner you recognize that as the new reality, the sooner you\u2019ll adapt to it, whatever that looks like for you. Whatever defeated new landscape your life takes on. It\u2019s all very Russian.But when people write to me concerned that someone they love is suicidal, my advice is unflinching: There may be nothing you can really do, but whatever you\u2019re doing to help, do more of it. Ask more questions. Drive your loved one to more doctors. Spend more nights watching him or her sob. I regret every time I rolled my eyes because my sister was having another bad day. I\u2019m ashamed of myself for it. No matter how much we know it\u2019s not our fault, it doesn\u2019t matter. In our hearts, we feel guilty. I look back at Lydia\u2019s life and I\u2019m sickened we couldn\u2019t see it coming. A preternaturally intelligent girl who is sensitive and socially awkward, obsessed with dark literature and music and television, overdoses on sleeping pills, and we thought she\u2019d turn it around?The way my mom saw it, modern science barely understands the human brain. All the studies, all the tests and pills and breakthroughs, it\u2019s all worthless, she said. Medical science still has such a rudimentary understanding of why the mind works the way it does. In a hundred years, psychiatrists would look at Lydia and say, \u201cOh, this girl is clearly suffering from X, Y and Z.\u201d And they would prescribe her whatever it took to fix X, Y and Z. Then off Lydia would go to fulfill her potential, to find a sense of worth, of happiness. But, of course, science isn\u2019t there yet. So all we\u2019re left with is the clumsy knowledge that Lydia suffered from something. Something we were powerless to stop. It was mental illness \u2014 a real disease. That\u2019s what got Lydia in the end. Not our ineptitude or lack of perception, the disease.It helps to think this way, to view it as an inevitability that was neither Lydia\u2019s fault nor our own. It\u2019s the only way to free yourself from anguish. The only way to realize that despite all the suffering, even though she\u2019s not there anymore, you are.It\u2019s been six years since Lydia died, and I\u2019ve started talking about her on stage some, when it feels right. I don\u2019t really have a joke about it. It\u2019s more like a public service announcement that I make into the microphone, urging people to seek help, urging people to not feel ashamed of feeling powerless when it comes to their brains. You can see the audience tense up. I pepper in a few jokes here and there, to try to cut the tension. Which kind of works. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s the best I seem to be able to do right now. If people are going to keep asking me about the train that barreled through my house, I might as well learn to be honest about the damage.Adam Cayton-Holland is a comedian and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cTragedy Plus Time,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "That\u2019s Not Algae Swirling on the Beach. Those Are Green Worms.", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers demonstrated that plant-worms rotate in circular congregations along Atlantic beaches. But nobody is certain why.Between April and September, just minutes after waves splash over beaches along the eastern Atlantic coast of England, Wales, France or the Channel Islands, tiny, green worms emerge from their sandy hide-outs. They gather in small pools, often near small boulders. But if you stuck around and watched patiently, you\u2019d see something strange happen.Since the late 19th century, this peculiar marine flatworm, just about the size of a pencil tip, has intrigued scientists. They\u2019ve studied it to understand regeneration, photosymbiosis and climate change. But the plant-worm\u2019s collective behavior has only recently captivated scientists like Dr. Sendova-Franks. At first glance, it looks and acts like a plant. But it has a rudimentary brain and nervous system, and if you chop off its head, it rejuvenates. It also has gravity sensors and eye-like photoreceptors. As a juvenile, the worm swallows solar-powered algae that lose their cell walls, eyes (yes, the algae have eyespots) and wiggly tails. After a few worms move in parallel, they start rotating suddenly at a certain density. The team thinks the worms enter the spiral like cars all moving toward the center of a roundabout. As traffic increases, the center comes to a halt. Then mats form. The worms stay together to maximize their algae\u2019s ability to harness solar power. But too much light is bad for the algae. Rotating, the researchers speculate, may prevent a single plant-worm from getting all the exposure. The worms also secrete a mucus which may reflect away some sunshine \u2014 and possibly aid in travel.\u201cFor me, the most amazing thing is how they keep together given how precarious the environment is,\u201d said Dr. Sendova-Franks. Next, the researchers hope to learn if this collective behavior truly is adaptive, and if so, how it evolved. They want to know how the worms communicate and travel to the most advantageous or safest mingling locations. Until then, if you\u2019re lucky enough to stumble upon plant-worms in a circular mill, Dr. Sendova-Franks suggests that you look but don\u2019t touch. Until we get to know them better, we don\u2019t want to harm them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Alex Jones, Facebook\u2019s Worst Demons Abroad Begin to Come Home", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWhen does speech become unsafe? When can it be limited? Should those decisions be up to a private company at all? And if a company shies away from acting, as Facebook did with Mr. Jones until Apple moved first, where does that leave the rest of us?But to activists and officials in much of the developing world, both the problem and Facebook\u2019s muddled solutions will be old news.Before there was Alex Jones, the American conspiracy theorist, there was Amith Weerasinghe, the Sri Lankan extremist who used Facebook as his personal broadcast station.And so on.\u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t seem to get that they\u2019re the largest news agency in the world,\u201d Harindra Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan official, said a few days after Mr. Weerasinghe\u2019s arrest.The problem, he said, goes beyond a few underregulated extremists. It also involves the algorithm-driven newsfeed that is core to the company\u2019s business model. \u201cThey are blind to seeing the real repercussions,\u201d Mr. Dissanayake said of Facebook\u2019s leaders.Developing countries\u2019 experiences with Facebook suggest that the company, however noble its intent, has set in motion a series of problems we are only beginning to understand and that the company has proved unable or unwilling to fully address:\u2014 Reality-distorting misinformation that can run rampant on the newsfeed, which promotes content that will reliably engage users.\u2014 Extremism and hate speech that tap into users\u2019 darkest impulses, and polarize politics.\u2014 Malicious actors granted near-limitless reach on one of the most sophisticated communications platforms in history, relatively unchecked by social norms or traditional gatekeepers.\u2014 And a private company uneager to wade into contentious debates, much less pick winners and losers.But chillingly similar Facebook-linked problems are becoming increasingly visible in wealthy, developed countries like the United States. So is the difficulty of solving those problems \u2014 and the consequences of Facebook\u2019s preference for action that can be incremental, reactive and agonizingly slow.Though Facebook officials often portray the violence associated with it as new or impossible to predict, the incidents date to at least 2012. So does the pressure to more actively regulate speech on the platform.\u201cI think in the back deep-deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya, a senior executive who left Facebook in 2011, said at a policy conference last year. \u201cWe have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.\u201dThere were other warnings, typically from activists or civil society leaders in the developing countries where Facebook\u2019s expansion was fastest and most obviously disruptive. But they were little heeded.\u201cFacebook is the platform that we could not meet with for years,\u201d Damar Juniarto, who leads an Indonesian organization that tracks online hate groups, told me in March.Facebook representatives eventually met with Mr. Juniarto, and the company has shut most pages associated with the Muslim Cyber Army.In the developing countries where such incidents seem most common, or at least most explicitly violent, Facebook simply faces little pressure to act.In Sri Lanka, government officials spoke of the company as if it were a superpower to be feared and appeased.Even officials in India, a major power, struggled to get the company to listen. Indian pressure on Facebook, however, has dropped since the arrival of new government leaders who rose, in part, on a Hindu nationalist wave still prevalent on social media.American officials have far greater leverage over Facebook, as members of Congress proved when lawmakers summoned Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive officer, to testify in April. But the Americans seem unsure what they want Facebook to do, or how to compel it to act. So they, too, are not very effective at changing the company\u2019s behavior.More broadly, Americans seem unsure precisely how far Facebook should go in regulating speech on the platform, or what it should do about the data suggesting that misinformation is more common on the political right.All of which comes through in Facebook\u2019s hesitation about shutting down Mr. Jones\u2019 page, despite his long record of demonstrable falsehoods that have real-world consequences.American commitment to free speech is unusually tied into the country\u2019s sense of itself. Still, the dilemma here is not so different from those government officials and Facebook itself face in places like Indonesia or Sri Lanka.So while few are comfortable \u2014 perhaps Facebook least of all \u2014 with a private company acting as a vastly powerful regulator of public speech, even fewer seem willing to step in and take on the task themselves.There are growing indications Facebook\u2019s problems in rich countries may go beyond misinformation to do the kind of harm developing countries have experienced.\u201cI think it does something to their sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cThese things, if they reach thousands of people, you cannot get it back.\u201dThe platform has grown so powerful, so quickly, that we are still struggling to understand its influence. Social scientists regularly discover new ways that Facebook alters the societies where it operates: a link to hate crimes, a rise in extremism, a distortion of social norms.After all, Mr. Jones, for all his demagogic skills, was tapping into misinformation and paranoia already on the platform.In Germany, Gerhard Pauli, a state prosecutor based in Hagen, told me last month about a local firefighter trainee who had grown so fearful of refugees that he attempted to burn down a local refugee group house. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure that social media made it worse,\u201d he said.Mr. Pauli said that his office spent more and more time tracking rumors and hate speech on Facebook, and that it seemed to rise in advance of violence, as when the mayor of nearby Altena was stabbed last year.Though Germany is a major economy with some of the world\u2019s strictest social media regulations, Mr. Pauli had only somewhat more success with Facebook than his peers in the developing world.\u201cIn the beginning, they did nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You have no jurisdiction over us.\u2019 In the last few years, they are more helpful, especially in cases of child abuse.\u201dBut, in other matters, the company remains skittish, Mr. Pauli said. \u201cThey do have a lot of information, but they don\u2019t want to lose users,\u201d he said.The prosecutor has grown especially concerned, he said, about social media rumors \u2014 say, a stranger near a school \u2014 that could spin ordinarily self-contained Germans into violence. Not so unlike in Sri Lanka or India.\u201cWe have lots of situations where somebody saw somebody outside the kindergarten,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin five minutes it\u2019s spreading, and from post to post, it gets worse. It takes two hours and then you have some lynch mob on the street.\u201dAmanda Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google: Which Can Carry on a Conversation Best?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Advertisement\nDigital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can carry on a good conversation.We explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments \u2014 even in the moments when the assistants screwed up \u2014 showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.Because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how.Right away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called \u201cthese things\u201d to a shopping list.If your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said \u201cguacamole, chips, tortillas,\u201d he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn\u2019t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it.Alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren\u2019t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.A digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.When you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you\u2019ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.Engineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time \u2014 a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.In some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.Even if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with.When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.When you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.After recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.Engineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It\u2019s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.All of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don\u2019t change anything.Machine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\u201cIf you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,\u201d said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. \u201cThe technology operates by different rules than people do.\u201dIn the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don\u2019t use a pronoun?The devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That\u2019s likely because each device is using a different \u201cknowledge graph,\u201d a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp.Amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was \u201csluggish.\u201dA neural network also drives Google\u2019s new \u201cconversational mode.\u201dIn the past, you couldn\u2019t talk to the device without saying \u201cHey, Google.\u201d Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command \u2014 and when you\u2019re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with the interactions other people have had with their devices. Basically, Google\u2019s customers are helping Google build a smarter product.Don\u2019t expect these devices to tell you what they think \u2014 or even what other people think. It\u2019s easier to build technology that sticks to the facts. After asking these devices to identify the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which they all did correctly, we asked for their opinion of his work. None of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question, and Google eventually lost the context altogether.Engineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do, but conversation is such a complex task, even machine learning approaches will need years \u2014 or perhaps decades \u2014 to completely solve the problem.These devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self-reflection or complex analysis.This is an incredibly difficult question for a computer to answer, unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it. Many times, these devices will just reply with canned responses, as Google did with the Muffin Man bit.For now, you will have to make do with the Muffin Man.Note: The devices tested were the Apple HomePod, the Amazon Echo Plus and the Google Home. They were each tested separately. The phrases used to trigger the devices \u2014 \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey, Google,\u201d respectively \u2014 were used before each interaction, and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity.Audio production by Brad FisherAdvertisement"}

But there I was on my granddaughter Avery\u2019s first day of life, so happy I didn\u2019t recognize myself.I have raised children. Five of them. I have held my own babies in their first minutes of life; I have felt that shock of recognition \u2014 this is a version of me. I have kvelled (a Yiddish word meaning a giddy mixture of pride and joy) at the things my babies did that all babies do. But I have never felt this thing that stopped my brain, that put all plans on hold, that rendered me dumb.O.K., I\u2019ve had glimpses of this thing. But this was my first uninterrupted hour of it.In the first moments of my own children\u2019s lives, I couldn\u2019t turn my brain off. When will we be able to leave the hospital? Is his skin sort of yellow? Will she take to the nipple? Did my brother feed our dog like he was supposed to? Should I get my parents from the waiting room now? Does my wife need another blanket? Does the baby look like her brothers? Does she look like a Zoey?And more existential concerns: What the hell were we thinking?Becoming a father was a lot like becoming a German shepherd if German shepherds were capable of constantly calculating the risks of SIDS and peanut allergies.I worked part time for the first two years of my firstborn\u2019s life. I got to spend a lot of time with Zack. He had terrible colic. I became a one-armed man: By the time he was 2 months old, I could do almost any task with Zack cradled face down in the crook of my arm, where his own weight applied constant, soothing pressure to his sputtering digestive tract.Then the ear infections started. One night when he was 4 months old and had a high fever, I went to check on him in his crib. His face had a bluish cast, and it appeared he wasn\u2019t breathing. The paramedics assured us that it was just a febrile seizure, benign, except for the permanent heart damage it causes parents.Sure, I spent time staring at Zack\u2019s beautiful sleeping face. But my joy was always crowded by more questions, namely, \u201cWhat are you going to throw at us next, little guy?\u201d When my second child, Max, came, I should have been more relaxed. After all, Zack had somehow managed to live till his third birthday. But whenever I held Max, whenever I started to get lost in his impossibly perfect newness, I\u2019d remember that his older brother might at this very instant be about to fall off a bookcase and split his head open, which is exactly what he did a few weeks after Max was born.Oh, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have lots of chances to exercise my highly advanced worrying skills, but I will always be the second line of defense, a bench player. Her parents will watch her sleep and weigh the newest research on side sleeping versus back sleeping. They will never have a moment as free as that first hour I had with her.But in keeping her alive, they will become fully alive. They will feel the awesome power of joy tinged with vulnerability. Only when you have everything to lose, do you have everything.That\u2019s what parenting teaches you.Now that I am a grandparent, I look forward to learning more about this other kind of joy.Jim Sollisch is a creative director at Marcus Thomas Advertising in Cleveland, Ohio.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Trick to Keep Barnacles From Sticking to Ships", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesBy experimenting with tiny textures, scientists may have found a technique that could save the shipping industry billions of dollars each year. To keep barnacles off hulls, boats are coated in antifouling paint that kills barnacle larvae. Unfortunately, the paints\u2019 active ingredients also leach into the water and kill other things, like oysters, leading to bans on some formulations and a search for alternatives. Part of what makes barnacles so difficult to dislodge is that they secrete a liquid glue that makes close contact with the hull\u2019s surface and then hardens into a cement-like substance. If they could develop structures that kept the glue from attaching smoothly, it could compromise the animals\u2019 grip.Textured coatings that make it difficult for barnacle larvae to settle down already exist. But they only succeed in delaying colonization of ship hulls, said Lars Heepe, a professor of biomechanics. Dr. Heepe, Dennis Petersen, a graduate student, and their colleagues decided to test tape made of silicone and covered with forests of either straight pillars or mushroom shapes. The team tested their samples in the Baltic Sea. Both accumulated barnacles, but the glue had easily seeped between the straight pillars and made a tight seal with the surface. On the coating with the mushroom shapes, however, there were big gaps beneath the barnacles\u2019 layer of cement. They were perched precariously on top of the mushroom caps. To see what this meant in practical terms, the researchers lowered samples back into the Baltic and drew them up again every week for more than four months, taking photographs of their surfaces and painstakingly tracking every barnacle that tried to take hold. For the first seven weeks, barnacles built up on both, but then something interesting happened.\u201cWe were quite surprised by the fluctuation in the number of barnacles,\u201d said Dr. Heepe. Steadily, all the barnacles that had landed on the mushroom surface disappeared, apparently pulled from their insecure seats by the motion of the waves. No new barnacles settled on it for the rest of the experiment, while the other coating continued to attract new colonists. The team also put a sample of the mushroom coating on a sailboat belonging to the Kieler Yacht Club that subsequently sailed through the Baltic and the North Sea for seven months, covering about 1,800 miles. When it returned, the patch was clear of barnacles.While this study helps establish the potential of these structures, \u201cin the future, these surfaces can be optimized,\u201d Mr. Petersen said. The tape with mushrooms on it is already being manufactured for medical uses \u2014 particularly bandages to help burn patients \u2014 but it might be possible to shrink the number of mushrooms per square inch and still get a good effect as far as boats are concerned, Dr. Heepe said. The fact that the mushroom structures did well demonstrates the importance of careful testing. Even a relatively simple textural change could have an outsize impact on troubles caused by barnacle hitchhikers. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gatekeepers or Censors? How Tech Manages Online Speech", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple, Google and Facebook this week erased from their services many \u2014 but not all \u2014 videos, podcasts and posts from the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars site. And Twitter left Mr. Jones\u2019s posts untouched.The differing approaches to Mr. Jones exposed how unevenly tech companies enforce their rules on hate speech and offensive content. There are only a few cases in which the companies appear to consistently apply their policies, such as their ban on child pornography and instances in which the law required them to remove content, like Nazi imagery in Germany.When left to make their own decisions, the tech companies often struggle with their roles as the arbiters of speech and leave false information, upset users and confusing decisions in their wake. Here is a look at what the companies, which control the world\u2019s most popular public forums, allow and ban.Of all the tech companies, Facebook has faced the biggest public outcry over what it allows on its platform.Whenever the social media company has been pressed to explain its decision-making, it has referred to its community standards, a public document that outlines Facebook\u2019s rules for users. The company has outright bans against violent content, nudity and terrorist recruitment propaganda. The rules on other types of content, including hate speech and false news, are more ambiguous.Now, less than a month later, Facebook has banned Mr. Jones and removed four pages belonging to him \u2014 including one with nearly 1.7 million followers \u2014 for violating its policies. The ban means that while Mr. Jones still has an account and can view content on Facebook, he is suspended from posting anything to the platform, including to his personal page or any pages on which he is an administrator.The company has refused to say how many strikes is too many, however. It has also not answered questions on how long Mr. Jones will be banned or whether Facebook will be reviewing similar content posted by other right-wing conspiracy theorists.It\u2019s unclear whether the actions Facebook has taken against Mr. Jones signal a new approach by the company against hate speech or whether they are, once again, responding to an isolated case because of public pressure.\u2014 Sheera FrenkelUsers can flag videos that they believe violate those guidelines, which include bans on videos with nudity or sexual content or incite violence. YouTube will then review those flagged videos for potential violations. In addition, YouTube\u2019s computer systems also comb the site for videos that violate its rules.But many videos operate in a gray area. Even in YouTube\u2019s own explanation of \u201chateful content,\u201d the company calls it is a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d between free expression and protecting YouTube users.YouTube still hosts videos of Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich., whose sermons were viewed by one of the knife-wielding attackers in the terror attack on London Bridge last year. His sermons posed a quandary for the video service because the cleric does not directly call for violent jihad and is, therefore, not in clear violation of community guidelines. YouTube now presents Mr. Jibril\u2019s sermons behind a warning that the video has been deemed \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d by part of the YouTube community.Mr. Jones incurred two content violations from YouTube over the last year. In February, YouTube said he had violated its policies regarding harassment and bullying when a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201dIn Mr. Jones\u2019s most recent violation last month, YouTube took down four of his videos that included hate speech against Muslim and transgender people as well as footage of a child being shoved to the ground. YouTube said the videos had violated its policies pertaining to hate speech, harassment and child endangerment.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiTwitter\u2019s approach has provoked plenty of criticism, particularly around its lax handling of harassment. Celebrities like the actress Leslie Jones have been temporarily driven off the platform by swarms of abusers.Although the parents of several Sandy Hook shooting victims are suing Mr. Jones for defamation, a Twitter spokesman said that neither Mr. Jones\u2019s personal account nor his Infowars account are currently in violation of Twitter\u2019s policies. Tweets questioning the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., remain live on both accounts.The simultaneous takedowns across YouTube, Spotify and Facebook are troubling, said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. The number of bans in quick succession from multiple companies raised the specter that this could have been influenced by outside political pressure rather than a straightforward application of company policies, he said.Twitter\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Jones and Infowars to stay on its platform may reflect a commitment to consistent policy enforcement, Mr. Bankston said.\u201cA Twitter that\u2019s not accountable to its own rules is not accountable to anybody,\u201d he said.In a series of tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Dorsey suggested that other tech companies had caved to political pressure in their decision to remove Mr. Jones from their platforms and argued that journalists \u2014 not Twitter \u2014 were better suited to fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019 claims.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t violated our rules,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.\u201d\u2014 Kate CongerWithout a social-media platform, Apple typically avoids the content controversies that ensnare its peers. Yet the iPhone maker still makes many decisions about what apps, podcasts, songs and videos it will make available on its popular services.Apple\u2019s decision to ban the Infowars podcasts was surprising partly because an app that Infowars introduced last month was gaining steam on Apple\u2019s App Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 33rd most popular news app on the app store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones\u2019s bans spread, the Infowars app was Apple\u2019s fourth most popular news app, outranking every mainstream news organization.How Apple decides which apps violate those policies is more vague, however. Apple said in its policy: \u201cWe will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, \u2018I\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u2019 And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\u201d\u2014 Jack NicasAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Coronary Complacency", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDeaths from heart attacks are dropping, but the number of people whose hearts cannot pump enough blood for a healthy, comfortable existence is on the rise.Ms. Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cTicker, the Quest to Build an Artificial Heart.\u201d HOUSTON \u2014 When Ally Babineaux was 22, before she had the first of two heart transplants but after she had nearly died from a ruthless virus that attacked her heart, a woman accosted her in a parking lot. As sick as Ally was on that day in 2010, she was, still, a classic Texas beauty, with long blond hair, flashing blue eyes and just a hint of the trim, muscular body years of ballet had given her. She was fresh from a monthslong hospital stay \u2014 her recovery never assured \u2014 and was trying to do some quick shopping before the last of her energy drained away. She parked her car close to the store entrance and hooked her handicapped sticker on the rearview mirror. As she slid out of the driver\u2019s seat, the woman began screaming at her for taking up a space for sick people.Being short-tempered can be a contributor to heart disease, but it can also be a sign of self-preservation. Standing in the sun, Ally lifted her blouse to show off the tube running from her belly to the small battery pack she carried in a shoulder bag \u2014 the battery that powered the tiny pump that kept the left side of her heart beating, that kept her alive. \u201cIs this handicapped enough for you?\u201d Ally demanded.And yet, complacency persists. That\u2019s partly because of the many advances made since the 1960s, when the causal link between cigarette smoking and heart disease became convincing enough for everyone but cigarette manufacturers. Nor has it ever been a secret that staying healthy helps: All a person has to do to avoid a heart attack, supposedly, is to quit smoking, get proper sleep and exercise, control stress and avoid junk food. We now have better medications, like cholesterol-lowering drugs, and medical devices like pacemakers and defibrillators, and even microsurgery for in utero repairs of the heart muscle in embryos. Who can forget heart transplants, which were mind-blowing in the late 1960s but now seem almost routine? (Unless you are getting one.) Mechanical hearts and hearts grown from our own stem cells seem just around the corner. The treatment for heart disease, unlike cancer, can also seem invisible. Maybe, in the later stages, you can find yourself tethered to an oxygen tank, but no one goes bald as a treatment for open-heart surgery, and no one suffers a disfiguring loss that can threaten a person\u2019s sexual being. \u201cYou hear the word \u2018chemo\u2019 and you see what it does to people,\u201d Ally reminded me. \u201cI never looked sick until it was really bad. You can\u2019t really tell who has heart disease unless you know they do.\u201dIn truth, heart disease has become a victim of its own success. Yes, 90 percent of all heart attacks are preventable \u2014 but more than 735,000 Americans annually still suffer one. And while it may be easy to persuade a college-educated white woman to start going to spin class to save herself, there are far fewer options for poor people of color in the United States, who often lack access to grocery stores with fresh food, just for starters. Ally was on a transplant list twice after that day in the parking lot. She\u2019s now married, living with her second heart and a long, jagged scar, the top of which is visible whenever she wears an open-necked shirt. She has endured more surgeries for heart-related conditions, and more hospitalizations, and near daily wrangling with insurance companies. She manages, usually with good grace. Except for the abuse of passers-by who don\u2019t know how lucky they are.Mimi Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cTicker, the Quest to Build an Artificial Heart.\u201d A previous version of this article mistakenly said that breast cancer kills about one in 30 women a year in the United States.

Trump broke through their bullying and lies. We stood beside him, and now they want to take out the press from under him, and they want to use me as the distorted poster child to do it. They think you\u2019re weak.\u201dThe moves drastically reduce the audience for Infowars, which sells diet supplements and survivalist gear through a radio broadcast, videos and online stories spreading bizarre conspiracy theories and misinformation.Mr. Jones has been trying to compensate by promoting his website and mobile app. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones\u2019s bans spread, Infowars was Apple\u2019s fourth most popular news app, outranking those from every mainstream news media organization. Before the ban, it ranked 33rd on average since July 12.In an interview on Friday at his headquarters in Austin, Tex., Mr. Jones said the effort to limit his access to social media platforms was part of an elaborate plot to silence him involving Democrats, China, \u201cglobalists\u201d and \u201ccorporatists.\u201d He suggested that it was his support for President Trump, not his spreading of falsehoods, that led to him being \u201cde-platformed.\u201d\u201cThis is a war on free speech,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThis is what the corporate media is doing in America because it\u2019s afraid of new independent media and asking questions.\u201dMoney, he said in a follow-up interview on Saturday, was not a prime motivator for him. \u201cMoney is the jet fuel for the jet bombers I use to drop truth bombs,\u201d he said.Facebook removed Mr. Jones\u2019s pages for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.Indeed, Infowars\u2019 own website says in its terms of service that the company \u201cmay review and delete any content you post on the website or elsewhere utilizing our services or system if we determine, in our sole discretion, that the content violates the rights of others, is not appropriate for the website, or otherwise violates this agreement.\u201dBut Vera Eidelman, a fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, sided with Mr. Jones.\u201cWhile private companies can choose what to take down from their sites, the fact that social media platforms like Facebook have become indispensable platforms for the speech of billions means that they should resist calls to censor offensive speech,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe recent decision by Facebook and YouTube to take down Alex Jones\u2019s content may have provided a quick solution to a challenging situation, but encouraging these companies to silence individuals in this way will backfire.\u201dMr. Jones was defiant on his program Monday, saying past efforts to screen offensive broadcasts have \u201conly made us stronger.\u201d\u201cBut it has not allowed us to reach a lot of new people,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to understand now that Infowars is the most censored program in the world \u2014 because we know the truth.\u201dOver two decades, Mr. Jones has built a profitable business selling diet supplements, survivalist gear, and air and water filtration equipment as he spread bizarre theories, including that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were an inside job, and that various government-orchestrated plots are responsible for poisoning Americans\u2019 water, air and food.Mark Bankston and Bill Ogden, who represent the parents, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, said in a court filing that requiring the Pozners to disclose the information in a public document could subject them to \u201cfurther harassment or attack.\u201d Death threats and harassment by Mr. Jones\u2019s followers have forced the Pozners to move seven times, and they live in hiding.Mr. Jones has promoted himself and Infowars as near-solitary truth tellers in a news landscape dominated by left-leaning \u201ccorporatist\u201d media \u2014 even though the popular Drudge Report website broadcast his show on Monday. Now, what he calls his \u201cde-platforming\u201d has only increased his sense of grievance, and that of his followers \u2014 even as it shrinks his reach before the November midterm elections.\u201cI knew what the enemy was doing \u2014 I knew their battle plan, I made the conscious decision to draw their fire,\u201d he said on his show Monday. \u201cWhen you see the Alamo assaulted and myself probably destroyed, I\u2019ve been telling you this for years,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cRemember Infowars. Remember free speech.\u201dSo far, Mr. Trump, who praised Mr. Jones during an appearance on his radio show during the presidential campaign, has remained silent as Mr. Jones issues appeals to Trump supporters. Democrats have praised the takedown of Infowars content as long overdue.On his show, Mr. Jones is using the moves against his business to raise money and encourage his followers to migrate to his Infowars website, where he has posted the content removed by other platforms. He is also asking followers to donate to him \u2014 and buy his merchandise.\u201cDon\u2019t forget the financial support; that is the strongest thing you can do to make sure that we continue on and are strong in the fight,\u201d he said. Referring listeners to his online store, he said, \u201cGo there today and send them a strong message that you stand for the First Amendment, you stand for us and get air filtration, water filtration, optics, preparedness gear, high quality storable foods, supplements that are so good for you and your family.\u201cFeed your gladiator,\u201d he urged.Jack Nicas contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

But this voyeuristic focus on petty personal corruption is a harmful distraction. Trump\u2019s dalliances are a sideshow. So were Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cbimbo eruptions.\u201d As a largely apolitical friend of mine likes to say of such scandals, \u201cHow does this affect me?\u201d That\u2019s what a lot of people ask. What political types fail to understand is that many Americans don\u2019t hold our elected representatives in very high regard or look to them for moral example. We see them more as contractors hired to do a job. My friend\u2019s question is a good one for all of us to keep in mind. How do the things we\u2019re talking about and spending our time on affect the peace and prosperity of the nation? Scandal mongering for partisan advantage makes our nation less secure. It\u2019s one of the dangers of democratic government, which is why political systems like ours require politically mature citizens. Right now, we\u2019re not passing that test. Advertisement"}

It led to signs of a prehistoric shark feast.In 2015 Philip Mullaly was strolling along a beach in Victoria, Australia, when he spotted what looked like a shining serrated blade stuck in a boulder. Using his car keys, Mr. Mullaly carefully pried from the rock a shark tooth about the size of his palm. He didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the tooth he uncovered once belonged in the mouth of a 25-million-year-old giant shark that was twice the size of a great white.\u201cIt was an awesome creature, it would have been terrifying to come across,\u201d Mr. Mullaly said. Though Mr. Mullaly, who is a schoolteacher and amateur fossil hunter, has collected more than a hundred fossils, he never before found a prehistoric shark tooth. He returned to the boulder a few weeks later and to his surprise dug up several more three-inch teeth. \u201cIt dawned on me when I found the second, third and fourth tooth that this was a really big deal,\u201d said Mr. Mullaly. \u201cAngustidens was a bloody big shark, we\u2019re talking more than 30 feet long,\u201d said Dr. Fitzgerald.Dr. Fitzgerald also determined that all of the teeth most likely came from the same individual shark. Though people have found single shark teeth belonging to the mega-toothed shark before, Mr. Mullaly\u2019s find was the first time a set had been discovered in Australia, and only the third time a set of teeth belonging to the same individual Carcharocles angustidens had been found in the world.\u201cI said to him, \u2018You realize how important and rare these are?\u2019\u201d Dr. Fitzgerald said. \u201c\u2018There could be more there. We need to go back down there and dig.\u2019\u201dSo with a team of paleontologists, Dr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Mullaly returned to the beach last year, which was south of Melbourne. When the tide was low enough, the team uncovered more than 40 shark teeth from the boulder and part of the giant shark\u2019s vertebrae. Dr. Fitzgerald said that each Carcharocles angustidens tooth they found came from a different spot in the shark\u2019s jaw, which meant that all of the teeth most likely came from the same individual mega-shark.\u201cThe teeth were finely serrated and sharper than a steak knife,\u201d said Dr. Fitzgerald. \u201cThey are still sharp, even 25 million years later.\u201dMr. Mullaly donated the teeth to the Melbourne Museum, where they are on display until Oct. 7.Among the treasure trove of mega-shark teeth, the team also found prehistoric teeth belonging to a sixgill shark, which is a bottom-feeding scavenger that swims off the coasts of Australia today. Although the team found evidence that there was only one mega-shark there, they found indications that there were several different sixgill sharks on the scene. The findings paint a gruesome picture of what the paleontologists think occurred at this spot. Though it was the fiercest predator in the sea during its time, this colossal shark must have died and sunk to the seabed. There, a school of sixgill sharks, each with saw-like teeth, sliced its rotting flesh apart and feasted upon its carcass. \u201cIt\u2019s shark eating shark,\u201d Dr. Fitzgerald said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why We Try So Hard to Escape Our Humanity", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE big ideasMr. Ariely is a professor of psychology and author. We have the capacity to feel the emotions others experience as if those emotions were our own. We feel our children\u2019s joy when they first ride a bike or score a soccer goal, but we also cry when someone else is suffering a loss, and rejoice at one\u2019s good fortune. And we can experience these things even if the other person is just an acquaintance or even a complete stranger.When we stop to think about empathy, it is very clear that it is an amazing superpower. It allows us to transport ourselves into the mind of another person and view and feel life from their perspective. Of course, we can\u2019t completely step into that other person\u2019s shoes, but we can get close. Even more impressive is that sometimes when we watch a movie or read a book, we get to feel the joy and pain of fictional characters as if they were real. What kind of a dictator would you be?In a generic version of the dictator game, we pick two people to participate. The players don\u2019t know each other and are never to learn the other\u2019s identity. One is assigned to be Player A (without telling the participants, we call this role \u201cthe dictator\u201d), and the other player is assigned to be Player B (\u201cthe recipient\u201d). We give the dictator a sum of money; let\u2019s say $100. We then ask the dictator to allocate the money between himself and Player B. Any allocation is acceptable. The dictator can keep all the money and give the recipient nothing. He can keep $50 and give away the other half. The dictator can also keep nothing and give all the money to the recipient. How caring are we? In general, when this type of experiment is conducted across countries, genders and ages, most dictators give some money to the recipients. As one might expect, most dictators appear to care more about themselves than the recipients, and as a consequence typically give away 20-30 percent of the money. But they do care!In other versions of this basic experiment, dictators share more after they meet the recipient in person, or when the recipient belongs to their social group, or when the recipient demonstrates real need, or when they expect to meet and interact with the recipient again in the future. But the point is that we have a capacity for caring about others \u2014 and we take actions to follow up on this caring, even at a cost to ourselves. The dark side of caring Because our ability to care shows up when we are exposed to suffering, and because we have an instinct to try and avoid pain, we are often tempted to evade the very thing that makes us human: caring.As long as the people around us feel positive emotions, we join their emotional party, and we get happier as a consequence. But, what about when someone else is suffering? Here, too, we have the capacity to share in the feeling, but now we experience negative emotions and sadness. In fact, it can sometimes be agonizing. And this is when our innate empathy drives us to escape, in order to avoid those feelings and impede our humanity. How does this happen? We pass a panhandler on the street. We know that if we make eye contact we will feel compassion. We will experience some of his despair and be moved to give something. So what do we do? We work hard to look the other way. We focus intently on the buildings on the other side of the street or the array of cars down the road, hoping to keep our humanity, the part of us that cares, dormant. And the larger question is: Which version of humanity will we, individually and collectively, choose? Will we open our eyes to the pain of others, and with it feel the need to do something to help? Or will we just get better at looking away?Dan Ariely is an author and professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University.Advertisement"}

On Monday, the day the new economic plan was rolled out, streets were quiet and most shops were closed, as Mr. Maduro had decreed a national holiday. But most remained closed on Tuesday as shopkeepers tried to understand how to reset prices in the new currency and buyers struggled to make the conversion.Rosa Pe\u00f1a walked into a small shoe shop that was open in the low-income neighborhood of Petare, in Caracas, to look for flip-flops for her granddaughter. She brought a cellphone, which she borrowed from her daughter, to calculate what she would pay for the shoes in the new currency and to compare that with what she would have paid in the old, familiar one.Even with the help of a conversion app for the two currencies, she couldn\u2019t grasp what the new price meant.\u201cI can\u2019t even understand these numbers,\u201d Mrs. Pe\u00f1a said, holding up the phone. \u201cMy daughter gave me this, and she showed me how to use it, but we can\u2019t understand when we convert big amounts.\u201dThe new plan also introduced an increase in the minimum wage of more than 3,000 percent, which many business owners said they could not afford, leaving employees afraid for their jobs.\u201cWe are waiting for the store owner to tell us what he is going to do with us,\u201d said Marietta Guerrero, the manager of one of the few shops that opened in Caracas on Tuesday.As she wrote receipts with a black marker, waiting for the cash machines to be adjusted to the new currency, she explained that after only one month at her job, she is scared she might get fired.\u201cNo one here can afford an employee,\u201d she said, before helping a customer who could not figure out if she had enough of the new currency to make a purchase.It was not clear on Tuesday how many businesses were closed in response to the opposition\u2019s initiative and how many were waiting for clarity on the meaning of the new rules.Andr\u00e9s Vel\u00e1squez, an opposition leader, said the question of why the population was staying home was not relevant.

{"Headline": "The Church of Aretha Franklin", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow the Queen of Soul preached to us all.Dr. Dyson grew up in Detroit listening to Aretha Franklin.In 2015, Aretha Franklin invited me and a few others to join her in Philadelphia as she sang for Pope Francis. I was certainly thrilled to see the pontiff up close. But, I must confess, after many years of friendship, I was still more excited to watch the Queen of Soul. Even at 73, Franklin could trap lightning in her mouth at a moment\u2019s notice and shout down fire to earth. Just the mention of Aretha Franklin\u2019s name conjured transcendent sonic fury. She came to it honestly. Her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin, was one of the most storied preachers of his day. His rhetorical genius made its way onto dozens of recordings that were treasured possessions in many black homes. I grew up in Detroit, where the Reverend Franklin lived, but I first sampled the minister\u2019s words on my grandfather\u2019s Alabama farm. I was barely 6 years old and I sat, transfixed, by the record. Franklin was a down-home preacher whose sermons showcased his earthy squall, which could resolve in dramatic whisper. He was a master of the chanted sermon, where words are put under pressure of music and speech bursts into song. The young Aretha learned from her father and turned into a gospel wunderkind.  If Aretha got her gift from her father, I inherited my love for Aretha from my mother. When she migrated to Detroit from Alabama in the mid-1950s, my mother frequented the New Bethel Baptist Church where C.L. Franklin held forth every Sunday. She told me how, after the Reverend Franklin mesmerized the congregation with his poetic homilies, his teenage daughter would rise behind him to ratchet up the spirit. Her uncanny aptitude was so compelling that the congregation knew that greatness and the Spirit rested in double portion on this fearless young woman. One can hear her gargantuan gift on her first gospel recording, at age 14, \u201cNever Grow Old.\u201d When it came time for her to switch from sacred to secular, to head for the soul music charts after she had brilliantly charted the path of the soul in gospel music, she confronted brutal blowback from some black believers. They thought that she had betrayed her first love and her true calling. But they were wrong. After experimenting with numerous genres, from blues to jazz, Aretha Franklin found a bigger canvas on which to sketch her artistic vision, which drew both from ancient soul passions and progressive moral possibilities. Thus, she transformed Otis Redding\u2019s punchy \u201cRespect\u201d into a timeless anthem for racial pride and a cry of feminist recognition. Her church got larger, her congregation composed of millions of people in search of a soulful vision of spiritual direction beyond sanctuary doors. When she returned to the world of gospel in 1972, and again 15 years later, her embrace of the phrases and emotion of the sanctuary put at ease those who may have feared that she had somehow lost it, or that God had somehow forsaken her. Her father let the world know, in spirited remarks on her 1972 album, \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d that his daughter \u201cnever really left the church.\u201d And clearly it had never left her.During her remarkable career, Ms. Franklin made sure to incorporate her concern for social justice and redemptive politics as she performed at civil rights fund-raisers for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s and to benefit the efforts of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. She offered to post bond for the jailed revolutionary Angela Davis in the early \u201970s, going against the wishes of her father. In her statement at the time she said: \u201cI\u2019ve been locked up (for disturbing the peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Adorned in a spectacular hat, Ms. Franklin famously sang \u201cMy Country \u2019Tis of Thee\u201d at the first inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009. I was blessed to know Aretha Franklin personally, and she would sometimes call me to discuss current events. She had a crisp comprehension of the political machinations of our time. She reveled in the achievements of the first black president and registered grief at the polarization under his successor.As we stood on stage, we both realized, as we remarked later, that we were a long way from Detroit. We both fiercely loved Detroit, and Detroit, in turn, was exceedingly proud of her. She was a fearless evangelist for a city that was often spurned for its embrace of unapologetic black identity and leadership. The Baptist church that we both sprang from eventually took great delight in her reign as the most dominant force in American music. The preacher in me believed that hers was the best way to tell our story to a world that might never darken the doors of a church but was sorely in need of a dose of the Spirit. Aretha Franklin had a famous fear of flying. But now, like one of her compositions, she has ascended to a heavenly domain in which she passionately believed and to which her immortal art, both in the church and beyond, always pointed.

Tame foxes offer a tantalizing window into the nature of domestication. Starting around 1960, Russian scientists took farm-bred foxes and began to breed them selectively, not for better fur, but for friendliness toward humans. They are, however, an obvious resource for genetic studies that aim to tease out some of the genes involved in domestication, particularly in dogs. Foxes are canids, like wolves, dogs and the extinct wolves that are thought to have given rise to dogs.The gene is involved in regulating how the connections between brain cells work, which makes sense for a gene involved in social behavior. Other genes of interest are connected to human illnesses that affect behavior, like autism. Dr. Kukekova said that genes found in the fox are tantalizing hints. \u201cWe can\u2019t be 100 percent sure that they are involved in the evolution of behavior.\u201dBut the first step is to find these candidate genes, she said, and the current research shows that in that pursuit, the tame foxes are very useful animals.

He suffers from persistent insomnia. The work charts his sleep habits and his use of the apps WhatsApp, Uber and Instagram in real-time for viewers in London. Each of the four curtains is linked to a specific action: When Mr. Idrissa wakes up or opens an app, a set of curtains open; when he closes an app, or goes to sleep, another set closes.The piece is part of the show \u201cThe Future Starts Here,\u201d running through Nov. 4. The show assembles objects \u2014 some prototypes of advanced technology, some so familiar they may seem old-fashioned \u2014 and artworks that serve as starting points for imagining possible futures and examining the complexities of modern life.Sit down at a table for one, with a bottle of the meal-replacement drink Soylent, in a recreation of a Dutch restaurant for solo diners. Marvel at the models of planned floating cities, or a 13-year-old\u2019s vision of a rebuilt Aleppo. Pick up a book from a library curated for the end of civilization, and read.Alongside these there are works of art, like Ms. July and Mr. Idrissa\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m the President, Baby\u201d is a lens into issues of migration, app-based communication, the gig economy, surveillance, social media and privacy \u2014 all that from four sets of elegant curtains, opening and closing on a museum wall.Mr. Idrissa said his insomnia started in about 2006. He came to the United States on a student visa, which expired. \u201cI was supposed to be deported, and they sent me a letter,\u201d Mr. Idrissa said in a recent interview. He said that one day the immigration authorities \u201ccame to my door at 4 or 5 in the morning and the lady there wouldn\u2019t let them in. So there were three or four years of just hiding, and I sleep only a couple hours a night.\u201d Now, Mr. Idrissa is a citizen of the United States, but the insomnia hasn\u2019t left. He says he often spends hours awake on his bed, scrolling through apps.\u201cI remember I told him about the trauma of the birth of my child,\u201d Ms. July said. \u201cI had this rough, rough birth, and I was really quite sad. We were both talking about a trauma that wasn\u2019t really leaving our bodies.\u201d She said the conversation stayed with her, and that when she was commissioned to make a work for the Victoria and Albert show she thought of Mr. Idrissa. He agreed to work on it with her, despite Ms. July\u2019s initial concern that the project was too invasive.\u201cIt\u2019s making something into a civilized object that\u2019s also kind of a distressing feeling potentially, or at least unsettling,\u201d Ms. July said.Many of the objects and artworks in the \u201cThe Future Starts Here\u201d could be described that way. The show is sprawling, overwhelming, awash with screen-light. The half-familiar automated sounds of Siri and Alexa\u2019s voices pulsate on repeat in parts of the gallery, along with the buzz of futuristic music. The exhibition itself is beautifully housed and designed, in bright neon and pastel colors. It\u2019s divided into four thematic areas \u2014 Self, Public, Planet and Afterlife \u2014 though these arenas feel porous.The exhibition\u2019s co-curator Rory Hyde said that he wasn\u2019t sure the museum could have done the show five years ago, when digitization seemed to sound the death knell for physical objects.\u201cBut objects are relevant again,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you think about the self-driving car, or Facebook\u2019s aircraft. Even the tech companies are moving back into physical engineering.\u201dMariana Pestana, the show\u2019s other co-curator said: \u201cObjects have this incredible capacity to embody visions. We think of these objects as beginnings that open up a set of possibilities.\u201dTo walk into the show is to be confronted by big questions in all-caps text: \u201cWHAT MAKES US HUMAN?\u201d \u201cIS EDWARD SNOWDEN A HERO OR A TRAITOR?\u201d \u201cWE ARE ALL CONNECTED, BUT DO WE FEEL LONELY?\u201d The wall text explores nightmare scenarios and seeks to maintain optimism, often at the same time. The questions present an alternative to tech evangelism and extreme pessimism, but sometimes as a framing device they can feel didactic.The effect, though, is to make us realize how little we know the answers to these questions, and how uncertain we are about what the world will look like in five years, much less 50. The objects succeed in imbuing their own wonder and terror.There are some historical objects in the show as well \u2014 an early home telephone and a celestial globe from around 1627 \u2014 that allow viewers to consider just how much and how rapidly society and the objects in it have changed. A scarf that reads \u201cVotes for Women\u201d reminds us that 2018 is the centennial of women\u2019s right to vote in Britain.\u201cWe\u2019re now at the centenary of the first women\u2019s vote in the U.K.,\u201d Ms. Pestana said. \u201cA hundred years ago this idea that women could vote was a radical idea, and not a plausible future. Nowadays it\u2019s something of the norm, at least in the West, so we wanted to use this object to consider that some of the ideas in the show, even if they seem radical and implausible, maybe they\u2019re not, maybe they can be the future.\u201dPerhaps the most moving parts of the show are the artistic works, like Ms. July and Mr. Idrissa\u2019s, that respond in some way to the too-much-ness of contemporary and future life. They\u2019re interspersed throughout the show, among the objects themselves.Almost easy to miss, tucked next to a splashy flier that reads, \u201cCampaign to Stop Killer Robots,\u201d is a stuffed panda. You might walk right past it, or take it for another version of the cuddle-you-to-sleep robot seal.It\u2019s actually part of Ai Weiwei and Jacob Appelbaum\u2019s 2015 work, \u201cPanda to Panda.\u201d The panda is stuffed with shredded government documents and a memory card containing information leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. A series of these pandas were sent to dissidents around the world, creating what Mr. Appelbaum called a \u201cdistributed backup\u201d of the politically sensitive documents they had published. \u201cPanda to Panda\u201d is also an art piece about subverting state power, surveillance, and secrets. This particular panda, the wall text notes, is on loan from Julian Assange.\u201cThe safest place to put these things is in a museum, a gallery, where it\u2019s protected as an object,\u201d Mr. Appelbaum said, in a video about the piece.And there it sits, an object among the other objects \u2014 simultaneously a piece of art, a thing, a part of history and a harbinger of possible futures.Advertisement"}

The wounded included four teenage girls.At a block party providing distraction from the weekend heat wave, Jahnae Patterson, 17, was shot in the face and died.Scenes like these unfolded over and over again in Chicago during the course of a long, exceptionally violent weekend. From Friday at 6 p.m. through Sunday at midnight, 66 people were shot, 12 of whom died. The count served as a stark reminder that despite recent progress in reducing shootings and gun deaths, the root causes of Chicago\u2019s notorious crime problem have yet to be addressed, community members and city officials said. As of Monday evening, the police had made no arrests in connection with the shootings.\u201cPray for our city my baby is gone,\u201d wrote Ms. Patterson\u2019s mother, Tanika Humphries, on her Facebook page.John H.

Some of the attacks were made on foot, others from cars, and some were met with return fire. But many of the victims were clearly not the intended targets, the police said.Despite a steady decline since 2016, shootings in Chicago in the first five days of August were higher than they have been for the same period in recent years, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab, which tracks gun violence in the city.\u201cIt had seemed like the city was trending in the right direction, but when you see this, anybody who lives in the city of Chicago is going to be concerned,\u201d said Jens Ludwig, the Crime Lab\u2019s director.At a news conference on Monday, the police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, and the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, sought to place much of the blame for the weekend carnage \u2014 and for the still-high rate of violent crime \u2014 on factors other than the police department or the city government, citing too many guns in circulation, the failure of courts and judges to convict and hold accountable those caught with illegal guns, and the need for better parenting.They said, too, that people in the neighborhoods with the most violence needed to \u201cstep up\u201d and help the police solve these crimes. But community leaders, civil rights groups and critics of the police say those statements belie a deeper problem: That the police have given the people who live in the neighborhoods hardest hit by the violence little reason to trust them. Chicago has one of the lowest rates of solving murders of any major city in the country.In many places, constructive interaction between the community and the police rarely happens, they say, adding that officers react in force to shootings but virtually disappear when it comes to crime prevention, community policing and, often, investigations.The police have maintained for years that an endemic \u201cno-snitch\u201d culture keeps them from solving more serious violent crimes. Many residents are afraid to help because they believe there is little the police would \u2014 or could \u2014 do to protect them from retaliation.That fear is reinforced for residents who must navigate gang territory to get to stores, take a walk, or pick up children from day care.The combined effect is that some residents feel the police are more of an occupying force than one that is there to protect them.\u201cThe people on the south and west sides have endured deep, intergenerational trauma from having police officers brutalize folks in ways that don\u2019t make the headlines, and seeing that happen again and again and again,\u201d said Sheila Bedi, a law professor at Northwestern University who was a member of one of the mayoral task force\u2019s working groups.\u201cThe only tool the Chicago Police has is making arrests,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re not there to try to stop any violence. They\u2019re entirely a reactive force.\u201d Mending the divide will only happen with a fundamental overhaul of how the police department operates in these neighborhoods along with reinvestment by the city in resources that have been taken away, she said.At the news conference on Monday, Superintendent Johnson said the Chicago Police Department had made progress on these issues over the past two years.\u201cWe\u2019re working hard to repair relationships in the community, especially the black communities, with C.P.D. That\u2019s not easy to do. You think it\u2019s easy for me to stand up here and have to talk about this? Because it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t enjoy this. But I know it\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d said Superintendent Johnson, who is black. \u201cBut what I\u2019m asking is for the community to step up and do their part also,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve these things without the community. C.P.D. is only as good as the faith the community has in it.\u201dSarah Mervosh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Retirement Community Turned Away These Married Women", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe new old ageAccording to the facility\u2019s \u201ccohabitation policy,\u201d marriage is between one man and one woman, \u201cas it is understood in the Bible.\u201d Mary Walsh and Beverly Nance did considerable research in 2016 before deciding to move into a continuing care retirement community outside St. Louis.They took a tour of Friendship Village Sunset Hills and were impressed by its pool and fitness center, a calendar crammed with activities, the newly built apartments for independent living. They had meals with a friend and with a former co-worker, and their spouses, all of them enthusiastic residents. \u201cWe\u2019d met other people from the community, and they were very friendly,\u201d said Ms. Walsh, 72, a retired manager for AT&T. \u201cI was feeling good about it.\u201d Like most C.C.R.C.s, Friendship Village \u2014 a \u201cfaith-based\u201d but nondenominational nonprofit \u2014 includes assisted living and a nursing home on its 52-acre campus, an important consideration. If one woman someday needed more care than the other, \u201cwe\u2019d still be able to have dinner together,\u201d Ms. Walsh said. \u201cWe wanted to be together, no matter what happened.\u201dThe community seemed eager to recruit them, too, offering a lower entrance fee if they signed an agreement promptly. So they paid a $2,000 deposit on a two-bedroom unit costing $235,000. Mary WalshThey notified their homeowners association that they\u2019d be putting their house in Shrewsbury, Mo., on the market and canceled a vacation because they\u2019d be moving in 90 days. Ms. Walsh contacted a realtor and began packing. Then came a call from the residence director, asking Ms. Walsh the nature of her relationship with Ms. Nance, 68, a retired professor.\u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019ve been married since 2009,\u2019\u201d Ms. Walsh replied. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m going to need to call you back.\u2019\u201d In turning down their application, Friendship Village had mailed a copy of its cohabitation policy, which limits shared units to siblings, parents and children, or spouses. \u201cThe term \u2018marriage\u2019 as used in this policy means the union of one man and one woman, as marriage is understood in the Bible,\u201d the policy noted. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more clear-cut case of discrimination because of sex,\u201d said Julie Wilensky, senior staff attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The center represents the couple, along with private attorneys and the ACLU of Missouri, in what\u2019s believed to be the first federal suit by a same-sex couple turned away from a retirement community. \u201cOne thing so troubling about this case, and this time, is the argument that religious beliefs can justify discrimination,\u201d said Michael Adams, chief executive of Sage, an advocacy group for L.G.B.T. seniors. Faith organizations operate many retirement facilities. If a baker can refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple (and have the Supreme Court agree, albeit on narrow grounds), can a C.C.R.C. refuse admission to Mary Walsh and Beverly Nance?Neither the federal nor the Missouri law explicitly covers sexual orientation, but both outlaw sex discrimination. \u201cIf either Mary or Beverly were a man, the couple wouldn\u2019t have been denied housing,\u201d Ms. Wilensky said. Compared to older adults who are heterosexual, \u201cthey\u2019re much less likely to be parents and twice as likely to be single and live alone,\u201d said Mr. Adams of Sage.With less help from partners or families, \u201cthey\u2019re more likely to have to rely on professional care and services,\u201d Mr. Adams said.His organization has fielded thousands of complaints about long-term care from L.G.B.T. seniors: disrespect from staff members, harassment by fellow residents, religious proselytizing, refusal to recognize same-sex relationships. \u201cWe often hear about people deciding to go back in the closet because they\u2019re afraid,\u201d Mr. Adams said.In about half the tests, the facilities were more likely to discriminate. The testers posing as same-sex spouses were offered fewer rental units, faced higher prices or more burdensome application requirements, or were less likely to hear about financial incentives. With its written policy, Friendship Village operated more blatantly. The management declined an interview request. But in a statement, the vice president of its board of directors said that \u201cguided by our Christian faith,\u201d it led \u201ca loving community that wishes only the very best for all people, including Ms. Walsh and Ms. Nance.\u201d The statement went on to say, \u201cWe are taking the matter very seriously. We are prayerfully and thoughtfully reviewing this issue.\u201d Advocates fear that the progress they\u2019ve made could be undermined by federal actions, however, and by a possibly related slip in public approval. But in its most recent survey, more respondents said they felt uncomfortable in certain scenarios (a child having a gay teacher, for example), while L.G.B.T. people reported increasing discrimination.Ms. Walsh and Ms. Nance thought they\u2019d gotten past this sort of response. Earlier, visiting a Lutheran retirement community, Ms. Walsh had asked an administrator if he foresaw a problem admitting two married women. \u201cHe said no and looked at me like, why would you ask me such a silly question?\u201d So when Friendship Village suddenly refused them, \u201cI was blindsided,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they had kicked me in the stomach.\u201d Initially stunned, the women grew angry, contacted the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, then decided to turn to the courts.\u201cThis is not right. They shouldn\u2019t be able to do this,\u201d Ms. Walsh said of Friendship Village. \u201cWe met all the qualifications, other than one of us wasn\u2019t a man.\u201d Their lawsuit asks the court to order the facility to develop policies and procedures to prevent discrimination.And the women seek a permanent injunction to keep the community from denying them admission. After all this, they still want to move into Friendship Village.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cybersecurity Firm Finds Way to Alter WhatsApp Messages", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A cybersecurity company said it had discovered a flaw in WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service with 1.5 billion users, that allows scammers to alter the content or change the identity of the sender of a previously delivered message.By creating a hacked version of the WhatsApp application, scammers can change a \u201cquote\u201d \u2014 a feature that allows people within a chat to display a past message and reply to it \u2014 to give the impression that someone sent a message they did not actually send, according to the company, Check Point Software Technologies.WhatsApp acknowledged that it was possible for someone to manipulate the quote feature, but the company disagreed that it was a flaw. WhatsApp said the system was working as it had intended, because the trade-offs to prevent such a deception by verifying every message on the platform would create an enormous privacy risk or bog down the service. The company said it worked to find and remove anyone using a fake WhatsApp application to spoof the service.\u201cWe carefully reviewed this issue and it\u2019s the equivalent of altering an email,\u201d Carl Woog, a spokesman for WhatsApp, said in a statement. What Check Point discovered had nothing to do with the security of WhatsApp\u2019s so-called end-to-end encryption, which ensures only the sender and recipient can read messages, he said.WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users on its platform, making it the world\u2019s most widely used messaging app. It has gained popularity for the simplicity and security of its service, providing encryption so that even the company does not know the content of its users\u2019 messages. Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.Mr. Woog of WhatsApp said the company was taking \u201cthe challenge of misinformation seriously,\u201d putting limits on how widely a message can be shared to different groups and attaching labels when a message has been forwarded. However, WhatsApp said the issue raised by Check Point was unrelated to its efforts to curb misinformation.Oded Vanunu, head of vulnerability research at Check Point, said the ability to alter messages gave attackers a powerful tool to spread misinformation from what appeared to be a trusted source. It is especially problematic in group chats, which can include up to 256 people. Multiple messages can come in at once and it can be easy to lose track of what someone has said, he said.\u201cThe public relies on the integrity of the message,\u201d said Mr. Vanunu. \u201cWhatsApp needs to adjust to prevent this simple manipulation.\u201dFor now, the issue appears limited to a discussion among security experts. Both WhatsApp and Check Point Software said they had not seen regular users creating fake quote messages in chats.Check Point said it also discovered a way within group chats to send a message to a specific individual within the discussion. That individual is tricked into believing that the whole group saw the message and responds accordingly.WhatsApp played down the concerns raised by Check Point, saying most people know the person who they are messaging on the service. The company said 90 percent of all messages on the service are sent in one-on-one conversations, and the majority of groups are six people or less \u2014 making it less likely that an unknown person can infiltrate a conversation to trick other users.A person can check the validity of a quote message by clicking on it. Doing so will take you back to the point in the chat when the message was sent unless the message was deleted or the person was not a participant in the chat when the message was sent.WhatsApp said the potential fixes to this issue were not worth trying. One solution would be to create transcripts of every message exchange to verify the accuracy of every quote. Creating such a transcript is a significant privacy risk because those accounts of what people wrote to each other must be stored somewhere, the company said.Advertisement"}

Last week, the state of Tennessee responded in kind.Ms. Renkl is a contributing opinion writer.Thursday was Billy Ray Irick\u2019s last day on Earth. His execution was the first in Tennessee since 2009.Based on post-trial affidavits from Paula Dyer\u2019s stepfamily, the psychologist who pronounced Mr. Irick fit to stand trial in 1986 later questioned that judgment. \u201cIs he fit for execution? That combination of words,\u201d Mr. Hale writes, \u201clike so many in the lexicon of the death penalty, twists the English language into a peculiar shape. But it is crucial.\u201d In the United States, executing an insane person is unconstitutional. Another problem with this execution is Tennessee\u2019s new protocol for lethal injection. The first drug administered in an execution is supposed to put the inmate to sleep so he can\u2019t feel the effects of the other two drugs: the one that causes paralysis and the one that stops the heart. But midazolam, the sedative in Tennessee\u2019s execution cocktail, doesn\u2019t always render complete unconsciousness. It\u2019s possible for the inmate to feel the effects of the next two drugs, and what he feels is akin to being suffocated and burned alive at the same time. This is the unvarying pattern in death-penalty cases: arguments in favor of lenience, arguments in favor of severity and a perfectly realistic assumption that nothing at all will change. Some victims will be more sympathetic than others. Some death-row prisoners will be harder to hate. Defense attorneys will point out extenuating circumstances. Critics will list the pragmatic arguments against the death penalty \u2014 from its failure to deter crime to the racial disparities in its application to its terrifying permanence.It would be a tiresome litany if not for the fact that a human life hangs in the balance. It would be a tiresome litany if not for the fact that in state executions, the executioner is always you.Then too, there is the matter of our own dignity, the dignity of those of us in whose name and for whose \u201cprotection\u201d the state has decided \u2014 in cold blood, with calm premeditation \u2014 to take a human life. We are not doing it out of fear or rage or insanity. We are doing it out of a primitive need for vengeance.Paula Dyer was a beautiful little girl who deserved a full and happy life, but Billy Ray Irick\u2019s death didn\u2019t give it back to her. His death did not erase her terrible suffering or bring her back to the people who have mourned her loss for more than three decades. Justice Sotomayor is right. We are not a civilized nation.

Financing reached a high of $2.92 billion in 2015, but this year, it is on pace to be less than half that, according to CB Insights, a financial research firm.The number of independent ad tech companies has fallen 21 percent since 2013, to 185 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to LUMA Partners, which analyzes digital media and marketing.\u201cWhile all industries go through a maturation curve, this one faces a particular need for consolidation,\u201d said Terry Kawaja, the chief executive of LUMA Partners. \u201cSo many of these companies were not profitable.\u201dAlthough many consumers have never heard of ad tech firms, people\u2019s online activity is influenced every day by these companies as they battle for a share of ad impressions on phones, tablets and laptops. The \u201cMad Men\u201d style of advertising workers has been replaced by the \u201cmath men\u201d of ad tech start-ups, which specialize in gathering data on consumer preferences.Advertising, the economic juice behind the internet, has long been an attractive area for start-ups. During the last 10 years, the ease of forming companies and the availability of cheap venture capital led to a flood of ad tech start-ups, pushing boundaries on where and how ads were delivered. They introduced technologies like the automation of ad buying \u2014 called programmatic advertising \u2014 and header bidding, in which many ad exchanges bid on publishers\u2019 space simultaneously.Ari Paparo, chief executive of the ad tech start-up Beeswax, said he had noticed a distinct decline in venture capital funding for ad tech firms just in the last two years. \u201cThe private market is influenced by the public market, and you saw so many fail as publicly traded entities,\u201d he said.There were 260 deals between ad tech companies and venture capital firms in 2014 but only 122 in 2017, according to PitchBook. In the first half of 2018, there have been 53 deals.The fear is that when investment dries up, innovation will die.Small start-ups are crucial to the industry because they often serve as catalysts for technological advances, said Doug Knopper, one of the founders of the ad tech platform FreeWheel, which was sold to Comcast in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s still more innovation to come, but if V.C.s don\u2019t put money into it because they don\u2019t see a path to exit, does innovation stall?\u201d he said, referring to venture capitalists.Some are hoping a third big competitor could help the industry. Eric Adelman, president and one of the founders of Three Pillars Recruiting, said while the AT&T acquisition consolidates power in fewer places, the deal could help make AT&T a rival to Google and Facebook.\u201cHaving three giants in the industry is much better than having two giants,\u201d he said.In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cThe dynamics of the market may be changing, but it\u2019s stemming more from people\u2019s shifting consumption habits than one platform\u2019s popularity.\u201dNot all smaller players are giving up. Kevin Hunt, senior vice president of global marketing for the ad platform SpotX, is betting that his company\u2019s focus on video advertising will set it apart.\u201cIt\u2019s important for companies who are in this space to be technically flexible, to make sure they have built a solid foundation that allows them to move as technology moves,\u201d he said.Eric Franchi, one of the founders and a former executive at the digital advertising company Undertone, isn\u2019t giving up on ad tech. After the software company Perion acquired Undertone in 2015, Mr. Franchi teamed up with Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, to fund an ad tech-focused venture-capital fund called MathCapital that helps the little guys.\u201cWe want the best entrepreneurs that want to build ad tech companies to come to us,\u201d Mr. Franchi said. \u201cOver time, hopefully we can be a force for good in the space to help these companies get started.\u201dAnd even after Ben Barokas sold his company Admeld to Google in 2011, he decided to stay in the ad tech industry, creating a content compensation platform called Sourcepoint.\u201cI think certainly Facebook and Google are hoovering up the vast majority of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I believe in independent content creation.

{"Headline": "Russia Hated John McCain, and Will Miss Him Dearly", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 He was long reviled by Russia\u2019s state-controlled media as a deranged warmonger. President Vladimir V. Putin said he had \u201clost his roof\u201d \u2014 in other words, gone crazy \u2014 during his time in captivity in Vietnam. Despite, or rather because of, all the abuse, however, Senator John McCain will be sorely missed in Moscow.In a report on Mr. McCain\u2019s death, Rossiya 1, a state television channel, called him \u201cthe chief symbol of Russophobia\u201d and as such the main reason Moscow\u2019s relations with the West are so bad. Life News, an outlet close to the Russian security services, declared him the West\u2019s \u201cchief Russophobe.\u201dThe beauty of \u201cRussophobia\u201d from Russia\u2019s perspective is that it absolves Moscow of any responsibility for the consequences of its own actions \u2014 the annexation of Crimea, its military incursions into Georgia and eastern Ukraine, the shooting down of a Malaysian passenger jet and its repeated meddling in Western elections \u2014 and has turned the country into an innocent victim of, well, John McCain.But what to do now that, as Oleg Morozov, a member of the foreign affairs committee of Russia\u2019s upper house of Parliament, declared this week, \u201cThe enemy is dead\u201d?He mentioned Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, and other critics of Mr. Putin in Washington as possible substitutes, but said: \u201cNone of them is as charismatic as John McCain. It will be hard to find somebody who can replace him as the main Russophobe.\u201dApparently calculating that kicking a dead man looks bad, and unsure about how to make sense of the world now that the man supposedly responsible for so many of Russia\u2019s troubles has gone, Russia\u2019s state news media has in recent days somewhat muted its previously splenetic attacks on Mr. McCain and even given voice to what pass for tributes.\u201cGive him credit for his honest enmity, his honest hatred and intransigence,\u201d said Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the Kremlin-funded RT news network. \u201cOthers play a double game. He said what he thought.\u201dSoviet ideologues and propagandists mostly stayed away from the idea, preferring to blame the machinations of class enemies, foreign capitalists and imperialists for their country\u2019s problems. But as faith in Marxism withered in the 1980s and Russian nationalism re-emerged as a potent force, interest in \u201cRussophobia\u201d resurfaced.The true flowering of \u201cRussophobia\u201d as a concept embraced not only by fringe nationalists but by the Russian state did not take place until the 2014 crisis in Ukraine. Russian officials and the state-controlled news media started using the term daily to explain why the West was protesting so loudly over the annexation of Crimea and Russia\u2019s military intervention in eastern Ukraine.Throughout, Mr. McCain was cast as the principal source of all of this supposed hatred.That Mr. McCain was not a fan of President Putin and also a tireless supporter of his foes across the former Soviet Union, including the former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, is beyond dispute.But his place at the center of Russian demonology stems not only from his long record of resisting what he saw as Russian aggression, but also from the Kremlin\u2019s need to find a self-exculpatory explanation for why its relations with the West have soured so badly.The list, however, highlights how difficult it will be for Russia to find a substitute hate figure for Mr. McCain. The other \u201cRussophobes\u201d on the list \u2014 Hillary Clinton, the actor Morgan Freeman, a handful of journalists and a few other, mostly obscure, figures \u2014 are either has-beens or carry too little weight to step into Mr. McCain\u2019s shoes as the plausible ringleader of what is supposed to be a global conspiracy.Molly McKew, an American consultant who worked in the past for Mr. Saakashvili and who appeared at the bottom of RT\u2019s top-10 Russophobes list, said she \u201cwould be happy to take John McCain\u2019s spot on the list\u201d if that means someone ready to \u201cpush back the dark, cynical vision of the world Putin cherishes.\u201dBut, she said, \u201cIf I am all they\u2019ve got, they\u2019ve got a problem.\u201dShe added: \u201cI think they miss him already.\u201dLincoln Pigman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But in my loved-up, idle state, it was quite likely I had tried my luck at winning a luxury honeymoon to India.I replied with probing questions, wary of falling for a scam. A response arrived that was reassuring and convincing. An itinerary was fixed upon. Flight dates were set. At no point were my credit card details or passport demanded.It was real. I was going to India.\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d I crowed to friends, family, anyone who would listen. \u201cCan you believe I actually won?\u201d It felt miraculous, this random gift from the universe.Friends looked at their shoes; my mother cleared her throat. Nobody wanted to ask, but somehow they managed: \u201cWho are you going to take with you?\u201dBecause 11 days before I\u2019d won, the man in Boston whom I loved, who I thought was going to marry me in a year, had Skyped to say he didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. The distance was exhausting. He needed to focus on his own life. He thought it would be best for both of us. He was sorry.I don\u2019t remember the call as it happened, but I recall the aftermath, when I was crying too hard to stay upright and crawled under my coffee table, howling like an injured animal. Friends arrived, peeled me off the floor, fed me and eased my path into the wilderness of heartbreak.Everywhere I looked, I saw question marks: What happened? What did I do wrong? Who will come with me on my honeymoon? What, really, have I won?The prize wasn\u2019t a gift from the universe so much as a cruel joke.Three months later, when I arrived at Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport with my best friend in tow (passed off as my \u201cmaid of honor\u201d to the company handling the travel arrangements, along with an implausible series of lies about why my husband was unable to come), a driver met us with a sign that read, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Stevens.\u201dWhen we got to the hotel, a man delivered cocktails to our room with a note congratulating the \u201chappy couple.\u201d He looked confusedly at the two of us and said, \u201cWhere is Mr. Stevens?\u201dAt breakfast the next day, the manager came to greet us as honored guests. \u201cOur lucky winners,\u201d he said, beaming, and then, \u201cMrs. Stevens, I am so sorry Mr. Stevens is not here.\u201dAround us: the happy murmuring of other people\u2019s conversations, cutlery scrapes, eruptions of laughter from distant tables. A brief silence, and then what could I say in response? Yes, me too? I too was sorry my husband wasn\u2019t there \u2014 sorrier than the hotel manager was, I bet. But the honeymoon went on, and so did the confusion of our hosts, at every stop on our itinerary. Rose petals on the beds, champagne chilled for our arrival, chocolates arranged in heart shapes on the pillows. My friend and I were careful to acknowledge and thank the hotels for these flourishes, and each time our awkwardness was reflected back on us tenfold by our hosts.They were baffled at the sight of two apparently unattached women sharing the honeymoon suite. The question that had been filling my brain before I arrived \u2014 \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d \u2014 was now being posed, politely and persistently, on a balcony in Agra with a view of tiered swimming pools and the Taj Mahal, on the back of an elephant climbing to Jaipur\u2019s Amber Fort, on a boat gliding across Lake Pichola beneath a bat-filled sky.We got back from excursions to find the trappings of romance spirited away from our room and replaced by other, more platonic gifts: jewelry, scarves and once, unnervingly, a pair of dolls, nestled between the pillows. Then we\u2019d arrive at the next leg of the tour and it would happen all over again: \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201dI repeated this refrain, along with variations, to my best friend: \u201cWhere is he? Why isn\u2019t he here?\u201d The price she paid for this luxury vacation was having to endure the most miserable travel companion of all time. She swam and sunbathed, wore a succession of very good hats and bought a Kashmiri rug; I huddled in the corner of our room and called the man who had chosen not to be there, leaving voice mail messages: \u201cWhere are you? Why aren\u2019t you here?\u201d I was the most self-pitying of lucky winners, having won the honeymoon but lost the fianc\u00e9.Here\u2019s the lesson I was learning about winning: It is impermanent, unstable, transient. It isn\u2019t a happy ending, just punctuation between sentences, a triumphant pause before life rolls onward in uncontrollable directions.If you win one race but lose 15 others, have you won at all? If you earn someone\u2019s respect, attention and love, and then lose it again, what did you win? Winning can be lost. You can lose at winning.\u201cI\u2019m going to get him back,\u201d I said to my friend as we lounged by the pool, doused in dark yellow sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m going to win back his love.\u201dHer face in response: a perfect composite of pity, skepticism and restraint. She knew it wouldn\u2019t go that way, and knew, too, that I wasn\u2019t ready to hear it.Of course, I did not win him back. But here\u2019s another lesson I have learned about winning: not just how unstable it is or the way it can shift to loss, but how it can eventually transform into triumph all over again. How would it have been, I think now, if that trip had really been the beginning of my married life to the man in Boston? It would have been delirious, ecstatic. Ten days of happiness, followed by a month, or two months, or a year of contentment.And then, one by one, the problems the man predicted on that Skype call would have come to the fore: he needed to focus on his career and decide for himself what he wanted to do.And didn\u2019t I, really, prefer women to men? And didn\u2019t I, really, have an aversion to the straight and strait-laced married life I would have signed up for in the giddiness of love? My mood swings and impulsiveness would have frustrated him. His caution and risk aversion would have made me feel stifled. One of us would have been driven crazy by the way the other chewed or swallowed or breathed. In short, it would not have worked out. That win was never going to last.I am in love with someone else now, a woman, and happier than I have ever been. When I think back to the honeymoon, to the hotels and the good food, the gifts and the lovely, dusty luxury of it, I don\u2019t feel any loss at all. Those days my best friend and I spent in India, wandering through a choreographed, red-rose, moonlit version of romance without knowing the routine, was a premonition of queerness before my own queer life got underway.I could not have foreseen, on that lovelorn journey, that I would look back on it as one of the greatest examples of having it all. I want to crow to my heartbroken former self: \u201cYou got the honeymoon, but you didn\u2019t have to have the husband.\u201d What a coup! What a win! Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018Searching\u2019 Uses Tech Devices as Narrative Devices", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA thriller that takes place entirely on computer screens and apps required rethinking everything. The filmmakers explain \u2014 by text, Google Hangout and other platforms. Skype was on the fritz. I was trying to do a call with the filmmakers of \u201cSearching,\u201d a thriller that unfolds on computer screens and digital devices, but mine were not cooperating. The audio was clear but the filmmakers weren\u2019t showing up onscreen, and the clock was ticking. I didn\u2019t want to take time away to download an update to the app (and yes, I did that thing in which you deactivate and reactivate the camera button), so after some more fiddling, we decided to move the conversation to Google Hangouts instead. Trying to figure out the best way to communicate through constantly changing technology is the story of my life right now, probably yours as well. And using tech to solve problems is pretty much a daily task. \u201cSearching\u201d takes these ideas to the most urgent of places: How well could we navigate a sea of technology if someone\u2019s life depended on it? Much like those earlier films, \u201cSearching\u201d takes an unconventional approach to storytelling, which meant even the screenplay was written in an unconventional way. I asked Mr. Chaganty via iMessage about the difference. He texted, \u201cWhat we ended up writing was a scriptment \u2014 a creative mix of a screenplay and a treatment that factored in the mouse movement, text messages and browser windows.\u201dAnd yet, with all these forms of expression, sometimes they pull us away from those closest to us. That becomes clear when David realizes he doesn\u2019t know where his daughter has been spending her time. (In one scene, someone tells David that Margot has a Tumblr account. He Googles \u201ctumbler.\u201d) To visualize that difference, the filmmakers created a look for each character\u2019s computer. David\u2019s is more private, with less on his desktop and a sense of order. Margot\u2019s is a social world that keeps opening up further, forcing David to figure out how to navigate it. From her Facebook and Tumblr to a live-blogging site she uses called YouCast, Margot has crafted a life that is exposed and open to the world but completely hidden from her own father.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beautiful Mess in a Savory Pie", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteWith its filling of roasted eggplants, tomatoes and cheese, ratatouille pie may not be tidy, but it is irresistible.There\u2019s fancy: eggplant, tomatoes and zucchini artfully cut and arranged in a dish before baking \u2014 the kind of thing you don\u2019t mind getting the china down for. And there\u2019s simple: a potentially sloppy mix of long-stewed vegetables, liable to collapse in an oily heap on your everyday plates before being devoured. The same can be said for ratatouille baked in a crust. It can be an elegant tart, a dainty quiche or, as in this case, a rustic pie that\u2019s homely, but impossible to resist. Its golden crust shatters messily when you cut it. The custard filling could leak, escaping the pastry. The cheese may brown; the tomatoes on top may shrivel.None of that matters when you taste it, each buttery, creamy, vegetable-filled bite flavored with herbs and olives, and covered in cheese. Here, I skipped the raw tomatoes, substituting a mix of summer vegetables cooked in plenty of olive oil until velvety soft. I particularly like to roast them so they caramelize and release much of their moisture, which keeps the pastry from turning soggy. If you have leftover ratatouille or any kind of cooked vegetables \u2014 roasted, grilled, saut\u00e9ed \u2014 in your fridge, you could use those instead. You\u2019ll need about three to four cups of cooked vegetables, enough to fill the crust by two-thirds.No matter how else you tweak it, make sure to bake the pie on the day of serving. This hot mess is its best, stunning self when it\u2019s just that: just baked, a little warm from the oven and delightfully gooey.A capsule summary accompanying an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the ingredients in the ratatouille pie.

{"Headline": "Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201dTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rita Borsellino, 73, Dies; a Murder Made Her an Anti-Mafia Crusader", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn July 1992, the Sicilian Mafia sent a loud and gruesome message to those who would challenge it when it killed a prosecutor named Paolo Borsellino with a car bomb in Palermo. He was the second prosecutor to meet that fate in two months; in May, another bomb had killed Giovanni Falcone.The assassinations made news around the world, and the second one made the Mafia a new enemy: Rita Borsellino, Paolo\u2019s younger sister. Before her brother\u2019s death she was a pharmacist. After it, she became a leading crusader against the Mafia\u2019s longstanding, often ruthless grip on life in Sicily, where small businesses were routinely extorted for protection money and killings were commonplace.Ms. Borsellino was often frustrated over the years as she waged that fight. In 2006 she ran for governor of Sicily and lost to Salvatore Cuffaro, the incumbent, who had been linked to the Mafia and later went to prison. In 2009 at an anti-Mafia march, she told Agence France-Presse, \u201cI am angry and less optimistic than 17 years ago, when my brother was slain.\u201d Mafia influence remains a vexing problem in Sicily and elsewhere in Italy.Ms. Borsellino was born on June 2, 1945, in Palermo. There had been pharmacists in her family stretching back several generations, and she followed the tradition, earning a pharmaceutical degree in 1967.While she was pursuing her career, her brother was becoming a thorn in the side of the Mafia, so much so that he traveled with bodyguards. Five of them were killed in the bombing that killed him, as he arrived for a visit with his mother.The Borsellino and Falcone murders produced a wave of outrage, as well as swift action by the Italian government, which sent troops to Sicily in an effort to restore order. The troops stayed for six years.During that time Ms. Borsellino emerged as the face of the anti-Mafia movement. After her brother\u2019s death she began speaking in schools, talking to children about ethics and civic responsibility. She also worked with Arci, another group that tries to combat Mafia influence.Geoff Andrews, a senior lecturer in politics at the Open University and the author of \u201cNot a Normal Country: Italy After Berlusconi,\u201d said Ms. Borsellino \u201cwas a symbol of resistance for a new generation of anti-Mafia activists.\u201d\u201cYet,\u201d he added, \u201cshe was more than a historic reference point of the events of 1992. She had the commitment and vision to help build a new dialogue between civil society and politicians with roots in the local associations, including the anti-Mafia network Libera, and not the traditional parties. She had the vision to appeal to younger Sicilians who wanted a new beginning.\u201dMs. Borsellino was not afraid to criticize authority. When the Italian government withdrew the troops from Sicily in 1998, she was skeptical.She even criticized Pope Benedict XVI. In 2010, when he gave a homily in Sicily that anti-Mafia forces hoped would be a ringing denunciation of the Cosa Nostra, she was among those who found his words too timid.\u201cI was disappointed in the lack of force in what he said,\u201d she told Reuters.\u201cThe Mafia is no longer an Italian problem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has definitely become a European issue. I would say even a worldwide or international issue. In the last few years, they have changed their trafficking and their routes, their contacts, their financial and commercial links. To symbolize the extent of the change, we no longer speak of \u2018the Mafia\u2019 today, but of \u2018mafias.\u2019\u201dThe biography on Ms. Borsellino\u2019s Facebook page says she was married and the mother of three children, but complete information on her survivors was not immediately available.In 2010, to mark the 18th anniversary of the 1992 assassinations, statues of Ms. Borsellino\u2019s brother and Mr. Falcone were placed in a public square in Palermo. Within hours they had been vandalized, and Ms. Borsellino had withering words in response to both the vandalism and to the lack of witnesses willing to come forward.\u201cThere are people in Palermo who are frightened even of two statues,\u201d she said, \u201cand, what is more, there are still people in Palermo who don\u2019t have the gift of speech.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are ISIS Fighters Prisoners or Honored Guests of the Afghan Government?", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHEBERGHAN, Afghanistan \u2014 The top commander of the Islamic State in northern Afghanistan stood behind a lectern decorated with the shield of the Afghan government\u2019s powerful intelligence agency.On his left was the police general in charge of the province. Arrayed behind him was an assortment of other dignitaries: police, army, political figures. An attendant put a bottle of mineral water nearby, in case the intense heat made the commander thirsty.This is how the Islamic State commander, Maulavi Habib ul-Rahman, began his \u201cimprisonment\u201d on Thursday. Along with 250 of his fighters, Mr. Rahman had surrendered the day before to the Afghan government in the northern province of Jowzjan, to avoid being captured by the Taliban.He thanked his hosts and, in a scolding tone, warned them to stick to the deal they had just made. \u201cProvide us with personal security as well as stay loyal to the commitments made between us so it prepares the ground for others who fight against the government to join the peace process,\u201d Mr. Rahman demanded from the dais.Other insurgents have joined the government side through a formal peace process open to those not accused of human rights abuses, but that is not a possibility with the Islamic State, officials insisted.\u201cThey surrendered to Afghan forces \u2014 they did not join the peace process. These are two different things,\u201d said Gen. Faqir Mohammad Jawzjani, the provincial police chief, who shared the podium with Mr. Rahman.If they were prisoners, however, it was hard to tell. The government arranged for them to stay in a guesthouse in the provincial capital of Sheberghan. Guards were posted around it not to keep the insurgents in, but to keep their potential enemies out, according to the provincial governor. Although the fighters were disarmed, they were allowed to keep their cellphones and other personal possessions.The police said that about 100 of the prisoners were younger than 18. Many young fighters were stunned to see journalists and officials without beards, and loudly denounced them as \u201cinfidels.\u201dSome of the police officers were angry. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we just let the Taliban kill them, instead of treating them like honored guests?\u201d one officer said.Mr. Nemat bemoaned what he described as a \u201cfake news\u201d climate around their decision to go over to the government side. \u201cWe believe that the U.S. supports the Taliban,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is against us. Every side puts pressure on us: the Afghan government, the Taliban and also the people. The whole world is against us.\u201dMr. Nemat said he joined the Islamic State because he believed in the group\u2019s ideology, which he felt was closer to Afghan values than that of the Taliban or the government. Mr. Nemat, Mr. Rahman and their followers previously fought on the side of the Taliban and the government before joining the Islamic State in 2016.\u201cWe want other people to accept our ideas with their hearts, not by force,\u201d Mr. Nemat said. \u201cThere is no need to force people to accept us.\u201dThe dubious nature of the Islamic State surrender has proved a propaganda bonanza for the Taliban, which began an offensive with thousands of fighters about a month ago to wipe out the Islamic State group in the north. All of their fighters have now surrendered, been captured by the Taliban or been killed, according to Mr. Nemat, as well as government and Taliban spokesmen.Much was made by the Taliban and by the government\u2019s critics here of the mode of the Islamic State prisoners\u2019 arrival in Sheberghan. They were ferried from the battlefield in Afghan Army helicopters, avoiding a potentially dangerous journey on the roads.Mr. Nemat, was nervously defiant, saying: \u201cThe Afghan government promised they wouldn\u2019t punish us. The Afghan government must save my life and provide me with security.\u201d He insisted his commanders and their followers were guilty of nothing other than fighting on the battlefield. \u201cI am ready to go to court if there is any proof against me,\u201d he said.Lines had already started forming outside the provincial police headquarters, with people offering such proof. General Jawzjani said 50 complaints had been received by Thursday: \u201cOn every complaint, the fighters will be questioned and investigated.\u201dThe complainants included Yar Mohammad, 53, a farmer from the Darzab district of Jowzjan Province, where the Islamic State fighters had their stronghold in the north. On July 24, he said, his pregnant niece, Noria, was shot to death by Mr. Rahman and Mr. Nemat\u2019s group of fighters while she was visiting the doctor.

But What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cO.K., I need to stop this craziness,\u201d Mr. Lin recalled thinking.A new cap on the service goes into effect on Wednesday. It will change the number of movies allowed to three per month from one per day, at a flat rate of $9.95 per month. The limit may put a dent in the habits of many pass subscribers \u2014 and, almost certainly, the population of highly devoted users who have structured their social lives around MoviePass.Elaborate social networks have popped up around the pass online (over 70 Facebook groups exist, with membership ranging from two to more than 9,000 members), and many consist of tight-knit meetup groups or family members \u2014 like Cristina Crowley of Alexandria, Va., a teacher who bought her 13-year-old a pass. The two scheduled weekly gatherings and recently saw \u201cEighth Grade\u201d together.Afterward, the group \u2014 a mix of entrepreneurs, bloggers and real estate investors, some new, some regulars \u2014 trickled over to the Bleecker Street Bar, where, speaking loudly over Jay-Z\u2019s music, they answered questions prepared by the founder of Mewvee Club, Kean Gardner, 31, of Brooklyn. Questions included: \u201cWhat would your artist name be?\u201d \u201cWhat is your quick take on the movie?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a fact that intrigued you about the documentary?\u201dThe group has had 25 meetings like this, usually with five to 15 members participating in person, since January.Noemy Jorge, 31, who is dating Mr. Gardner, said they also hold movie screenings on a projector in their apartment, which she said they will probably start doing more now that MoviePass has set limits. \u201cOur entire dating life has revolved around going to the movies,\u201d Ms. Jorge said. \u201cBefore MoviePass, we would go early in the morning to get matinee passes.\u201dOne MoviePass user in California, Cea Marcel Lee, 52, a substitute teacher from Irvine, created a network of 70 people who use the pass to attend movies a few times per month. The largest attendance they had for a gathering was 25, for \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d Ms. Lee said.After the movie, people in that network usually go out together for dessert and a discussion.Jose Roldan, 46, of Zephyrhills, Fla., said he had only seen about one or two movies in a theater per year before MoviePass. Now, Mr. Roldan, a facility-services coordinator, sometimes drives 45 miles round-trip to see films twice a week. He started the largest group on Facebook, MoviePass Chatter, in September 2017, while trying to troubleshoot issues with his pass.Most of his dedication to the service occurs online \u2014 he spends about three hours a day moderating the chatter and trying to \u201cstimulate the conversation.\u201d There, people discuss the service\u2019s problems and post takeaways from new films. If the conversation gets too heated, Mr. Roldan said, he steps in to \u201ckeep it from getting out of hand.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want any politics or religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about MoviePass and your love for movies.\u201dSome MoviePass users say they will stay loyal until the end, while many have started to reconsider their habits, or think about adding or switching subscription services.Even with the new three-movie-per-month rule, Damon Packard, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who used MoviePass every day at one point, said he is keeping it because he thinks the other services \u2014 like AMC Stubs A-List and Sinemia \u2014 are too pricey.\u201cI\u2019ll stick with them because they\u2019re constantly changing things and they\u2019re trying to dig themselves out of this hole that they\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Packard said.He hopes that they will reinstate the one-movie-per-day plan.Mr. Roldan said he wants to stay with MoviePass, too, because the AMC theater is even farther out of his way.Ken Lin, a movie buff, tracked his moviegoing.Mr. Lin, who also has Sinemia, is part of the administrating team of MoviePass Fanatics on Facebook, where users sometimes compare spreadsheets of how many movies they have seen and share service updates. (Mr. Lin, for example, has tracked via spreadsheet the money he would have spent without using MoviePass: $2,012.97.)

Mr. Scranton is the author of \u201cWe\u2019re Doomed. Now What? Essays on War and Climate Change.\u201dYou can walk to the beach from where we are staying. It\u2019s a long peel of dun-colored sand bordered by tidy rainbow summer houses, monotonous black and white condos and monstrous blue McMansions that blister the length of the Delmarva Peninsula. On the other side of the sand lies the heaving, implacable mass of unfathomable gray-green water that covers nearly three-quarters of the globe, once a boundary between the known and unknown, a limit-space of mystery and terror, now tamed, or so we think, to a vacation fun zone. There are lifeguards, though, lean summer kids with lazy tans, and to the north, rising from the low trees, towers built to defend the American coastline from Nazi subs. Ten minutes away, the highway connects you to an outlet mall, a Walmart and a cinema showing the latest superhero movie. We walk back and forth from the beach to the house, brave the cold Atlantic rush and the biting flies, make dinner, put the baby to bed, play a board game and sink at last into our screens, each of us burrowed into a different dark corner of the living room. Tablet light, phone light, laptop light flicker on our slack, rapt gazes.The paucity of historical evidence and the eradication of native peoples\u2019 culture by European colonizers make it difficult to reconstruct precontact indigenous life in all its detail. What evidence there is, combined with anthropological insights into similarly premodern cultures, strongly suggests that despite having to persevere without the miraculous comforts, devices and potions upon which we thoughtlessly depend, they almost certainly lived lives at least as meaningful, complex, rich and joyful as our own. We humans of the Anthropocene Era, inhabitants of a global capitalist civilization built on fossil fuels, slavery and genocide, are used to living with the fruits of that civilization. We are accustomed to walking on concrete in mass produced shoes. When it rains we go inside or open an umbrella made of nylon, a synthetic polymer first designed in 1930. When we have to travel, we take a train, bus, car or plane, journeying hundreds of miles in a few hours, at speeds that would have been unimaginable 250 years ago. When it gets hot, we turn on the air-conditioning or go to the beach.The extended coastal urban areas where about 40 percent of all humans now live, so blessedly near the sea, including this very beach town from which I write, would have been incomprehensibly strange, even grotesque, to the people who used to live here. Yet we are no different from them in any essential way, only accustomed to a different way of life, a different built environment, a different set of narratives and concepts that shape our sense of reality. In the transition from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic eras, around 65 million years ago, when the North American continent began to take shape, much of what we call the Eastern Seaboard was under water. No human beings existed then; it would be millions of years before any hominids evolved. Today, Delmarva\u2019s highest point is barely above sea level, a low hill on the peninsula\u2019s west coast where you can sit and watch Chesapeake Bay slowly rise as Antarctica and Greenland melt, as the planet warms one-tenth degree by one-tenth degree, and the world to which we have adapted changes into something else. The beach will disappear, the McMansions will fill with water, the lifeguards will age and die and even the towers built to watch for Nazis will crumble and fall. In some unknown future, on some strange and novel shore, human beings just like us will adapt to a whole new world. You can see them sitting circled around a fire on the beach, the light flickering on their rapt faces, one telling a story about a mighty civilization doomed by its hubris, an age of wonders long past.Advertisement"}

By the end of my shift, 12 hours later, she had grown confused and her speech was garbled. A CT scan revealed bleeding in her brain. She was sent to intensive care and died the next day. This was years ago, but the case still haunts me. I believe that moving faster on her treatment might have prevented her sharp decline. But the medical team didn\u2019t share my sense of urgency, and no obvious red flags signaled a coming emergency. Without a worrisome clinical value or test result to point to, my concern alone wasn\u2019t persuasive.Every nurse likely knows the feeling. The patient\u2019s vital signs are just a little off, she seems not quite herself, her breathing is slightly more labored. But on paper she looks stable, so it\u2019s hard to get a doctor to listen, much less act. In such situations nurses invoke \u201cgut feelings,\u201d but they actually aren\u2019t feelings at all \u2014 they are agglomerations of observations and experiences that over time have turned into finely tuned clinical judgment. The idea is that working at the bedside has honed nurses\u2019 perceptions to be especially alert to brewing trouble.These reactions and observations typically aren\u2019t given the clinical weight of test results and lab values. Similarly, a large part of every nursing shift is spent on the computer documenting how patients are doing, but the content of these notes is more often than not ignored, particularly by physicians. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way, and it may not be for much longer. The change began in 2003, when an 87-year-old woman named Florence Rothman was hospitalized for a heart-valve replacement. She was in good health and initially did well, but experienced a slow, unnoticed deterioration in the hospital. She eventually received treatment for her symptoms, but no one investigated the cause. However, she improved and was sent home.Four days later Ms. Rothman was seen by a home health nurse during an episode of severe breathlessness. When it happened again the same day, her family called 911, but it was too late: Her heart stopped in the emergency room, crushed by fluid surrounding it. Ms. Rothman\u2019s sons \u2014 Michael, a data scientist, and Steven, an engineer \u2014 wondered if their mother\u2019s death could have been avoided, had there been a better way to track her signs of distress. Doctors later determined that she had developed a condition called cardiac tamponade, and it probably started during that first deterioration in the hospital. If her overall condition had been thoroughly examined at that point, the tamponade likely could have been detected and treated. The goal is to identify those patients who might look stable but are in fact fragile; applied correctly, it allows medical teams to intervene well before a crisis hits. This saves lives, and money. I have seen the Rothman Index in action at the Yale New Haven Health System, where special SWAT team nurses use it to coordinate care for the sickest patients. The Rothman Index empirically validates nurses\u2019 gut feelings by showing that nursing assessments \u2014 what nurses see and document when they \u201clay eyeballs\u201d on patients \u2014 offer crucial information about patient stability. It validates what nurses have known all along: that well-honed clinical instincts matter.Part of why I still feel haunted by my patient who suddenly took a turn for the worse and then died is because of that nagging sense I had, early on, that something was wrong. Her disease put her at risk for spontaneous bleeding, but at the start of her third day in the hospital a treatment plan still wasn\u2019t in place. My gut told me we were moving too slowly, and I was able to push here and there. But there was nothing I could articulate as a sign of impending calamity.I don\u2019t have access to that patient\u2019s records, so I can\u2019t go back and chart her Rothman Index. But I can promise myself that in the future, I will take any sense of urgency very seriously, document my concern and speak up. There\u2019s now solid evidence that when a nurse says she\u2019s got a bad feeling about a patient, the entire care team needs to listen.Theresa Brown, a hospice nurse, is the author of \u201cThe Shift: One Nurse, Twelve Hours, Four Patients\u2019 Lives.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the careers of Michael and Steven Rothman.

{"Headline": "Reality Winner, Former N.S.A. Translator, Gets More Than 5 Years in Leak of Russian Hacking Report", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReality Winner, the former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who pleaded guilty in June to leaking a top-secret government report on Russian hacking, was sentenced on Thursday to five years and three months in federal prison.Ms. Winner, 26, is the first person to be sentenced under the Espionage Act since President Trump took office. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media.Prosecutors said on Thursday that Ms. Winner\u2019s actions merited a stiff sentence.\u201cWinner\u2019s purposeful violation put our nation\u2019s security at risk,\u201d United States Attorney Bobby L. Christine told reporters after the sentencing in federal court in Augusta, Ga. He said the report she leaked revealed sources and methods of intelligence gathering, and its disclosure \u201ccaused exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security.\u201dHe added that she \u201cknowingly and intentionally betrayed the trust of her colleagues and her country,\u201d and was \u201cthe quintessential example of an insider threat.\u201dMs. Winner was fresh out of the Air Force and a few months into a job as a translator for the National Security Agency in May 2017 when prosecutors say she printed a report from her work computer that detailed hacking attacks by a Russian intelligence service against local election officials and voter registration databases. She later told investigators that she smuggled the report out of the Augusta, Ga., offices of the contractor, Pluribus International, in her pantyhose, and then mailed it to the online news outlet The Intercept.Addressing Chief Judge J. Randall Hall in court on Thursday, Ms. Winner said she took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the \u201cundeniable mistake I made.\u201d She said she \u201cwould like to apologize profusely\u201d for her actions.Ms. Winner\u2019s lawyers asked the judge to take into account in sentencing that she had served honorably in the Air Force, had been a top student and had no prior criminal record. \u201cShe is someone who has done something she should not have done \u2014 and knows she should not have done,\u201d John Bell, one of Ms. Winner\u2019s lawyers, told Judge Hall. \u201cBut she\u2019s not an evil person.\u201dJoe Whitley, a former federal prosecutor who was another of Ms. Winner\u2019s lawyers, highlighted her military service, including assisting with more than 800 intelligence missions that he said had \u201cremoved\u201d 100 enemies.Federal guidelines allowed for a sentence of up to 10 years, but prosecutors agreed in June to a sentence of 63 months, to avoid a trial that would require discussing classified reports and intelligence gathering techniques in open court. Prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum filed this week that such a trial \u201cwould compound the exceptionally grave harm to national security already caused by the defendant,\u201d and that the plea agreement \u201creflects a fair resolution of the defendant\u2019s criminal culpability. \u201dThe judge imposed the sentence that prosecutors recommended.In federal leak cases, the sentences are generally aligned with the scale of damage done to national security, according to Robert Cattanach, a former lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s civil division who represented security agencies. He said Ms. Winner\u2019s sentence seemed to be an outlier.\u201cNo one was endangered, no one\u2019s identity was revealed, the Russians just learned that when they penetrate our systems, we can track them, which they already knew,\u201d Mr. Cattanach said. \u201cI think this kind of sentence, if anything, is designed to have a chilling effect.\u201dThe Justice Department prosecuted Ms. Winner under the Espionage Act, a World War I-era law that made it a crime to disclose secrets that could be used to harm the United States or aid a foreign adversary.Perhaps the best-known leaker, Chelsea Manning, was tried and convicted in a military court-martial, not a civilian court, for sending a vast archive of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. She was sentenced to 35 years, but served only about seven years; President Obama commuted the remainder of her sentence.Ms. Winner, who grew up in Texas, seemed in some ways not to fit the popular image of someone who might try to circumvent the rules. A part-time yoga instructor who was fond of kale, owned rescued pets and drove a Nissan Cube with a bumper sticker saying \u201cBe truthful, gentle and fearless,\u201d she had passed several security screenings and had no history of disciplinary problems in the military.But prosecutors said in court filings that she was a savvy and well-trained analyst whose political beliefs drove her to violate security restrictions. They said that in the months before she leaked the report, Ms. Winner had downloaded software that helped her hide her web searches and communications; had expressed support for Edward J.

{"Headline": "Briton From Sudan Is Named as Suspect in London Crash", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The police in London on Wednesday identified a Sudanese-born Briton from Birmingham as the driver who had plowed a car into three people and crashed outside Parliament, leaving the authorities trying to pry a motive from a suspect they said was uncooperative.The authorities said they were treating the events on Tuesday as an act of terrorism, \u201cgiven that this appears to be a deliberate act,\u201d because of the location \u2014 the center of British politics \u2014 and the method used. The Houses of Parliament have been the target of terrorist attacks before, and past episodes have involved drivers deliberately steering vehicles into pedestrians.The driver in this episode, who was swarmed by armed officers on Tuesday after the silver Ford Fiesta crashed into cyclists, pedestrians and a concrete barrier outside Parliament, was not cooperating, the authorities said.\u201cThe priority of the investigation team continues to be to understand the motivation behind this incident,\u201d the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.As detectives searched three addresses in the Midlands region of England \u2014 two in Birmingham, Britain\u2019s second-largest city, and one in Nottingham \u2014 as part of the investigation, a portrait of the suspect and his movements has begun to emerge.According to the police, the driver arrived in London from Birmingham early Tuesday, and drove around Tottenham Court Road and then to the Houses of Parliament. At 7:37 a.m., his car hit and injured three people and stopped at the security barrier.Security camera footage broadcast by the BBC showed the car making a sharp turn to travel the wrong way down one-way traffic lanes, then driving over an island in the middle of the street before entering a side lane, where it hit the barrier.A man and a woman were taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, while one man was treated at the scene, officials said.The BBC quoted a man who said he was Mr. Khater\u2019s brother and described his family as being in \u201ca state of shock\u201d over the arrest.Nassar Mahmood, the trustee of the Birmingham Central Mosque, said after talking to people in the Sudanese community who knew Mr. Khater that he \u201chad been trying to get a visa from the Sudanese Embassy to go back to Sudan.\u201dHe added that Mr. Khater was not known to the Birmingham Central Mosque.Shortly before it was shut down on Wednesday, Mr. Khater\u2019s Facebook page said he was born in Wad Madani, a city on the banks of the Blue Nile, and that he had studied engineering in Sudan. British news outlets reported that he later studied accounting at Coventry University. University officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.It appeared he had most recently worked as a shop manager in Birmingham. Mr. Khater\u2019s Facebook page included posts about listening to sentimental songs like Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cBecause You Loved Me,\u201d and Eminem\u2019s \u201cLove The Way You Lie.\u201d He was also a fan of Al-Merrikh SC, a Sudanese soccer club. Mr. Khater was not known to the authorities in Britain, officials said.The Parliament building, also called the Palace of Westminster, is surrounded by some of London\u2019s busiest streets, with traffic passing much closer than it does to the White House or to the United States Capitol, making security a challenge.Mayor Sadiq Khan has suggested that Parliament Square could be turned into a pedestrian-only site to thwart future vehicle attacks.Parliament is already ringed by crash bollards, balustrades and steel barricades, put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States and the London bombings on July 7, 2005. Terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 led to even tighter security.\u201cI have been an advocate for some time now of part-pedestrianizing Parliament Square,\u201d Mr. Khan told the BBC program \u201cToday.\u201d Still, he said, he had to make sure \u201cwe don\u2019t lose the wonderful thing about our democracy, which is people having access to parliamentarians, people being able to lobby Parliament and visitors being able to visit Parliament.\u201dMark Rowley, the former counterterrorism chief for the Metropolitan Police, said on \u201cToday\u201d that security arrangements in the area had helped reduce the effects of the crash.\u201cThis person was driving around for some time,\u201d Mr. Rowley said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t find a weak spot and ends up doing a fairly chaotic attack, which fortunately only resulted in injuries, not in death.\u201d\u201cThe physical protection around Parliament worked very well, and the police response was brilliant, quick and massively careful, given the risk that they were rushing into,\u201d he added.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misquoted a mosque trustee\u2019s comments about Salih Khater\u2019s affiliation with the Birmingham Central Mosque. The trustee, Nassar Mahmood, said Mr. Khater was not known to the mosque, not that he was a member.Advertisement"}

He didn\u2019t believe me at first \u2014 unlike the current occupant of the Oval Office, he rarely watched cable news. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all over Fox.\u201d Obama shook his head: \u201cThat\u2019s some real tin-hat stuff.\u201d Mr. Obama may have gotten the best of that exchange. But having failed in 2012, the Republicans kept breathing oxygen into a meandering series of Benghazi conspiracy theories for four years \u2014 a trail that led all the way to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and, in some warped way, helped propel Donald Trump into the White House. What\u2019s clear in reading the document, though, is that whoever wrote this conspiracy theory either believes it, or has chosen to believe it. Why does this conspiracy theory mind-set matter? And what does it tell us about the state of our politics today? First, the memo is a glimpse into a world in which dissent is viewed as dangerous. A group of aides to a president from a different party must be part of some cabal, manipulating the media and working against America\u2019s interests. This goes hand-in-glove with the \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy, which has led President Trump to disparage the intelligence and law enforcement community, purge the State Department of expertise, urge investigations into political enemies and strip security clearances from former officials. By creating conspiracy theories about the Russia investigation and equating them with the actual crime of conspiring with Russia to undermine American democracy, Mr. Trump and his lieutenants want to stir up enough phony equivalence among their supporters to evade accountability. Third, a democracy cannot function in a politics fueled by conspiracy theories. If the United States government itself is cast as a deep state adversary of the president\u2019s, how can he effectively lead it? If the media or people who hold different opinions are \u201cenemies of the state,\u201d then the compromise upon which democracy depends becomes impossible. As we career toward the conclusion of the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, we can sense the coming clash of competing realities: between the facts laid out in carefully prepared legal proceedings, and the countercharges peddled by a president and his supporters who will never accept Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings as anything other than a conspiracy to bring him down. The irony is that so many of the charges leveled against Mr. Trump\u2019s critics are rooted in projection: We are accused of creating a vast information ecosystem to perpetuate false narratives. The reality is that Trump and his supporters have succeeded in doing just that. Whether Mr. Trump and his allies actually believe these theories, or merely choose to believe them out of political expediency, they rode the back of a tiger \u2014 and now we have all ended up inside.Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to President Obama, is the author of \u201cThe World As It Is: A Memoir of the Obama White House.\u201dAdvertisement"}

President Trump spent considerable time in the last week denouncing the \u201cfake news\u201d media at two rallies. But in this hyperpartisan time, even local news is falling under a microscope.And in smaller, rural communities, the decimation of the newspaper industry is being keenly felt. Since 2004, more than 1,800 newspapers have died or merged with other companies, according to research by the University of North Carolina\u2019s Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media.This has left roughly 200 \u201cnews deserts\u201d without any local newspaper coverage, and even more areas where a single source dominates, said the study\u2019s leader, Penelope Muse Abernathy, the university\u2019s Knight professor of journalism and digital media economics.Those numbers are growing. \u201cThere are more counties than you can count that are right on the line right now,\u201d Ms. Abernathy said.As a result, a lot of people are on edge about the state of local media outlets, which, in addition to printing high school sports scores and obituaries, are often doing the only meaningful watchdog reporting at a community level.\u201cPeople are caring that something has changed very dramatically in the last decade, and it\u2019s threatening democracy at our grass roots,\u201d Ms. Abernathy said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s threatened at the grass-roots level, that means it\u2019s threatened at the national level.\u201dMs. Budman, 61, is listed as the vice president of operations at The Signal.\u201cIf somebody buys into those narratives that were fundamentally debunked, you have to question, what is their judgment?\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd how are they going to accurately judge what\u2019s factual if this is what they buy into?\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Budman, despite his earlier comments to the business journal, denied that the paper was being influenced by his views, which he described as centrist on several issues. He said that the newspaper would continue to publish columns by people supporting Democrats and that he had yet to turn away anyone seeking to write an opinion piece. While he will have final say over editorial opinions \u2014 and his wife will not \u2014 news stories will cover the community fairly, he said.\u201cThis is all a bunch of hooey over nothing,\u201d Mr. Budman, 62, said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the newspaper business for 35 years. My views haven\u2019t changed. Nothing has changed.\u201dAs to Ms. Budman\u2019s tweets, Mr. Budman said, \u201cJust because someone may retweet something does not mean they believe or support it any more than I believe or support all the opinions in the opinion columns I print.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for P.R.,\u201d said Sue Sylwester-Rice, 49, a resident who canceled her subscription after reading about Ms. Budman\u2019s tweets.Beyond their general unease over the political bent of the new owners, many of those criticizing the Budmans can point to few specific changes in the paper\u2019s coverage. Tim Whyte, The Signal\u2019s editor in chief since June after a stint from 1994 to 2004, said he had evaluated the feedback but did not think the outcry was warranted.He said he believed that the community angst reflected many people\u2019s distrust of the media today.\u201cThis is sort of where it\u2019s landed,\u201d Mr. Whyte said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just CNN and The New York Times that are targets anymore. It\u2019s right down to your local community newspaper.\u201dMr. Daniels and others did note that a demonstration on June 30, a Saturday when hundreds of people marched on City Hall to protest immigration detention centers, was not covered in The Signal\u2019s next print edition on Tuesday.\u201cThis is the main news source for the third-largest city in L.A. County,\u201d said Philip Germain, chairman of a local progressive political action group. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve seen since the new ownership has taken place is a noticeable shift to the right. What also concerns me is the lack of coverage.\u201dMr. Budman said he could understand why readers were bothered by the lack of coverage of the rally. \u201cIt should have been in Tuesday\u2019s paper,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my decision.

It should have run on Tuesday, and it didn\u2019t. It was simple as that.\u201dAs for those who worry that their community may soon become another news desert, Mr. Budman said he had other plans.

{"Headline": "Before You Flush Your Contact Lenses, You Might Want to Know This", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesFlushing disposable contacts down the toilet or washing them down the drain may contribute to the problem of microplastic pollution, researchers said.If you throw out your contact lenses every day or so, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 more than 45 million people in the United States wear contacts, and many of them use disposable versions of the little plastic hemispheres. But if they are not tossed out correctly, contact lenses may have a dark side. Filters keep some nonbiological waste out of wastewater treatment plants, said Rolf Halden, the director of the Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University, and Charles Rolsky, a graduate student and the study\u2019s lead author. (Dr. Halden uses contact lenses; Mr. Rolsky wears glasses.) But contacts are so flexible that they can fold up and make their way through. The researchers interviewed workers at such facilities, who confirmed that they had spotted lenses in the waste.Next, the team submerged contacts in chambers where bacteria are used to break down biological waste at a treatment plant. They found that even after seven days of exposure, the lenses appeared intact, though lab analysis detected small changes in the material. \u201cThese are medical devices \u2014 you would not expect them to be super-biodegradable,\u201d Dr. Halden said. \u201cGood for the contact lens wearer during use, not so good when the things get out into the environment.\u201dThen, going through about nine pounds of treated waste, Mr. Rolsky and a colleague found two fragments of contact lens, implying that while microorganisms might not make much of a mark, physical processing might break them into pieces. Tiny bits of plastic from many sources have been spotted in the oceans and other bodies of water, where they may be ingested by fish, corals and other animals. The fragments can carry high loads of pollutants absorbed from their surroundings, so the organisms get a dose of these substances as well. After processing, treated waste is often spread on fields. If fragments of contacts are in the mixture, they or the substances they\u2019ve picked up may be washed by rain into surface water, the researchers conjecture. They estimate that billions of contact lenses \u2014 weighing at least 22 metric tons \u2014 may be flushed in the United States every year. Contact lens packages don\u2019t currently tell users how to dispose of them, said Dr. Halden, who suggested that companies should add labels recommending that contacts be put in the garbage rather than washed down the drain. He pointed out that some manufacturers have already begun recycling programs to reclaim the plastic from lenses. While contact lenses are far from the largest source of microplastic pollution in water, they appear to be a readily avoidable one.Mr. Rolsky said the findings had given him an additional incentive to stick with his preference for wearing glasses. \u201cThis just gives me a reason,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cto solidify that for the rest of time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Metamorphosis of the Western Soul", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE Big ideasHumans want to get along and get ahead. And they will become whoever they need to be in order to do so.Mr. Storr is a journalist and novelist. Between 1965 and 1985, the Western self was transformed. We turned from anti-materialistic, stick-it-to-the-Man hippies into greed-is-good yuppies. We would be surprised if an individual went through such an extreme metamorphosis. But an entire culture did. What could have caused such a dramatic shift? While the origins of such changes cannot be reduced to a single source, I believe we can point to a dominant one: the economy. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rewrote the rules by which we had once lived. And that, with stunning rapidity, changed who we were. Psychologists attest to the enormous power of environment over culture. Many focus on differences between the individualistic West and the collectivist East. The story goes something like this: The Western self was born in Greece, a pointillist realm of around 1,000 city-states, where the land was poor for farming. Getting by meant hustling \u2014 tanning hides, making olive oil, fishing. This individualistic economy created an individualist ideal of self. The Greeks sought singular fame and glory. They gave birth to the Olympics, that celebration of individual competition, and an astonishing era of democracy. Compare that with ancient China, an undulating landscape in which getting by meant being part of a large farming community. Survival depended on the group rather than the individual. For Confucius the \u201csuperior\u201d person \u201cdoes not boast,\u201d preferring instead \u201cthe concealment of his virtue\u201d \u2014 nothing like the glory-seeking Greek. A different landscape made a different kind of human with different values. One prioritized the individual, the other the group. One saw reality comprising individual objects, the other a web of forces.Cultural differences such as these run deep.Humans are born incomplete. The brain absorbs huge amounts of essential information throughout childhood and adolescence, which it uses to carry on building who we are. It\u2019s as if the brain asks a single, vital question: Who do I have to be, in this place, to thrive? If it was a boastful hustler in ancient Greece and a humble team-player in ancient China, then who is it in the West today? The answer is a neoliberal. After the economic chaos of the 1970s, it was decided that the United States and Britain had become too collective. Previous decades had seen the introduction of the New Deal, which included the Social Security Act, strict regulations on banking and business, and the rising power of the unions. This collectively tilted economy sired a collectively tilted people: monkey-suited Corporation Man and his children, the hippies. For Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, saving ourselves meant rediscovering our individualist roots. They cut taxes and regulations; they battled unions; they shrunk the welfare state; they privatized assets and weakened the state\u2019s safety nets. They pursued the neoliberal dream of globalization \u2014 one free market that covered the earth. As much of human life as possible was to become a competition of self versus self.In 1981, Margaret Thatcher said, \u201cWhat\u2019s irritated me about the whole direction of politics in the last 30 years is that it\u2019s always been toward the collectivist society.\u201d She then made a comment that bordered on the sinister. \u201cEconomics are the method: The object is to change the soul.\u201d And that\u2019s precisely what happened.The global financial crisis in 2008 did not help. Interestingly, narcissism, which was increasing during the 1990s and 2000s, has reportedly started to fall. Although the reasons are murky, I wonder about the psychological aftermath of this economic shock. Before 2008, it felt as if neoliberalism was basically working for most people. But since the crash, millions have come to see the system as broken. First there came the Occupy movement and then the identity politics of alt-left and alt-right. The feeling is, variously, that the system has been stitched-up by bankers and corporations or is hostile to women, people of color or the white working class. We also have seen the neoliberal Hillary Clinton falter and the antiglobalist Donald Trump triumph. Britain\u2019s Brexit was secured by antiglobalist arguments, while support for the anti-neoliberal left-winger Jeremy Corbyn surged. The perception of a broken, rigged economy has left us angry and increasingly tribal, which might explain this recent trend toward \u201cus\u201d over the narcissistic \u201cme.\u201d It might even help explain recent rises in the grim ramifications of perfectionism.

{"Headline": "With Lawsuits, New Jersey Signals Tougher Stance on the Environment", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 New Jersey officials announced on Wednesday that they were pursuing several lawsuits targeting former industrial sites around the state where communities are still grappling with the persisting effects of pollution that has seeped into soil, groundwater and nearby waterways.\u201cThey show that today is a new day for environmental enforcement in New Jersey,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, the state\u2019s attorney general, said of the lawsuits at a news conference at one of the sites, which had housed a cigarette lighter factory that had closed more than 30 years ago in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark.\u201cThey involve different polluters, and they involve different pollutants,\u201d Mr. Grewal added, referring to the various allegations raised in the lawsuits. \u201cThey involve damage to different natural resources. But what they all have in common is that environmental pollution affects all of New Jersey, North and South, rural and urban, rich and poor.\u201dEnvironmental advocates said that New Jersey, long known for its industrial history, has adopted some of the strongest laws to combat pollution, but they said they welcomed the lawsuits on Wednesday because they signaled a changing tide after years of the state, in their view, growing too lax in enforcing those laws.\u201cRegulations matter, and so do the enforcement of those laws,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \u201cI think the biggest thing is that polluters out there can violate the law because you\u2019ll either not get caught, or if you do get caught, you\u2019ll get off the hook.\u201dSome of the lawsuits seek financial damages for the toll wrought by pollution on the state\u2019s natural resources, including surface and groundwater, sediments and wetlands. Officials said they were the first such lawsuits the state had pursued in a decade. The other suits were filed in an attempt to recover money that the state had already spent on environmental cleanups.The lawsuits are targeting a Superfund site in Warren County, in the northwest part of the state, where a stretch of groundwater nearly nine miles long was polluted; a manufacturing facility in Newark where a school was recently built after a costly cleanup; a former petroleum refinery and an old gas station in Woodbridge, on the central coast; and a former manufactured gas plant in Atlantic City. In Newark, at the cigarette lighter factory, homes had been built on ground that had been seriously contaminated.\u201cWe need to clean up the contamination to protect the health of our people and to restore the land to productive use,\u201d Catherine R. McCabe, the state commissioner for the Department of Environmental Protection, said at the news conference.Some members of New Jersey\u2019s business and industrial community said they understood the need for enforcement, but urged officials to consider a tempered approach.\u201cOverzealous enforcement or looking for \u2018gotchas\u2019 in a morass of sometimes complex regulations can cause unnecessary burdens on well-intended companies that are already challenged to keep up with the high cost of doing business in the state,\u201d Michele Siekerka, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201cIn those cases, it\u2019s important that environmental regulators provide the option of compliance assistance to help allow for practical and timely resolutions to issues, rather than inhibiting the growth of New Jersey\u2019s job creators.\u201dEfforts on Wednesday to reach representatives of the property owners or companies that were once on those sites were largely unsuccessful. But John Deull, the owner of Deull Fuel Company in Atlantic City, said he was surprised to be named in the Atlantic City lawsuit. In a Facebook post, he added that he and his wife had spent nearly $2 million over 27 years on lawyers, environmental consultants, testing and other remediation efforts.\u201cThere is nothing left to extract from me,\u201d Mr. Deull wrote, \u201cexcept my property on the site and the life from my body.\u201dNew Jersey\u2019s reputation has been molded by industry, with a horizon that has long been dotted with factories and smokestacks. The state was once derided for its vast acreage of garbage dumps and for the fires that would ignite on a heavily polluted stretch of the Passaic River.Now, long after much of that industry has faded and extensive work to recover from the pollution has been done, the state continues to contend with the scars left behind. On the Passaic River in Newark, for instance, it has required a massive undertaking to remove a century\u2019s worth of pollution, costing over $1 billion to dredge sediment laden with chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.Environmental advocates said that progress had slowed during the administration of Chris Christie, a Republican, which had been far less aggressive. Critics were especially incensed by the state settling a lengthy legal battle with Exxon Mobil Corporation over the contamination and the loss of use of more than 1,500 acres that included wetlands, marshes and meadows. The state, which had sought $8.9 billion in damages, settled for around $225 million, which is still the biggest settlement for the state in an environmental case.Mr. Tittel said he saw the lawsuits as a sign that New Jersey was poised to become more aggressive in enforcement.\u201cThis is a good first step,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot more to be done.\u201dMariana Alfaro reported from Newark, and Rick Rojas from New York.Advertisement"}

The internet was free for the duration of the test, but Etecsa plans to sell mobile phone plans that include internet service.For a short period, Cubans could use the internet from their bedrooms, kitchens, porches or wherever they wished.The test started at 11 a.m. and concluded at 8 p.m., according to Ms. S\u00e1nchez.\u201cThe connection was very slow, with a lot of problems for stretches of time,\u201d she said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cAt one point the connection was dropped, but even so, it felt like a tiny window had been opened.\u201dCubans could use only chat services, and it was very difficult to connect to Facebook, she said.Her site reported that privileged users, including official journalists, businessmen and diplomats, have been enjoying free internet navigation from their cellphones for the last couple of weeks.For now, Ms. S\u00e1nchez said, normal people \u201cstand around in the sun, in blazing heat, at risk of getting their phones stolen.\u201d\u201cThey cannot work from home,\u201d she added. \u201cThe government has delayed this for us as long as possible.\u201dIn July, President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel told Parliament that \u201cwe need to be able to put the content of the revolution online\u201d and added that Cubans could \u201ccounter the avalanche of pseudo-cultural, banal and vulgar content\u201d on the internet, suggesting that the government would manage the content.It would not be unexpected for Cuba to do so, as the state already has a monopoly on the news media.Cuba has some of the poorest internet service in the Caribbean, but that doesn\u2019t stop its more than 11 million citizens from posting on Facebook and using WhatsApp to communicate with family members outside the country.Cuban dissidents also use social media to amplify their voices. Many post on Twitter using text messaging, but more are on Facebook.Etecsa currently has 630 public internet hot spots around the country, but it doesn\u2019t beat going online from the comfort of home, a reality that could be close for Cubans.Tania Vel\u00e1zquez Rodr\u00edguez, an executive at Etecsa, asked customers last month to prepare for a technological leap.\u201cEverything is designed so that people can self-manage the configuration of the service,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are nearly ready.\u201dMs. S\u00e1nchez said: \u201cYesterday was the first time Cubans had internet access in their pockets. Even though it was pretty frustrating because the connection wasn\u2019t great, it was a very hopeful moment for us Cubans.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companions for City Trees", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ&AIf you\u2019re going to add plants around a street tree, make sure they\u2019re not too thirsty and have shallow roots. In the best circumstances, attractive plants can keep people and dogs from walking on and compacting dirt around the tree trunk. When the plants wilt, it can serve as a reminder to water them and the tree. Avoid ivy, which drinks a lot of water, climbs and strangles the tree, and shelters rodents. The top inch of soil around the smaller plants should be gently loosened, but deep cultivation should be avoided, so that the tree roots are not harmed. Most important, the soil level should not be raised to pamper the undergrowth. When too much soil is piled up, the air and oxygen are pressed out, starving the tree roots. Moist soil can also make the bark rot, leaving it vulnerable to diseases and pests.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chocolate-Making Is Secretive. This Chocolatier Isn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a Las Vegas strip mall, Melissa Coppel is teaching cooks from all over the world how to create the perfect bonbon.They noted the way she stirred and warmed the butter so it ran fluid from the gun. They watched how she adjusted her stance and pressure on the trigger, according to the fluctuating temperature, and the way she angled the trays so the flawless, glossy tops of each chocolate would be marked with a black-and-gold waxing moon.\u201cI always say, you have to develop a romantic relationship with your gun,\u201d Ms. Coppel said over the clamor of the machine. Her students laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not even joking,\u201d she added.Ms. Coppel, who is 37, runs Atelier Melissa Coppel, a small chocolate school in an unglamorous strip mall in western Las Vegas, that shares the parking lot with an orthodontics office and a law firm. But with her meticulous, colorful style of making chocolates and more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, she draws pastry chefs from all over the world who want to learn by her side. Ms. Coppel works with international students at various levels of proficiency, and estimates that about 90 percent of her students are women. She teaches about 20 classes a year, each one usually spanning several days. Though the techniques she demonstrates are hard to master \u2014 from sealing chocolates neatly to balancing the water and sugar contents of ganaches \u2014 cooks can reproduce them at home, with some practice. (Ms. Coppel uses molds to produce her chocolates. Enrobed chocolates, usually cut from a slab and covered in melted chocolate, can require a bigger investment in equipment.)\u201cThere are a lot of chocolatiers teaching chocolate, but what I do is very specific,\u201d Ms. Coppel said. \u201cI\u2019m like one of those surgeons who only operates on one particular bone behind the ear.\u201dHer specialty: the molded bonbon. Ms. Coppel\u2019s molded bonbons, or chocolate shells filled with ganaches, caramels and crunches, are handmade and hand-decorated in acrylic trays, using a variety of intricate spray techniques and painted designs.\u201cShe goes to the farthest difficulty that you can with bonbons,\u201d said Mr. Muncy, describing how each little bite often holds three or four different components, precisely layered. \u201cIt\u2019s just awesome that there\u2019s so much attention to detail, even inside a chocolate, which most people won\u2019t even see because they\u2019re just popping it into their mouth.\u201d\"Whatever the flavor, you can always taste it,\u201d Mr. Muncy said.\u201cIt\u2019s when I realized that I loved to teach,\u201d Ms. Coppel said.Chocolate was not, at least to begin with, a passion for her. In fact, Ms. Coppel was beginning to notice that the grand kitchens of Las Vegas were shrinking in size and range: Restaurants that had once employed entire teams to work on laminated doughs, cakes and chocolate were now outsourcing that work.As Mr. Muncy explained it, there has long been a shortage of highly trained pastry cooks in American restaurants. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s more so now, since pastry chefs are leaving to do their own thing,\u201d he said.Like many pastry chefs who value their craft, Ms. Coppel worried about these disappearing roles. She also saw a business opportunity. In 2012, she started a wholesale chocolate company, providing chocolates to various clients in Las Vegas, including hotels that no longer made their own.She found a devoted audience for that work \u2014 the elaborate chocolates and dessert bars that she made on the weekends \u2014 by hiring a photographer to shoot them, building her own website and sharing the images on social media. In 2016, Ms. Coppel started her school, and in October she will open an online shop selling her chocolates.While they chatted, the students removed their chocolate-smudged aprons to eat vegetarian risotto in the conference room. Ms. Solan hoped she could coordinate some bonbons to match her favorite bands\u2019 costumes at Carnival next March in Trinidad. And Ms. Espinoza wondered how the ganache recipes would need to be adjusted, and rebalanced, for cannabis oil.Back in the kitchen, students banged their bonbon trays upside down onto parchment paper to unmold the chocolates and packed them up. Using the sharp end of a paintbrush, they had swirled some pieces with turquoise cocoa butter; others were speckled in bronze and toffee-browns, or striped in gold.None of the bonbons were as immaculate as Ms. Coppel\u2019s, with their even, delicate shells and pristine shiny tops, but they were beautiful.Just before everyone went home, Ms. Coppel applauded her students and opened a bottle of Champagne to make a toast. She demanded that they share everything they had learned in the class with other curious cooks.\u201cOne more thing! How many of you found me through Instagram?\u201dA quick poll revealed that it was almost everyone. Ms. Coppel sighed deeply. \u201cO.K. then, that answers that,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t close my Instagram account.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Fear of Strangers Is Fatal", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStoking parental fear about predators inspires vengeance.This is what it happens when stranger-danger runs rampant. It turns out that fear of strangers is far more dangerous than strangers themselves.But that wasn\u2019t what millions of Indians saw on WhatsApp. In the doctored Indian version, that ending was cut off, so the child never reappears.So why not remind parents of this menace and their responsibility to protect their young?When rumors of predators mix with new technology the results tend to be combustible. We can see that as early as 1475. That\u2019s the year that Simon, a boy in Trent, Italy, was found dead. Rumor rapidly spread that the local Jews had killed him to use his blood to make matzo for Passover. The Jews of Trent \u2014 and they were very much The Other at the time \u2014 were tortured into confessing this blood libel. Eight were executed.The story was so sickening and shocking that it stuck. The blood libel persists to this day.But it had help from the start. Simon of Trent went viral thanks to a boost from the brand new social media of his day: the printing press. \u201cThere were poems, posters, pictures,\u201d says historian Emily Rose, the author of \u201cThe Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe.\u201d \u201cThere were treatises printed in multiple languages.\u201dThis is utter nonsense.

Per year.But when scary rumors are repeated over and over \u2014 or watched again and again \u2014 they change the way we see the world. So now it\u2019s the rare day on Facebook when I don\u2019t come across a post like this: \u201cMy name is Amanda and I\u2019m a Longview, Texas resident. I\u2019m convinced that our two-year-old daughter was the victim of a potential sex-trafficking scam yesterday. I got in the checkout line at a local store early afternoon. I took my daughter out of the cart and the couple ahead struck up the typical conversation about how \u2018cute your daughter is.\u2019\u201dStrangers \u2014 East Indians, she says \u2014 admiring her child. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all it took for this mother to believe they were child-snatchers.In all these social media stories, including Amanda\u2019s, no child is actually kidnapped. None of the strangers do anything more than glance or chat. Panic does the rest. Fear is a virus. Once infected, we hallucinate, seeing threats everywhere. And it\u2019s very hard to stop the spread.The girl later drowned in a pond.Stop spreading stranger-danger rumors and start giving people the benefit of the doubt.

{"Headline": "The Last Company You Would Expect Is Reinventing Health Benefits", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrustrated with insurers, some large companies \u2014\u00a0including a certain cable behemoth \u2014\u00a0are shedding long-held practices and adopting a do-it-yourself approach.It\u2019s hard to think of a company that seems less likely to transform health care.\u201cThey\u2019re the most interesting and creative employer when it comes to health care benefits,\u201d said Dr. Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm whose portfolio companies have done business with Comcast. (The cable company declined over several months to provide executives for an interview on this topic.)Comcast, which spends roughly $1.3 billion a year on health care for its 225,000 employees and families, has steered away from some of the traditional methods other companies impose to contain medical expenses. It rejected the popular corporate tack of getting employees to shoulder more of the rising costs \u2014 high-deductible plans, a mechanism that is notorious for discouraging people from seeking medical help. \u201cWe see the start-up community as where the real disruption is taking place,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. \u201cWe weren\u2019t seeing enough innovation.\u201d The group now vets some of these companies for employers, including Comcast.Comcast \u201cis the tip of the spear,\u201d Mr. Marcotte said. Other employers are focusing more attention on unsatisfying hospitals and doctors. Walmart has been at the forefront of efforts to direct employees to specific providers to get medical care, even if it means paying their travel to places like the Mayo Clinic. The majority of working-age Americans \u2014 some 155 million \u2014 get their health insurance through an employer, and most companies cover their own medical costs. The companies rely on insurers to handle the paperwork and to contract with hospitals and doctors. Insurers may also suggest programs like disease management or wellness to help companies control costs. But employers, including that Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan alliance, are increasingly unhappy with the nation\u2019s health care systems. Companies are paying more than they ever have. And their employees, saddled with escalating out-of-pocket costs and a confusing maze, aren\u2019t well served, either. \u201cThe results haven\u2019t been there,\u201d said Jim Winkler, a senior executive at Aon, a benefits consultant. \u201cThere\u2019s frustration.\u201d And, like many other workers, many employees are being pinched by the rising cost of premiums, Mr. Speer said. Geoff Girardin, 27, used Accolade when he worked at Comcast a few years ago and he and his wife were expecting. \u201cOur introduction to Accolade was our introduction to our first kid,\u201d Mr. Girardin said. He credits Accolade for telling him his wife was eligible for a free breast pump and helping find a pediatrician when the family moved. \u201cIt was a huge, huge help to have somebody who knew the ins and outs\u201d of the system, he said.For employees like Jerry Kosturko, 63, who survived colon cancer, Accolade was helpful in steering him through complicated medical decisions. When he needed an M.R.I., his navigator recommended a free-standing imaging center to save money. \u201cThey will tell me what things will cost ahead of time,\u201d Mr. Kosturko said.A nurse at Accolade helped him manage symptoms after he had surgery for bladder cancer in 2014. He developed terrible spasms because, he said, he wasn\u2019t warned to avoid caffeine. The Accolade nurse thought to ask him and quickly urged him to call his doctor for medicine to ease his symptoms. Mr. Kosturko also turned to Grand Rounds when his doctor thought he might need to stay overnight in the hospital to be tested for sleep apnea. The second opinion convinced him he did not. \u201cThis is my life at stake,\u201d she recalled in an interview. \u201cI need to know what I\u2019m doing is the best plan.\u201d Grand Rounds asked a specialist at Duke University School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Berchuck, to review her case. Insurers are usually none too pleased with the employers\u2019 use of alternatives: They\u2019re reluctant to share information with an outside company and poised to undercut a potential competitor by offering a cheaper price. They may even refuse to work with some of the companies. For Comcast, the next frontier is the financial well-being of its employees, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and may not be able to afford even a small co-payment toward a doctor\u2019s visit. Employees who run into financial trouble have no independent source of information, Mr. Spann said.Employees who are less worried about their finances may be less likely to miss work or suffer from health problems, Mr. Leavitt said. Ultimately, he said, \u201cthere is a productivity play for Comcast.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Real power is, I don\u2019t even want to use the word, fear.\u201dTrump has found \u2014 or has always had \u2014 a winning populism perfectly suited for this moment in our history, when the anxious, scared, hateful and callous desire an unapologetic voice that has the backing of actual power. Trump\u2019s magical mixture is to make being afraid feel like fun. His rallies are a hybrid of concert revelry and combat prep. Trump tells his followers about all the things of which they should be afraid, or shouldn\u2019t trust or should hate, and then positions himself as the greatest defense against those things. His supporters roar their approval at their white knight.Fear is the poison-tipped arrow in Trump\u2019s quiver. He launches it whenever he needs to change the subject, justify his callousness and racism, or defend himself from critique.And he has been doing this since he got into the race for president. \u201cMore than 2,500 were from Afghanistan, a terrorist haven, the president complained. Haiti had sent 15,000 people. They \u2018all have AIDS,\u2019 he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there.\u201dHe constantly whips up panic about the Salvadoran-American gang MS-13.

Fear doesn\u2019t have to be rational or reasonable to be real.A lie is just as solid a foundation for fear as truth is. Indeed, the lie is probably an even better foundation.Trump is playing the people who support him and they revel in the delight of being played. It\u2019s all dramatic theater, a game in which the rule maker is armed with the power of the presidency.

He\u2019s not your average showbiz composer, either. He struck a chord with a far broader range of listeners than the norm.\u201dHe was the rare kind of classical music conductor whose fans would lunge at his car and tear at his clothing.But fame came to Bernstein through a stroke of luck.A Jewish boy from the Boston suburbs, Bernstein moved to New York City in his early 20s and spent time playing piano at the Village Vanguard in the West Village and working at a music-publishing house.

{"Headline": "\u2018Overtourism\u2019 Worries Europe. How Much Did Technology Help Get Us There?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtOver the summer, my wife and I traveled with our two young kids on a two-week vacation through Europe.It wasn\u2019t as highfalutin as it sounds. In London, our Airbnb had ample skylights \u2014 which rendered the place all but uninhabitable during Europe\u2019s heat wave. In Paris, our charming home-share had a cavernous hole in the ceiling of the entryway, revealing load-bearing beams that appeared to have been rotting since Napoleon\u2019s reign. And in Amsterdam, our Airbnb advertised a kids\u2019 bedroom stocked with toys \u2014 but failed to mention the mosquitoes and mice.I\u2019m not complaining. If travel mishaps are the stuff of memory, my vacation was unforgettable. And without home-sharing services like Airbnb, review sites like TripAdvisor and conveniences like Uber, OpenTable and Expedia, the trip would have been far more expensive, less accessible and, in a strange way, less authentic.But my tech-abetted trip was illuminating, too, because it provided a firsthand look into a vexing problem that has gripped much of Europe lately \u2014 the worry of \u201covertourism,\u201d and the rising chorus that blames technologies like Airbnb, Uber and other internet-enabled travel conveniences for the menace.This growth might once have been considered unambiguously good news. But the world\u2019s most popular destinations cannot expand to accommodate an infinite flood of visitors. Advocates of curbing tourism say too many visitors are altering the character of historic cities, and making travel terrible, too.\u201cIt\u2019s a level of tourism which is degrading the enjoyment that residents have, but it\u2019s also degrading the tourist experience, because the tourist who is endlessly queuing behind backpacks of hundreds of other tourists is not discovering the real or the authentic place,\u201d said Justin Francis, the chief executive of Responsible Travel, a company that arranges \u201csustainable\u201d travel for customers.What\u2019s to blame? In addition to broad prosperity, there\u2019s technology, defined very broadly.Finally, as in almost every other issue these days, there is the influence of social media.\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about overtourism without mentioning Instagram and Facebook \u2014 I think they\u2019re big drivers of this trend,\u201d Mr. Francis said. \u201cSeventy-five years ago, tourism was about experience seeking. Now it\u2019s about using photography and social media to build a personal brand. In a sense, for a lot of people, the photos you take on a trip become more important than the experience.\u201dThat so many different forces play into overtourism highlights the difficulties of doing much about it. Managing a tourist destination is something like managing a natural resource, like a mine or a fishery; a sustainable level of tourists brings widespread gains to the local economy, but too many ruin it for everyone. Cities that are looking to tame the number of tourists must manage a delicate balance \u2014 to gently discourage some forms of travel without appearing unwelcoming to others.That brings us to the hand-wringing over Airbnb, which has been singled out by lawmakers across Europe as a primary driver of overtourism. In Amsterdam, the authorities are pushing to slash the number of nights that residents can rent their homes to 30 from 60. Several other cities, including London and Barcelona, Spain, have also instituted stringent home-sharing rules.The measures reflect Airbnb\u2019s jaw-dropping growth. In just a few years, the company has become a significant force in the tourism economies of many cities. In Amsterdam, according to the company, Airbnb accounted for 12 percent of all overnight bookings in 2017. In Barcelona, Airbnb had an 18 percent market share. And in Kyoto, Japan, it was 22 percent.Airbnb said that because it offered lodging across a city \u2014 rather than only in the tourist hot spots where hotels typically congregate \u2014 it could distribute crowds more evenly.In an interview, Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s vice president for public affairs, also argued that the site benefited local economies more directly than hotels did.\u201cOur local hosts make 97 percent of the money that they list their homes for,\u201d Mr. Lehane said. \u201cOur guests stay longer than a typical hotel guest, and they\u2019re spreading the economic gains across a whole community in a way that doesn\u2019t happen with hotels.\u201d He said that while there was some friction with cities over the company\u2019s huge growth, he had seen signs of a more recent thaw.\u201cAmsterdam is an outlier right now,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the most part, we are generally in the ballpark in our discussions with cities.\u201dThese challenges are unlikely to remain fixed for long, because the technology that exacerbates it is always changing. One recent problem is the rise of a more professional class of home-sharers \u2014 people who buy up properties to rent out full time on home-sharing sites, often in violation of local rules.Airbnb said it tries to crack down on rule-breaking hosts, but even some of its nominal allies wonder how diligently.\u201cThe issue for Airbnb, and I\u2019ve said this to them, is that there are listings that are not home-sharing \u2014 the people who buy up multiple flats and list them all, which really changes the character of a city,\u201d said Jonathan Tourtellot, the founder of the Sustainable Stewardship Center, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable tourism. Airbnb commissioned Mr. Tourtellot to write the foreword of its report.Another issue is that Airbnb has faced more competition from newer home-sharing services \u2014 and the authorities have had trouble policing some of its competitors.The more general problem is nonstop growth everywhere.\u201cAt the end, this story is just a numbers problem,\u201d Mr. Tourtellot said. He noted that in 1960, when the jet age began, around 25 million international trips were taken. Last year, the number was 1.3 billion.As for the cities that are the major destinations? They are \u201cthe same size they were back in 1959, and they\u2019ll probably stay that way,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Waiting for Caesar", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill the Trump White House start testing the limits of its power?Opinion ColumnistIn the eight years of the Obama presidency, there were three cycles of policymaking. First came the attempt to pass an ambitious liberal agenda through a Democratic-controlled Congress, which ended with the Republican House takeover in 2010. Then came the attempt to strike bargains, grand and otherwise, with John Boehner and congressional Republicans, which petered out early in Barack Obama\u2019s second term. And finally came the imperial phase, in which activists appealed to the president to claim powers that he had previously abjured, and override or sidestep congressional gridlock on immigration, climate policy and health care through the power of the presidential pen.Under Donald Trump the imperial phase might arrive much sooner. The possibility for further ambitious conservative legislation seems to have died away already; it's hard to imagine Trump successfully making deals with Democrats if his party loses the House in November, and so two years may stretch ahead of us in which literally nothing passes Congress except the necessary budget deals.These kinds of collisions are common in other presidential systems, especially Latin American governments that imitated our constitutional arrangements. And the drift of American institutions lately \u2014 the celebrity status of the presidency and the increasing powers claimed by presidents of both parties, the abdication and ineffectiveness of Congress, the tendency for policy disputes to be tacitly negotiated between the White House and the Supreme Court \u2014 is arguably creating some of the preconditions for a Latin American-style breakdown.But at the same time, the legacy of Obama\u2019s foray into Caesarism offers some reasons to think that our system will limp along without a crisis for a while. That\u2019s because one of the essential preconditions for such a crisis would be a feeling, in an ambitious White House, that going the full Caesar on some disputed issue would make them dramatically more popular. And in our environment of stark polarization, equally balanced parties and presidents who struggle to keep their approval ratings above water once the policymaking starts, it\u2019s hard to chart a course from constitutional aggression to clear political success. Certainly that was the case with the Obama White House. It wasn\u2019t just that Obama\u2019s more imperial forays on immigration were quickly tied up in the courts. It was that the imperial Obama was a politically unsuccessful Obama, whose party lost the Senate and then the White House during its imperial phase \u2014 ushering in a Republican presidency that set about unilaterally reversing much of its predecessor\u2019s unilateralism, from DACA to the Paris and Iran deals.In the same way but more so given his worse-than-Obama poll numbers, it\u2019s very hard to see how the imperial forays being urged on Trump by immigration restrictionists or supply-siders would make him more popular, or less likely to suffer a repudiation at the polls. (Maybe the capital gains cut would juice the economy enough to compensate for the awful optics of yet another tax cut weighted to the rich \u2026 but those of us who aren\u2019t sworn to the supply-side catechism should be doubtful.) By contrast, in countries where an imperial presidency transitions to an authoritarian one, the transition often happens precisely because the imperial president has strong popular support. The original Caesar was dangerous because he was beloved, and a country like Venezuela is where it is today because Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was able to win thumping-big electoral victories throughout his constitutional aggressions, on a scale that no recent American president has been able to achieve or sustain.So long as that kind of popularity eludes our chief executives, their unilateralism is more likely to be a driver of dysfunction \u2014 encouraging wild swings from presidency to presidency, impeding policy certainty and follow-through \u2014 than a greased slope to presidential tyranny. For that to change you would need a different correlation of forces than our polarized landscape currently produces \u2014 with a significantly more popular president pushing against a clearly unpopular Supreme Court or Congress, under conditions (a terror campaign, an economic crash) where the stakes in the big policy debates seem more immediate and dire.

The central kitchen, on the ground floor, preserves an original arched brick structure called the carriage house. There, Matthew Deliso, the executive chef and a native of Long Island, will be in charge of the wood-fired grills and the grand Molteni ovens and cooktops. The blue finish on the ovens inspired the name of the hotel\u2019s signature restaurant: Klein\u2019s, for the French painter Yves Klein, who used bright blue with abandon. (The Hoxton team was not aware that for some New Yorkers, the name might evoke memories of discount designer clothing.) The restaurant is airy and free-flowing, and the food, Mr. Deliso said, will be American: poached king salmon, spaghetti and meatballs, burgers and halves of grilled chicken. The hotel also has the open-air Backyard terrace for sandwiches, dips and drinks; and the rooftop Summerly, with stunning views and a menu of lobster rolls, ribs and pizza. By next year the English onslaught will be in full force. D&D London will open a restaurant in Hudson Yards, as will Rhubarb, another London group, which plans an \u201cEast-meets-West\u201d menu.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the restaurant previously in the third-floor space in the Time Warner Center.

Will He Keep Hating Me Forever?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SMaybe, but you could try giving him some space and apologizing.A close friend, 32, dated a woman for eight months, then broke up with her. Three months later, I began dating her after hanging out with her in groups. I told my friend my intentions. (The woman and I dated briefly, but it didn\u2019t work out.) I knew my friend wouldn\u2019t like it, but he\u2019s furious and our relationship now seems irreconcilable. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want your friendship.\u201d I\u2019ve tried reasoning and apologizing until I\u2019ve run out of things to say. Is there anything I can do to salvage our friendship? What am I not seeing?ANONYMOUSI hope you realize that you\u2019re asking a gay guy to interpret the bro code for you. That said, you\u2019re missing a few key things. The mere fact that your friend broke up with this woman does not mean that he wasn\u2019t distraught about it. Is he a toxic bachelor? Did she cheat on him? Was he heartbroken that they didn\u2019t connect more deeply? More important, you \u201ctold\u201d your friend that you were going to date his ex. A better move would have been to discuss the prospect with him. Investing more energy at that stage may have paid better dividends than crawling back to him after things didn\u2019t work out with the ex. As it stands, you look like a guy who did exactly what you wanted to, regardless of your pal\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s your right, but that can hurt a bro.The part of these dating codes that I dislike is the possessory interest it gives our friends over third parties. This woman has feelings, too. It was your job to try to balance the needs of all three of you. Maybe 90 days struck your friend as too soon to take up with his ex. Maybe there would never be a good time (in his view), which would be extreme. But that\u2019s water under the bridge. The best you can do now is to give him space. Check back with him in a month or two. Don\u2019t try to rationalize your behavior. Just apologize for ignoring his feelings and ask him to dinner. Court him, like on an old-fashioned date.I have a friend who texts me: \u201cDo you have any plans this weekend?\u201d I\u2019m hoping she wants to spend time with me. But if I say I\u2019m free, she often presses me into dog-walking, plant-watering and mail-collecting duties while she\u2019s away for the weekend. I\u2019m starting to dislike the burden of caring for her life in her absence. Is there a nice way to handle this?C.Unless you are on your pal\u2019s payroll as a part-time handyman, let\u2019s break this cycle. The next time she sends one of her (manipulative) \u201cAre you free?\u201d texts, reply: \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. What do you have in mind?\u201d Make her ask for the favor. Don\u2019t let her back you into it. And promise me you won\u2019t feel guilty about standing up for yourself. Friends don\u2019t trick other friends into scooping poop.A colleague with whom I was friendly often made disparaging comments about my height, sometimes in front of other colleagues. (I am five feet tall; he is much taller.) By email, I asked him politely, but firmly, not to make comments about my height or compare me to his 2-year-old. He apologized immediately by email but hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. Was I wrong to send my email?N.R.You weren\u2019t wrong to send your email. Making fun of someone\u2019s physical trait \u2014 or even noting it repeatedly \u2014 is rude. But your colleague may have read your email as angrier than you intended \u2014 perhaps so angry that you wanted to end your friendship. That\u2019s why I usually prefer face-to-face complaints (though they are more stressful to make than typed ones). Seek out your colleague for a friendly word. It will probably put you back on collegial track again.I had an enjoyable night with a gentleman. However, he enjoyed it so much that he left some parting marks on my neck and collarbone. The collar I wear to my blue-collar job did not cover them, so I had to spend $50 for cream and powder to conceal the hickeys. Is it reasonable to ask him to pitch in for half the cost? He earns more money than I do, and I don\u2019t see why I should have to pay for something he did. D.If, as we learned in the ancient days of hip-hop, \u201cIt takes two to make a thing go right/ it takes two to make it outta sight,\u201d why shouldn\u2019t it also take two to buy a tube of concealer? Accidents happen, and good partners help shoulder the burden. Let\u2019s put aside income inequality for another day, because as sex-related phone calls and requests go, this one should be pretty easy.Advertisement"}

They threw sand in his eyes so he couldn\u2019t see, he said, and struck his head and back with what appeared to be a stick and a belt.\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here,\u201d he said they told him.Sheriff Adam Christianson of Stanislaus County said his office was aggressively investigating the case and looking for suspects.\u201cIt\u2019s a despicable hate crime,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cThere is no room for this in Stanislaus County or anywhere else in the United States of America.\u201dRepresentative Jeff Denham, Republican of California, released a statement on Monday condemning the attack, which occurred in his district.

Our tech columnist explains how the industry got here and what we can do.The web is in a dark place, as I plan to examine in the next several columns. If you need proof, look no further than autoplay videos, the first example.You\u2019re probably familiar with this horrendous experience: You are perusing a website, and suddenly an annoying voice or unfamiliar music blasts through your speakers. You wonder, where is this coming from? You scroll up and down the webpage only to realize that a video is playing without your consent. And the noise polluting your ears is coming from an ad preceding a video you had never clicked to watch.Autoplay videos are all over the web and inside apps. They are prominent in your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Some major news sites embed them into features and news articles. Nobody seems to likes autoplay videos \u2014 not even people I\u2019ve talked to in the ad industry. The indiscreet videos demand your attention while burning through your mobile data plan and sucking up your batteries. Yet they have become a necessary evil for many media publishers trying to survive in the digital age.\u201cI think we\u2019ve ended up in a really crappy user experience right now with video advertising,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads. \u201cVideo has been pushed into every user experience whether or not it fits, because it\u2019s a way to make more money.\u201d\u201cSight, sound and motion can make people laugh, make people cry, make them hug somebody,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cIt can make them love a brand. It can make them whistle a brand\u2019s theme song when they\u2019re walking a dog.\u201dYet publishers faced technical hurdles, like slow internet connections, that made video ads untenable. Instead, publishers served ads that were static images, which eventually evolved to become graphics with some animations and sound. Over the last decade, fast wired and wireless connections spread, as did computers and smartphones. Consumers also became acclimated to streaming video services like Netflix and YouTube. Serving an online video became easy. So advertising firms like BrightRoll and Tremor Video, along with tech companies like Facebook, began testing video ads.As annoying as they may be, autoplay videos are here to stay \u2014 largely because the ads generate so much money. But they are thankfully becoming less obnoxious.\u201cAutoplay with sound on is just going to go extinct,\u201d Mr. Wiegert said. \u201cIt\u2019s been deemed as a poor quality experience for users. Even I\u2019ve gotten annoyed when I\u2019ve been on a webpage and all of a sudden I hear sound coming through my speakers.\u201dYet Mr. Morgan of Simulmedia believes video ads will be forced to change more radically to give people fuller control over what they see. That\u2019s because autoplay videos still satisfy publishers, not the consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re putting those ads in those places because we can \u2014 not because it is the best for the user,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Depends on Which One", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRod Nordland has been reporting on Afghanistan\u2019s travails since well before the American-led invasion that booted the Taliban from power in 2001. For the past eight years, he has been a correspondent and then Kabul bureau chief for The New York Times, which has expanded its presence in the country even as many other news organizations have withdrawn.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Two wars are convulsing Afghanistan, the war of blood and guts, and the war of truth and lies. Both have been amassing casualties at a remarkable rate recently.The other is the war in which most of that, according to official accounts, did not happen \u2014 or at least was not as bad as it sounded. Not until late on the third day of the Taliban\u2019s assault on Ghazni did President Ashraf Ghani\u2019s aides even inform him of the desperation level there, two government officials said privately; Mr. Ghani himself later confirmed that publicly. By then the Taliban had control of nearly every neighborhood.The American military\u2019s chief spokesman, Lt. Col. Martin L. O\u2019Donnell, insisted there was no big problem \u2014 just insurgents looking for \u201cinconsequential headlines.\u201dDiscerning fact from fiction is challenging in any war, of course. But in Afghanistan, where most of the population has known only war, narratives are often total contradictions of one another.We had a reporter inside Ghazni, canvassing neighborhoods. Although the country\u2019s cellphone networks failed in Ghazni, making it hard to check the official narrative, we also found people who could get a cell signal on the outskirts or upper floors of Ghazni buildings, or who fled and brought their stories to us.One of our reporters, Fahim Abed, got through on the phone to the director of Ghazni Hospital, Baz Mohammad Hemat, who spoke from a hospital floor awash in blood, bodies stacked in storerooms because the morgue was full. Dr. Hemat counted 113 dead on day two, and more arriving hourly. Most were in uniform, belying official claims of minimal casualties.In Ajristan District, our Afghan reporters heard that disaster had befallen an elite Army commando unit defending that remote area. As our reporter Jawad Sukhanyar called around to officials in the surrounding areas, he found that the Ministry of Defense was doing the same thing; they didn\u2019t know what had happened either.It turned out that insurgent suicide bombers destroyed the commando company\u2019s base, and as the defenders fled, Taliban fighters picked them off. Out of a base force of more than 100 commandos, police and militia fighters, only 22 survived, fleeing into the desert with no water or food.Jawad reached a surviving commando, Sgt. Eid Mohammad, 30, on the phone. He described how they had drunk one another\u2019s urine while fleeing pro-Taliban Kuchi nomads.The sergeant also repeated a version of something widely heard in the 25 of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces actively at war now: \u201cNo one from the government gave us anything. All we got was promises, no action.\u201dOur reporter Najim Rahim had been on the phone every day for a week with the defenders, including their captain, who had become Najim\u2019s friend. On Sunday someone else answered the captain\u2019s phone. \u201cI started crying when I heard he was killed,\u201d Najim said.By Tuesday the defenders at Chinese Camp were almost out of ammunition, they told Najim. Half were dead or wounded and the rest surrendered except for a lieutenant who escaped. Najim managed to track him down, so we knew what had happened.Afghan officials at the Ministry of Defense said they could not provide an account of Chinese Camp casualties. \u201cWe\u2019re working on figuring out how many soldiers were there and when we do, we\u2019ll share it,\u201d said Ghafoor Ahmad Jawed, a ministry spokesman.This is often the first question arriving diplomats ask. Every year there\u2019s a new group of them \u2014 most countries do not allow them to stay more than a year, sometimes two. They are usually well briefed in the official narrative that things are improving. But many spend their entire tours inside a fortified embassy.On paper, the Afghan government and its 40-plus international coalition allies, predominantly Americans, have all the advantages over the insurgents. The Afghan military and police have an authorized strength of 350,000, their payroll funded by international partners. The American military now number 14,000, a mix of trainers, advisers and Special Operations members.The Afghans also have their own small air force, and extensive support from American drones, jet bombers and helicopter gunships.The Taliban have been estimated by American military officials to number 20,000 to 40,000 active fighters, an estimate that has not changed much for years even though the Afghan government claims it has been killing nearly a thousand a month.Full data on attrition, which includes desertions, failure to re-enlist and casualties, was now secret, the agency said, a decision taken by the American military, which the agency criticized.Many Afghan officials and military officers say privately that the losses have worsened since then. \u201cCasualties among Afghan forces are higher than they have ever been,\u201d said the retired general Atiqullah Amarkhel, a military analyst in Kabul.If the death toll of the past week \u2014 more than 400 Afghan soldiers and police officers \u2014 were to continue for a year, the annual total would be triple the worst known year so far.The Taliban vowed this year to retake cities and provinces, but so far they have taken no provinces and three cities, but only briefly. And most of Afghanistan\u2019s population lives under government, not Taliban, control.Even by territorial standards, according to the American military\u2019s reckoning, the Afghan security forces have been doing well lately. When the international coalition reduced its 140,000-soldier presence, handing security responsibility to Afghan forces, the insurgents quickly expanded their control throughout the country. But in the past year, the military said, that expansion has been halted.As of July 30, the government controlled 58.5 percent of the country, the insurgents 19.4 percent, with the remaining 22 percent contested, according to the American military.Other information raises serious questions about the accuracy of that data. In Ghazni Province, for example, only one of its 19 districts was listed by the American military as under insurgent control. But local officials said last week that only three Ghazni districts were clearly government-controlled.In northern Kunduz Province, and in southern Helmand, Uruzgan and Zabul Provinces, most districts are listed as under government control or contested. But in none of them would it be safe for a government official to leave the provincial capital without a heavily armed escort.The government\u2019s efforts at message management often collide with an inclination by many ordinary Afghans and local officials to speak their minds. They are often the best sources for information.When phone service was restored in Ghazni and we finally reached Mohammad Arif Noori, the spokesman for the governor, he did not try to obscure what had just happened. There were too few security forces in the city, he said, and they were using outdated equipment. \u201cThe reason most parts of Ghazni city collapsed was a lack of coordination between police and N.D.S. forces,\u201d he said, referring to the National Directorate for Security, a paramilitary intelligence service.Even parts of the country considered safe have been badly affected. Take Bamian Province, home of the standing Buddhas destroyed by the Taliban. Bamian attracted a range of foreign aid groups with ambitious projects: a ski slope, to promote tourism; a girl\u2019s bicycle team.Both roads into Bamian are blocked by Taliban units, in Wardak Province and in Parwan Province\u2019s Ghorband Valley. \u201cThe government has no will to clear the Taliban from Ghorband valley,\u201d said Ghulam Bahauddin Jilani, the Parwan provincial council chairman.In provinces like Oruzgan where the insurgents have much more support, the situation is even more difficult. Amir Mohammad Barakzai, head of the provincial council there, said officials had asked in vain for more resources to fight the insurgents, who are now on the outskirts of the provincial capital, Tarinkot. \u201cThe Taliban are winning this war,\u201d Mr. Barakzai said.In Helmand Province, where the Taliban dominate, Bashir Ahmad Shakirn, head of the security committee, said corruption was the main reason the government does so poorly. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the Taliban are stronger than us, what makes them stronger is the incompetence of our officials,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir priority is not winning the war but their personal benefits.\u201dThe Afghan security forces and the police receive about $6 billion annually, most of it from the United States. But corruption eats away at that money, as reflected in the constant complaints by local units that they are underfed and outgunned.\u201cIf we compare the anti-government forces with Afghan security forces, the Taliban are better equipped, have more resources, and have access to modern weapons,\u201d said a councilman, Abdul Wali, in Logar Province. \u201cIf things continue like this, the Taliban will be the winners.\u201dNesar Ahmad Mehari is the spokesman for the governor of western Farah Province, where the capital city, Farah, was overrun by the Taliban for a day in May. Things are better now, he said, as American troops fight with Afghan commandos. But other officials say that in some neighborhoods, insurgents walk around freely. \u201cI think no one will win this war,\u201d Mr. Mehari said. \u201cWe have seen only destruction and human losses from both sides since 17 years, and this will continue for years to come with the same bloodshed.\u201dAmerican commanders have long since stopped talking about winning in Afghanistan. None see how 14,000 American troops can achieve what 110,000 could not.Taliban leaders have always insisted that as long as any American troops remained in Afghanistan, they would negotiate peace only with the Americans. But American officials had insisted on an \u201cAfghan-owned, Afghan-led process.\u201dIn the past, Afghan officials have opposed that sort of American role, but apparently no longer. \u201cAs President Ghani has indicated that he\u2019s ready to pursue something without conditions, that speaks for itself,\u201d said Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of the American military\u2019s Central Command, when asked about American-initiated talks during a visit here on July 23. \u201cEverything can be on the table here as we move forward with this Afghan-led process.\u201dInsurgents came into towns and cities and mingled with locals in a remarkable outpouring of pro-peace sentiment by people on both sides, who were taking selfies with one another. Even women came out to see the insurgents, who once had hounded them off the streets. It was a moment many hope to see repeated, and President Ghani has offered another cease-fire for the Eid al-Adha holiday that begins Tuesday.Some analysts think the Taliban\u2019s remarkable push on so many fronts in the past week may actually be an effort by the insurgents to gain as much ground as possible before a cease-fire and any further steps toward peace.\u201cThey can join the peace process in a stronger position, and show they are not doing it due to military pressure,\u201d said Intizar Khadim, an Afghan political analyst.Others fear that Ghazni and the bloody past week may have made peace prospects dimmer than ever. The final death toll in Ghazni, a senior official told us, was 155 police and soldiers, 60 to 70 civilians, and 430 insurgents. As many as 200 security forces died elsewhere around the country last week. That left thousands of relatives and friends with reasons to harbor hatred.On the Taliban side, supporters may well be wary of people like Col. Farid Ahmad Mashal, the Ghazni police chief, who posted his own photo on Facebook with the corpses of Taliban fighters. \u201cDo not show any mercy to the enemy,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.Rod Nordland reported from Kabul, Afghanistan.

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Elon Musk\u2019s Interview With The Times About Tesla", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla is not considering hiring a second in command, the electric carmaker\u2019s founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, said in wide-ranging comments to The New York Times.Mr. Musk\u2019s remarks came during an hourlong interview Thursday in which he described the extraordinary demands of running Tesla and the profound effect it has had on his personal life.\u201cIf you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job,\u201d he said from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cIs there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dHere are five takeaways from the interview.En route, he typed out the message that provoked the latest crisis over his leadership of Tesla.Mr. Musk said no one reviewed or saw the tweet before he sent it, but the post sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring. He then reached the airport and took a private jet to a Tesla battery plant in Nevada. Later that evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area and held meetings into the night.When Mr. Musk sent out the tweet, Tesla\u2019s share price rocketed upward, finally closing up 11 percent to finish the day just above $379. He said in the interview that he had sought to offer shareholders a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had recently been trading, and rounded up to $420 a share.Since then, however, Tesla\u2019s share price has nose-dived. On Friday, Tesla shares ended trading at $305.50, a fall of about 9 percent for the day \u2014 and about 24 percent lower from where the price closed on the day of the tweet.\u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Musk told The Times on Thursday, there was \u201cno active search right now.\u201d People familiar with the matter, however, said that executives were looking for a No. 2 executive, and one person said the hunt had intensified in recent weeks.A couple of years ago, Tesla approached Sheryl Sandberg, currently Facebook\u2019s second most senior executive, about the job, Mr. Musk said.\u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asked.Once Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about taking Tesla private was posted, speculation was rife that his target share price, $420, held an implicit message \u2014 the number has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.Mr. Musk was, however, definitive in his response. \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear,\u201d he said.\u201cWeed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dHe did note, though, that he sometimes takes Ambien to help him sleep when he is not working, a practice that has worried some of Tesla\u2019s board members.They worry that the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep, but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, a person familiar with the matter said. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has occasionally used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk outlined the toll that running Tesla had taken on his personal life, from spending the entirety of his birthday at work to nearly missing his brother\u2019s wedding, where he was to be best man.But while that effort appears to have helped Tesla gain a firmer footing, things could get worse for him personally, he said.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d\u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint,\u201d Mr. Musk added, \u201cthe worst is yet to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Be aware that most farmed frozen shrimp, though inexpensive, are of dubious origin, and are likely dipped in some kind of preservative solution. I\u2019d rather get a small amount of higher-priced wild shrimp. You are essentially making a flavorful mixture of spiced minced shrimp that\u2019s similar in shape and bite to crumbled sausage. You\u2019ll add ginger, garlic, soy sauce, scallions, sesame oil and hot red pepper and let the flavors meld: The longer it rests in the fridge, the more aromatic the mixture becomes. (By the way, this mixture could also be used as a won ton filling, but that\u2019s another story and a bigger project.)Once you\u2019ve marinated the chopped shrimp, stir-fry it in a large wok or frying pan over high heat until it sizzles and achieves a crumbly texture, just as you would when frying any other sort of minced meat. It\u2019s then combined with cooked rice noodles, just to heat them through and coat them with the well-seasoned shrimp meat and its juices. Sprinkled with chopped peanuts and a few herb sprigs, your dinner for four is ready. It\u2019s that easy.Advertisement"}

We just have to listen to each other. Coffs HarbourBy Sheila Ngoc PhamThe first creative writing exercise we take them through is a poem constructed by answering a series of questions. Anyone with the most basic grasp of English can write this poem and, as I discover that morning, some of the most simple ones are the most moving. When adjectives and other literary flourishes are stripped away, only feelings and everyday objects remain.In just a few hours with these students in the school library I learn so much about the world, things I probably should know but really don\u2019t. Like the Hazara students whose families were persecuted by the Taliban; how they fled Afghanistan by going over to Pakistan, living there indefinitely in refugee camps until their application to settle in Australia was approved many years later.I chat with one boy about how he misses freshly baked Afghan bread because he\u2019s written it down in a story about his family. We agree that if he lived in Sydney or Brisbane he\u2019d be able to find some easily, and I tell him I know exactly where to find a good Afghan bakery in Auburn. Refugee resettlement has transformed Coffs remarkably in recent years, but not enough to warrant its own Afghan bakery. Not yet, anyway.I\u2019d visited Coffs only once before, 20 years earlier, a brief stop at the town\u2019s infamous Big Banana on the 10-hour drive from Sydney to the Gold Coast. It was the only time we ever visited because family holidays were rare. My parents were always working, often on weekends as well, and for a time Dad even worked two full-time jobs going straight from one to the other with a short nap in between.Later that afternoon we visit Coffs Harbour High, where teacher Kate Pullinger has gathered together a large group of students interested in creative writing. Only three look like recent arrivals to Australia, while the rest seem to be largely white or Aboriginal. I gravitate toward the three, instinctively protective, sitting down with them to support them in their writing. One boy writes on his sheet of paper that he\u2019s traveled in Australia.\u201cWhere in Australia have you traveled?\u201d I ask.\u201cJust here, Coffs Harbour.\u201d\u201cOh I see, you mean you moved or migrated here,\u201d I said. I look at what else he\u2019s written for some context. \u201cBut you\u2019ve written that you flew from Bangkok. Did you stay there?\u201d\u201cNo, I was in Pakistan. We traveled to Islamabad first where we got on the plane.\u201d\u201cAre you Hazara then?\u201d I asked, going off what I\u2019d learned just that morning from the other kids at Orara High \u2026 and when I say that, he just stares at me, his eyes popping out of his head at my recognition.\u201cHow did you know?!\u201dI suddenly choke up and have to turn away to compose myself before I can face him again. In that moment I realize how much is still so close to the surface, the countless times people were ignorant of who I was and how my family got here. Turns out I'd just developed a thick skin, long used to the fact that most people don\u2019t appreciate the extraordinary journey undertaken to arrive here after a war.Knowing he was Hazara was hardly the most profound insight, something learned earlier that day from a few conversations; that he felt validation from so little reminded me how we \u2014 all of us \u2014 don\u2019t even have to work that hard to meet people part of the way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Poem in The Nation Spurs a Backlash and an Apology", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut last week, the venerable progressive weekly published what may have been a first: an apology for one of its offerings that ran twice as long as the poem itself.But after a firestorm of criticism on social media over a white poet\u2019s attempt at black vernacular, as well as a line in which the speaker makes reference to being \u201ccrippled,\u201d the magazine said it had made a \u201cserious mistake\u201d in publishing it.\u201cWhen we read the poem we took it as a profane, over-the-top attack on the ways in which member of many groups are asked, or required, to perform the work of marginalization,\u201d they wrote. But \u201cwe can no longer read the poem in that way.\u201dMr. Carlson-Wee also posted his own apology. \u201cTreading anywhere close to blackface is horrifying to me, and I am profoundly regretful,\u201d he said in a statement posted on Facebook and Twitter.For an art form starved for attention, it was not the kind of publicity poetry needed. To the mostly right-leaning media outlets who covered the controversy, it was just the latest skirmish in the broader battle over cultural appropriation and political correctness.The Nation did not remove or alter the poem. But its handling of the incident provoked criticism even from within its ranks for the way it broke with the magazine\u2019s traditional way of handling controversy: by publishing critical letters, not by ducking for cover from Twitter storms.Online battles over cultural appropriation may be relatively new, but Mr. Carlson-Wee\u2019s poem is part of a long, queasy history of white poets adopting black vernacular.While few today would attempt that kind of mimicry, some white poets have been accused of flip appropriations of black experience and black pain under the guise of postmodern irony and experimentation.Mr. Carlson-Wee\u2019s poem might seem like a more earnest, if linguistically twisty, attempt to channel a homeless person trying to appeal to passers-by for some change.\u201cIf you got hiv, say aids,\u201d begins the list of advice. \u201cIf you a girl, say you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Later, it says:The speaker continues: \u201cIf you\u2019re crippled, don\u2019t flaunt it.\u201dAfter Mr. Carlson-Wee posted an excited tweet announcing publication of the poem, the negative reaction was swift.\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the voice in this poem,\u201d Nate Marshall, an African-American poet from Chicago, tweeted in reply. \u201cIt feels offensive to me and like it\u2019s trafficking inappropriately in Black language but is there something I\u2019m missing?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t use AAVE. Don\u2019t even try it,\u201d she said. \u201cKnow your lane.\u201d\u201cI feel as though tagging me as an \u2018editor\u2019 of the poem was an intentional way of showing that a PoC\u201d \u2014 a person of color \u2014 \u201cco-signed this offensive poem,\u201d he wrote.Dr. Burt, a professor at Harvard who has contributed articles and reviews to The New York Times, said that she and Ms. Smith, a poet and a professor at Virginia Tech, would offer no comment beyond the statement on the website. A spokesman for The Nation, Peter Rothberg, also said the magazine would offer no further comment, but noted that the apology posted on the website, while it reflected the position of the magazine, was written entirely by the two poetry editors.Instead, he offered a terse restatement of his own online apology.\u201cI intended for this poem to address the invisibility of homelessness,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly it doesn\u2019t work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New York Times Endorses Zephyr Teachout for Attorney General in Thursday\u2019s Primary", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "OpinionThe office is a potential firewall against an out-of-control president and a historically corrupt New York State government.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The most important choice facing New York voters this fall is whom they will pick as their next state attorney general. The office could be the last line of defense against an antidemocratic president, a federal government indifferent to environmental and consumer protection and a state government in which ethics can seem a mere inconvenience. Even in the best of times the office plays a critical role, policing fraud on Wall Street and ensuring enforcement of state and federal laws, from regulating the financial system to preventing employment discrimination. Its influence is felt across the nation. New Yorkers who feel they deserve better \u2014 presumably just about all of them \u2014 have the chance this fall to elect a strong and unencumbered attorney general capable of delivering it.The office of attorney general has been held by a long line of formidable lawyers and strong, if at times deeply flawed, men. No woman has ever been elected to the position. Barbara Underwood, the current occupant, assumed office after Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s resignation. Ms. Teachout lacks direct experience as a prosecutor but is equipped with legal firepower comparable to previous attorneys general. A Fordham Law School professor and activist, she\u2019s widely respected among lawyers and academics. She\u2019s known as a thoughtful and innovative scholar who has been a pioneering thinker in the legal case against Trump\u2019s entanglements with foreign favor-seekers who are lining his pockets through his hotels, golf courses and other private holdings. We are persuaded she will not let a focus on the Trump administration detract her from other efforts on behalf of New York, including securing tenants\u2019 rights and voting rights and pursuing criminal justice reform. We believe Ms. Teachout would also be able to recruit some of the best lawyers in the country to the state attorney general\u2019s office, which competes for talent with the Southern District of New York, the Department of Justice in Washington, top private law firms and prestigious public-interest groups.Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of upstate New York is also in the hunt. Mr. Maloney, whose congressional seat is up this year, is straddling two races. He is fighting to hold on to his seat in the 18th Congressional District \u2014 a race that could prove critical to Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning the House \u2014 while also running for the Albany job. His acceptance of tens of thousands of dollars from real estate interests casts a shadow over his appealing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and solid government experience. Mr. Maloney has been effective in Congress; he and the state would be better served if he stayed there and moved into the leadership ranks. The winner of the Democratic primary will face the Republican Keith Wofford, co-managing partner of Ropes & Gray, an international law firm, in the general election on Nov. 6. New York needs a great lawyer. We believe that Democrats who are seeking a means of standing up to the Trump presidency and graft in Albany can find in Ms. Teachout their most effective champion for democracy and civil rights, good government and the environment, workers\u2019 rights, fair housing and gender equality.

{"Headline": "Rules Won\u2019t Save Twitter. Values Will. ", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe platform won\u2019t ban the dangerous liar Alex Jones because he \u201chasn\u2019t violated our rules.\u201d Then what\u2019s the point of these rules? Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Spotify and most other major internet distributors banished Mr. Jones, either permanently or for some unspecified star-chamber-determined amount of time, for hate speech and other violations. But not Twitter. Instead, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive, founder and tweet inventor himself, took to his own platform to explain in the high-minded tone that one takes with small children that Mr. Jones wasn\u2019t suspended from Twitter because he \u201chasn\u2019t violated our rules.\u201d His tweets were a variation on that theme. Mr. Dorsey insisted that Twitter was \u201cnot taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.\u201dLet\u2019s ignore for a second that taking really valuable one-off actions can, in fact, be a very laudable thing and listen to more key-tapping by Mr. Dorsey: \u201cIf we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that\u2019s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction. That\u2019s not us.\u201dTranslation: Twitter is doubling down on the same squishy point of view that has allowed too much of it to become a cesspool over the last several years, and it has little intention of truly cleaning up.So it\u2019s somewhat odd for Mr. Dorsey to be lecturing the rest of us about principles at this moment of high agitation, brought on in no small part by the twitchy, meaner-than-ever screamfest of Twitter itself. While principles and rules will help in an open platform, it is values that Mr. Dorsey should really be talking about. By values, I mean a code that requires making hard choices \u2014 curating your offerings, which was something Apple got made fun of for doing, back when it launched the App Store, by the open-is-best crowd. Let me say that I have nothing but admiration for the long-suffering trust and safety team at Twitter, which has been tasked with the Sisyphean job of controlling humanity and scaling civility, armed only with some easily gamed and capriciously enforced rules. How are these people supposed to do that when the company has provided them with no firm set of values? Values would require that Twitter make tough calls on high-profile and obviously malevolent figures, including tossing them off as a signal of its intent to keep it civil. And Mr. Jones is not even an edge case: His bilious lies, including that the murders of the Sandy Hook Elementary children were \u201csynthetic, completely fake, with actors,\u201d clearly sully the platform. Besides, let\u2019s be clear: Twitter can change its rules to ban whoever it wants anytime, because it is not a public trust but a for-profit company. Twitter has certainly appeared to have adjusted the rules for Donald Trump. While the president has not descended down the same demented rabbit hole as Alex Jones, many argue that he has violated various Twitter rules, by threatening violence (he did so against North Korea and later Iran) and by systematic harassment of people (the list is too long). You can have whatever opinion you want on that, even as Mr. Trump still continues to play the medium like a virtuoso plays a Stradivarius violin. I mean this as no compliment, but he remains the most epic troll in Twitter\u2019s pantheon. And, while it pains me to say this, he is a true tweet savant, however awful and deceitful his utterances sometimes are. But Twitter famously declared last year that since Mr. Trump was president, what he said was news, and so he got immunity. (Is there a secret Rubicon that Twitter has in place that Mr. Trump cannot cross? Yes, many sources assure me that there is indeed a pull-emergency-brake plan for him, but it hasn\u2019t come to that. Yet.) But by that measure, the rest of us plebes, including Mr. Jones, should probably get no protection if we err, no matter how much we rant that tweeting is a right under the First Amendment. It\u2019s not, because Twitter is not the government and it can decide what and what not to host on its service. In any case, if you get kicked off Twitter, you can always unload your twisted mind on your very own website. And it cannot be said too many times that freedom of speech does not guarantee freedom from consequence. All this is not to say that fixing Twitter will be easy; in fact, I think at this point it is nearly impossible. Add to that the fact that this is a global issue, making it hard to have any consistent rules that address the complexity of the world and, really, its deep and abiding ugliness. But will Mr. Dorsey ever stand up to the uglies to protect the rest of us? On Wednesday, he went on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show. His intent was to tamp down widespread rumors that Twitter was \u201cshadow banning\u201d \u2014 who comes up with these creepy terms? \u2014 some conservative users. The idea is that their posts mysteriously don\u2019t show up in search results. Twitter did not do that, Mr. Dorsey said, \u201cperiod.\u201d But Twitter immediately and on cue lit up with criticisms about him pandering to the right. It was a lot calmer just a week earlier, when Twitter held an offsite meeting for its staff members \u2014 some 3,500 of them. It was opened by Mr. Dorsey, who sat cross-legged on the stage, leading a 10-minute meditation for his most fervent followers \u2014 Twitter\u2019s employees flown in from across the globe. The event had a very Silicon Valley feel-good vibe, and veered awfully close to becoming a spoof of itself. There was Mr. Dorsey\u2019s adorable mom onstage, there was a continuing joke about drinking \u201csalt juice\u201d (salt, water and lemon; part of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s morning regimen, it was provided to all there), and there was what looked like a fabulous lip sync contest. There were also, Twitter tells me, many serious conversations about the health of the platform and what the company needed to do to make it better. It is heartening to think of really smart people thinking hard about issues that affect the real world and trying to come up with solutions, even if they need a slug of salt juice to get there. What I really hope, though, is that they don\u2019t think protecting Alex Jones is the answer.Advertisement"}

There can easily be, as Ronson puts it, a \u201cdisconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment.\u201dCertainly, public shaming can have positive effects; sometimes the angry mob gets it right \u2014 punching up and hitting the right target. But Harmless Torturers can just as easily swarm the weak; the mobbing can be based on lies and confusions or ignorantly encouraged by powerful celebrities and politicians, including, notably, the current president. The Harmless Torturer effect isn\u2019t limited to social media; we can also see the effects of aggregation when it comes to more impactful individual actions. Likes and retweets bear a structural similarity to execution by stoning, particularly if the crowd is large: it\u2019s hard to see the victim, and nobody has good aim. Social shunning is another case, torture through the accumulation of omissions \u2014 individuals avoiding social contact with a certain person \u2014 as opposed to actions. It\u2019s difficult to change the sorts of behaviors that Sanchez discusses, and probably even harder to get people to rethink internet mobbing, which, when we feel we have right on our side, can feel so good. Our minds have evolved to think about the effects of our individual actions; it\u2019s hard to consider aggregate effects. But the lesson of Parfit\u2019s Harmless Torturer is that if we want to be decent people, we should try. Advertisement"}

When I plunged my spoon in, plump grains of hominy mingled with shrimp and red snapper. \u201cI\u2019ve got to imagine somewhere in Mexico someone\u2019s put seafood in pozole verde before, but I\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d Mr. Salazar said. When he tried it, the combination made perfect sense.In this version, I\u2019ve taken Mr. Salazar\u2019s already lighter pozole and made it even more August-appropriate. In place of starchy hominy, I used fresh corn, both kernels to mix into the broth and rounds to pick up and gnaw.Before I added the corn, though, I grilled it to add a caramelized, smoky character to the dish. Mr. Salazar\u2019s recipe had me charring the chiles and tomatillos before pur\u00e9eing them, so the grill was already hot. (You can also do these steps in a broiler as long as you or your air-conditioner can handle the kitchen heat.)At Mita\u2019s, Mr. Salazar uses a combination of seafood: fish, squid, lobster and shrimp. But you can choose one or two varieties. Just take note of timing, adding quicker-cooking ingredients (thin fish fillets, squid ringlets) after any thick pieces of fish or shrimp, so everything is ready at the same time.In any pozole, the garnishes are as important as the dish itself, and that holds true for inauthentic, pozole-inspired stews like this one. You don\u2019t need to use all of the garnishes, but try to include the avocado for creaminess, along with one crunchy vegetable like cabbage or sliced radish for a contrasting texture.When winter comes, you can replace the fresh corn with hominy to make a more substantial, warming dish. The seafood will welcome it with open tentacles. An earlier version of this article omitted the given name of the chef at Mita's Restaurant and Bar in Cincinnati. He is Jose Salazar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ronaldo Joins Juventus, and Everybody Wins", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "On SoccerCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s arrival at Juventus could be a commercial, financial and structural victory for Italy\u2019s Serie A. The whole world is watching.Supported byFLORENCE, Italy \u2014 As soon as the final parking space is taken on Saturday afternoon, long before kickoff, the roads around Verona\u2019s Stadio Bentegodi will go into lockdown.Crack counterterrorism units \u2014 as well as Italy\u2019s regular police and the carabinieri (military police) \u2014 will patrol the streets near the stadium. It is an unprecedented security measure for a city whose two soccer teams, Hellas and Chievo, tend to labor in quiet mediocrity.These, though, are unusual times. Verona\u2019s authorities are expecting some 30,000 fans to descend on the Bentegodi, a brisk 30-minute walk from the city\u2019s historic heart. No chances are being taken for an event that, according to Angelo Sidoti, Verona\u2019s vice prefect, \u201chas assumed a worldwide significance.\u201dIt feels like an age since Serie A saw itself in that light. For almost two decades, Italy\u2019s top division has had an air of faded grandeur, of inescapable decline. Its reputation has been tarnished by corruption and its image damaged by empty, crumbling stadiums.Serie A has seemed a league cowed by the memory of what it used to be, unable to live up to the gilded ghosts of its past. Suddenly, now, it feels like the center of the universe again, as though it will not just be the 30,000 at the Bentegodi this Saturday, but the whole world, who will be watching as Chievo take on Juventus, who will arrive with the man who has changed everything: Cristiano Ronaldo.This spring, when Juventus\u2019s directors agreed to commit some $387 million to signing Ronaldo, the reigning world player of the year \u2014 a $133 million transfer fee for Real Madrid and, roughly, $254 million in salary and taxes over the next four seasons \u2014 they did not do so to boost Serie A\u2019s self-esteem.They did so, partly, because the 33-year-old Ronaldo represented the club\u2019s best chance of ending its long, agonizing wait to win a third Champions League title. Juventus has lost two of the last four finals, to Barcelona in 2015 and to Real Madrid, and Ronaldo, in 2017. Despite seven straight Serie A titles under his stewardship, to Andrea Agnelli, Juventus\u2019s president, going one step further in Europe now ranks as somewhere between a mission and an obsession.This summer, the club jettisoned its longstanding policy of slow, steady growth in favor of immediate success: Agnelli brought Leonardo Bonucci, the Italy defender, back to Turin after a season at A.C. Milan and, more important, worked with Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo\u2019s agent, to complete what has been called il colpo del secolo: the deal of the century. Ronaldo has won three Champions Leagues in a row, and five over all. He is the competition\u2019s all-time leading scorer. If anyone can deliver European domination, he can.At Ronaldo\u2019s age, though, even Juventus might have balked at the cost of the move \u2014 and in particular that four-year contract; by the time it ends, Ronaldo will be 37 \u2014 if it was not for the commercial, and financial, benefits a player of his unique profile can bring to his club.That started to manifest even before the deal had been announced: Juventus\u2019s share price soared with the first whispers that a move might be imminent. Though reports that Juventus has sold 500,000 jerseys in the six weeks since his arrival are incorrect \u2014 that would be \u201cimpossible,\u201d according to one club executive \u2014 it already has sold more jerseys this summer than it did in the whole of last season. The club has sold 29,300 season tickets, too, despite substantial price increases from last year.If anything, though, the impact on social media has been more impressive. Ronaldo has almost 335 million followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram; as Juventus had hoped, a fraction of those have migrated to the club\u2019s accounts with its new signing. The club added four million new followers on Instagram in the weeks since Ronaldo signed, and an extra two million likes on Facebook (curiously, there has been a much less dramatic uptick on Twitter: only another 150,000 followers). Juventus had more YouTube views than any soccer club in the world in July. All of that has a real impact; all of it can be tangibly monetized, by selling access to those accounts to sponsors.According to a report by the accountancy firm KPMG, the club can expect an increase of some \u20ac75 to \u20ac100 million (up to $114 million) in commercial revenue over the first three years of Ronaldo\u2019s contract, thanks largely to increased opportunities in Asia, where Ronaldo\u2019s brand is considerably more appealing than the club\u2019s.Juventus\u2019s rivals, on the surface, should dread that economic impact. This is a club, after all, that has already outstripped all of its domestic opponents on and off the field, a team that is so secure in its domestic primacy that it can afford to focus almost exclusively on European success.Bolstered by the most eye-catching signing by an Italian team since Inter Milan signed the Brazilian Ronaldo in 1998, Juventus should cement its grip on Serie A. After the most enthralling title race in years last season, it is hard to envisage a sustained challenge over the coming months. As Lazio\u2019s Ciro Immobile, the league\u2019s leading scorer last season, put it: \u201cIt\u2019s lucky I topped the scoring charts in time.\u201dThat, though, is not how most of Italy sees it. \u201cIt adds more salt and pepper,\u201d said Aurelio De Laurentiis, the president of Napoli, the team that finished a close second to Juventus last season. James Pallotta, the owner of Roma, has described Ronaldo\u2019s arrival as \u201cpositive for Serie A;\u201d he insisted that he did not see it as something negative for his club, a putative challenger, at all.There is a pride, of course, almost a validation, in having the reigning world player of the year choose Serie A. Not since 1995, when Hristo Stoitchkov left Barcelona for Parma, has the holder of the Ballon D\u2019Or moved to Italy. And there is a hope, too, that Ronaldo\u2019s decision might prove a harbinger of a return to a halcyon age.\u201cHe gives a luster to the whole championship,\u201d said Gianpiero Gasperini, the manager of Atalanta. \u201cA return to the past, when great players arrived.\u201d Luciano Spalletti, Gasperini\u2019s counterpart at Inter Milan, suggested the signing gave Serie A \u201cthe air of great soccer.\u201dBut the excitement is not only rooted in nostalgia and yearning, in intangible emotion and rootless hope: there is a sense of economic opportunity, too. As Christoph Winterling, the commercial and marketing director at Bologna, said, for Serie A, \u201cRonaldo is a game-changer.\u201dIt is the more lasting effect, however, that could be more significant. As Winterling put it, the mere presence of Ronaldo \u201clends trust\u201d to Serie A: from fans who assume that if it is worth Ronaldo\u2019s time, it is worth theirs, and from players who are more likely to be tempted to Italy if they know a player of his magnitude is there. \u201cIt is a chance to rebuild our credit on an international level,\u201d said Stefano Campoccia, the vice president of Udinese.If that sounds like an intangible, unquantifiable gauge, it is not: it can have a direct financial impact on Italian soccer\u2019s health.Though Serie A sold its domestic television rights for the next three years before Ronaldo\u2019s move was announced \u2014 \u201cIt was agreed a week before the news,\u201d said Campoccia, a little mournfully \u2014 a clause in the contract dictates that the league\u2019s 20 clubs could earn an extra \u20ac150 million a year (about $170 million) if Sky Italia, its principal broadcaster, attracts a set amount of new subscribers.Internationally, Ronaldo is likely to be even more important. Serie A hopes to attract a title sponsor for its overseas rights in the coming months; his brand is powerful enough to help.In August, meanwhile, ESPN agreed to air more than 300 Serie A games this season in the United States, starting with Juventus at Chievo tomorrow, an occasion the network has been hyping across its channels for weeks. It was a major strategic victory for the league. \u201cIt was a crucial part of the plan that we found a broadcast partner that had the reach to increase the fan base,\u201d said Campoccia, his club\u2019s television rights specialist.The aim by 2021, when the next set of rights tenders come to market, is to have a \u201cproduct that is much more internationally appetizing,\u201d according to Campoccia. A league-specific channel is already under discussion (Juventus, this summer, launched its own worldwide streaming service).Featuring Ronaldo goes a long way to fulfilling that ambition, of course, but the rest of the league has a role to play, too. \u201cWe expect a rise in the technical level, as clubs commit greater investments than those of other leagues,\u201d Campoccia said. This summer has been encouraging in that sense: A.C. Milan now boasts Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, the Argentina striker made available by Juventus in a bid to reduce its salary bill, as a direct consequence of Ronaldo\u2019s arrival; Inter had hoped to tempt Luka Modric, another of Real\u2019s crown jewels, to Italy in an attempt to keep pace.\u201cThat market activity helps raise the level not just in Serie A, but improve our performances in Europe,\u201d Winterling said. \u201cThat helps with future television deals, but the other major advantage is that Italy is open to international investors: better performances increases the league\u2019s attractiveness.\u201dThere are several already \u2014 Bologna, like Roma and Milan, is in American hands; Inter and Parma are backed by Chinese owners \u2014 but Winterling believes more will come, a modernizing force for a league mired for too long in stasis. \u201cInternational investors would bring a different mentality, more professionalism,\u201d he said.Nobody is under any illusion that Ronaldo is a panacea for all of Italian soccer\u2019s ills. Winterling highlights the \u201clack of infrastructure,\u201d and the absence of a professional management structure overseeing Serie A. Campoccia, too, suggested that \u201cthere must be efficient renovation of our stadiums in the next three years, to make the league attractive audio-visually.\u201dWhat Ronaldo may be is a spur to kick-start \u2014 at last \u2014 all those changes that have been so necessary for so long. Fresh investment, and fresh ideas, may follow in his wake, helping to close the gap with England\u2019s Premier League, to recapture a little of Serie A\u2019s golden age. Even Ronaldo cannot restore an entire league\u2019s prestige all by himself. He could, though, be the start of something, the man to make Serie A feel as if it has a worldwide significance once again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Full-Spectrum Corruption of Donald Trump", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryone and everything he touches rots.Mr. Wehner served in the previous three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.There\u2019s never been any confusion about the character defects of Donald Trump. The question has always been just how far he would go and whether other individuals and institutions would stand up to him or become complicit in his corruption. For decades, Republicans, and especially conservative Republicans, insisted that character counted in public life. They were particularly vocal about this during the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal, arguing against \u201ccompartmentalization\u201d \u2014 by which they meant overlooking moral turpitude in the Oval Office because you agree with the president\u2019s policy agenda or because the economy is strong. Senator Lindsey Graham, then in the House, went so far as to argue that \u201cimpeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.\u201dIt is a stunning turnabout. A party that once spoke with urgency and apparent conviction about the importance of ethical leadership \u2014 fidelity, honesty, honor, decency, good manners, setting a good example \u2014 has hitched its wagon to the most thoroughly and comprehensively corrupt individual who has ever been elected president. Some of the men who have been elected president have been unscrupulous in certain areas \u2014 infidelity, lying, dirty tricks, financial misdeeds \u2014 but we\u2019ve never before had the full-spectrum corruption we see in the life of Donald Trump. For many Republicans, this reality still hasn\u2019t broken through. But facts that don\u2019t penetrate the walls of an ideological silo are facts nonetheless. And the moral indictment against Mr. Trump is obvious and overwhelming. Corruption has been evident in Mr. Trump\u2019s private and public life, in how he has treated his wives, in his business dealings and scams, in his pathological lying and cruelty, in his bullying and shamelessness, in his conspiracy-mongering and appeals to the darkest impulses of Americans. (Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, refers to the president\u2019s race-based comments as a \u201cbase stimulator.\u201d) Mr. Trump\u2019s corruptions are ingrained, the result of a lifetime of habits. It was delusional to think he would change for the better once he became president. Some of us who have been lifelong Republicans and previously served in Republican administrations held out a faint hope that our party would at some point say \u201cEnough!\u201d; that there would be some line Mr. Trump would cross, some boundary he would transgress, some norm he would shatter, some civic guardrail he would uproot, some action he would take, some scheme or scandal he would be involved in that would cause large numbers of Republicans to break with the president. No such luck. Mr. Trump\u2019s corruptions have therefore become theirs. So far there\u2019s been no bottom, and there may never be. It\u2019s quite possible this should have been obvious to me much sooner than it was, that I was blinded to certain realities I should have recognized. In any case, the Republican Party\u2019s as-yet unbreakable attachment to Mr. Trump is coming at quite a cost. There is the rank hypocrisy, the squandered ability to venerate public character or criticize Democrats who lack it, and the damage to the white Evangelical movement, which has for the most part enthusiastically rallied to Mr. Trump and as a result has been largely discredited. There is also likely to be an electoral price to pay in November. But the greatest damage is being done to our civic culture and our politics. Mr. Trump and the Republican Party are right now the chief emblem of corruption and cynicism in American political life, of an ethic of might makes right. Dehumanizing others is fashionable and truth is relative. (\u201cTruth isn\u2019t truth,\u201d in the infamous words of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.) They are stripping politics of its high purpose and nobility.That\u2019s not all politics is; self-interest is always a factor. But if politics is only about power unbounded by morality \u2014 if it\u2019s simply about rulers governing by the law of the jungle, about a prince acting like a beast, in the words of Machiavelli \u2014 then the whole enterprise will collapse. We have to distinguish between imperfect leaders and corrupt ones, and we need the vocabulary to do so. A warning to my Republican friends: The worst is yet to come. Thanks to the work of Robert Mueller \u2014 a distinguished public servant, not the leader of a \u201cgroup of Angry Democrat Thugs\u201d \u2014 we are going to discover deeper and deeper layers to Mr. Trump\u2019s corruption. When we do, I expect Mr. Trump will unravel further as he feels more cornered, more desperate, more enraged; his behavior will become ever more erratic, disordered and crazed.Most Republicans, having thrown their MAGA hats over the Trump wall, will stay with him until the end. Was a tax cut, deregulation and court appointments really worth all this? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Cute, but This Cat Probably Wasn\u2019t Feeding Its Toy Kittens", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesFeline behaviorists offered explanations for a viral tweet that captured a cat\u2019s tendency to bring stuffed toys to its food bowl.It seemed like he was feeding them. But he also regularly eats their faces. Was he really trying to feed his toy babies? Was he stowing away treasure? Did Sherlock think he was the leader of some kind of secret cat society? It\u2019s easy to project our human thoughts and feelings onto a cat and its behavior, but something else might be going on.\u201cCats have their own agendas. We\u2019re just not privy to it all the time,\u201d said Ms. Johnson in an interview. \u201cWe kind of marveled at it. What has Sherlock been doing all night?\u201d Sherlock is a seven-year-old purebred Siamese cat who lives with no other pets. He has done this collecting thing since he was a kitten, when he first received and became obsessed with these stuffed, orange toy cats. Cat behaviorists agree Sherlock\u2019s shenanigans are common cat behaviors, but they disagree about the motivation.The cat hunts the toy prey around the house and brings it back to the nest or feeding area, like an instinct. In the wild, this would prevent competition from finding the prey first. That the toys are first scattered throughout the house may also trigger the cat\u2019s seeking circuits in the brain and related \u201cfeel good chemicals,\u201d she said.Many cats do this \u2014 with socks or toy mice, whatever they prefer \u2014 and some will even dunk the toys in water, as if to drown or immobilize them. \u201cIt\u2019s all about survival,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last thing a cat would do is bring in another cat to eat their food.\u201dBut she hedges a little. Because domestic cats are in a strange environment, natural instincts can manifest in odd ways. And she added that to test the behavior, Ms. Johnson\u2019s family could try putting the toys outside or in one basket, mixing up the types of toys or satisfying the cat\u2019s prey drive before bedtime with food or a wand toy. Cats like attention \u2014 praise or scolding. After the first time Sherlock gathered toys and ate their faces, he likely received attention, which he found rewarding. This led him to repeat the behavior in order to get that reward. And just like humans get addicted to slot machines that randomly dish out money, if the cat was rewarded with attention only some of the time, the behavior probably only strengthened. If it ever became problematic, Ms. Johnson\u2019s parents could try ignoring Sherlock. But they\u2019d have to be consistent. Ms. Nagelschneider doesn\u2019t entirely agree: This cat was predator, she said, since it was a kitten and did not need owners or other cats to train it to hunt, because the drive evolved over millions of years. In a calm environment with the right prey, \u201cit\u2019s almost like this switch flips, and there\u2019s something in their eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can\u2019t help it.\u201d Then again, prey drive can\u2019t explain all strange behaviors, and Siamese are \u201cthe aliens of the cat world,\u201d she said, quite demonstrative and unusual in contrast to other felines. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them, there could be some odd thing going through their head.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mardini overuses the kinds of short, staccato sentences found in advertising. She frequently omits specific dates or locations that might anchor the chronology, and sometimes misses opportunities to pull back and give us a bigger picture. The final chapters focusing on her discomfort with media messaging and her experience of fame could be condensed into an epilogue or skipped altogether.

Instead, the driving narrative is a story about the heroism of white Americans.In the first chapter, Al Samawi, who was trapped in his apartment when war exploded just outside his door, deftly catches newcomers up on the conflict, but then suddenly pivots to a Facebook exchange. The effect is a little jarring, and it\u2019s not the only time the reader will feel disoriented. Throughout the first several chapters, we wade through a convoluted account of defining moments in Al Samawi\u2019s childhood but learn precious little about Yemeni life and society.The story really begins when Al Samawi reads the Bible for the first time at the urging of an English-language teacher. We see how he begins, on his own, to be a critical thinker, eventually attending an interfaith conference and encountering Jewish Israelis and Americans.Finally, we reach the action-packed center of his story, his entrapment and eventual rescue from Aden, a port city in the south, where he\u2019s fled after receiving death threats, presumably for his engagement with Jews and Americans. At this point, we are suddenly in a completely different book, a gripping account of terror and escape that plays out over a few weeks.The book asks us to tacitly accept unexplored descriptions of anti-American and anti-Semitic sloganeering without understanding when and how the country\u2019s education system collapsed as it did, and to blindly applaud interfaith encounters as a viable path to peace. And we end up learning more about Al Samawi\u2019s work from the glowing letters his American friends write about him than from the pages he\u2019s written himself. Nonetheless, he comes across as a sensitive, curious, openhearted man \u2014 and meeting such a person from a country as far off the American public\u2019s radar as Yemen is valuable in itself.\u201cHara Hotel\u201d stands out as an example of how not to write about the refugee experience in southern Europe or about the Syrian civil war and its consequences. Thornhill, a British barrister, decided to visit Greece for just two weeks to produce the initial reporting for the book. She later returned \u2014 for nine days. Her limited engagement with her subjects and subject matter is evident throughout.Thornhill\u2019s book is an often self-involved account of a Westerner\u2019s transient and shallow stroll among people whose lives and histories she fails to grasp. It is a textbook example of \u201cparachuting in,\u201d a practice that has been harshly criticized even when undertaken by seasoned journalists. From the first pages, the contrast with the previous books is stark. Mardini\u2019s memoir opens as she is in the Mediterranean Sea, trying to keep herself and her fellow refugees alive and afloat, and Al Samawi\u2019s opens with him trapped in his apartment, as his food and water supplies are dwindling to nothing, bombs are collapsing buildings along his block and Qaeda militants are executing other northern Yemenis on the street below. Thornhill\u2019s book, on the other hand, opens as she\u2019s watching the news.Thornhill has written two other books, and her prose is clean and attractive. But her lack of journalistic experience is immediately evident: She centers the story on her own feelings and observations rather than on reportage, eliding and omitting certain crucial historic events.From the start, Thornhill takes up the limited attention and resources of thinly stretched volunteers, not because she is assisting in their efforts, but because she wants to get the story (which is not even theirs but the refugees\u2019). She goes on to complain about the hardship of staying in a dilapidated motel after spending a day in a refugee tent city and makes vaguely salacious references to the beauty of young Kurdish men. The book does improve when Thornhill tells the story of a man she meets in the camp, but it\u2019s too late. By then the damage has been done.Kavitha Rajagopalan is the author of \u201cMuslims of Metropolis: The Stories of Three Immigrant Families in the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Bordoff is an author of the 2017 study \u201cCan Coal Make a Comeback?\u201d for the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. It has been a bad month for the fight against climate change. Amid heat waves, wildfires, droughts and Arctic ice melt, President Trump has taken aim at the two central pillars of his predecessor\u2019s ambitious efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. After proposing in early August to freeze a scheduled increase in fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, the Trump administration on Tuesday said it would seek to significantly weaken the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. So why does this proposed rollback of power sector climate regulations matter if it won\u2019t change the carbon emissions trajectory much? First, firm policy direction from the government provides investors and utilities with certainty about the investment outlook and ensures emissions reductions even if the market shifts. Just as few predicted the collapse in natural gas prices a decade ago, there is a wide range of uncertainty about what energy prices will look like in the future. Second, the right way to assess whether a policy makes sense is not just to look at its emissions impacts but also to compare its costs with its benefits. Even by the current E.P.A.\u2019s own analysis, which makes assumptions that play down the climate benefits and increase the implementation costs, the Clean Power Plan delivered far more net benefits for the American people than the proposed replacement. That is because reducing coal use in the power sector not only delivers carbon emission reductions but also lower levels of local pollutants like particulate matter.The damage done by the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policies is less a sharp rise in carbon emissions than it is the loss of American leadership and missed opportunity to save future generations from climate change\u2019s severe impacts.

{"Headline": "Boy\u2019s Lemonade Stand, Shut Down for Lack of Permit, Reopens With Fanfare", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBALLSTON SPA, N.Y. \u2014 When a 7-year-old boy\u2019s lemonade stand was shut down by a health inspector here last month, it became the talk of the town. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo weighed in. A New York State senator introduced legislation in the boy\u2019s name, and the roadside drink entrepreneur\u2019s photo was splashed across newspapers around the country.But, at the end of the day, Brendan Mulvaney just wanted to sell lemonade. So, on Saturday, Brendan and his family reopened the lemonade stand for one more day. Instead of raising money for a trip to Disney, as Brendan had planned to do the first time around, he and his family sought to capitalize on his newfound fame to raise money for a local family in need.Last month, Brendan set up his lemonade stand on the side porch of his house, just as he had done for the past two years during the Saratoga County Fair. This year, Brendan hung new signs, printed by a family friend, and with the help of his parents, added water and snow cones to the stand\u2019s menu.But an inspector with the state Department of Health soon told the Mulvaneys that they needed a permit because their venture was similar to those of permitted vendors at the fair, said Jill Montag, a health department spokeswoman. (Ms. Montag said at least four vendors inquired about the Mulvaney family\u2019s stand.)So Brendan\u2019s lemonade stand closed.But after Brendan\u2019s dad, Sean Mulvaney, posted on Facebook about the interaction with the health inspector, the news spread quickly, leading Mr. Cuomo to issue a statement that he would personally pay the fee for any necessary permit.The Department of Health later clarified that Brendan would not need a permit if he wanted to sell only lemonade. \u201cThe Department will continue to use its discretion to not enforce regulations on children\u2019s lemonade stands that are limited to lemonade or a similar beverage,\u201d Ms. Montag said in a statement.So on Saturday, Brendan\u2019s lemonade stand was back in business. Coinciding with the World\u2019s Largest Yard Sale at the Saratoga County Fairgrounds, Brendan raised $946 for Maddy Moore, a 12-year-old battling Blount\u2019s Disease, a growth disorder affecting bones in her lower leg. Maddy is scheduled to have surgery on Wednesday and the funds will help the family cover transportation costs to Shriners Hospitals for Children in Springfield, Mass.By noon, as elected officials and media outlets descended on the Mulvaney\u2019s porch, Mr. Mulvaney said he was worried the attention was distracting from the ultimate goal. \u201cIt\u2019s all great and dandy,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cMy son\u2019s loving it. But now we just got to get back to selling lemonade and try to raise as much money for Maddy.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s an example of a young kid who is doing something that is quintessentially American,\u201d Ms. Stefanik said.State Senator James Tedisco introduced \u201cBrendan\u2019s Lemon-Aid Law,\u201d which would exempt people under the age of 16 who have lemonade stands from the health department\u2019s permit requirements.\u201cWhen I was kid, probably half the people here had lemonade stands in front of their homes,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody ever complained. Nobody ever got sick or died from the lemonade stand. It taught kids entrepreneurial skills, interpersonal relationships, how to maybe raise some money.\u201dAdopting the political slogan of the moment, Mr. Tedisco, a Republican who represents Ballston Spa, N.Y., quipped, \u201cWe want to make lemonade stands great again.\u201dThe mayor of Ballston Spa also visited and presented Brendan with a key to the city.The buzz around Brendan\u2019s stand achieved the goal the Mulvaneys had hoped for: customers.Wendy Sarbo, who lives in Berne, N.Y., roughly 40 miles from the Mulvaneys, bought two waters from Brendan and donated an extra $3 to the cause. She had planned to attend to World\u2019s Largest Yard Sale, but heard about Brendan\u2019s stand on the news and said its proximity to the grounds was an added bonus.\u201cEverybody should stop by to support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good cause.\u201dAs for next year, Brendan plans to resume operations for a fourth year. But, next time, he will return to a simple menu. Just lemonade.\u201cIt\u2019s important to people to have something that is delicious,\u201d Brendan said.Advertisement"}

Before photo by Davide Papalini; After photo by Reuters.The highway bridge fell by as much as 148 feet just before noon, taking about three dozen cars and three trucks with it, according to Angelo Borrelli, chief of the Civil Protection Department.Giuseppe Conte, who took over as prime minister in June, traveled to the scene of the disaster. The office of the city\u2019s public prosecutor said it would open a criminal inquiry, examining whether the collapse was because of negligence, and federal authorities indicated that they, too, would investigate.Mr. Conte\u2019s deputy prime minister and interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who is a powerful populist skeptic of the European Union, said that the bloc\u2019s budget rules might have to be lifted so Italy could overhaul its infrastructure. \u201cWhen they tell us that we can\u2019t spend our money because some E.U. constraints don\u2019t permit it, I wonder whether these constraints make any sense,\u201d he said.Danilo Toninelli, the transportation minister, said the government had ordered a comprehensive safety review of Italy\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 including viaducts and bridges built in the 1950s and 1960s during the country\u2019s postwar boom. Much of the infrastructure, he warned, was showing signs of age. \u201cThis is what Italy needs to do, now,\u201d he said.In a phone interview, Antonio Occhiuzzi, director of the Institute for Construction Technology for Italy\u2019s National Research Council, said that most of the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u201cneeds to be carefully re-examined\u201d because much \u201cwas at the end\u201d of its useful life span. He added, \u201cIn some cases it can be reinforced, in other cases it will have to be demolished and rebuilt completely.\u201dMr. Occhiuzzi said that civil and structural engineering projects in Italy were complicated by a national patrimony that dates to antiquity. \u201cOur position, typically, is to try and conserve rather than demolish and rebuild, as happens in other countries,\u201d he said.The collapse of the Genoese bridge was a serious alarm, he said, \u201cbecause it is not an isolated case \u2014 in the last three years, a number of bridges have collapsed in Italy, and they are all around 50 years old.\u201dFrancesco Faccini, a lecturer at the University of Genoa and an expert on floods and landslides, said \u201csignificant urbanization\u201d of the city\u2019s flood plains along with, at times, irrational urbanization, led to channels being narrowed and streams diverted. The result, he said, was a situation where flooding became more common, especially as the intensity of downpours has grown in recent years.In the Sampierdarena neighborhood under the fallen bridge, gas and electricity were shut off as workers scrambled to check on the security of buildings. The electricity was later restored.Giovanna Santacroce, a 25-year-old ice cream vendor who lives a few hundred yards from the bridge, said she heard what sounded like thunder. \u201cThen the light went off for a second and I peeked out of the window and couldn\u2019t see the bridge anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the street people were crying, debris was everywhere. They ordered us to leave the house, and we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be able to return.\u201dPietro Marzullo, a 31-year-old elder care attendant who was driving in the area when the disaster occurred, said he helped a woman in shock get away moments later. \u201cSmall concrete blocks were scattered everywhere, rolling down the street and around us,\u201d he said.The national police noted that there was a \u201cviolent cloudburst\u201d about the time the section fell, and some witnesses said the bridge was struck by lightning just before it collapsed, though it was not clear whether the storm contributed to the failure.Mr. Rixi said the entire bridge would be demolished, \u201cwith serious repercussions on traffic, and problems for citizens and companies.\u201dSurvivors marveled that the toll was not higher.One motorist, Corrado Cusano, told the Italian channel Rai News that he had just driven across the bridge when \u201cI turned around and saw the bridge collapsing.\u201d\u201cWe were stuck in traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a long line of cars, and I only saw the bridge collapsing behind me and then I couldn\u2019t see any cars anymore.\u201dA stretch of the road, estimated by some witnesses to be more than 300 feet long, fell to earth in a huge dust cloud. Remarkably, some people driving on the bridge walked away unharmed.Cars and trucks were abandoned on the road, just short of the new chasm; their occupants had fled on foot.Firefighters with rescue baskets were hoisted by cranes onto the piled wreckage to pull people from the rubble. Others loaded the injured into paramedic helicopters, or picked their way across the mounds of debris with dogs trained to sniff and listen for people.\u201cI drive on that bridge four times a day and I know that they do maintenance work on that bridge every single night,\u201d said Edoardo Serra, a pharmacist in Genoa who was to return to the city center an hour after the bridge collapsed. \u201cThey normally closed one direction to traffic and allowed double circulation on the other.\u201d\u201cIt was a bold structure, designed for a volume of traffic that was much lower than it is today,\u201d said Diego Zoppi, a Genoese architect. The bridge, he said, required constant maintenance because it was an essential traffic hub for the city, connecting Genoa\u2019s eastern and western suburbs with highways to major cities in the north, like Milan.Mr. Morandi designed several major bridges using similar designs and materials, primarily in Italy but also in Libya, Colombia, Ecuador and elsewhere.Autostrade per l\u2019Italia and Atlantia did not respond to emails requesting comment, and their media offices were closed on Tuesday. Atlantia shares fell by 5.39 percent on the Milan stock market on Tuesday.Autostrade\u2019s director for the area of Genoa, Stefano Marigliani, told the Italian news agency ANSA that the collapse of the bridge \u201cwas unexpected and sudden with respect to the monitoring that the bridge was subject to.\u201d\u201cThere was no forewarning,\u201d he said.The bridge carried the A10 highway \u2014 a major east-west artery through the port city that extends west along the coastline to the border with France \u2014 across the Polcevera River. It was one of two just major highway bridges that span that waterway, in the western part of the city, and officials warned that the loss of the crossing could significantly affect the movement of people and goods.The impact of the collapse \u201cwill be devastating for the local economy,\u201d and the city would be paralyzed for years, said Enrico Musso, an economics professor at the University of Genoa, and a center-right politician. A long contested project to build a new highway had only recently been approved after years of fierce debate, in part because of concerns about the Morandi Bridge had intensified. \u201cWe knew it was not eternal,\u201d Mr. Musso said.As night fell, the only audible sound was that of rescue workers drilling through the concrete blocks to look for more vehicles buried under the rubble, illuminated by large rescue lights.Gaia Pianigiani reported from Genoa, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a from London.

{"Headline": "Dry American Rieslings Never Tasted So Sweet", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolWith riesling, the line between dry and not-dry can be awfully fine.This was the leading takeaway from the last month of drinking American rieslings. I had recommended three bottles, as I do each month in Wine School, and I had presumed that they would all be dry. And so I learned some of the pitfalls of relying on faulty memory, in one case, and of drawing an inference from a producer\u2019s website in another.The wine seemed dry when I first tasted it. But then I paired it with a meal: pork chops topped with a sauce of cooked fresh tomatoes and a little garlic, with saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions on the side. With the meal, the wine seemed unexpectedly bright at first, and then a bit sweet.Was it the food? Cooked ripe tomatoes can seem sweet. Caramelized onions do for sure. The dish seemed to enhance the sweetness of the Teutonic (which was already apparent in the tasting), but it did not make the Ravines taste sweet. What was it about the Tatomer?These are the sort of questions that we wrestle with happily at Wine School. Not that languid summer meals need concern themselves with wine riddles. But when the interest is piqued, we can\u2019t help but go with it.What does it mean to call any wine dry or sweet? Common sense would tell us that a wine would be considered dry if yeast during fermentation consumed all the sugar in the grape juice, converting it to alcohol and carbon dioxide as a byproduct. But what is common sense to wine?In fact, a small amount of residual sugar often remains in wine naturally, even when the yeast are permitted to gobble up all they can. That bit of sugar can affect the wine differently depending on a host of other factors, like the level of acidity in the wine as well as the alcohol content.Producers sometimes provide technical details of their wines, including grams of residual sugar per liter, or total acidity per liter, but these numbers can be difficult to interpret. In general, a wine is considered dry if it has less than four grams of residual sugar per liter, but that technical definition may not convey how the wine will actually be experienced.Like unruly children, good wine refuses to conform to strict definitions of behavior. Bottles with quite a bit of residual sugar can taste dry, while others with less residual sugar may leave the impression of sweetness.Rieslings and chenin blancs are among the few white grapes versatile enough to make captivating dry wines and luscious sweet wines. Why? Because these grapes come with ample supplies of natural acidity, which allows even the sweetest wines to be refreshing rather than cloying.Vouvray traditionally labels its wines sec, or dry, and demi-sec, or moderately sweet. Both styles are wonderful. But sometimes wines labeled sec can be noticeably sweet (\u201ctendre\u201d in the local parlance). Balanced, yes, but unexpected.In humid years, grapes with botrytis are sometimes included in dry white wines like Burgundy, for example, or Wachau riesling, adding richness, flavors like beeswax and a slight perception of sweetness. Mr. Tatomer does use a percentage of grapes with botrytis in his Vandenberg riesling cuv\u00e9e. I wondered if the Kick-on might have been made with similarly afflicted grapes.Mr. Tatomer told me by email that the grapes in the 2016 Kick-on had a minimal amount of botrytis, but that the wine had 7.73 grams of residual sugar per liter, which would technically make it \u201coff dry,\u201d to use Teutonic\u2019s term.\u201cThis is the highest it has ever been, but not by much,\u201d he said. \u201cI aim for the wine to have between five and seven grams.\u201dFor the record, I loved all three wines, and the way they each expressed a different style of riesling. Year after year, I find the Ravines to be an excellent representative of the cool-climate, dry style of the Finger Lakes. It smelled like flowers and pebbles, and it had a wonderful texture.The Teutonic was a fine Willamette Valley representation of a German kabinett-style riesling, moderately sweet and very refreshing, with a wet-rock minerality. It was richer, however, than the sheer, delicate wines you might find from the Mosel region of Germany.The Tatomer continues to mystify. Even if it did not go particularly well with my dinner, I could not stop drinking it. With a different dish, it might have tasted as dry as it did with no food. Alone, it had richness, acidity and a saline flavor that balanced out any hint of sweetness. That changed with food.\u201cSometimes I am really perplexed by which foods this wine pairs with or against,\u201d Mr. Tatomer said.Readers may have had difficulty finding the wines I suggested, but they had plenty of their own ideas. Among other regions, readers suggested rieslings from Idaho, Texas, Washington State, Michigan, Ohio and the North Fork of Long Island.Having had rieslings from Michigan, I know how good they can be. I take all these suggestions as a sign that people are embracing their local wines, which is a great thing. I just wish some of the wines were more widely distributed.I understand the appeal of sweet rieslings, but why restrict ourselves? Dry rieslings can be mind-blowingly good.Oddly, on my first sip I had noted a \u201cmuskiness\u201d to the aftertaste, but it never recurred. I\u2019m not sure what to make of it.This was the fourth time we tasted rieslings, including dry wines from Germany and Austria, and moderately sweet German sp\u00e4tleses. But it was the first time we have had both dry and sweet at the same time. It was not my intention, and I will take responsibility. But I would like to implore producers to be clearer in their labeling.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The White Strategy", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump\u2019s winning coalition and its weaknesses.Opinion ColumnistIn other words, both conventional polling and conventional wisdom underestimated the potential for white turnout generally and working-class white turnout specifically \u2014 and that\u2019s why Trump\u2019s strategy was able to carry him to victory.The numbers offer a cautionary tale for both emerging-Democratic-majority inevitabilists and for a left whose increasing vehemence about the wickedness of \u201cwhiteness\u201d probably encourages the white tribalism that Trump rallied and exploited.But on the other hand the numbers are not exactly a sweeping political vindication for Trump\u2019s strategy, let alone of alt-right theories of what conservatism should become. After all, though Trump outperformed pundit expectations, he did not carry a majority, and his Midwestern electoral victory was wide but dangerously shallow. And if he won many of Trende\u2019s missing whites, he also lost other (female, educated) whites whom past Republicans had won. Those losses point to the likely limits on racial polarization as a Republican strategy. Turning out disaffected whites is more politically effective than most people imagined after 2012, but white voters are ultimately too divided to make a \u201cwhite strategy\u201d work as a foundation for a real governing majority.So even with a slower immigration rate, a slower pace of demographic change, the Republican Party would still need either some of the white voters Trump alienated or some of the minority votes he didn\u2019t really try to win \u2014 and neither can be delivered by the white strategy alone.Fortunately for the G.O.P. there is an obvious and morally superior alternative, which is to return to Trende\u2019s original insight, recognize that Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric as well as his race-baiting helped win the white Midwest, and instead of a white strategy pursue a populist strategy shorn of white-identity appeals. Keep the infrastructure promises and drop the birther forays; pursue E-Verify but forgo the child-separating cruelties; be tough on China but stop vilifying black athletes; embrace nationalism but stiff-arm Confederate nostalgia.But just because this alternative is obvious doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s operable. Some Republicans really welcome racial polarization; others, a larger group, are hoping to simply return to the ideological comforts of zombie-Reaganism once Trump has vanished from the scene. Meanwhile Trump himself seems mostly content to fight from within the redoubt the white strategy built for him rather than expand it.Which is why the surprising success of his 2016 strategy is on track to give way to something more predictable this fall: A white-as-Moby-Dick Republican Party whose very whiteness ensures that it will lose the next battle in the great white civil war.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yes, There\u2019s Hope for Health Care Reform ", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bipartisan consensus is focused on reducing the system\u2019s chronic waste and inefficiency. Mr. Chen is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and the director of domestic policy studies in the public policy program at Stanford University. Mr. Capretta is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. The political divide over the insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act looks to be unbridgeable for now, but out of public view, Republicans and Democrats are quietly forging a consensus on an even more consequential aspect of medical care: improving its value for all Americans by increasing its quality and lowering its cost.President Trump\u2019s health secretary, Alex Azar, is fully committed to building upon the agenda he inherited from the Obama administration and accelerating its progress by injecting even stronger incentives for improvement. The existing Obama-era initiatives point in the right direction, but so far, they haven\u2019t delivered enough quantifiable improvement to be considered successful. Mr. Azar can step up the pace of progress by injecting more competition and market incentives into two of the initiatives he inherited.Accountable care organization plans were introduced to encourage hospitals, doctors and others to better coordinate how they care for Medicare patients. If they can cut costs while improving quality, the plans can share in the resulting savings with the federal government. A major flaw is the lack of a beneficiary enrollment process. Beneficiaries do not get to choose to enroll in an accountable care organization, as they do with Medicare Advantage plans. Instead, the Medicare program assigns beneficiaries to plans based on their use of physician services: If a beneficiary sees a doctor in an accountable care organization, then the beneficiary is assigned to it by the Medicare bureaucracy. The A.C.O. automatically becomes responsible for managing that beneficiary\u2019s care even though, in most instances, the beneficiary is unaware that he or she has been assigned to it. Since beneficiaries can go outside of their organization\u2019s network without financial penalty, the plans have a limited ability to cooperate with their cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Azar should use market competition to improve the A.C.O. plans\u2019 performance. Medicare beneficiaries should be given the option each year to select from among competing Medicare Advantage plans, A.C.O.\u2019s and the traditional fee-for-service program (beneficiaries should also select their drug coverage and supplemental insurance at the same time). Accountable care organizations should be allowed to share some of the savings from better management of patient care with the beneficiaries through premium discounts, and enrollees should pay more when they go outside of their network. Plans that are able to cut overall costs and improve the patient experience would attract enrollment and thrive. Mr. Azar can improve a second Obama-era initiative by retooling \u201cbundled payment\u201d efforts. With bundling, hospital systems, physician groups and other providers can get an all-inclusive fee from the Medicare program for an entire episode of care, such as joint replacement surgery and the implantation of a pacemaker. The bundle replaces the traditional approach of separate payments for each facility or practitioner caring for the patient. Bundled payments encourage hospitals and physicians to find cost reductions because they get paid a fixed total fee that does not increase with the provision of low-value services and unnecessary tests. Mr. Azar should reverse how payments are set under the bundling initiatives by asking the providers to name their prices (and compete with one another) instead of presenting them with the fee the government will pay based on antiquated regulations. The government could use the prices submitted by providers to establish a fixed payment rate per episode in relevant markets, based on a weighted average (the government wouldn\u2019t pay a rate that exceeds what would be paid in the absence of the bundling initiative). Actual payments would continue to be risk-adjusted based on the characteristics of individual patients. To encourage providers to cut their costs and charge low prices, the government should share some of the savings with the patients who get their care from those charging below average prices. The stated prices of all providers nationwide would be posted and publicly available, too.President Obama\u2019s Health and Human Services Department wanted to disrupt business as usual in health care to drive better value for patients and taxpayers. Alex Azar has the same goal, and is using many of the same tools. So there is some hope for progress on health care in the coming years after all.Lanhee J.

{"Headline": "Talk on Hong Kong Independence Goes Ahead, Despite Criticism", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The head of a political party calling for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China said Tuesday that government efforts to ban his group were a sign of eroding freedoms in the city.Calls for the club to cancel the event raised questions about the future of free speech in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous part of China where protections for civil liberties are far more robust than in the mainland.In response to Mr. Leung\u2019s criticism, the club said last week that it planned to go ahead with the talk.Dozens of protesters gathered near the club ahead of the event. Some opposed the talk, while others came to support Mr. Chan and his call for Hong Kong\u2019s independence from China.\u201cI am here protesting for our country,\u201d said George Ng, a retiree and member of Voice of Loving Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing group.Mr. Ng, who was carrying a large Chinese flag, said he objected to the club giving Mr. Chan \u201ca platform for his anti-state propaganda.\u201dMr. Chan said that he considered his call for Hong Kong independence to be a natural part of the effort to promote democracy in the city.\u201cIf Hong Kong were to become truly democratic, Hong Kong\u2019s sovereignty must rest with the people of Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is only one way to achieve this: independence.\u201dMr. Chan attacked the influence of China\u2019s central government over the city, saying it treated Hong Kong with an even heavier hand than the former colonial ruler, Britain.\u201cThe nature of China is oppression,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its heart, the empire that existed in the 18th century still stands today, despite all its technological advances. China is not a modern nation-state, much less a civil society.\u201dA Hong Kong government spokesman said Tuesday that it was \u201ctotally inappropriate and unacceptable for any organization to provide a public platform to espouse such views.\u201dA group of pro-establishment Hong Kong lawmakers also criticized the talk. And the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the club, saying that by \u201cproviding a stage to \u2018promote Hong Kong independence,\u2019\u201d it had \u201cseriously hurt the feelings of the Hong Kong people.\u201dThe ministry said the talk was beyond what could be considered reasonable free speech, like inviting Nazis to speak in Germany or terrorists to speak in the United States. Mr. Chan, however, said he and his party were advocates for peaceful political change.\u201cWe condemn violence, we do not support violence, and we never have been for violence,\u201d he said.Calls for Hong Kong independence were largely unheard-of in this city a decade ago, and they still lack widespread public support. But after the 2014 demonstrations known as the Umbrella Movement, when protesters occupied major roadways for 79 days in an unsuccessful push for more open democracy, some activists became more vocal in their calls for the city to formally separate from China.Official criticism of such ideas only gave them more attention, and Mr. Leung has sometimes been mockingly called the \u201cfather of Hong Kong independence\u201d for highlighting the movement.Mr. Leung is now a vice chairman of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the central government.His vocal criticism of Hong Kong independence could ensure that Mr. Leung is seen as an ally by the central government, said Maya Wang, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.That pattern is similar to other parts of China that have independence movements, like the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, she said.\u201cThat unfortunately results in authorities hardening their approach to these regions,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of addressing legitimate grievances in those places over freedom of expression, participation, equality and justice, you are creating a hostile, tough approach to a certain segment of the population.\u201dThe law, formally known as the Societies Ordinance, is typically used against organized crime groups, and the proposed ban of the Hong Kong National Party would be the first application against a political party since Britain returned the territory to China in 1997.Mr. Chan has until Sept. 4 to respond to the government\u2019s proposed ban.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs complained to the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club about plans for the talk, titled \u201cHong Kong Nationalism: A Politically Incorrect Guide to Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule.\u201dMr. Leung also suggested that the government was giving the club a break on its rent and that the lease should be reopened for other bidders. But Carrie Lam, the chief executive, said the club paid a market rate.The club currently pays more than $73,000 a month for its building, a former cold-storage warehouse for a dairy. The rent has roughly doubled from the rent of about $37,000 it paid in 2008.Victor Mallet, the club\u2019s first vice president and Asia news editor for The Financial Times, said that the club considered the talk a \u201cnormal event,\u201d and that it regularly hosted speakers representing a range of viewpoints it neither endorses nor opposes.\u201cThe fact that this lunch seems to have become far from normal and has generated such exceptional interest in Hong Kong and around the world I think tells us more about the political climate in Hong Kong and in Beijing than it does about the F.C.C.,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Syria, an Ugly Peace Is Better Than More War", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Carter is a former president of the United States.Beginning in 2011, Western and Middle Eastern powers rallied around the slogan \u201cAssad must go.\u201d This singular focus on the fate of Syria\u2019s president hardened positions on all sides and made it much more difficult to explore other options. The calls for regime change have diminished since then, but there are still some voices in Western policy circles that demand a full transition of power from the Assad government. A better approach at this point would be to test the Syrian government\u2019s ability to embark on a new course that has the potential to bring the war to a close. Western countries, including the United States, should re-engage incrementally with the Syrian government. They can start by reopening their embassies in Syria, since Western diplomats\u2019 absence from Damascus has led to missed opportunities. The West should also abandon the goal of regime change and temper expectations of democratic transition in Syria in the short-to-medium term. Instead, the focus should be on patiently building democracy. In exchange for this re-engagement, Damascus should be required to enact reforms, though the West must keep its demands moderate. Additionally, the West should be prepared to contribute to the reconstruction of Syria, perhaps selectively by sector. Humanitarian assistance alone will remain a bottomless pit as long as enterprising Syrians are unable to revive the country\u2019s economy and create jobs, particularly for young people. Syria\u2019s economy cannot be revived while the country remains under sanctions that hurt ordinary citizens. Lifting sanctions will be crucial to solving the huge challenges of reconstruction, unemployment and economic revival. Otherwise, a generation of Syrian children coming of age in the next few years and idle young men now in their 20s will be susceptible to insurgent and extremist recruiters and could resume the war in the next decade. To begin addressing these many challenges, all concerned must engage in a political process to wind down the war. Undermining of the Geneva peace process by Syria or European indifference to the situation will only lead to greater instability and suffering. Despite these gains, much of Syria remains outside the government\u2019s control, including, according to Carter Center research, 27 percent of the country\u2019s territory in the north and east that is held by Syrian Kurds with the help of an international coalition led by the United States. Opposition groups, some with close ties to Al Qaeda, control the northwestern province of Idlib. And Turkey has established along its border a protectorate in northwest Syria.For these complex measures to come to fruition, the Syrian government must accept the inevitability of reforms and implement confidence-building measures, including the release of detainees and accountability for their treatment. Immense violations of the laws of war and human rights have been committed in Syria, including the use of chemical weapons. Some such violations continue today. As a result, half the country\u2019s people have been displaced, and their homes and livelihoods destroyed. The international community has been a helpless witness to these violations, except in 2013, when a joint Russian-American effort removed from Syria the bulk of the country\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile. Assigning responsibility for the catastrophe in Syria would be an important part of postwar healing, but the priority now should be to end the war. Many Syrians have concluded that almost any peace, even an imperfect or ugly peace, is better than ongoing violence. The alternative is a failed state for decades ahead in the heart of the Middle East. Jimmy Carter, the founder of the Carter Center, was president of the United States from 1977 to 1981.Advertisement"}

For one particular doe and fawn, that neighborhood happens to be my backyard. Sure, they\u2019re quiet \u2014 come to think of it, I\u2019ve never heard them make a sound. And the little one covered in Bambi spots sure is cute. But let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re rude neighbors. When I ask the mother to leave by, say, pounding on my kitchen window with a spatula, she stares back at me blankly and pees. Sometimes, she deposits her fawn in my shrubs for the day while she runs off to do whatever it is deer do with their time when they\u2019re not devouring my marigolds. I\u2019m not a free babysitter, but she seems to think I am. And the fawn is under the impression that we can\u2019t see her, even as my children crouch, perplexed, to get a better look at the little speckled creature crushing my lamb\u2019s ear.I\u2019ve tried using subtle hints to let them know I want my space, like spraying my foliage with an organic concoction that smells like sour milk and claims to repel deer, but actually only repels people who like to sit near flowers. Sometimes, they take a hint and venture off \u2014 I imagine them taking long strolls in the nearby nature preserve, another suburban selling point.No sooner have they left, though, when another mother shows up. How do I know she\u2019s not the same one? A hint: this one has twins. You\u2019d think I live far out in the country, in some area of thick woods and wild mountains. But no, I\u2019m only 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan in New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the country. Blake Smith, who moved from Brooklyn to West Orange, N.J., 13 years ago with her husband, Tim, 49, can see the Empire State Building from her back deck, but it\u2019s the deer that take her breath away. \u201cThey\u2019re like these mystical creatures,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like unicorns.\u201d More like shameless interlopers. A few weeks ago, a deer pushed its way into Ms. Smith\u2019s screened-in porch to get ahold of some potted hibiscus. Ms. Smith, 45, an associate director of digital at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, had moved the pots inside so they wouldn\u2019t become deer salad.So much for that. Ms. Smith gave up and put the pots back outside. \u201cI told them, \u2018Have them, just eat them. Just please don\u2019t eat my watermelon,\u2019\u201d she said.Ms. Smith knows these deer well. They are members of a herd that has lived in a vacant lot behind her house for years, with a doe that the family named Limpy for her uneven gait. Perhaps because they\u2019ve been neighbors for so long, the deer listened to her about the watermelons and so far have left them alone. The hibiscus they ate. Homeowners grapple with fascination and irritation simultaneously. These graceful, delicate creatures can startle you with their presence, just before they poop on your front lawn. Step out for an evening run and you might encounter a few trotting alongside you on the road, barely fazed by your presence until they hop away, vanishing into the landscape. Hardly a month goes by without someone posting a video on a local Facebook group of a deer encounter \u2014 from banal ones, like a herd resting on a driveway, to the awe inspiring, like a doe giving birth to triplets in someone\u2019s garden. One neighbor recently shared a video of two bucks fighting in the woods behind her house. Standing on their hind legs, the animals swatted at each other with their skinny front legs in a scene straight out of Animal Planet, or maybe \u201cThe Real Housewives of New Jersey.\u201d Live outside the city, and you should expect to encounter wildlife \u2014 not just squirrels and raccoons, but foxes, rabbits, coyotes and groundhogs, which inhabit the shadows around our homes and lend a bucolic, and sometimes murderous, quality to a suburban existence. (The fox in my neighborhood has occasionally taken out some of the smaller wild neighbors, leaving their remains for me to remove.)Ms. Dahl was at work at the time, but a neighbor texted her a picture of the bears casually strolling up her driveway, like good friends paying a visit. Ms. Dahl\u2019s father, Jack Dahl, 72, scooped up the family\u2019s Chihuahua before the bears got a hold of it and rushed his grandson inside. Mr. Dahl called the police for assistance, but was told unless the animals posed an imminent threat, there was nothing to be done, except, of course, to post the incident on social media. And so the family did what most of us do when our wild neighbors take over: They sat inside and watched in fascination as the cubs and the mother climbed a tree and hung out until they got bored and moved on to someone else\u2019s yard.

{"Headline": "Watering New York\u2019s Transit Deserts", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow that the city has capped ride-hailing services, it needs a real solution for commuters outside Manhattan.Mr. Campanella is director of the Urban and Regional Studies Program at Cornell.Last week the New York City Council voted to temporarily limit the number of Uber, Lyft and other ride-hail cars as a way to ease congestion in densely populated parts of town. The plan may well work in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, where riders have an abundance of public transit options. But a moratorium on new Uber and Lyft licenses, should it become permanent, will exact a heavy toll in New York\u2019s boroughs outside Manhattan, where ride-hail cars fill a transit gap that the city has too long ignored. This problem will only grow as New Yorkers move to the city\u2019s far corners in search of affordable housing \u2014 which means the council needs to get serious about developing creative and effective transit solutions that serve everyone, and fast.On the low-slung plain of southeast Brooklyn, where the land slips gently toward the sea, subway stations are as common as obedient cats. Its neighborhoods \u2014 East Flatbush, Flatlands, Canarsie, Mill Basin, Marine Park, Gerritsen Beach \u2014 are diverse, affordable and unspoiled by gentrification. They are also far away \u2014 a solid hour\u2019s commute from Midtown, if you\u2019re lucky. In urban planning parlance, southeast Brooklyn is a rapid-transit desert, unserved by a single subway line. Some neighborhoods here are more than three miles from a station.Local residents were partly to blame. The first plan, dashed by the Great Depression and then postponed by World War II, was revived in the 1950s only to be quashed by civic groups outraged that the city wanted to build the new lines not underground but overhead. Downtown Brooklyn and all of Manhattan had only recently been relieved of the dark and noisome \u201cels,\u201d and nobody wanted them resurrected in a leafy bedroom community. By the time plans were dusted off again in the late 1960s, crime was soaring and subway cars, now spectacularly covered in graffiti, had become rolling symbols of social collapse. New York was under siege; no one wanted subways anymore \u2014 underground, overhead or anywhere else.Today, with urban living resurgent and transit-rich parts of New York City becoming increasingly unaffordable, we need to revisit plans to better link boroughs outside Manhattan to the city\u2019s center. This is especially so in light of the recent move to cap ride-hailing, an effective free-market solution to a transit problem it should have solved decades ago. Compared with these big-ticket items, extending the crucial Utica Avenue line deeper into Brooklyn would be a cakewalk. It would irrigate in a single stroke Brooklyn\u2019s largest subway desert and \u2014 if built just below street grade using traditional \u201ccut and cover\u201d construction techniques \u2014 could be realized for a mere fraction of the $4.45 billion that Phase I of the Second Avenue Subway cost taxpayers.These steps can be taken quickly, at little extra expense \u2014 and they need to be, within the next few years, while the city decides how to make rail transit reach the vast parts of the underserved boroughs outside Manhattan. The irony is that the city\u2019s ride-hailing freeze, taken in part to help the companies\u2019 underpaid drivers, disadvantages the very neighborhoods where many of those drivers live. Without a comprehensive approach to filling in the service gaps left by ride-hailing, they will be inarguably worse off than if the council had done nothing. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Facebook, or Anybody, Solve the Internet\u2019s Misinformation Problem?", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe social network was slow to recognize such campaigns as threats before the 2016 presidential election, and it surely deserves some credit for what Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, described as the company\u2019s shift from \u201creactive to proactive detection\u201d of coordinated propaganda operations.But it was not just Iran, and not just Facebook.Feeling better yet? Yeah, me neither.These drip-by-drip revelations inspire something like the opposite of confidence. Find one cockroach in the kitchen and you might feel better for having caught the sucker. Find another, and then another, and pretty soon you start to wonder if you should burn your house down.And these revelations of mischief underscore the novelty of the threats we are dealing with \u2014 and how unprepared we might be to handle them.Some of these disclosures are about actual criminal activity. But others, like the Iranian campaign, describe a more fuzzy kind of misbehavior, one that is not obviously illegal, and whose tactics amount to something that lots of people do everyday: Lying on the internet.Given the gray area some of these activities occupy, figuring out what to make of each revelation \u2014 how to assess its potential impact and our collective capacity to respond to it \u2014 is going to be the next great task of digital society. And the task is far bigger than any of us realize now.\u201cThe work you see now from Facebook, Microsoft and others to be more proactive is a trend that is positive \u2014 it\u2019s part of the solution, and I would want to see that trend continue,\u201d said Graham Brookie, director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has been working with Facebook on election-security issues.But Mr. Brookie added: \u201cIs this a solution? No, definitely not.\u201dA solution, he said, would involve a society-wide reckoning with the problem of the vulnerabilities that the internet has uncovered in democratic society. A solution would involve the federal government taking the lead in such an effort, which is not really happening at the moment. A solution would also involve citizens becoming far more vigilant about what they see online, how they respond to it, and the effect it has on their political lives.And even with all that, we may not really get an actual solution. Instead, the best we might hope for is something like an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between good and bad actors online: a fight that never ends, but whose damage we can at least hope to reduce.That\u2019s the long game. The short game is rather more depressing.Consider the most pressing question: How confident should you be that the coming midterm elections will be safe from hacking and propaganda operations online? The most likely answer: Nobody knows for sure, but probably not very confident.Facebook and other tech companies are stepping up their efforts to police their sites before the midterms. But some of the threats they have spotted so far have little to do with the election. The Iranian operation, for example, has been going on for years, and to judge by some of the content posted by these Facebook pages, was not aimed squarely at American elections, but instead American policy.In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook has been making progress on keeping elections safe, having learned from several races around the world since 2016.\u201cThere was the French election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election \u2014 and in each of these elections, our systems have been able to find a lot of fake accounts that were attempting potentially to do bad things on the system,\u201d he said.Each time the company finds something, Mr. Zuckerberg added, \u201cWe get better at identifying this kind of activity up front and putting barriers in place to those who would try to abuse these systems.\u201dHis words are somewhat reassuring, but only in that they feel like the bare minimum that a company like Facebook should do.The government\u2019s failure to address these threats have left the United States \u201cunprepared to protect the 2018 elections,\u201d Mr. Stamos said. He outlined a set of legislative, regulatory and law enforcement steps Americans might take to secure their digital house.If we move fast, he said, we might be able to salvage 2020.Advertisement"}

So what\u2019s behind the legions of beautiful young people in smoking, vaping and partying posts with the same hashtags?It\u2019s been years since the tobacco industry promised to stop luring young people to smoke cigarettes. Most countries, like the United States, imposed rules back in the 1970s against marketing tobacco to youths; many have banned cigarette commercials on television and radio. So the industry that brought the world the Marlboro Man, Joe Camel and slogans like \u201cReach for a Lucky Instead of a Sweet\u201d has latched onto the selfie generation\u2019s screens in a highly adaptive way that skirts the advertising rules of old.\u201cThe most surprising thing to me was the level of sophistication of these different global networks. You get incredible campaigns, the likes of which I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dDr. Kozinets\u2019s work, paid for by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group, analyzed social media in 10 countries by looking for hashtags that connect to tobacco cigarette brands. By promising anonymity, Dr. Kozinets\u2019s researchers were able to interview paid and unpaid \u201cambassadors\u201d and \u201cmicroinfluencers\u201d to reveal the connection between the tobacco companies, their communications agencies and social media posts on Instagram and Facebook. The petition claims that Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Brands are targeting young American consumers with deceptive social media marketing in violation of federal law. The petition calls on the F.T.C. to stop the practices. Several of the tobacco companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the petition. A spokesman for Philip Morris International said on Friday afternoon that the company had yet to review the documents and therefore could not comment. According to Caroline Renzulli, who oversaw the project for the campaign, 123 hashtags associated with these companies\u2019 tobacco products have been viewed 8.8 billion times in the United States alone and 25 billion times around the world. \u201cIf smokers or vapers choose to share their social activity,\u201d he added, \u201cit is completely their choice.\u201d\u201cWhere this is the case, however, we make it clear to them they are not to post branded content,\u201d Mr. Evans said.Sometimes the posts omit the cigarettes altogether, but mention upcoming parties and other events where cigarettes are promoted in giant displays and given away. The party d\u00e9cor colors often match those of a specific brand.The image below is from Indonesia, where a pack of Dunhill cigarettes is a subtle prop. After a press inquiry, BAT said they would take down the post. In an email, Simon Cleverly, an executive with British American Tobacco, said the company\u2019s team in Italy was reviewing the above documents, which researchers translated into English. The Like Us campaign ran from 2012 through 2017, he said.  Bruno Nastari, a Brazilian business strategist, spent more than three years working for Geometry Global, in S\u00e3o Paulo, according to his LinkedIn page. His accounts included British American Tobacco brands Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Kent, his page noted. Describing the strategy he used, Mr. Nastari wrote, \u201cOur insight was that Dunhill is the brand that transforms the city into a platform of discoveries, delivering exclusive experiences to younger audiences. Make Dunhill recognized as a modern, bold and sassy brand, thus being more appealing to the average smoker under 30 years. All this considering Brazil\u2019s legal restrictions of cigarette advertising.\u201dMr. Nastari did not respond to a reporter\u2019s inquiry, but these notes are no longer available on LinkedIn. The New York Times reached out to the social media posters included in this article. Several, including tico13, vikicecarelli1 and Mr. Nastari, acknowledged receipt but declined to be interviewed. Representatives for British American said that the company believed that neither tico13 nor Polpettadiriso were posting on its behalf. She also said that the company was not aware of the Lucky Us platform. In Uruguay, the researchers interviewed several ambassadors paid to post by Wasabi, a public relations firm working for Philip Morris International. Corey Henry, a spokesman for Philip Morris International, said that none of the company\u2019s marketing is aimed at recruiting new smokers, and that promotions include health warnings. He also said that no digital programs were conducted in Brazil this year. He said the company\u2019s Uruguay affiliate uses digital programs to \u201cresearch trends among current adult smokers,\u201d not to market cigarettes. \u201cAs we transform our business toward a smoke-free future, we remain focused on maintaining our leadership of the combustible tobacco category outside China and the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Henry said.  The researchers flagged posts they believe are designed to promote electronic cigarettes to youth. This post, from Romania, features iFuse, the tobacco heating product sold by British American Tobacco.Mr. Cleverly, the spokesman for British American Tobacco, said all promotional material and events were geared toward adult smokers and were in line with local regulations in its 200 markets. \u201cAcross the BAT Group, we are clear that social media can only be used for activities that do not involve the advertising of any of our cigarette brands,\u201d Mr. Cleverly said in an email. \u201cWe sometimes use social media, and we also sometimes work with bloggers and brand ambassadors, for posting unbranded content (i.e. showing no tobacco brands or products), \u201d he said. The petition filed by the antismoking advocacy groups asks the F.T.C. to require tobacco companies to disclose all pictures, videos and hashtags that are paid advertising or endorsements by adding some new, and likely less viral, hashtags: #Sponsored, #Promotion, or #Ad.

If you\u2019re a romantic, you might think of mating as harmonious. But in nature, reproduction is more often a vicious power struggle between mothers and fathers with competing interests. A maternal analogue to the \u201cwoman in red\u201d effect occurs among mice. Males are willing to kill a female\u2019s offspring, if they are unrelated to him, before mating with her. In anticipation, a pregnant mother may terminate her pregnancy when exposed to a new male, rather than spending resources on doomed offspring. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, Dr. Flanagan said, it\u2019s as if male pipefish are thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve done better in the past.\u201d Males in the \u201cwoman in red\u201d group \u2014 exposed to the new, \u201csexier\u201d female \u2014 had the highest rates of abortion and shortest pregnancies. They also birthed smaller offspring, some of which had abnormalities. It seems that these fathers stopped investing in existing offspring to save up for a better brood, said Jacinta Beehner, an associate professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan who studies reproductive strategies in primates. This fish-eat-fish explanation is a temptingly Machiavellian one, he added, but exactly how the \u201cwoman in red\u201d effect occurs remains unknown. For instance, are male pipefish the ones deciding to hold out for a more appealing mate? Or are dominant females short-circuiting male pregnancies through some type of cue?For now, Dr. Beehner said, \u201cThis study offers insight into the dark side of paternal care in pipefish and sea horses that probably won\u2019t find its way into many children\u2019s books.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mount IsaBy Helen McInerneyThe crowd outside in the dust had cheered loudly for me, and now I\u2019m being called and the tent is going crazy. I\u2019m in my corner, about to fight a member of Fred Brophy\u2019s boxing troupe \u2014 the last touring boxing tent in the country.This is my chance to belong to the outback, to the Australian dream of a place beyond where life is tough and a nation was made. The corner man tells me to keep my fists up and gives me a little pep talk. He smears my face with Vaseline, pulls on my gloves and then I\u2019m in the ring getting the rules from Mr. Brophy who\u2019s also the referee.I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.There\u2019s no headgear in this fight and I don\u2019t have a mouth guard to protect my expensive white teeth.Me, I\u2019m here to fight the Cracow Mauler. She\u2019s got short sharp hair and the face and attitude of a woman who has lived only among men.Back in the city I said I was going to have a fight the following year at the Mt. Isa Rodeo. No one believed me.Australia remains black and white, divided by race, and when you\u2019re away from the city, your skin color will tell you where you\u2019re welcome or where you can get a cold beer on a hot day. You can live in the suburbs and have good thoughts and the best of intentions but it\u2019s not the same in the towns of the outback. Out there are ties that bind, when small towns are flooded by tourists and race matters less than where you are from. I learned that lesson in Birdsville seeing Fred Brophy\u2019s Boxing Tent and realizing that here was my chance to belong to the outback, to the rough and tumble, to be part of the margins.Boxing tents, with their troupes of fighters, have been a part of Australia\u2019s traveling fairs since the gold rush of the late 19th century. Sandy Moore, Jimmy Sharman and others signed up tough men who dug in the dirt to make a living and found their entertainment in fighting a round or two for a pound or two. Jimmy Sharman\u2019s troupe had been Aboriginal men \u2014 tough, fast and athletic \u2014 but the fighters were exploited, and by the 1950s right-thinking citizens had said enough was enough, and white fighters joined the caravan. Even Mr. Brophy, with his diverse troupe, are no longer welcome in Australia\u2019s south so you have to travel to remote Queensland if you want to put your gloves on for a prize fight against one of his 12 tough ne\u2019er-do-wells. The fighters live rough, sleeping in swags in the dirt and eating meat and potatoes cooked on the campfire that also keeps them warm on the frigid star-filled outback nights.The Aboriginal ringers from the outback stations are all primed and ready to go three rounds for a $50 prize, though it\u2019s not about the money. This is where you can get your own back. Mr. Brophy asked me about my boots and I said I\u2019d keep them on. He laughed and I wasn\u2019t sure why.Me and the Cracow Mauler touch gloves and then it\u2019s game on and first blow I\u2019m down and on the canvas. But I\u2019m right back up again, and now I understand that leather-soled shoes cannot compete when you\u2019re getting hit sweet by a girl who knows how to box. I\u2019m flailing and not landing a blow, and there\u2019s coaching coming from the crowd as men shadow box with their fists up as fists are meant to be.Round 1 is over in three minutes and I\u2019m back in the corner with my man who\u2019s spraying water from a filthy old bottle into my mouth and mopping me down with the dirtiest old towel in Christendom. He\u2019s telling me I\u2019m doing O.K., to keep myself protected, keep the gloves close to my face. I\u2019m learning here, but in the next two rounds my lesson gets harder. Round 2, and I\u2019m there swinging my arms, not moving my feet, and it\u2019s clear I\u2019ve never had a fight in my life.The Mauler is landing blows beat by beat, and my cheekbones are burning and my eyes are blurring and it\u2019s all going so fast but so slow, and I want the fight to end but I want it to keep going, but Mr. Brophy blows his whistle and the fight is over. I survived three rounds in Mr. Brophy\u2019s boxing tent.There\u2019s whooping and hollering and, even though I\u2019ve soundly lost, the crowd is on my side.The Australian outback is tough. Now I know just how tough.Fred Brophy and his traveling boxing tent continue to tour remote Queensland, despite his threat to retire in 2012. Advertisement"}

Few Americans will ever have the misfortune \u2014 McCain would have called it the honor \u2014 of keeping faith in circumstances as dire as the ones he faced.Yet many people, at home and abroad, are straining nonetheless.They strain to keep faith when the president rains scorn on our closest allies at summits in Canada and Belgium, and follows each performance with epic displays of obsequiousness toward a North Korean mass murderer and a Russian assassin.They strain to keep faith when the vice president publicly walks out of a football stadium because players bend a knee in silent protest of racial injustice just two months after the president loudly defended white nationalists at Charlottesville as \u201csome very fine people.\u201dNor is the straining just a function of the current administration, or the sole domain of those opposed to it.Tens of millions of Americans also strain to keep faith with America when opinions that until recently were commonplace, traditional or innocuous are now denounced as racist, sexist, micro-aggressive and attach-your-prefix-phobic.They strain to keep faith when racial discrimination is always hideously wrong \u2014 except when it\u2019s the not-so-secret admissions policy of Harvard.They strain to keep faith when the arbiters of moral and cultural acceptability, all of them self-appointed, insist both on their right to offend nearly anyone and take offense at nearly anything.These examples don\u2019t exhaust the list. Nearly everyone I know seems to have a well-developed theory as to why this country is past redemption, or almost, and every theory seems almost right. There is a great deal of ruin in a nation. A great deal of malice and misadventure, too.It was no mystery to anyone in his audience that day where the real source of his alarm lay: An American president who, in matters of both character and conviction, was low and vapid and mean-spirited and bottomlessly dishonorable \u2014 McCain\u2019s opposite in every respect. But everyone in that audience would also have known that McCain had enough sense of history, and enough confidence in the future, not to mistake evidence of decay for proof of decline. In the scale of American blunders \u2014 from the Dred Scott decision to the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s to the tragedy of Vietnam \u2014 is the Trump presidency really unique? And in the long, upward arc of American history, will its consequences be so dire or decisive?It happens that in the years when McCain and his fellow P.O.W.s were straining to keep faith with America, much of America had lost faith with them. It didn\u2019t matter. The America they were keeping faith with was not so much a people, or even a country, as it was a set of ideas that elevated and transcended both.Those ideas, about human liberty, dignity and possibility, lie beyond the reach of President Trump to traduce, or Jeff Sessions to betray, or any English department in the country to deconstruct. They are the ideas to which McCain held fast in his torment, to which billions worldwide aspire, and to which every American implicitly subscribes, even those who pretend otherwise. They are the ideas that will see us through this presidency.Advertisement"}

They do not need a taxpayer-sponsored haven to shoot up. Mr. Rosenstein is the deputy attorney general of the United States. Almost 64,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2016, a shocking 54 percent increase since 2012. Dangerous opioids such as heroin and fentanyl contributed to two-thirds of the deaths. This killer knows no geographic, socioeconomic or age limits. It strikes city dwellers and Midwestern farmers, Hollywood celebrities and homeless veterans, grandparents and teenagers. The Trump administration is working to reverse those trends. Prosecutions of drug traffickers are on the rise, and the surge in overdose deaths is slowing. Unfortunately, some cities and counties are considering sponsoring centers where drug users can abuse dangerous illegal drugs with government help. Advocates euphemistically call them \u201csafe injection sites,\u201d but they are very dangerous and would only make the opioid crisis worse.These centers would be modeled on those operating in Canada and some European countries. They invite visitors to use heroin, fentanyl and other deadly drugs without fear of arrest. The policy is \u201cB.Y.O.D.\u201d \u2014 bring your own drugs \u2014 but staff members help people abuse drugs by providing needles and stand ready to resuscitate addicts who overdose. One obvious problem with injection sites is that they are illegal. It is a federal felony to maintain any location for the purpose of facilitating illicit drug use. Violations are punishable by up to 20 years in prison, hefty fines and forfeiture of the property used in the criminal activity. The law also authorizes the federal government to obtain civil injunctions against violators. Because federal law clearly prohibits injection sites, cities and counties should expect the Department of Justice to meet the opening of any injection site with swift and aggressive action. Supporters also ignore the unintended consequences on the next generation. Injection sites normalize drug use and facilitate addiction by sending a powerful message to teenagers that the government thinks illegal drugs can be used safely.That is not the way to end the opioid crisis. Americans struggling with addiction need treatment and reduced access to deadly drugs. They do not need a taxpayer-sponsored haven to shoot up. To end the drug crisis, we should educate everyone about the dangers of opioid drugs, help drug users get treatment and aggressively prosecute criminals who supply the deadly poison. Under the leadership of President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice is delivering results. Many federal, state and local agencies are working with us to combat opioid addiction. Cities and counties should join us and fight drug abuse, not subsidize it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Democrats Campaign Against the Swamp?", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationIt does still need some draining.Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.As a fellow journalist and enemy-of-the-people, do you have any updates about our schemes? For instance, has our advocacy of fluoridated water and the Rigged Witch Hunt borne fruit yet?Never mind. Are you ready to move on to the elections? If you think it\u2019s too early we can discuss baseball. Please tell me why I\u2019m wrong. If I\u2019m right, this November people will vote on whether they like the way things are going, or they\u2019re just tired of all this \u2026 stuff. So far, the economy doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a punch for the Republicans and the tax cut thing is a total washout. The fact that it\u2019s mainly just a big giveaway to the rich has sunk in, and if anything it\u2019s going to be a drag on the people who supported it.A remark I heard from a savvy businessman seemed to sum up the thinking of at least part of the country: When he looks at the state of the country with the mute button on, he basically likes what he sees. It\u2019s only when he un-mutes and has to listen to Trump that he\u2019s alarmed. But I suspect a lot Americans have turned down the sound as they try to get on with their lives, so a lot of the screaming about Russiagate or the Helsinki fiasco or Scott Pruitt\u2019s corruption just doesn\u2019t get through and is probably counterproductive.To win, Democrats need to spend a lot more time explaining what they are for, and how they\u2019re going to achieve it, then simply pointing to what they\u2019re against. The one Trump message I thought really resonated with good-hearted voters was \u201cDrain the swamp.\u201d Well the swamp is murkier than ever. Half of Washington seems to be lobbying for Ukraine or Turkey. The call for getting big, greedy special interests out of campaign donations is a surefire winner.But again, to really carry the issue Democrats need to do more than just note that the administration is corrupt. They have to offer an affirmative, credible and straightforward program for reducing political corruption systemwide.But about that swamp \u2014 if you\u2019re going to drain it you\u2019ve got to limit the ability of rich special interests to donate huge chunks of money, to either party.Just goes to show: Even August can be an adventure.

{"Headline": "How Fake Influence Campaigns on Facebook Lured Real People", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe recognized it as trouble. Little did he know just how much.The event page was created on June 24 by a feminist-oriented Facebook political page called Resisters. On June 25, Mr. Orsinger reached out via Facebook to a Resisters administrator he knew as \u201cMary,\u201d whom he had messaged before, to discuss how Washington-based activists resent it when national activists crowd out local organizers on an event.Mr. Orsinger gently suggested to \u201cMary\u201d that the Resisters \u201cget buy-in from local DC organizers of color first,\u201d like the local Black Lives Matter chapter, for the counterprotest, according to messages reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cMary\u201d appeared receptive, he said. So Mr. Orsinger connected several other Washington-based activist groups to help flesh out the event page the Resisters had started.Mr. Orsinger\u2019s experience shows how real people continue to become entangled with fake accounts and pages on Facebook \u2014 and the sometimes significant consequences for them as the company has tried to clamp down. Mr. Orsinger said he was invited into the Resisters page on Facebook in January and interacted with \u201cMary\u201d for months on the social network, without thinking anything was amiss.\u201cMary\u201d was not the only apparently fake Facebook account that drew legitimate activists into the Resisters event page. On July 1, another Resisters administrator, \u201cNatasha Shipley,\u201d reached out to Workers Against Racism, a national group, to request help for the same event \u2014 quickly making it a co-host, too, according to messages reviewed by The Times. Facebook has suspended the \u201cNatasha Shipley\u201d account as well, the messages show.\u201cBeing an activist, you come in contact with so many people here and there and have to also understand that people have a lot going on,\u201d Mr. Orsinger, 36, said. \u201cI feel curious right now, to see what exactly happened so I can learn from it.\u201dBut even as Facebook moved more quickly this time to limit meddling, some said the company had become heavy-handed. The activists working on the counterprotest, which is scheduled for Aug. 10 to 12, said Facebook had gone too far by removing videos and messages that real people had posted. Facebook also notified users who had indicated interest in attending the counterprotest of the suspicious activity. That essentially forced them to start over in gathering followers and building momentum to stage an effective protest, they said.Dylan Petrohilos, a Washington-based organizer, said Facebook had deleted the event page without giving activists an opportunity to argue that the content they had posted to it was legitimate and should stay up. He accused the company of quashing their work as a \u201cpolitical out that Facebook took to deal with the scrutiny\u201d it had been under.Tom Reynolds, a Facebook spokesman, said the company\u2019s decision to remove the event was about addressing the coordinated influence campaign \u201cand maintaining the security of our services.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe ban hate organizations from our platform and are encouraged to see people using Facebook to stand up against white supremacy.\u201dThe Resisters page was created in March 2017, according to an analysis by the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. It gained momentum in the ensuing months by posting about feminist activism. Mr. Orsinger said he was invited to become an administrator on the page this January after he helped organize a protest against President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address.In the late winter and early spring, word began circulating that the white supremacists who had organized the Charlottesville \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally last August wanted to hold another one in 2018. Washington-based activists began discussing a counterprotest.Andrew Batcher, 37, a Washington-based activist who is an administrator for the Facebook page of the group Smash Racism \u2014 one of those that the Resisters later invited to act as a co-host of their event page \u2014 said many local activists had traveled to Charlottesville last year to protest the original rally. He said he was there when a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators, killing a woman.He said groups would protest the \u201cUnite the Right II\u201d rally in their own city regardless of whether the Resisters page had moved first to create an event page for it. But because the Resisters\u2019 event page was up, he said, it made sense to reach out via Mr. Orsinger and essentially take it over, rather than create a redundant page and risk fracturing the potential audience.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much on the page before we were added,\u201d Mr. Batcher said. \u201cThe content, when it was taken down, was all from us.\u201dOn July 1, the \u201cNatasha Shipley\u201d account reached out to Workers Against Racism seeking assistance with the Resisters. Reached via Facebook, a spokesman for WAR, who declined to give his name, citing security threats, said it was common for inexperienced but politically minded people to reach out for help organizing events.WAR provided some advice to \u201cNatasha\u201d about fixing problems with the date and time on the event page, he said, and she made WAR a co-host. The group thought it was odd when \u201cNatasha\u201d disappeared for 17 days, then resurfaced and said she had been sick, he said. By then, local Washington activists had essentially taken over the event page and filled it out.Messages from \u201cMary\u201d and \u201cNatasha\u201d are now redacted in Facebook\u2019s system, so The Times was able to review correspondence only from the side of Mr. Orsinger and WAR.After Facebook deleted the event page on Tuesday, activists swiftly recreated a new one from scratch to promote the counterprotest.But the display of raw power \u2014 erasing the entire platform that the activists had been using to organize their political action \u2014 was striking, said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, an internet rights group.\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely dangerous situation for free speech when politicians are screaming at web platforms to \u2018do something\u2019 about a problem that is difficult to address,\u201d she said. \u201cCensoring an anti-Nazi protest was a particularly egregious example of collateral damage.\u201dMr. Orsinger said that he was not sure whether an account associated with the Resisters page had originated in Russia or not, but that it had done no harm to local organizers.\u201cI\u2019m scared that my work moving forward is going to be either co-opted or deemed as illegitimate because Facebook didn\u2019t decide to do the homework and background,\u201d he said. \u201cThey decided to just start taking down stuff unilaterally.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Later in the recovery, the decision by Republican leaders in Congress to oppose every Obama proposal prevented the government from doing much to help people regain what they had lost or to heat up the tepid recovery with infrastructure spending and other stimulus measures.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy speculating about it, the president and his surrogates have already acted improperly. Mr. Whiting and Mr. Goodman are a founding editor and an editor in chief of the blog Just Security. Whether and when he acts, it appears that Mr. Trump has already embarked on a strategy of using his pardon power to silence witnesses in the Mueller investigation. In other words, at this point, dangling the prospect of a pardon or going ahead and exercising it amounts to the same thing: obstruction of justice. The only proper course for the president and his surrogates would have been to say nothing about Mr. Manafort or a possible pardon \u2014 but that is decidedly not the path they have chosen. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have signaled to Mr. Manafort that a future pardon is very likely. This strategy offers the president several advantages and may be the most cunning way to undermine the Mueller investigation. If he pardoned Mr. Manafort now, Mr. Trump would pay a political cost. In addition, he and his lawyers have surely recognized that a pardon now could, paradoxically, help Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Right now, the special counsel can\u2019t compel Mr. Manafort\u2019s testimony because he has a Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself. But a pardon would free Mr. Mueller to subpoena Mr. Manafort to the grand jury to testify, because he cannot fear incriminating himself and criminal liability if he cannot be prosecuted. But if given a presidential pardon, why would Mr. Manafort provide potentially damaging information to a grand jury against Mr. Trump? Because he would open himself up to a different legal peril: If he refused to say anything, he could be jailed for contempt. As his lawyers would tell him, such contempt orders cannot be lifted by a presidential pardon. If he lied to the grand jury, he would risk being detected by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, and a pardon for past conduct would not cover such perjury. In short, Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors would bring tremendous pressure on Mr. Manafort to testify and to be substantially truthful. For the moment, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to have it all: dangling a pardon down the line to keep Mr. Manafort quiet, giving the president the benefits of a pardon without requiring him to pay substantial political costs. That requires assuring Mr. Manafort that a pardon will very likely come, and Mr. Giuliani has obliged, telling reporters that Mr. Trump himself raised the subject of a Manafort pardon. These words should be seen for what they are: an effort to keep Mr. Manafort quiet and to impede the investigation by encouraging potential witnesses not to cooperate. In this way, the president\u2019s words about the judicial process matter, have real consequences and should not be discounted or dismissed as mere angry rants. It will be up to the American public, regardless of whether Congress ever acts, to consider whether Mr. Trump has grossly abused his powers as president and what he\u2019s hiding.

{"Headline": "War Without End", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "At WarThe Pentagon\u2019s failed campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan left a generation of soldiers with little to fight for but one another.Supported byHe was 19, but at 160 pounds and barely needing to shave, he could pass for two years younger. He was nobody\u2019s archetype of a fighter. A high school drama student, he joined the Army at 17 and planned to become an actor if he survived the war. Often he went about his duties with an enormous smile, singing no matter what anyone else thought \u2014 R. & B., rap, rock, hip-hop, the blues. All of this made him popular in the platoon, even as he had become tenser than his former self and older than his years; even as his friends and sergeants he admired were killed, leaving him a burden of ghosts.After a few hours, Second Platoon reached the crest, high above the valley. The soldiers inhaled deeply, taking in the thin air. Away from the outpost\u2019s burning trash, the air tasted clean.A few soldiers went forward to check the trail before the rest of the platoon moved to the ambush site. With little more than whispers, the soldiers arranged themselves in a triangle astride a mountain footpath. Second Lt. Justin Smith, their platoon leader, put Molano at one corner and a second man with an M240 at another, with their machine guns angled back toward each other so their fire could create an interlocking zone of flying lead. Other soldiers set claymore mines on small stands.Everything was ready before dark. The air was chilly and the ridge raked by gusts. Soto was shivering. He pulled a dry undershirt and socks from his pack, changed clothes, ate a protein bar and washed it down with water. He saw his company\u2019s outpost below, across the open space, and realized this must be what it looked like to militants when they attacked. A distant call to prayer floated on the mountain air.More than three million Americans have served in uniform in these wars. Nearly 7,000 of them have died. Tens of thousands more have been wounded. More are killed or wounded each year, in smaller numbers but often in dreary circumstances, including the fatal attack in July on Cpl. Joseph Maciel by an Afghan soldier \u2014 a member of the very forces that the United States has underwritten, trained and equipped, and yet as a matter of necessity and practice now guards itself against.On one matter there can be no argument: The policies that sent these men and women abroad, with their emphasis on military action and their visions of reordering nations and cultures, have not succeeded. It is beyond honest dispute that the wars did not achieve what their organizers promised, no matter the party in power or the generals in command. Astonishingly expensive, strategically incoherent, sold by a shifting slate of senior officers and politicians and editorial-page hawks, the wars have continued in varied forms and under different rationales each and every year since passenger jets struck the World Trade Center in 2001. They continue today without an end in sight, reauthorized in Pentagon budgets almost as if distant war is a presumed government action.As the costs have grown \u2014 whether measured by dollars spent, stature lost or blood shed \u2014 the wars\u2019 architects and the commentators supporting them have often been ready with optimistic or airbrushed predictions, each pitched to the latest project or newly appointed general\u2019s plan. According to the bullhorns and depending on the year, America\u2019s military campaigns abroad would satisfy justice, displace tyrants, keep violence away from Western soil, spread democracy, foster development, prevent sectarian war, protect populations, reduce corruption, bolster women\u2019s rights, decrease the international heroin trade, check the influence of extreme religious ideology, create Iraqi and Afghan security forces that would be law-abiding and competent and finally build nations that might peacefully stand on their own in a global world, all while discouraging other would-be despots and terrorists.Aside from displacing tyrants and leading to the eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, none of this turned out as pitched. Prominent successes were short-lived. New thugs rose where old thugs fell. Corruption and lawlessness remain endemic. An uncountable tally of civilians \u2014 many times the number of those who perished in the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 \u2014 were killed. Others were wounded or driven from their homes, first by American action and then by violent social forces American action helped unleash.The governments of Afghanistan and Iraq, each of which the United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to build and support, are fragile, brutal and uncertain. The nations they struggle to rule harbor large contingents of irregular fighters and terrorists who have been hardened and made savvy, trained by the experience of fighting the American military machine. Much of the infrastructure the United States built with its citizens\u2019 treasure and its troops\u2019 labor lies abandoned. Briefly schools or outposts, many are husks, looted and desolate monuments to forgotten plans. Hundreds of thousands of weapons provided to would-be allies have vanished; an innumerable quantity are on markets or in the hands of Washington\u2019s enemies. Billions of dollars spent creating security partners also deputized pedophiles, torturers and thieves. National police or army units that the Pentagon proclaimed essential to their countries\u2019 futures have disbanded. The Islamic State has sponsored or encouraged terrorist attacks across much of the world \u2014 exactly the species of crime the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d was supposed to prevent.Almost two decades after the White House cast American troops as liberators to be welcomed, large swaths of territory where the Pentagon deployed combat forces are under stubborn insurgent influence. Areas once touted as markers of counterinsurgency progress have become no-go zones, regions in which almost no Americans dare tread, save a few journalists and aid workers, or private military contractors or American military and C.I.A. teams.Across these years, hundreds of thousands of young men and women signed on in good faith and served in the lower and middle ranks. They did not make policy. They lived within it.His urge to understand what happened was irresistible. A few months later, Soto sneaked away from the Bronx with an 11-year-old friend. The two rode the 4 train to Lower Manhattan and walked to the rubble at Ground Zero, where the towers had been. Soto made up his mind standing there. He would protect the United States. When he was old enough, he would enlist.The neighborhood outside his home was rough, and Soto was already carving out his place on the street \u2014 since age 8, he had been selling AA batteries on the curb. As his childhood passed, he watched friends drift into crime. Some joined Dominicans Don\u2019t Play, a Latino gang in a violent rivalry with another, the Trinitarios. His father, who worked as a doorman in Manhattan, had custody of him and his brother. The family shared an apartment with Soto\u2019s grandmother, Haydee Madera-Soto, who moved to New York from Puerto Rico in 1962 and lived in the same building on Morris Avenue for decades. She watched from her second-story window as if hovering above him, calling him inside when she sensed trouble. When he tried evading her, she learned his routes over rooftops and down staircases into other buildings on the block, and knew which staircases to charge up to intercept him and lead him home. Soto did not want to disappoint her. In eighth grade, he played Iago in a school production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cOthello.\u201d The role helped him enroll at the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan in September 2003, not long after the United States invaded Iraq.Soto never quite fit in. Most of his classmates were neither skirting gang involvement nor inclined toward military service. They were almost all bound for college and seemed to be able to dissociate themselves from the memory of New York being attacked. Soto felt as if he were from another world and moving in a different direction. He graduated in 2007 and enrolled in summer classes at Lehman College, but something did not feel right. America was fighting two wars. Each was going badly. What was he doing sitting around? He walked out of math class and into an Army recruiting office, where he told the first soldier he saw that he wanted to sign up. He volunteered for the infantry \u2014 his sense of the hardest, most dangerous job. His grandmother was visiting her village in Puerto Rico when he took his oath. She was despondent when she heard. \u201cIf I had been here, I wouldn\u2019t have let him go,\u201d she said.In August, when Soto arrived at Fort Benning, Ga., for One Station Unit Training, a pipeline to combat divisions, he was given as simple a label as a human being can have: Roster No. 242, written on tape on his plain green helmet. Several sergeants who trained him had been to Iraq and Afghanistan; he regarded them as the most impressive people he had ever met. Soto returned home for the holidays with orders to report in January 2008 to Fort Hood, Tex., and join the First Infantry Division, which was bound for a rotation in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq had entered a less violent phase. The Pentagon was shifting attention to defeating the Taliban, which had reasserted itself after being forced from Kabul in 2001. It had cut off remote outposts and was challenging the American-backed government across much of the country.At Fort Hood, Soto was greeted by a Viper Company squad leader, Staff Sgt. Nathan Cox. At 32, Cox was older than is typical for his rank. He had a deeply furrowed brow, a hint of graying hair, a college education and an aura of confidence rooted in previous tours in Bosnia and Iraq. He welcomed Soto in a straightforward manner, with a politeness that reflected his Catholic-school years in Iowa. Soto immediately liked him. Cox was a tattooed bookworm with a pensive side. After working under the tutelage of drill sergeants, with their outsize personas, Soto was drawn to his quieter, more composed and reflective demeanor. The platoon sergeant, Sgt. First Class Thomas Wright, assigned Soto as an ammunition bearer in a machine-gun team, a position for an F.N.G. \u2014 \u201cfucking new guy\u201d \u2014 on a fast track to war.The company was busy readying for Afghanistan and spent weeks in the field, conditioning with long marches under heavy rucksacks and training with weapons. The more Soto came to know Sergeant Cox, the more fortunate he felt to work for him. Cox served in the Army in the \u201990s, then returned to civilian life and studied for his bachelor\u2019s degree. Like Soto, he was deeply affected by the terrorist attacks in 2001, and he began talking of serving again. But he was raising two stepchildren and an infant daughter with his wife-to-be, Annie, and did not want to disrupt their family while they had teenage children in school. He waited until 2005, as his stepdaughter was graduating from high school, to take his oath for a second time, returning, like Soto, to the Army as an infantry volunteer. Cox did a tour in Iraq before reporting to Fort Hood with Annie and their toddler, where he became a squad leader. In this role, he was expected to shape a new batch of soldiers into a fighting team. Like Soto, he was also an artist. Soto sang. Cox drew. Sometimes he sketched officers as they gave briefings, filling pages of his tactical notebooks with renderings in real time.Late that spring, Cox hosted several young soldiers at the home on Fort Hood he shared with his family. It was one-half of an Army-managed duplex, a place in such poor condition that Annie and he referred to it as a government slum, the \u2019hood of Fort Hood. The battalion\u2019s soldiers were being granted leave before flying away for a year, and the party, on a concrete patio outside their back door, was a chance to gather away from work and relax. Annie prepared food and welcomed her husband\u2019s charges into her life. Cox grilled meat and served drinks and offered his out-of-uniform human side, impressing on his squad that each soldier was part of a team, and that he needed them, and that soon they would all need one another in profound ways.There were things he did not share. Although few of his fellow soldiers knew it, Cox did not have to deploy to Afghanistan; he had been recruited to serve as a PsyOps soldier, and there was a position for him in the PsyOps field. He turned down the opportunity, confiding in Annie that he could not let his squad go to Afghanistan without him. He had been telling his soldiers they had to be there for one another. He intended to live by his words.On the flight from the United States in July, Cox got his soldiers seated, then tried to relax. He ate and read part of a book but felt his wartime self settling over him, that blend of exhaustion and intensity, as he headed into his third war. \u201cSaying goodbye was hard, took it out of me emotionally,\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cFlight gives way to deployment mind-set + compressed brain.\u201dViper. The name sounded impressive. They were F.N.G.s now.At the moment Soto and his fellow soldiers arrived in the valley, the United States had been in Afghanistan almost seven years \u2014 longer than America\u2019s Civil War and involvement in World War I combined. The war\u2019s objectives and the military\u2019s roles had shifted across the years. The rush into the country to punish the perpetrators of the 2001 attacks had evolved into something else: an open-ended occupation. Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban\u2019s leader, were at large, and elite counterterrorism units remained in the country, fighting a shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies. But larger conventional American units were engaged in a war that swapped urgency for a mesh of military, development and political aims. Combat tours to Afghanistan now blended military and civil assignments, including holding down remote outposts, organizing infrastructure projects, helping Afghan ministries with tasks like registering voters and training and outfitting Afghan soldiers and police officers, to whom the Pentagon insisted security would one day be entrusted.No one had a firm idea of when that day might be, and hope for decisive momentum on any of these propositions had been undercut by the campaign in Iraq, which began diverting Pentagon attention soon after Bin Laden escaped over the mountain passes near Tora Bora in late 2001. In mid-2008, as Cox\u2019s squad arrived, the United States had more than 140,000 troops in Iraq and about 33,000 in Afghanistan. Many lived in an archipelago of small rural positions, around which the Taliban had long ago established ambush points and planted hidden bombs. This encirclement made ground patrols perilous and in some places rendered resupply by road impossible. These positions were kept alive by replenishments dropped with parachutes or carried by helicopters, themselves in short supply. All the while, the United States, pitted against enemies adept at terrorist attacks and guerrilla warfare, was field-testing a reboot of Western counterinsurgency doctrine, with an emphasis on protecting civilians and providing services while tightening rules that dictated how troops could fight. A phrase from Vietnam was circulating anew \u2014 \u201cwinning hearts and minds\u201d \u2014 even as units of hard-helmeted conventional troops spent large fractions of their time guarding their outposts and keeping themselves provisioned in distant, rugged terrain. A darker slang developed in the lower ranks. Afghanistan was the \u201cwelfare war.\u201d Forlorn outposts, often built near villages resentful of foreign occupiers, were \u201cbullet sponges.\u201dAmericans occasionally ventured up the Korengal\u2019s banks in the first years of the war, and they often met armed resistance. But the valley did not gain larger notoriety until 2005, when three Navy SEALs were killed in an ambush and a helicopter rushing to their aid was shot down, claiming 16 more lives. In 2006, an Army brigade situated the outpost on a low ridge with a gently sloping crest, beginning the phase of the American effort that Soto\u2019s platoon was cycling through. On a tactical level, establishment of the outpost could seem to make sense. The place was defensible, in an officer-school way \u2014 a position overlooking the river and lower trails with enough space for helicopters to land. On a social level, it could not have been much worse. It was an unforced error of occupation, a set of foreign military bunkers built on the grounds of a sawmill and lumber yard formerly operated by Haji Mateen, a local timber baron. The American foothold put some of the valley\u2019s toughest men out of work, the same Afghans who knew the mountain trails. Haji Mateen now commanded many of the valley\u2019s fighters, under the banner of the Taliban.Military minds had chosen the place. Standard military tactics would have to defend it. Troops built smaller posts so their occupants could watch over more of the riverbed and support one another with machine gun and mortar fire. NATO officials spoke of forging alliances between government and people. The American presence in the Korengal felt more crude fortress than diplomatic expedition, out of sync with ideas of protecting populations or courting hearts and minds.At first Soto found the valley breathtaking. The riverbed formed a green stripe of cropland. Terraces of stacked stone climbed the lower hills. Villages clung to ledges. Farther up the mountains rose escarpments of stone, buffeted by wind. This was not the arid steppe or brown hills that dominate much of the Afghan landscape. It was ancient forest bisected by cascading mountain streams that fed a river with a haunting name, a place beyond the imagination of a teenager from the Bronx.Soto soon saw the ground through another lens. Using aerial photographs, the Americans had charted every building in every village. The valley no longer seemed to him a land that time forgot. It was as intricately mapped as almost any place on earth. Hilltops, ridges, livestock sheds. Each was a precise spot that American weapons were ready to hit, a number on a targeting template overwritten on homes, ready for retaliation against any place from where an attack might emerge. Many attacks followed patterns. The outpost was reachable by a single dirt road from the Pech Valley. The Army had used this overland path for more than a year, sending cargo trucks accompanied by helicopters and armored Humvees. Often a route-clearance platoon led the slow drive, looking for bombs. These practices were well known by all sides and allowed the Taliban hours to prepare. Without irony, the Army had given its dirt track a name: Route Victory.Soon after his arrival, Soto was in a Humvee turret on the road, looking over the river to a village called Donga when incoming fire struck the dirt beside his truck, smacking it with shrapnel and rocks. He shouted to the driver \u2014 \u201cMove!\u201d \u2014 and opened up, aiming .50-caliber bullets just below dust he spotted rising on the far side. He fired an entire can, then half of another. Sergeant Cox was beneath him in the truck. \u201cHey, man, you O.K.?\u201d he asked Soto after, watching for his response. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said; he was adjusting to the place.Several times at night, Soto looked across the valley at flashlights bobbing in forests. He was sure these were Taliban moving ammunition and weapons. He found it maddening. They could fight as they pleased, but American soldiers were bound by rules limiting their ability to enter homes, rules governing when they could use their weapons, rules governing whether and how firepower could be applied. Soldiers were drilled in manners and restraint. As Soto saw it, Viper was like a boxer forbidden to use fists, reasoning with a foe who was allowed to punch first. It was a death lottery, with medals for the losers and talking points on the news.On Sept. 6, Second Squad walked across the river and up the steep hill to Donga, while other soldiers set up a position on the west side. Militants opened fire, trying to hit the soldiers on the west bank. When the gunfire stopped, Cox hunched over the radio with another sergeant. They shook heads and swore and told everyone to get ready for the return walk. Soto was a student of Cox\u2019s body language. He knew something was wrong.Helicopters circled overhead. After Second Squad crossed the river and climbed to the road, Soto was angry. There was a lot going on, and they weren\u2019t hearing it. He thought he knew why. When the squad reached an Afghan Army position, his anger surged to fury. He confronted a sergeant. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho got hit?\u201d\u201cIt was Knight,\u201d the sergeant said.Specialist Marques Knight was an experienced soldier, with a tour in Iraq. He was killed in a vehicle turret when a sniper\u2019s bullet hit his head. Soldiers beneath him in the truck saw his legs go instantly limp.The sky opened up, splattering the valley with rain and hail. Soto strode forcefully along the last leg of the walk to the outpost, soaked and cold, alternating between numbness and lucidity. Knight\u2019s body lay in the mechanics\u2019 bay, where soldiers paid last respects. Late that night, Viper gathered for a ceremony in the darkness. A mortar crew fired two illumination rounds. Each was a bright flare beneath a fluttering parachute. They ignited brilliantly and descended, whistling softly and casting shadows that spun and danced. They burned for about a minute. Then the valley was black again.The idealism that propelled Soto to Afghanistan was being scoured away. In his journal, Cox recorded one of Soto\u2019s questions. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d Cox wrote, \u201cthat pieces of crap go on living lives that mean nothing and good men die in places like this?\u201d Soto thought Cox agreed, but he was careful in his reply. He didn\u2019t know that fatalism had seeped into his sergeant\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cHave a bit of humor with death,\u201d Cox wrote. \u201cAt the funeral just say, \u2018I guess I had it coming.\u2019 \u201d His entry that night was littered with the titles of songs. \u201cSeven Nation Army,\u201d \u201cAway From the Sun,\u201d \u201cHere Without You.\u201dHe ended with a lyric from one more: \u201cLove me when I\u2019m gone.\u201dAfter Knight was killed, Sergeant Wright, the platoon sergeant, told Soto that Third Squad was heading to an observation post and that Soto would leave Second Squad temporarily to join them there. Soto did not want to go. Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday was at the end of the month, and Soto had ordered a gift \u2014 a copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d He had noticed how much Cox read. Even when there was time for only a few hours of sleep, Cox would often spend part of it with a book. It was fiction as sanctuary. The two men had talked about reading, and Soto had learned that Cox had never read J.D. Salinger. He intended to fix that, just as he intended to remain with Second Squad for its next patrols. He sought out his squad leader and asked to stay in his job.Cox told him he had already spoken with Wright and the brief reassignment would stand. The observation post needed a medic, a role Soto had trained to perform. Cox was occupied with leading the rest of his squad. Some of the soldiers were calling certain patrols suicide missions; one griped to him about taking what he considered unnecessary risks. Cox was incredulous. \u201cWhat?\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cEverything we do is an unnecessary risk. It is our job!\u201dSoto moved with Third Squad to Observation Post Dallas, a small position above the valley, where soldiers took turns on radio watch and behind machine guns, defending their peers below. The place was primitive to an extreme, a set of sandbagged fighting holes cut into stone and sunbaked earth. Soldiers slept in folding cots on uneven ground, camping near a barrel of their own waste. The bunkers were infested with fleas, and the air was swarmed by flies, which moved between excrement and everything else. But some of the soldiers liked their days there. At Dallas they were unhassled by the rules and routines of the larger outpost, alone atop a ridge where bird song filled the air each dawn. Cox, on an earlier rotation, had seemed especially pleased. \u201cMy 1st command,\u201d he wrote, \u201cof a fort.\u201dOn Sept. 20, Second Squad drove north on Route Victory toward the Pech Valley to sweep an area where patrols were attacked so frequently that troops called it Ambush Alley. Soto listened to their progress while on radio watch at Dallas. He heard gunfire chatter, then a rocket-propelled grenade boom and echo. Over the radio came the reassuring sound of Cox\u2019s voice. The patrol radioed that it had crossed through the most dangerous stretch.An explosion rocked the valley. Soto guessed what it meant. A Humvee had been hit by a bomb.He waited anxiously, monitoring the back-and-forth transmissions between outpost and patrol. Multiple voices came on the radio. Cox\u2019s was absent. Soto assumed Cox was busy at the blast site, assessing what had happened, helping any wounded, organizing the squad\u2019s reaction. Other soldiers reached the crater and described what they saw. The I.E.D. had knocked the last Humvee off the road, scattering its armor, roof and doors downslope. Two soldiers had been wounded. Two more were dead. The gunner, Pvt. Joseph F. Gonzales, had been killed instantly. So had Sergeant Cox.High on the mountain to the south, Soto\u2019s eyes welled with tears.Soto usually sat directly behind Cox in the truck. If Wright had not sent him to Dallas, if Soto had won his argument over being reassigned, he would have been in his seat with his first-aid bag when the blast blew the truck apart.Barack Obama was the president-elect. The Afghan war was soon to be new again. But political wheels turned slowly, and whatever changes were in store for the war would be unlikely to happen soon enough to matter to his platoon, which was still engaged in pitched firefights. Sitting at home, looked after by his grandmother, Soto felt guilty for being away. He was relieved when it was time to return to the valley.He landed to more bad news. Three more soldiers in his platoon were shot while he was gone, and a helicopter was hit by a missile or rocket and crashed. Most of those inside scrambled out, but a sergeant was killed. The downing exposed another weakness in American plans for Afghanistan: the reluctance of the Afghan forces. After the helicopter slammed into the earth, Marines mentoring Afghan soldiers tried to rally them to the aid of passengers and crew. The Afghans refused. The patrol, they said, was not on their schedule.Soto\u2019s views of the war were hardening further, and he was unwilling to suppress what he knew. American soldiers were not going to win over Korengalis with counterinsurgency sweet talk or development projects, and they were not going to defeat militants by hanging around the outpost and trying to visit villages by day. In the news he read about the war, senior officers said what they needed to say \u2014 about Americans coaching Afghan forces, about winning over the Afghan population, about the Taliban losing ground. The brass didn\u2019t mention what he saw: that most Afghans in the valley were not interested in getting along, that Afghanistan\u2019s Army survived only under American protection and that units like his spent most of their time just trying to stay supplied and alive.Then came the order for the ambush patrol high on the ridge.Smith\u2019s plan called for the scouts to find a position up the slope and watch the trail, ready to give warning if anyone approached. They departed in single file. Soto figured a night of boredom was ahead. Near the center of the patrol base, the radio operator sat with the handset, monitoring transmissions. He had spread a poncho liner and opened an M.R.E. ration, expecting an easy run of hours.Smith rushed toward him, whispering fast. \u201cDudes are coming down the trail,\u201d he said. The radio operator asked if the scouts were coming back.\u201cNo,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Taliban.\u201d He dashed away.Soto heard movement behind him. Smith crouched between him and Specialist Molano, practically hissing. Scouts had just reported gunmen walking this way, he said, 10 or 15 people in all.Soto entered a peculiar mind-set that can settle over a combatant in the seconds before battle, a feeling of absolute, intoxicating clarity. Roles in the valley had been reversed. This time someone else was heading into a trap. He flipped his rifle\u2019s selector lever off safe. His world shrank to what rehearsals had drilled him for: peering into his sector, ready to kill. His job now was to wait. Smith alone was to decide whether the people approaching were combatants. If he decided they were, then he decided when to begin shooting. Only he could initiate fire.Soto\u2019s eye was pressed close to his night-vision device. His heart thumped in his ears.Into the dim green glow of his eyepiece stepped the shape of a man. He was carrying a rifle. Another man emerged behind him. He carried a rifle, too. Two more men stepped into view. They were about 35 yards away. The first man paused. He pointed a flashlight at the ground, switched it on and quickly switched it off.Soto felt vindicated. The Taliban fighters were ghosts no more. He had been right all along when he saw flashlights and suspected the Taliban moved openly at night. Calm settled over Soto. The approaching men were about to die.The lead man was perhaps 20 yards away.Lasers had already settled on the first two men. A green line stopped on the forehead of the first; another traced a figure-eight pattern on his chest. The second man was similarly marked.Soto moved his weapon toward the man with the machine gun and rested his aiming laser between straps on his tactical harness.The gunmen drew inside of 15 yards, then inside of 10. More fighters filled in behind them.Smith pressed the switch on the claymore. An explosion shook the forest. Steel balls slammed into the Taliban patrol. His voice sounded in the dark. \u201cFire!\u201d he said. \u201cFire! Fire!\u201dSoto fired several times into the chest of the man carrying the machine gun. The man dropped to his knees. Soto kept shooting as the man crumpled to the ground. He scanned a pandemonium made visible through his night-vision monocular. A few Taliban fighters had fallen in place. Others staggered and scattered. Tracers skipped off rocks, spinning over the ridge in hot arcs. Soto fired at the fleeing men. He thought he hit them but wasn\u2019t sure.The man Soto shot first rose. He was upright. Soto fired again. The man dove into brush. A grenade shook the forest. Soto heard familiar voices. He yelled that he was fine as he changed his rifle\u2019s magazine. The shooting stopped. A voice called out. \u201cGet ready for a counterattack!\u201dSergeants moved through the patrol base, checking their soldiers. Someone said none of the Americans had been hurt. A sergeant led Soto and two other soldiers into the kill zone to search the dead. Soto found the body of the machine-gunner he had killed. Up close, under a flashlight, he looked 16 years old. More bodies were spread through the woods. The sergeant donned latex gloves and turned the dead men\u2019s heads to photograph each face for an intelligence report. Second Platoon had killed more than 10 Taliban fighters. Now it had to get back to avoid suffering casualties of its own.The platoon filed downhill with scouts in the lead. Gunfire broke out again. Soto was farther back; he and the soldiers near him slid downhill, grabbing brush to break their falls. They found the scouts standing over three more Taliban bodies.The platoon shuffled on. Inside the column, Soto let his mind wander. He felt proud. He and his friends had killed men who had been killing them. Vengeance was satisfying, in a primal way. And this night, he thought, might have brought more than revenge. The Taliban\u2019s losses could hurt its ability to fight.Viper 2 waded back across the river before dawn and weaved uphill to the outpost\u2019s gate. The waiting soldiers were cheering. Soto heard people say that what his platoon did was monumental. Cooks prepared a hot meal, and the soldiers, back within the relative safety to their base, talked hurriedly, loudly, surging with what they had done.Soto drifted away. His legs quivered with cramps. He had been working in gore, searching the warm, bloodied bodies of Taliban fighters ripped apart by bullets and claymore mines. He washed himself by standing naked and dumping bottles of drinking water over his head. His adrenaline had ebbed, allowing him to reconsider what had happened. He realized he had been wrong about one thing. Smith was legit. He\u2019d led them through the most successful operation of their tour. But now he doubted the killing would change the company\u2019s circumstances. The valley did not work that way.Earlier, elders had appeared at the outpost\u2019s gate and asked to speak with Viper\u2019s commander, Capt. Jimmy Howell. In ordinary circumstances, their long faces might command others to hush. But the outpost was ebullient. Viper\u2019s morale had been buoyed by the settling of a score. Soldiers grinned. An awkward meeting followed. Howell took a seat among his visitors, who said the Americans had made a mistake. A child had gone missing while gathering food on the mountain, they said, and villagers sent a search party to find her. These were the men, they said, that Viper killed.Howell waited until the last elder had spoken. Then he replied. The elders\u2019 tale, he said, was one of the most ridiculous lies he had ever heard.After the ambush, Soto became Smith\u2019s radio operator, and the platoon was assigned to visit Laneyal, across the river from Aliabad, a village that served as a de facto front line, beyond which was Taliban turf. Getting there involved multiple risks. The soldiers would walk along the western side of the river, which the Taliban often raked with gunfire, and where Knight was killed. Then they would pick their way downslope to a river fork. The path was narrow, and the river was swollen with snowmelt and rain. There the soldiers would cross on wooden footbridges. The first was perhaps two feet wide. The second was a timberlike plank. First Lt. John Rodriguez, Viper\u2019s executive officer, walked with Smith, who was still learning the ground.The platoon departed in drizzle. Sheets of mist drifted across the valley. The mud was slick like grease. The valley dropped before the soldiers like a gorge. On the way down, the soldiers met an elder, Zarin, coming up. Rodriguez knew him. The two men chatted in the rain. Zarin said the path would be safe.After crossing the bridge over the western fork, the soldiers moved in single file to the plank. Laneyal loomed overhead as Soto crossed.An explosion detonated before him, heaving a cone of dirt in the air, blowing him to the ground. In the moment after, all was still. Soto\u2019s ears rang.Bullets snapped down, part of a crescendo of fire. Soto pushed himself to his feet and dashed downstream, leaping over boulders. He saw a pile of logs ahead and headed there, his radio antenna swinging from his back. He reached the logs, knelt, aimed his M4 upward and fired.\u201cStay there!\u201d Smith shouted. \u201cStay! There!\u201dSoto couldn\u2019t hear him. Rushing water and gunfire drowned out other sound. He thought Smith needed the radio. He ran down the bank and jumped into the cold water, feeling the weight of his pack and radio as his feet struck bottom. A stone building stood across the river, about 100 feet away. Gunfire tore through the air. Soto pushed himself across the stream, struggling to stay upright. He cleared the water, scrambled upright and ran to the soldiers at the building.An Air Force bomb whooshed in and exploded, sending a mushroom cloud rising where another building had been. Smith told the soldiers under Laneyal to be ready to withdraw. Now was their chance. The soldiers threw smoke grenades and retraced their steps, contracting into Aliabad, where they clustered in alleys and went through the ritual of a head count. Squad and team leaders tallied ammunition. The mood lightened. They had survived another ambush and were exhilarated to be alive.A voice called out. \u201cDewater?\u201dThere was no answer. Pfc. Richard Dewater was not in Aliabad.Nausea swept over Soto. He radioed to the outpost, in case Dewater had walked back. Dewater was not there. Nightfall was near. The soldiers moved across the bridges. The platoon spread through wheat fields to the blast hole.\u201cI found him,\u201d a voice said. Soto spun around. A sergeant was there. Dewater was not. \u201cLook up,\u201d the sergeant said, and swung a flashlight beam into the canopy of a tree. Dewater\u2019s lifeless body hung from a branch. His helmet was on. He was missing a leg.Another sergeant climbed the tree and pushed Dewater free. The soldiers placed him on a litter. Slowly they made their way across the river, panting, struggling to carry their friend.On the staircase, Afghan soldiers watched. One raised a camera. Something in Soto snapped. He stepped before the lens. \u201cWhat the fuck you doing, man?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re taking a picture of? We don\u2019t take pictures of you. Put that camera down.\u201d He shoved the man. The Afghan soldiers parted. The processional reached the road and turned north, walking in darkness and cold rain.Unknown to most of the younger soldiers, officers in Viper Company and their battalion commander were advocating a different approach. One linchpin of American strategy had been to fight away from population centers, from outposts the military sometimes called blocking positions. The troops understood the assumptions in this thinking were weak. On May 1, Taliban fighters overwhelmed a mountaintop outpost overlooking the Kunar River, killing three Americans, two Latvians and three Afghan soldiers, and taking other Afghan soldiers prisoner. In the aftermath, Lieutenant Rodriguez talked with an intelligence sergeant who had concluded, as did others who were tracking the violence, that many Korengali fighters were fighting elsewhere, at least for now, including in the Kunar Valley. This challenged American thinking about blocking positions. Taliban fighters were not blocked. They had little trouble leaving the valley at will.That month, Viper\u2019s commander, Captain Howell, sent a letter via the elders to Nasrullah, the Taliban\u2019s local leader, proposing measured withdrawal in exchange for a Taliban commitment to reconcile with the Afghan government and not to use the Korengal to stage attacks. A letter came back, saying perhaps the parties could work out a deal if the Americans would convert to Islam. Until then, Nasrullah said, New York and London would have to burn.Soto felt anxious in his last weeks in the valley. A photograph of him seconds after Dewater was killed had appeared in The New York Times. Word rushed through his circles in the city. In her apartment in Morris Avenue in the Bronx, his grandmother stared at the photo and cried. Friends wrote him on Facebook and email, urging him to keep safe. The attention was jarring. Soto had shrunk his world to a grunt\u2019s regimen and assumed a fatalistic view. Expecting to be killed had made his job easier. Now he felt pressure not to die.By mid-June, all that was left was a helicopter ride to Bagram by darkness. He and a small group of troops sat on the landing zone, on gravel and dust, backs pressed against stuffed rucksacks. They were near the mechanics\u2019 bay, where the remains of men they knew had waited in body bags for their own flights home. His tour was minutes from being over.The first sergeant appeared. Dust swirled as the aircraft descended. He grabbed Soto and shouted. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cSoto!\u201d he shouted back.\u201cSoto?\u201d The first sergeant pressed a coin-shaped medallion with the company logo into his hand, a keepsake for having served his tour. \u201cMan, you really deserve this.\u201dIn 2011, his unit was sent to Iraq to help with another American withdrawal. Now he was a sergeant and team leader on a third deployment. He had gained muscle and experience, skepticism and tattoos. Soto\u2019s time in Iraq was nothing like his Afghan tour. He and his team were part of a perimeter security force that guarded airfields as planes carried away whatever the Pentagon wanted to keep. The insurgents appeared to have decided to let them go. Soto saw no direct action; he spent more time in the gym than on patrol. But he had learned to doubt official military narratives. When he flew to Kuwait late that year, among the last Americans to leave (before the collapse of Iraqi forces in the face of an Islamic State offensive would draw the Pentagon back), he did not feel as if peace had been assured. The violent contest for Iraq was not over.By then the war in Afghanistan had absorbed the Obama administration\u2019s campaign to turn it around. The American and NATO troop surge that followed Viper Company\u2019s tour had crested, bringing more news of fighting in places few Americans had heard of before. An influx of money, equipment and advisers had swelled Afghan Army and police numbers and distributed fresh forces over the ground. The latest plan was for the Americans to secure the country, usher in government services and then hand over the countryside to Afghan troops.But ministries and armies are not remade in a few years, and many American units were dispatched into lightly populated areas and the same sort of hard-to-maintain positions that previous commanders decided were ineffective, risky and not worth their cost. It was as if one cycle of senior officers had not learned from the previous round. Moreover, several regions were also engines of opium-poppy production, where a foreign military presence threatened an established local economy and provoked armed interests with no intention of losing it. The thinking behind the offensive could sound good in the general officers\u2019 suites. At the lower ranks, Marines and soldiers were fighting small, brutal and frustrating actions, protected from being overrun by air power while losing lives and legs on ground, like the Korengal Valley, that the Pentagon did not intend to keep and had few viable proxies to pass off to.The Taliban showed no sign of folding. Its bombs grew more sophisticated, even as its spokesmen taunted the Americans and their proxies on Twitter. Many American soldiers and lower-level officers saw that the Afghan surge was not succeeding, and that the Taliban would wait for the drawdown. Some of them, after a decade of war, in command of an array of fire support unmatched by any military in the world, adopted cautious tempos and spoke to their troops in knowing euphemisms, including \u201ctactical patience,\u201d a concept at odds with the aggressive ethos of infantry units but in line with an understanding that the plan was flawed. Roughly translated, it meant: \u201cDon\u2019t let your people be the last soldiers killed in this war.\u201dSoto and his fellow veterans from the Korengal watched from afar, clustered on social media, memorializing their own list of dead: David Paquet, Michael Dinterman, Marques Knight, John Penich, Joseph Gonzales, Ezra Dawson, Richard Dewater, Nathan Cox. A list including the wounded showed that the cost was larger; after a Marine who worked with them committed suicide and a postwar motorcycle accident claimed a forward observer, some of them wondered if it was larger still.And then it was someone else\u2019s turn. Sgt. Robert Soto left the Army with an honorable discharge in 2012, driving home to New York in a U-haul truck towing a red Camaro he kept almost as clean as the rifle he left behind. War had come to his city when he was a child. Now he was ready to try peace. He moved in with his grandmother in the Bronx and used his G.I. Bill benefits to enroll at Monroe College. Except for occasional visits to the nearby V.A. center for treatment for anxiety and insomnia, he mostly kept his status as a veteran to himself.In 2014, he transferred to Columbia University, where he avoided the vocal veterans\u2019 group on campus and rarely flashed the visual signals \u2014 the caps, T-shirts, bags and Velcro patches \u2014 that can convey recent service to the larger tribe. Sometimes to sleep he drank, enough that friends and his grandmother were concerned, but he was also making grades, working out, staying socially active. He landed a role in a musical and in 2017 performed at the war museum on the decommissioned U.S.S. Intrepid. That summer he graduated with a degree in political science. The Ivy League\u2019s imprimatur had been bestowed upon him, but he did not want to wear it. Apprehensive about having his life taken over by a conventional career, he still had dreams of being an artist. He worked part time \u2014 in construction, installing and removing scaffolding, in child care \u2014 while trying to break into the music industry. He had grown up on the street and then at war. Writing and recording music was the resumption of his long dream of becoming a performer, and felt like the childhood he never had. Much of what he wrote was about life in New York, but he recorded other tracks, like one he called \u201cGala,\u201d with a refrain that called back to the war:No more pain for all my guysJust ChampagneLet\u2019s taste the sky.Still he wondered: Was there no accountability for the senior officer class? The war was turning 17, and the services and the Pentagon seemed to have been given passes on all the failures and the drift. Even if the Taliban were to sign a peace deal tomorrow, there would be no rousing sense of victory, no parade. In Iraq, the Islamic State metastasized in the wreckage of the war to spread terror around the world. The human costs were past counting, and the whitewash was both institutional and personal, extended to one general after another, including many of the same officers whose plans and orders had either fizzled or failed to create lasting success, and yet who kept rising. Soto watched some of them as they were revered and celebrated in Washington and by members of the press, even after past plans were discredited and enemies retrenched.On that point Soto\u2019s views were unsparing. Good people paid in blood and sorrow, sent to graves or subjected to suffering for which there was no reckoning. It fit a pattern he now could see. Viper\u2019s war was the Korengal Outpost, for four years a showcase of American resolve only to become the subject of an Al Jazeera report of Taliban fighters strolling through its remains. Soto did not see himself as special. Many others served there, and he knew countless combat veterans could name emptied outposts across Afghanistan and Iraq that were also mostly forgotten, except among those who fought from them, told, in their time, that it mattered.Some days he accepted it. Others he could not square what he heard with what he and his fellow veterans had lived. The dead were not replaceable, and they had been lost in a place the Army did not need them to be. Sometimes, when he was awake in the restless hours between midnight and dawn, his memories of lost friends orbiting his mind, Soto entertained the questions. What befell those who sent them? Did generals lose sleep, too? \u201cThey just failed as leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should know: They failed, as leaders. They let us down.\u201dLate this spring, before a recording session in a rented sound studio near Times Square, Soto visited his grandmother on Morris Avenue. He and his father looked through a closet that held old uniforms and keepsakes from his enlistment. In the collection was a small Amazon delivery box. Soto had received the package when a helicopter brought mail to the Korengal Outpost in 2008. Its tape had been torn open, but its contents remained undisturbed \u2014 a paperback book gift-wrapped in green. Its gold ribbon was pristine. It was the copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d he had ordered for Sergeant Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday. It had arrived after Cox\u2019s death.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Demystifying Online Privacy, Through the Story of the Man Who Took On Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI usually think of myself as a politics reporter, the job I\u2019ve had, on and off, for most of my career. But in the last year or so, I\u2019ve had to add another title, one I never thought I\u2019d have: tech reporter.My colleagues and I have reported extensively over the last year on the enormous power wielded by tech companies over politics and commerce and on the ways in which that power can be abused. Our reporting has shed light on how poorly tech companies protect the integrity of their platforms and of the data you hand them for free, with profound consequences.Yet both Facebook and Google, and the broader tech industry of which they are a part, have escaped any major regulation or seriously punitive government action in the United States. (In Europe, Google was recently hit with a $5 billion fine for antitrust violations.) Even after a cascade of scandals, Washington had done almost nothing. Why?Mr. Mactaggart, who last year began organizing to pass a California ballot initiative restricting the abuse of personal data, turned out to be an ideal way to answer the question. For one thing, his campaign was happening in real time, and as a political neophyte, he was encountering Silicon Valley\u2019s political machine for the first time, much as most readers would be. Mr. Mactaggart was not an expert on privacy when he started; he was a wealthy real estate developer from Oakland, whose main interaction with people in the tech world was at Bay Area birthday parties and his neighborhood dog run. He more or less fell into a rabbit hole and became a little obsessed. That journey allowed me to turn an arcane and often boring subject into a compelling yarn; his education \u2014 as a political campaigner and as a consumer \u2014 becomes the reader\u2019s.That was important for me, too, as a reporter. I often write about complex policy issues, and questions surrounding data collection, advertising and privacy can be challenging to unspool in a compelling, accessible way.I used to write about campaign finance; that\u2019s a complicated topic, too, and it was easy to lose readers\u2019 attention. But writing about data and privacy is harder. Presidential campaigns lend a certain innate drama to stories about donors and fund-raising. Tech and social media, while in one sense nearer to people\u2019s daily lives, can seem distant and abstract. For those who have no background in programming or data science, the industry they animate can seem impenetrable.This is no accident. One reason Big Tech faces so little resistance from policymakers is that Silicon Valley\u2019s business seems so daunting. I find that Big Tech\u2019s lobbyists and \u201cthought leaders\u201d \u2014 and some journalists \u2014 implicitly and sometimes explicitly promote the idea that policymakers are too dumb, slow or unsophisticated to understand how it all works, let alone regulate something like data collection practices. This notion also helps insulate the industry from accountability.The story of how Mr. Mactaggart forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law is, in part, a story of the power of this idea \u2014 and also of its flimsiness. The law he helped pass is not a panacea, and won\u2019t solve every problem raised by the encroaching powers of Big Tech. Some critics believe the law doesn\u2019t go far enough. (And many in the industry believe it goes way too far.) But the fact of it \u2014 the political proof of concept \u2014 has already stirred intense debate and pressure to produce even more protections for consumers, not only in other states but in Washington.That matters not only for consumers, but also for readers. Mr. Mactaggart is a smart guy, and he had time and resources most people don\u2019t. But he\u2019s not an expert on politics or technology. If he can figure it out, so can you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Economic Claims Are Overblown", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Rattner served as counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.Yes, the economy is continuing to expand nicely, which all Americans should celebrate. But no, there\u2019s nothing remarkable in the overall results since Mr. Trump took office. Most importantly, there is little evidence that the president\u2019s policies have meaningfully improved the fortunes of those \u201cforgotten\u201d Americans who elected him.Let\u2019s start with the jobs numbers. While the latest figures are certainly positive, the United States has been adding jobs since well before Mr. Trump took office. And the rate of job growth during Mr. Trump\u2019s first 19 months in office (194,000 jobs per month) is slightly less than the rate at which jobs were added during President Barack Obama\u2019s final 19 months (205,000 per month). So the good news on jobs is the same good news Americans have been hearing for the last three years.Monthly totals, in thousands.300Obama average:205,000Trump average:194,0002001000201620172018JULY300Obama average:205,000Trump average:194,0002001000201620172018JULYBy The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsWith each month\u2019s jobs figures, the Labor Department also releases the latest wage data, which often gets short shrift in the news accounts. That\u2019s unfortunate because for a majority of the roughly 150 million Americans who have jobs, the income picture is harsh and not improving.After adjusting for inflation, wages have barely increased during the Trump presidency. When July\u2019s Consumer Price Index is reported next week, it is likely to show that whatever modest increase workers are getting in their wages continues to be eaten up by rising prices.Over the first 18 months since Mr. Trump took office, real earnings, which reflect earnings after accounting for inflation, rose at an annual rate of just 0.3 percent.Rising prices have been eating up most of the modest increases in workers\u2019 pay. Real average hourly earnings, year over year percent change.+4%+2Obama average: 0.8%0Trump:0.3%\u2013220102012201420162018+4%+2Obama average: 0.8%Trump average: 0.3%0\u20132201020112012201320142015201620172018By The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsThen there\u2019s the matter of the seemingly stellar second-quarter increase in gross domestic product of 4.1 percent. That also requires context. For one thing, quarterly numbers can be volatile, and the most recent figure includes an unusual number of special factors.Another one-time event propping up growth is the rush by farmers to export more soybeans, particularly to China, before July 6, the date when tariffs on soybeans went into effect. That accounted for about 0.6 percent of the growth in the second quarter, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm.Without these extraordinary interventions, the underlying rate of economic expansion in the second quarter of this year was about 2.7 percent, according to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal policy research and advocacy group.That\u2019s the key lesson from all these numbers: Whatever claims Mr. Trump may make about the economy as the midterm elections approach, most Americans have yet to experience any improvement in their economic well-being. And there\u2019s little sign of that sorry situation changing. In fact, it could even get worse.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Andrew Gillum Win in Florida?", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats are trying to win over red and purple America with inspiration.Opinion ColumnistFlorida is a state so closely divided between Democratic and Republican voters that differences in turnout levels often determine election winners.For years, Democrats have tried to win statewide races in purple states like Florida \u2014 and red states like Georgia \u2014 by nominating moderates who could woo swing voters. But now the party is trying something different. With a push from Democratic primary voters, it has adopted a strategy that the left has long urged. The party has nominated unabashed progressives for governor in both Georgia and Florida \u2014 and will try to win by inspiring left-leaning voters whose turnout has often lagged, such as younger adults and non-whites.It\u2019s one of the most fascinating subplots of the 2018 midterms. If Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor, can win in Florida, and Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator, can win in Georgia, it will suggest a big lesson for the 2020 presidential race: A turnout-first, persuasion-second strategy can work. That Gillum and Abrams aren\u2019t only proud progressives but also African-American would only add to the lesson.But persuading people who don\u2019t normally vote to do so can be extremely difficult. Voting is time-consuming and inconvenient, and many Americans think their vote doesn\u2019t matter. And in basic arithmetic terms, winning over a swing voter is twice as valuable as turning out an infrequent voter from the left.In Gillum\u2019s case, I think he is emphasizing a couple of issues that will turn off some swing voters.

But since then, Mr. Musk \u2014 who is chatty on Twitter but has a testy relationship with journalists \u2014 had not spoken to the press.By Thursday, appetite for stories about Mr. Musk and Tesla was still strong, and I was part of a team pursuing several leads. The goal was to explain what was happening inside Tesla, and to the extent we could, inside Mr. Musk\u2019s own head. At best, we hoped we might get some of his associates, or perhaps even a Tesla board member, to speak to us on the record. And while we had been trying to get Mr. Musk to agree to an interview for days, working through intermediaries, it wasn\u2019t looking promising. The company was in damage control mode, and no one seemed to be talking.Then, suddenly, Mr. Musk was on the phone.While each of those articles was different, my interactions with the executives were more or less the same. There was almost always a public relations representative for the company in the room, hovering nearby to make sure the boss didn\u2019t say something inappropriate. The C.E.O.s usually stuck to talking points that portrayed their companies, and themselves, in a flattering light. And the executives \u2014 all of whom have had hours of media training \u2014 usually delivered crisp, if dry, answers to just about any question I threw at them. They were programmed not to say anything that might make them appear vulnerable, and certainly not anything that might raise suspicions about their ability to lead a company.\u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said early in the conversation. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dBut the most intense moments of the interview came when I asked Mr. Musk whether his extreme work ethic was taking a toll on his physical and emotional well-being.\u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dHe paused, the line going quiet as he was seemingly overcome by emotion.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMidway through our conversation, I asked Mr. Musk if he believed he had turned a corner. Were things about to get better for him?\u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint,\u201d he said.It was the kind of bland answer I\u2019ve come to expect from the C.E.O. of a public company, and I assumed he had completed his thought.Then, after a moment of silence, Mr. Musk continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dIt was one of the most extraordinary interviews of my career, and by one simple measure it was a first: In all the conversations I\u2019ve had with business leaders over the years, not until Elon Musk got on the phone had an executive revealed such vulnerability. By speaking with such candor \u2014 choking up, pausing repeatedly to regain his composure \u2014 Mr. Musk made clear just what a steep toll his work was taking on his personal life. It was a reminder that despite all their efforts to make the public believe otherwise, C.E.O.s have feelings, too.Advertisement"}

He said the authorities were not sure when the crash occurred but believed it may have been Friday.He was found by a driver around 7:30 a.m. on Monday and was quickly taken to the Ouachita County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201cHe just wanted human interaction,\u201d said Detective Greeley, who helped take care of the boy at the office. \u201cHe was mostly hungry, thirsty and scratched from head to toe.\u201dSheriff\u2019s office employees bathed the child and bought him new clothes.

An officer crawled into the car and cut the seat out of the car with scissors.

We\u2019re all a big family ourselves.\u201dSoon Mr. Holliman came to pick up his grandchildren, whom the authorities did not identify. He told officials that his daughter, Lisa Holliman, 25, had been pregnant at the time of her death.\u201cWe lost two,\u201d Mr. Holliman told KARK.\u201cIt was hard to see my grandson laying there like that, all cut up,\u201d he said.The boys are now with their grandparents. Mr. Holliman and other family members did not immediately return phone calls or respond to emails and Facebook messages.Detective Greeley said he saw the 3-year-old boy again the day after he was taken into the office.\u201cHe was in good spirits and a completely different child,\u201d the detective said. \u201cHe even talked to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She moved to New York by herself at age 23, without speaking much English. Eventually, she became a nanny for an Iranian family.To assuage her homesickness, she started cooking regularly for the first time in her life. She found Persian ingredients at markets in Queens, and with practice she built her skills. \u201cIt was always very simple things, rice and lentils,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for the children, it was something new. They loved it.\u201d After nine years in New York, she was able to return to Iran to visit her family. Tasting Persian food again after such a long absence made her realize its wealth, complexity and diversity. She saw how the flavors build on one another, how experienced cooks coaxed different nuances out of herbs, spices, and all manner of meats and vegetables depending on the technique they used. Whenever she went back to visit, she traveled across the country, cooking, eating, writing down recipes and immersing herself in the history of the ancient cuisine. She interrupted her story as the herbs and onions were starting to shrivel and blacken. \u201cYou see, they are really burning,\u201d she said, pointing to the sticky brown coating on the bottom of both pans. \u201cI do this intentionally. This is how to build the flavors.\u201d She added that this is not how the sauce is made in Iran, where it\u2019s cooked much more slowly at a lower heat. But she prefers the complexity of the dark caramelization. This kind of updated, gutsy touch is evident across her menu, where she\u2019s not afraid to rebel against tradition.\u201cI\u2019m going to upset some people because I\u2019m going to do pork and I\u2019m going to do scallops, which you can\u2019t get in Iran,\u201d she said.Her chefs take over entirely once customers start arriving, allowing Ms. Alikhani to float from table to table in her small restaurant, as if she were hosting a giant dinner party in her home.\u201cThen I realized, I cannot start with this,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt I needed to show my guests more special occasion food, how Persians throw parties.

{"Headline": "What Father Bradel Did to Me", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe power of seeing one priest\u2019s name on a list.Ms. McCormick is the author of several books.But what stunned me was my second reaction: a perplexing disappointment that I still don\u2019t know whether I was his only victim. Of course, I didn't want others to have experienced what I did. But I did want some confirmation that his behavior was part of a pattern. In the 1960s, Catholic priests were a special class of bachelors, fed pot roast dinners by a bucket brigade of parish women, so when Father Bradel came to our house in central Pennsylvania for the first of many regular visits, my mother got out the good china. When my mother asked about the Catholic teacher\u2019s defiant assignment, the priest slammed his palm on table. The plates jumped. The water in the water glasses sloshed. The lamp over the table vibrated ever so slightly. \u201cI want to know what Patty thinks,\u201d he said. He turned his mastiff-like head in my direction. My three younger sisters looked at me in awe, as if they were expecting me to turn the water into wine. My father looked on in pity. My mother adopted a pose of polite curiosity. I found myself answering, slowly at first, then, under the blaze of his questions, articulating an opinion in favor of the assignment. Until now, ours was a home where only the adults had opinions. I waited to be sent away from the table for this heresy \u2014 or for my mother to mete out the real punishment later, to the backs of my legs with a wooden spoon. But when I finished, Father Bradel made the sign of the cross over my head. My father exhaled. My mother adopted a tight smile. Amen. The dinners became a tradition. One night, Father Bradel arrived early. My mother, who grew up in an era when girls tap-danced or recited poetry for guests, said to me, \u201cGo in the living room and entertain Father Bradel.\u201d She ushered the two of us into the living room, that museum of suburban propriety, and left. Father Bradel and I stood there awkwardly, as if we were waiting to be introduced. He was wearing a long black cassock and stiff white clerical collar; I was in my school uniform and knee socks. With no warning, he pulled me to him, crushing me in the blackness of his robe, my cheek so close to his heart that I could hear it pounding. He pulled back, appraising me. I looked away, terrified by this display, focusing intently on a nearby studio portrait of me and my sisters. He bent his knees, so we were at eye level, and tipped my chin toward him. Then he kissed me, his lips wet and flaccid, his mouth open wide enough that his teeth dug into my lower lip. His tongue probed for mine. I stood frozen, my arms at my sides. It was my first kiss.\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve heard,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m leaving the priesthood.\u201d I hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cI\u2019ve come for your blessing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. with me,\u201d I said. Then, years later, my mother told me, out of the blue, that the local diocese had a list. \u201cYour name is on it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Father Bradel.\u201dI didn\u2019t know why there would be such a list, but I told her that he used to kiss me every time I had to entertain him. She put her hand over her heart. \u201cNot Father Bradel!\u201d she said. I decided to notify church officials in the Harrisburg diocese about what had happened with Father Bradel \u2014 and to try and find out what list my mother was talking about. I told the priest to whom my call was transferred that I didn\u2019t plan to take legal action or want a monetary settlement. I just wanted to make a report. The other end of the line was quiet. \u201cDo you want to know the name of the priest?\u201d I said. \u201cIt was Fred Bradel, from Good Shepherd.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s been dead for several years,\u201d the man said, not missing a beat. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing we can do about it now.\u201dI\u2019d somehow expected that the man would need a few minutes to search his records, but he seemed to have the information at his fingertips. \u201cHe left the priesthood in 1975 and was laicized in 1977,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been a priest for 28 years.\u201dI told him I knew that. \u201cI\u2019m calling,\u201d I said, \u201cbecause I\u2019d heard my name is on a list compiled by the diocese.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about any list,\u201d he said. \u201cI can assure you he never would have done anything to be on a list.\u201d I asked if I could report my experience, for the record. \u201cThe diocese has a clinical support counselor you can talk to,\u201d he said. \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cSo, who are you?\u201d \u201cMy role is to be the advocate for the priests.\u201d It took me a minute to understand: My call had been forwarded not to a victim\u2019s advocate but to the priest in charge of defending the other priests.I called back and spoke to the diocese counselor. He took notes; asked questions; and, I remember, promised to pass my report on to the district attorney. And he apologized on behalf of the church. The seriousness with which he treated my account worked a small miracle. It made real what had once been unspeakable. I had long ago lost my faith in the Catholic Church, which had been so meaningful to me. But this man seemed determined to do anything he could to help me heal. \u201cWill you check into whether anyone else reported Father Bradel?\u201d I asked. He called a week later to apologize. He wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about other victims. Now, thanks to a grand jury in Pennsylvania, there\u2019s a real list \u2014 and it includes my report to the counselor. My name isn\u2019t on it. I\u2019m identified simply as \u201cthe survivor\u201d who reported \u201cyears of inappropriate behavior.\u201d There are several names I recognize in the lengthy report from Pennsylvania: a priest from the parish five miles to the east of mine; a priest from the parish four miles to the west; a priest who taught at my high school. I read the report feeling sick, digesting the accounts of rape, the long list of names with cases involving \u201cindecent behavior\u201d and \u201cchild pornography\u201d \u2014 and was heartbroken to imagine who among my classmates also were harmed.I\u2019m grateful that the attorney general did what the diocese wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m still curious, though, as to whether I\u2019m the only one Father Bradel preyed upon. I hope so. But I doubt it. Advertisement"}

I feel so at home, walking down the street, seeing people who probably agree with my opinion.\u2019\u201dMost notable, though, is her word-of-mouth success. Her voice has been greeted as something identifiably new: the arrival of millennial fiction. She has been called \u201cthe Jane Austen of the precariat,\u201d and compared to hipster luminaries like Greta Gerwig and Lena Dunham.And it is true, her characters are people we haven\u2019t encountered much in print. They communicate through emails and instant messaging, but do not regard these as degraded forms: They do not just speak, but compose their remarks, like characters in an Oscar Wilde play. They are skeptical of the ability of markets to provide people with a decent life. They view human relationships \u2014 especially sex \u2014 as deeply political, worthy of unsparing and precise analysis, but do not seem to read the newspaper. Standing at the threshold of adult life, they halt, failing to see any reason to proceed.Ms. Rooney, who wrote \u201cConversations With Friends\u201d while studying for a master\u2019s degree in American literature, expected to reach readers like herself, \u201cpeople who share my ideology or have a similarly jaundiced view of social systems.\u201d Her mass-market success is clearly still a little disorienting. \u201cLight and sparkling is the phrase that has been used,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t complain if people think it\u2019s sparkling, but then there\u2019s a sense that wasn\u2019t what I set out to do.\u201d****As a student in a Catholic high school a decade ago, Ms. Rooney was required to attend lectures by Pure in Heart, an organization that discouraged premarital sex. The presenters, having gathered a roomful of teenage girls, would ask for a volunteer to extend her arm and would display a length of clear adhesive tape, telling them that the tape signified them as virgins.\u201cThis is you when you decide to sleep with your boyfriend,\u201d they would say, attaching the tape to the girl\u2019s arm and peeling it off, now cloudy with skin cells. Then they would do the same thing multiple times, to signify multiple partners, so that the tape was clogged with dirty particles, and hold it up before the class, asking, \u201cWould you want to marry this?\u201dMs. Rooney and her classmates sat there, smirking. \u201cNo piece of Sellotape strikes me as an adequate marital partner,\u201d she said. \u201cWe perceived them as bizarre.\u201d The abortion ban, she said, was more offensive: \u201cIt felt like a vestige of a culture that was not in tune with how people were living their lives.\u201dHer characters long for the analytic way, too, but are jolted out of it, again and again, often by sex. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe in the idea of the individual,\u201d Ms. Rooney said. \u201cI find myself consistently drawn to writing about intimacy, and the way we construct one another.\u201d\u201cIn my parents\u2019 generation, or even before that, people who are in their 30s or 40s, you\u2019d go to college and it was easier to get a job in one of the big law firms, and you\u2019ll be set up \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to get a mortgage,\u201d said Ms. Rooney\u2019s partner, John Prasifka, 25, a high school math teacher. \u201cOur generation is seeing that\u2019s not worked out for us.\u201dEarlier generations may have naturally shed their leftist beliefs as they lofted into the middle class, he added.

The attention is hard for her to bear. During an interview in Dublin, she worried aloud that novelists are over-glamorized, and said newspapers should write more profiles of nurses or bus drivers.\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that I am not a very important person, and being treated like one gives me strange feelings,\u201d she explained in an email. She lingered over the question of whether, in a world facing climate change and white nationalism, novels about intimate relationships \u2014 \u201csmall lives\u201d \u2014 serve a political purpose. At some point, I realized I was no longer central to the conversation; she seemed to be interrogating herself.\u201cYou cannot write about what people are really like without making a political adjudication,\u201d she said. \u201cAll our ideas of what human nature consists of, or how people really feel and experience life are at their base political ideas.\u201d Then she paused, and gave a different answer. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to convince anyone of anything, and sometimes I feel, if I really believe this is the state the planet is in, why should I write novels? I must enjoy it.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Sally Rooney\u2019s age in May, during Ireland\u2019s abortion referendum.

{"Headline": "\u2018A Wound to the Heart of Genoa\u2019: Italy Buries Victims of Bridge Collapse", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Italy mourned those killed in the collapse of a bridge in the northern city of Genoa with a state funeral on Saturday as the country struggled to come to terms with a tragedy that government officials, families of victims and some experts say could have been prevented. But some families of the victims boycotted the event.Flags flew at half-staff across the country on a day of national mourning. Stores shut their doors or draped black ribbons on their windows. And a solemn ceremony was held in Genoa for 19 of the victims of the Aug. 14 collapse.The death toll rose to 40 on Saturday when one of the 10 wounded people still in hospital died and another victim was found, according to local officials. At least three people are still missing and a car matching the description of their vehicle was discovered on Saturday morning. But no bodies were found with the car.\u201cThe wound is deep, created above all by the boundless pain for those who have lost their lives and for the missing, for their family members, the injured, the many who have lost their homes,\u201d he said.The ceremony, which was broadcast live on Italian television, was interrupted by applause when Cardinal Bagnasco read the first name of each confirmed victim. Most were Italian, but others were Albanian, Chilean or French.Dozens of firefighters attended the ceremony, and they were met with applause and handshakes, an acknowledgment of their tireless efforts \u2014 more than 100 uninterrupted hours so far \u2014 to the dead and help the wounded.The funeral followed the Roman Catholic ritual, but the families of two Muslim victims attended and an imam led a prayer after the Catholic rite.He prayed that \u201cour Genoa,\u201d \u201cbeautiful Genoa,\u201d would be able to lift itself up.Cardinal Bagnasco spoke of suffering and the solidarity that the city had shown and received.\u201cThe highway that collapsed, as is known, was not just an important piece of highway, but a necessary route for the daily life of many, an essential artery for the development of the city,\u201d the cardinal said.He urged the city not to give up.\u201cWe can build new bridges and walk together,\u201d he said.In contrast, tempers flared on Friday in Torre del Greco, near Naples, at the funeral of four young men. The four friends in their 20s died on their way to Barcelona, Spain.But then he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not right to die because of negligence, carelessness, irresponsibility, superficiality, bureaucracy or boredom.\u201dOutside the church, friends of the young men hoisted a bedsheet scrawled with a condemnation: \u201cThere is no forgiveness without justice.\u201dCalling the deaths \u201cabsurd,\u201d he told reporters that he would not rest until those responsible for the collapse of the bridge were found.Another person listed among the missing had contacted relatives, the official said, calling it \u201cthe only good news.\u201dLuca Cari, a spokesman for Italy\u2019s firefighters, said that their work would continue until all the rubble has been cleared. Only then would they be certain that no one else had been killed by falling debris.Some of Italy\u2019s top officials, including President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, also attended the state funeral on Saturday.Before the ceremony, Mr. Mattarella spoke to the families of the victims, huddled along a line of dark coffins. At the center was the small, white coffin of Samuele Robbiano, 8, who died with his parents on the way to catch a ferry to Sardinia.\u201cThis tragedy that involved our entire country is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Mattarella said after the funeral. He added that he had pledged to support the families of the victims, the injured and the homeless; to find the causes of the collapse \u201crigorously and quickly\u201d and to ensure the safety of Italy\u2019s roads and transportation.Though Saturday was meant to be a day of mourning, hostilities continued between the government and Autostrade per l\u2019Italia, which had been responsible for maintaining the highway that included the Genoa bridge.The government started a formal procedure to revoke the concession held by Autostrade.A government statement said that it held Autostrade responsible for the \u201cgrave disaster\u201d because it had the \u201cobligation to look after the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the highway.\u201d The government said Autostrade had 15 days to present its defense.In their first public appearance since the collapse, the company\u2019s top executives pledged to build a new bridge in record time, and said that funds had been set aside to assist the families of the victims.\u201cWe will do whatever we can to alleviate their suffering, and also that of Genoa, which was wounded,\u201d Fabio Cerchiai, Autostrade\u2019s chairman, said during a televised news conference.Giovanni Castellucci, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Autostrade felt for the victims and their families and would cooperate with an investigation, but stopped short of accepting responsibility for the collapse.\u201cThe bridge,\u201d he noted, \u201cwas considered safe for good reasons, but something happened, that\u2019s clear.\u201dThe company said it was willing to build a new steel bridge at the site, in about eight months, and that Autostrade was already at work on a project, \u201cto give a response to the needs of the city.\u201d\u201cWe know we can give much and do much for Genoa,\u201d Mr. Castellucci said. \u201cWe are here.\u201dBut Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister, rejected the company\u2019s overtures, writing on Facebook that the government \u2014 which on Saturday allocated more than $32 million to the city in emergency funds \u2014 \u201cwon\u2019t accept charity from Autostrade.\u201d\u201cWe demand credible compensation, and there won\u2019t be any trade off,\u201d he wrote. \u201cApologies don\u2019t help much and there is no way to alleviate the suffering of a city destroyed by grief.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Banned Infowars. Now What?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftLate on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Mark Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.For weeks, the Facebook chief executive and his colleagues had debated what to do about Infowars, the notorious far-right news site, and Alex Jones, Infowars\u2019 choleric founder, who became famous for his spittle-flecked rants and far-fetched conspiracies, including the idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax promoted by gun-control supporters.Mr. Jones is just one Facebook user out of 2.2 billion, but he had become symbolic of tech platforms\u2019 inconsistency and reluctance to engage in a misinformation war.These posts clearly violated Facebook\u2019s hate speech rules. And in a normal situation, a low-level content moderator might have reviewed them, found that they qualified, and taken them down.The situation was volatile enough that Mr. Zuckerberg got personally engaged, according to two people involved in Facebook\u2019s handling of the accounts. He discussed Infowars at length with other executives, and mused privately about whether Mr. Jones \u2014 who once called Mr. Zuckerberg a \u201cgenetic-engineered psychopath\u201d in a video \u2014 was purposefully trying to get kicked off the platform to gain attention, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg, an engineer by training and temperament, has always preferred narrow process decisions to broad, subjective judgments. His evaluation of Infowars took the form of a series of technical policy questions. They included whether the mass-reporting of Infowars posts constituted coordinated \u201cbrigading,\u201d a tactic common in online harassment campaigns. Executives also debated whether Mr. Jones should receive a \u201cstrike\u201d for each post containing hate speech (which would lead to removing his pages as well as the individual posts) or a single, collective strike (which would remove the posts, but leave his pages up).\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,\u201d he said.Slippery-slope fears about mass censorship by social media platforms are probably overblown. For starters, Infowars presented an unusual case because of its size, the extreme nature of its content and the ferocity of Mr. Jones\u2019s critics. Mr. Zuckerberg does not have time to adjudicate every dispute over hate speech on Facebook, nor does he want to.One lesson Mr. Zuckerberg has taken from the Infowars saga, said the people involved in the handling of Mr. Jones\u2019s Facebook accounts, is that the social network\u2019s policies are overly complex and need to be simplified. Privately, company officials have also downplayed the Infowars bans, saying they don\u2019t represent a watershed moment in the online free speech debate, but are rather a matter of how to enforce Facebook\u2019s existing policies.This is a convenient narrative, of course, from a company that would rather haggle over terms of service than discuss the power and governance of its platform.There are legitimate questions, still unanswered, about what to do about the huge, unaccountable corporations that control large pieces of our modern communications infrastructure. Both fans and critics of Infowars can probably agree that a system in which one executive can decide to shut off a news organization\u2019s access to a large portion of its audience is hardly ideal.There are also valid questions about why Infowars got so popular in the first place, and whether attention-maximizing platforms like Facebook and YouTube are designed in ways so that people like Mr. Jones are incentivized to push the boundaries of acceptable speech.After all, these platforms didn\u2019t just host Infowars content for those who were seeking it \u2014 they actively promoted it to millions of people for years, through algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines that decide which videos to show you next. Could these platforms be redesigned so that the next Alex Jones never gets that kind of boost, and remains on the ideological fringes?These questions will have to wait. For now, tech leaders seem satisfied to have dealt with their Infowars problems, at least temporarily. They will return to their defensive crouch, hiding their power behind policies, making small changes under pressure, and hoping that nobody notices the size of their footprints.Advertisement"}

While Mr. Monahan\u2019s account described a video that he says showed Mr. Ellison pulling her off the bed, Ms. Monahan described an episode in 2016 in which he \u201ckept trying to drag me off the bed.\u201d She did not mention a video.A full list of elections for the House and Senate, including which races matter most for congressional control.Mr. Monahan wrote on Facebook that his mother experienced \u201cpure hell\u201d during the relationship with Mr. Ellison, 55. He wrote that he had uncovered, on his mother\u2019s computer in 2017, more than 100 messages between them that showed she had been bullied and threatened.\u201cThere is a lot more he has done to my mom,\u201d Mr. Monahan wrote. \u201cMy brother and I were so angry and hurt for our mom. We were ready to go public but our mom begged us not to and she along with others convinced us it wasn\u2019t in our moms best interest.\u201dIn the email she sent on Sunday to The Times, Ms. Monahan said it had been \u201ca very difficult time for me and my family\u201d and she \u201cwas not in a place to talk.\u201d The Monahans did not respond Monday to messages for further comment or an opportunity to review the messages and video.Ms. Monahan said in her email that she started to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder around 2014, and was in poor health when the relationship ended, a point for which they gave different dates.\u201cMy hair was falling out, I had severe pain in my neck, back and legs,\u201d Ms. Monahan wrote. \u201cMy social life was suffering due to isolation, my work was slipping and it was all becoming noticeable. I became someone I didn\u2019t recognize, on the inside or out.\u201dMr. Ellison separated from his wife, Kim Ellison, in 2010 and the couple divorced in 2012 after a marriage of more than two decades.Ms. Ellison defended him on Monday in an email to The Times. She said the allegations were not consistent with \u201canything that I experienced during the time that I have known him.\u201d\u201cWe may be divorced, but we are still a family,\u201d wrote Ms. Ellison, who said they met as teenagers four decades ago. \u201cThe behavior described does not match the character of the Keith I know.\u201dJonathan Martin contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Way to Detect Breast Cancer", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIXESFor poorer people in India and many other countries, a computer engineer has found a way to detect breast cancer without radiation. Ms. Cousins writes about health issues and gender inequality in South Asia.Not long before Mihir Shah was to be married in 2007, his soon-to-be mother-in-law got a diagnosis of breast cancer. She underwent chemotherapy and survived, wearing a wig to the wedding.But while the women in Mr. Shah\u2019s family \u2014 in both India and the United States \u2014 were able to get breast cancer screening, it made him think of the millions who weren\u2019t as fortunate.More than 90 percent of women in the developing world don\u2019t have access to early detection of breast cancer. One reason is that mammograms, the gold-standard screening technique, are rarely used because of their high cost and a lack of trained radiologists. India has one radiologist for every 100,000 people; the United States has 12. Then there are logistical challenges like a lack of electricity and poor roads. Many people are not aware of cancer, and the disease still carries a stigma. As a result, patients turn up for treatment at advanced stages of the disease. Too often, a quick death is inevitable.Such poor survival statistics propelled Mr. Shah, a computer engineer, to ask: Is it possible to offer women breast cancer screening that doesn\u2019t rely on mammograms? He knew that whatever device he designed would have to be usable by community health care workers, the backbone of most developing countries\u2019 health systems. It would also have to be portable and battery operated. And screening would have to affordable and painless. In 2015, Mr. Shah asked Dr. Brian Englander, an associate professor of clinical radiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, to lead an evaluation of iBreastExam. Dr. Englander first assumed the technology would fail. \u201cMammography is the standard of care,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that deviates from it, we\u2019re skeptical.\u201d \u201cI hope something like the iBreastExam would be accepted in the United States because there\u2019s places and groups that don\u2019t have access\u201d to breast cancer screening, Dr. Englander said. Dr. Englander points to the number of women in the United States who refuse mammograms because they fear radiation or lack access to radiologists, and the millions of women who simply choose not to go for mammograms for a host of other reasons. It\u2019s this gap where Dr. Englander sees a potential role for iBreastExam in the future. It could be performed by a general practitioner during a routine checkup as a pre-screening, to help identify masses that need to be investigated further, just as it\u2019s used in India and other less developed countries. On a winter afternoon in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, women lined up at their local primary health center in Hennagara village, about an hour and a half\u2019s drive from Bengaluru, the capital. The women had walked from neighboring villages after learning from community health care workers that there would be a free breast and cervical cancer screening camp. It is run by Biocon Foundation, one of the few nongovernment organizations in India that offer free cancer screening for the poor. For many of the women, it\u2019s the first time they had heard about cancer and had the opportunity to be screened. Dressed in a yellow and brown sari, Muniyallamma, 65, laid down on a gurney for an iBreastExam. A health care worker, Veda Kn, held the white and pink scanner in one hand and a cellphone in the other. She went over the four quadrants of each breast with the scanner. The device communicated wirelessly with the cellphone to display and store the findings in real time. Green would indicate normal breast tissue, and red would mean a lesion was detected, suggesting the need for further testing at a nearby hospital. Just a few minutes later Muniyallamma, who gave only her first name, got her results: She was in the clear. \u201cIt was fine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was no problem. It didn\u2019t hurt.\u201dBefore Muniyallamma left the primary health center, Veda Kn showed her how to do her own breast examination and explained some of the common symptoms of breast cancer, including nipple discharge and swollen glands. The device is currently in use in Mexico, Nepal, Myanmar, Indonesia, Oman and Botswana. In the next 12 months, its developers plan to expand its use to more Southeast Asian and African countries.It takes four to eight hours to train a health care worker to use iBreastExam. Every health care worker undergoes a test before being certified.In the absence of a nationwide population-based cancer screening program in India, the device is used in some private hospital chains, medical colleges, nongovernment organizations and state governments, and among community health care workers.In 2016, the western Indian state of Maharashtra began the country\u2019s first campaign to screen over 250,000 women using iBreastExam, with the state government committed to providing free or heavily subsidized follow-up measures when indicated, including ultrasound tests, biopsies and treatment. Mr. Shah is talking to other state governments, hoping the same screening campaign can be replicated across the country. In Mexico, the country\u2019s navy initiated a program to screen 140,000 women with the device. Foundations operated by pharmaceutical companies are also sponsoring iBreastExam. The Pfizer Foundation is supporting a pilot program to screen women in Myanmar, and the Bayer Cares Foundation is supporting screening in Brazil. Each scan costs between $1 and $4, depending on how many scans the provider commits to. A regular mammogram in India costs at least $20. But the rollout of iBreastExam in India has not been without problems, the biggest of which has been dealing with bureaucracy.\u201cIn developing countries, if you really want to lower the burden of cancer, you\u2019re going to have to work with \u2014 and partner with \u2014 the government and government institutions,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d In the context of India, that meant proving iBreastExam was not an ultrasound device \u2014 a highly controversial issue because ultrasound is commonly used to determine the sex of a fetus, and sex-selective abortion and female feticide have given India one of the world\u2019s most skewed sex ratios.While legislation was passed in 1996 banning the determination of a fetus\u2019s sex, it has continued to thrive as doctors cash in on the trend. But that means health care professionals go through immense trouble to get an ultrasound device \u2014 or something that looks like one \u2014 approved for use.\u201cDoctors literally placed the iBreastExam on the tummy of a pregnant lady to see if it could pick up the gender of a child,\u201d Mr. Shah remembered. \u201cI said, \u2018This is ridiculous,\u2019\u201d because the iBreastExam device cannot identify the sex of a fetus.Nevertheless, he said, \u201cPeople have great fear when a device looks remotely like an ultrasound.\u201d The core objective of a screening program is to improve survival rates. To that end, iBreastExam, like other community-based health screenings, relies on a strong referral system and linkage to care for women whose scans signal a need for further testing. \u201cAny screening without follow-up is useless,\u201d said Sumana Y, a doctor with Biocon. India\u2019s public health care system is marked by long waits, poor care and worker shortages. That\u2019s why private hospitals, often out of reach for the poor, are so popular. Moreover, most cancer centers are in cities. Dr. P. Raghu Ram, immediate past president of the Association of Breast Surgeons in India, said breast cancer is also an issue shrouded in stigma. The disapproval is rooted in a widespread belief that cancer is a sign that a woman has done something bad, in fear of death and in a taboo against discussing \u201cwomen\u2019s diseases.\u201d \u201cIndia is facing a breast cancer tsunami,\u201d Dr. Ram said. \u201cThe data reported is just the tip of the iceberg. I feel the major barrier in women getting opportunistic screening is it\u2019s a taboo closet issue.\u201d Nevertheless, Dr. Ram believes that the influence, reach and respect that community health care workers have in India could override the taboos and start to open discussions with women about cancer. iBreastExam is not a panacea for the detection of breast cancer. Experts agree that a simple blood test is the ultimate goal. But for now, this tool can save lives and revolutionize breast cancer screening in many countries. \u201cIt\u2019s all about access now,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cInnovation is only as good as its reach.\u201d Sophie Cousins is an Australian writer and freelance journalist.Advertisement"}

Over the previous several years I had grown weary of Mr. Bortnikov\u2019s denials of Russia\u2019s perfidy \u2014 about its mistreatment of American diplomats and citizens in Moscow, its repeated failure to adhere to cease-fire agreements in Syria and its paramilitary intervention in eastern Ukraine, to name just a few issues. When I warned Mr. Bortnikov that Russian interference in our election was intolerable and would roil United States-Russia relations for many years, he denied Russian involvement in any election, in America or elsewhere, with a feigned sincerity that I had heard many times before. President Vladimir Putin of Russia reiterated those denials numerous times over the past two years, often to Donald Trump\u2019s seeming approval. Russian denials are, in a word, hogwash.Having worked closely with the F.B.I. over many years on counterintelligence investigations, I was well aware of Russia\u2019s ability to work surreptitiously within the United States, cultivating relationships with individuals who wield actual or potential power. Like Mr. Bortnikov, these Russian operatives and agents are well trained in the art of deception. They troll political, business and cultural waters in search of gullible or unprincipled individuals who become pliant in the hands of their Russian puppet masters. Too often, those puppets are found.The already challenging work of the American intelligence and law enforcement communities was made more difficult in late July 2016, however, when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, publicly called upon Russia to find the missing emails of Mrs. Clinton. By issuing such a statement, Mr. Trump was not only encouraging a foreign nation to collect intelligence against a United States citizen, but also openly authorizing his followers to work with our primary global adversary against his political opponent. Such a public clarion call certainly makes one wonder what Mr. Trump privately encouraged his advisers to do \u2014 and what they actually did \u2014 to win the election. While I had deep insight into Russian activities during the 2016 election, I now am aware \u2014 thanks to the reporting of an open and free press \u2014 of many more of the highly suspicious dalliances of some American citizens with people affiliated with the Russian intelligence services. Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash. John O. Brennan was director of the Central Intelligence Agency from March 2013 to January 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Susan Rice: President Trump, the Autocrats\u2019 Best Friend ", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is tolerating abuses by Saudi Arabia instead of defending its democratic ally, Canada.Ms. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\u201cThe United States firmly supports the universal right of all people to express their views freely and to criticize their government\u2019s policies peacefully. The United States is deeply concerned by the recent imprisonment of leading women and civil society activists in Saudi Arabia and joins Canada in urging their immediate release. We regret that Saudi Arabia, an important partner of the United States, has reacted to Canada\u2019s expression of concern with excessive rhetoric and actions detrimental to both countries. We encourage both Saudi Arabia and our ally Canada to resume dialogue in order to restore normal relations.\u201dThat is how, consistent with America\u2019s traditional global leadership in defense of human rights, we would reiterate longstanding objections to Saudi abuses. We would support Canada, a NATO ally and indispensable neighbor, whose statement was neither harsh nor ill-conceived. We would signal subtly to Saudi Arabia that if they have a problem with Canada over this, then they also have one with the United States, because neither of us will be cowed into curtailing our criticism of friend or foe, when warranted. \u201cWe have a regular dialogue with the Government of Saudi Arabia on human rights and also other issues. This particular case regarding Canada, we have raised that with the Government of Saudi Arabia. They are friends, they are partners, as is Canada as well. Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can\u2019t do it for them.\u201dFalse equivalency. Refusal to criticize obvious human rights abuses. Abdication of American moral leadership. This is the hallmark of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to violations of human rights, particularly when committed by autocratic friends. In this instance, the administration left Canada swinging in the wind, gave Europeans cover to gaze at their feet rather than stand and be counted, and conveyed to Saudi Arabia and others that they can commit abuses without a word of concern, much less condemnation, from Washington. For more than a year, Saudi Arabia has persisted in blockading neighboring Qatar and is now digging a canal to turn it into an island, despite the presence of 10,000 American troops, to punish Qatar for allegedly supporting terrorism and its relationship with Iran. Most dangerously, the crown prince and his regional allies urged the Trump administration to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions, while stoking potential conflict with Iran. The United States is following, not leading, in our newly unconditional partnership with Saudi Arabia. We consistently acquiesce in the crown prince\u2019s actions, however impulsive or harmful. For reasons that remain unclear, President Trump has signaled to the crown prince (who is likely to lead the kingdom for decades) that America is at his service. Defenders of this administration\u2019s foreign policy love to tout the much-improved American relationship with Saudi Arabia, several Gulf countries and Israel, drawing a sharp contrast with the Obama era. It\u2019s no wonder these countries love President Trump, because unlike under his predecessors, the United States has rolled over and played dead while they do whatever they please. Not exactly the stuff of leadership.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Losing My Son to Reading", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks helped me gain independence. So it saddens me just a bit to see my son reading on his own.Mr. Nguyen is a contributing opinion writer.Do you remember when you learned to read? Like most of us, I don\u2019t. Still, many people can take comfort in knowing that this event, beyond memory, involved our parents. The parents who took us to school, who read books to us at home, who could speak to us in a shared language. But in my case, one of the things I lost as a refugee, without even knowing it at the time, was a childhood where my parents would have read to me.I came to the United States when I was 4, with my parents and older brother. Our language at home was Vietnamese, but somehow, by 6 or 7, I had learned how to read in English. My parents could speak English, but I have no memory of them reading to me, and if they did, they would not have been reading to me in English. It must have been my teachers who taught me, just as my 5-year old son\u2019s teachers taught him. Earlier this year I went away for a week and when I came back, the little boy who I had been reading to for years was suddenly reading by himself. Being a father makes me reflective, especially as I look at my son and remember myself at his age. Early in our American years, my father chuckled when I called the kitchen a \u201cchicken\u201d in English. He affectionately recalled for me how, when I was a baby in Vietnam, I saw the cows eating grass and called it \u201csalad.\u201d Like my father, I take pleasure in seeing my son learning a language, and through it, stories. I love the way he loves stories, the raw emotions he brings to them, the way he thrills to, or is terrified by, a powerful narrative. I know when a book is great because he cuddles up to me and asks to have it read to him again and again. The closeness a parent feels with a child, where boundaries are permeable, is mirrored in how a powerful story pulls a reader through a page and through the words and into the story itself. The story of my parents involved crossing a different boundary, the border of this country. We lost many things at the border, beginning with our shared language. Growing up and seeing my parents struggle with building a life for themselves and my brother and me, I could feel our closeness dissipating along with my Vietnamese. The better my parents were at taking care of their children by working endless hours, the less time they had to spend with us. It was the classic immigrant and refugee dilemma \u2014 sacrifice yourself for your children and in the process sacrifice your intimacy with them.I first found the book in a public library. Books were not a priority for my parents, so we never had them in the house. I would go to the public library every week and stuff my backpack full of books, which were barely enough for a week. I never owned my own until high school. My son has a bigger library than I ever had. While my parents showed me they loved me by making sure that I always had enough to eat, I show my love for my son by making sure that he always has enough to read (as well as to eat). For me, the library was a second home, and I want my son to have his own home in my home.By 11 or 12, I knew how to get to my second home by myself, on foot or on the bus. But in remembering that childhood library, what I also know is that libraries are potentially dangerous places because there are no borders. There are countries called children\u2019s literature and young adult literature and adult fiction, but no border guards, or in my case, parents to police the borders and protect me. A reader could go wherever he or she wanted. So, at 12 or 13, I read Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cPortnoy\u2019s Complaint\u201d and Larry Heinemann\u2019s \u201cClose Quarters.\u201d Crossing the border into confronting those wild things that I did not understand and that my parents could not protect me from was part of how I began the journey to adulthood and writing. Seeing my son reading, I realize he is taking one step further on his own road to independence, to being a border-crosser, someone who makes his own decisions, including what he reads and what he believes. Perhaps that\u2019s why seeing him read on his own is tinged with melancholy. I remember my own loss and I sense the loss that is yet to come, when he is no longer all mine, as he is when he wakes in the morning and says some of the sweetest words I will ever hear: \u201cDaddy, read me a book.\u201dViet Thanh Nguyen, a contributing opinion writer, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Refugees,\u201d and the editor of \u201cThe Displaced: Refugee Writers on Refugee Lives.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So far, it\u2019s working.Contributing WriterThey\u2019d gathered for supper one night in July, at the summer camp at the Kfar Silver school, in Ashkelon, Israel. For the last couple of weeks this group of kids \u2014 some from Israel, some from Palestine \u2014 had been trying to learn something about conflict resolution, by playing Ultimate Frisbee. Some of them had become friends.That was when the air raid siren went off. The rockets came from Gaza, part of the ongoing clash between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces. The missiles didn\u2019t land in Ashkelon. But they did score a direct hit on the hopes of some of the people who had looked to the camp as an oasis of peace.\u201cWell, we\u2019re not trying to bring peace to the Middle East,\u201d said David Barkan, who volunteers as the chief executive of Ultimate Peace, which sponsored the camp. \u201cThat\u2019s not the goal. It\u2019s about changing a mind-set through the values of the sport that we know leads to peace between people.\u201d As I interviewed Mr. Barkan by phone last week, I felt the temptation to roll my eyes. As he described his hope of changing hearts and minds through Ultimate Frisbee, all I could think about were those incoming rockets, and the long tragic history of that endlessly conflicted region. I struggled to imagine how Frisbee \u2014 seriously, Frisbee? \u2014 might succeed where a half-century of diplomacy had failed.And yet, when Mr. Barkan talks about \u201cthe values of the sport,\u201d it\u2019s not just idle talk. Ultimate \u2014 which is kind of a combination of football, basketball and soccer \u2014 has a unique twist: There\u2019s no referee. The sport is wholly self-regulated by its players, and competitors from opposing teams are called upon, when there\u2019s a dispute upon the field, to come to an agreement among themselves before play can resume.If the conflict can\u2019t be resolved, the disc goes back to the thrower, and the play starts over. But most of the time, the players work it out together. Occasionally, members of your own team come over and tell you, \u201cActually, I think you did foul him.\u201d While Mr. Barkan and Mr. Mooney were shepherding their campers, I was watching the World Cup \u2014 with its flopping and shirt-pulling and endless deceptions. The sport they were describing seemed to belong to a whole different universe.\u201cIf you win,\u201d Mr. Barkan said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t gain the respect of your opponent, then what have you won?\u201dLet\u2019s pause to agree that over the years there have been plenty of unlikely scenarios for bringing peace to the Middle East. Yitzhak Natan, a former principal of the Thelma Yellin High School for the Arts, in Tel Aviv, suggests that there be two states with the same borders, each governed independently. \u201cInstead of splitting the prayer shawl,\u201d he says, \u201ceveryone takes the prayer shawl.\u201d The writer Lior Aziz, meanwhile, proposes a third state, in addition to Israel and Palestine, the \u201cPeace State.\u201dWhat\u2019s clear is that the Jews and Palestinians who\u2019ve been part of the Ultimate Peace project have begun to see each other in new ways. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about deepening understanding and building empathy for people you\u2019ve always seen as your enemies,\u201d Mr. Barkan told me. \u201cThey become best friends with these people, and they know that all the stuff they\u2019ve been indoctrinated with is just a bunch of crap.\u201dAt the end of one tournament, Mr. Barkan told me, a Jewish boy named Uri Sapir, 13, threw an incomplete pass, a mistake that cost his team the game. As he walked away from the high-five line, tears in his eyes, Ali Hamam \u2014 the 14-year-old Arab boy he\u2019d been playing against \u2014 put his arm around him, and the two boys walked off the field together, arm in arm.At first their voices were tenuous and uncertain.

But lately, the line sometimes grinds to a premature halt, as supervisors wait for employees to straggle in \u2014 or give up and pull people off forklifts to fill in for no-shows. At the end of shifts like that, Ms. Hargrove and the others who bothered to come in have only 800 furnaces to show for their efforts.\u201cPeople aren\u2019t coming to work, which is sad because we really need these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Hargrove, who has worked at Carrier for 15 years. \u201cThey had a chance to prove that staying was good, but this is ruining it for everybody. It\u2019s killing us. It\u2019s pushing us out the door that much sooner.\u201dWhat\u2019s ailing Carrier isn\u2019t weak demand. Furnace sales are strong, and managers have increased overtime and even recalled 150 previously laid-off workers. Instead, employees share a looming sense that a factory shutdown is inevitable \u2014 that Carrier has merely postponed the closing until a more politically opportune moment.In some ways, the situation is a metaphor for blue-collar work and life in the United States today. Paychecks are a tad fatter and the economic picture has brightened slightly, but no one feels particularly secure or hopeful.\u201cPeople still don\u2019t trust Carrier,\u201d said Paul Roell, a group leader who has worked at the plant for 19 years. \u201cThey still have the warehouses and the factory in Mexico, and they can move down whenever. We all know that Carrier has the money to do whatever they want.\u201dSeveral times in late July and early August, so many workers were missing that the furnace line had to shut down in midday \u2014 even more disruptive than an early-morning halt. That hadn\u2019t happened in years, employees said. Some workers cite illness, while others claim days under the Family and Medical Leave Act, saying they are taking care of sick relatives.On a Facebook page open only to Carrier union members, there have been several posts a week complaining about the absenteeism and occasionally attributing it to abuse of family medical leave. \u201cBoggles my mind that there are complaints about the company shutting down because people aren\u2019t coming to work,\u201d reads one from Aug. 3. \u201cWhen they shut the doors, guess who will be crying the most, the ones who don\u2019t come to work,\u201d says another post, from July 18.Robert James, the president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents Carrier employees, said he had heard about the absenteeism from union members. \u201cNone of us are sure what\u2019s going to happen with Carrier staying, and I don\u2019t know if we will ever be sure again or have a positive attitude towards the company,\u201d he said.On the worst days, according to one group leader, up to one in five workers are out. It\u2019s true that the company has been running the factory hard \u2014 up to 60 hours a week with mandatory overtime, six days in a row \u2014 and some absenteeism could be due to sheer exhaustion, Mr. Roell allowed. But \u201cbad blood,\u201d as he put it, is at least as much to blame. \u201cWorkers feel like Carrier is going to leave,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether we come to work or not.\u201dAccording to Carrier, absenteeism has not increased. In a statement, the company said it was \u201cproud of the great work being done by our Carrier employees at our Indianapolis plant.\u201d Moreover, the company said, \u201cwe recently added a new gas furnace production line and continue to make investments in the facility, including skills training for our employees and product improvements.\u201d Carrier declined to comment further.Mr. Trump made the incident a staple of his stump speeches. In his telling, Carrier was thriving and its factory was profitable, yet it was still planning to send jobs to Mexico \u2014 an injustice that he alone could stop. Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Carrier paid off when industrial workers in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan helped him prevail over Hillary Clinton.One was Robin Maynard. With more than two decades at Carrier, he had enough seniority to avoid the layoffs. In July, I spoke with him and his wife, Candi, at the kitchen table of their 1,350-square-foot home; they recently relocated from a larger place to save money. Mr. Maynard described Mr. Trump\u2019s intervention as a valuable insurance policy. \u201cAs long as Trump is in office,\u201d he said, \u201cI will have a job.\u201dIt\u2019s not just any job, either. At 54, he earns $24.83 an hour, a third more than is typical for most local jobs available to workers without a college degree. Last year, Mr. Maynard earned $55,000 with overtime, enough to give him and his wife a tenuous hold on middle-class life and help their youngest daughter with her college tuition. She hopes to become a pediatrician \u2014 a goal the family can support only as long as Robin Maynard is employed at Carrier. If he were forced to take a lower-paying job at, say, an Indianapolis warehouse, he pointed out, his daughter\u2019s dream wouldn\u2019t come to pass.These days, more than on my previous visits, the Maynards feel anxious about the factory\u2019s future. \u201cHe\u2019ll come home and say, \u2018If people don\u2019t start showing up to work, they\u2019ll close it down,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Maynard said. A former teacher, she had to give up classroom work for health reasons, making the Maynards even more dependent on Carrier.\u201cWe always planned on going on a cruise to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary,\u201d Ms. Maynard said. \u201cInstead, we went to northern Indiana for the weekend in June.\u201dAt Carrier, Mr. Maynard supervises a part of the line where control boards are attached to furnaces, making sure there are enough components and troubleshooting when machines break down. Several times a week, though, one of his 14 workers doesn\u2019t show up, and Mr. Maynard has to cover. He dons a special vest, puts straps on his shoes to prevent sparks, and takes a spot on the line.\u201cThere have been a few days when three people don\u2019t show up and I\u2019ve had to work on the line all day,\u201d Mr. Maynard said. \u201cThe attitude, the demeanor \u2014 they\u2019re not grateful that they have a job. The absenteeism is real bad. A lot of us need our jobs. Others look at it and they don\u2019t really care anymore.\u201dThe bad vibes can be catching. \u201cIt makes it so depressing you don\u2019t feel like going in,\u201d he added. \u201cI need the job, but some days you just want it to be over with.\u201dYes, Mr. Hayes said, the company would invest in the Carrier facility, as it had promised Mr. Trump. But those funds were earmarked for automation, and would ultimately mean fewer jobs in Indianapolis, not more. Assembly-line positions there were not ones \u201cthat people really find all that attractive over the long term,\u201d Mr. Hayes said. There were \u201cgreat, great people\u201d there, he added, \u201cbut the skill set to do those jobs is very different than what it takes to assemble a jet engine.\u201d The Carrier faithful didn\u2019t appreciate the slights.Some, like Ms. Hargrove, remain committed to the factory, even if the love doesn\u2019t seem to always be requited from the executive suite. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m hurting and I\u2019m tired but when I walk through that door, I\u2019m going to give 100 percent,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Bible says an honest day\u2019s work for an honest day\u2019s pay, and I try to live by that.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re paying you to do a job,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying you to be happy.\u201d Her work is physically exhausting yet precise. Standing on her feet for the entire shift, Ms. Hargrove inserts tweezer-like strips of metal thousands of times a day into a tube that forms part of the heat exchanger in each furnace.Mr. Roell, the group leader, is also loyal, despite having to fill in frequently on the line. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay until I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said over coffee at the cheerfully retro Oasis Diner, not far from his home in Plainfield, Ind. Mr. Roell, 37, said he was grateful that when he deployed to Kuwait for a year in 2010, as a member of the Indiana National Guard, Carrier made up the shortfall between what he earned at the base and his regular salary at the plant.Something is amiss, though, despite the fact that he\u2019s making $23.88 an hour and last year cleared $70,000 with overtime, a solidly middle-class wage. \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy it as much as I used to,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cI used to look forward to doing my job and seeing co-workers. But I don\u2019t have as much trust as I used to.\u201dEven before the closure announcement, he said, supervisors gathered people from the lines and pointed out, ominously, that their counterparts in Mexico missed fewer days. \u201cI\u2019m worried they will use the absenteeism as an excuse to shut the factory,\u201d Mr. Roell said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t doing anything to improve morale.\u201dA few years ago, Carrier would treat workers to a meal before Christmas \u2014 a big spread of Kentucky Fried Chicken mains and sides. Now employees bring most of the food, potluck style. The company contributes only the meat.When Carrier began a round of layoffs in early 2018, Kelli Rowan figured she was senior enough to survive. She had joined the company six years earlier (after losing a job at a nearby Ford factory, which closed), but in the end she was among those let go. \u201cI was depressed, I was so bored,\u201d Ms. Rowan said. \u201cI thought I was too old to find something.\u201d A 56-year-old mother of two, she shook off her funk and began applying for other factory positions.Although statistics suggest that the local economy is booming, few positions that pay more than $15 an hour are available for the laid-off Carrier workers. Nothing Ms. Rowan found came close to her previous pay of $17 an hour plus overtime. Eli Lilly offered $14.50 an hour, while Roche paid $13 and change.Ms. Rowan eventually landed a position scanning documents at an acceptable salary, but it was temporary. And she received just two days off per month, forcing her at one point to work 13 days in a row. So when Ms. Rowan came home one day in June and found a message on her answering machine from the human resources department at Carrier, she immediately returned the call. Like an on-again, off-again boyfriend, Carrier suddenly needed her.Ms. Rowan had to put aside the hurt and rejection, but it was a small price to pay for a union job with full benefits, vacation and the possibility of overtime. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a tough old cookie.\u201dAs fortunate as she feels to go back, Ms. Rowan is like many other blue-collar workers in that her earning power has diminished over time. Her top hourly rate at Ford, where she worked for 18 years, was $28.24 an hour, and with overtime, her annual salary peaked at $86,000. During her best year at Carrier, she earned half that.How long the new job will last is something Ms. Rowan is trying not to think about. Carrier has hired seasonally in the past, adding people in the spring or summer and letting them go by the end of the year.\u201cSome may get laid off in January, just like they got laid off last January,\u201d said Jacque Williams, a former Carrier worker who is determined not to go back. At 56, he has returned to school to earn a certificate as a technician for heating and cooling equipment. The course is being paid for by a federal program called Trade Adjustment Assistance, which helps workers, businesses and farmers who can show they\u2019ve been hurt economically by imports.\u201cI\u2019ve never had an opportunity to go to school for free,\u201d he said. Mr. Williams is upbeat about his prospects, and unlike many Carrier workers, he bears no ill will toward the company. \u201cI don\u2019t have a gripe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me an opportunity. God didn\u2019t bring me this far to leave me. I\u2019m going to get a better job.\u201dYet even the most loyal Carrier employees aren\u2019t optimistic about their future or that of the broader sector where they\u2019ve chosen to spend their working lives. \u201cI come from a long line of people who worked with their hands,\u201d said Mr. Roell, the group leader, noting that his father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all mechanics. \u201cWhen my son was a toddler, the pediatrician noticed how he used his hands and asked me if I was a mechanic.\u201dMr. Roell doesn\u2019t want his son, 10, or his daughter, 15, to follow him into factory work. \u201cWe tell them all the time to go to college or trade school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not stable working in manufacturing. One day, the factory is going to go to another state or country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democratic Party Picked an Odd Time to Have an Identity Crisis", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan its unruly coalition take shape against Trump without one wing predominating?Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The Democratic Party is a traditional political organization dedicated to winning elections. It is also a social justice movement, the political home of societal change. The party has often been further out front on these issues than the public at large \u2014 and than many of its own voters. This has empowered the Republican Party, from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, to capitalize on opposition to a range of liberal Democratic initiatives on immigration, busing, women\u2019s rights, abortion, crime, gay rights, gun control, affirmative action and so on. The Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to newly ascendant \u2014 and often assertive \u2014 constituencies has alienated some middle and working class voters who see their own values and interests downgraded. The Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation\u2019s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over American citizens\u2019. Many citizens can simultaneously take a liberal position on one or more individual cultural issues and still believe more generally that the liberal vision requires changing the country too much or too quickly.Hopkins noted that it is only natural that such massive social changes have caused anxiety, alienation, or anger among a significant proportion of the population \u2014 and liberals who fixate on the elements of their agenda that remain unfulfilled can sometimes be insensitive to the substantial degree of change that has already occurred over what is, historically speaking, a short amount of time.While both parties are penalized for their internal divisions, there is some evidence that cultural and economic strains present particular challenges for Democrats. The NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll has regularly asked a random selection of all voters whether Democratic and Republican candidates \u201care generally in the mainstream of most Americans\u2019 thinking, or are generally out of step with most Americans\u2019 thinking.\u201d Percentage of all registered voters who said each party\u2019s candidates were out of step with most Americans or in the mainstream.DemocraticcandidatesRepublicancandidatesOUT OF STEPMAINSTREAM575654484538OUT OF STEP3333MAINSTREAM201220162018201220162018Democratic candidatesRepublican candidatesOUT OF STEP60%575654IN THE MAINSTREAM484540%38OUT OF STEP3333IN THE MAINSTREAM20%201220162018201220162018By The New York Times | Source: NBC News/Wall Street Journal SurveyFrom 2016 to 2018, the percentage of voters describing Democratic candidates as \u201cin the mainstream\u201d fell from 48 percent to 33 percent. The percentage describing Democratic candidates as \u201cout of step with most Americans\u2019 thinking\u201d rose from 42 percent to 56 percent.Over the same period, the evaluation of Republican candidates remained virtually unchanged, 59 percent \u201cout of step\u201d in 2016 and 56 percent in 2018; 31 percent \u201cin the mainstream\u201d in 2016, 33 percent in 2018. In other words, over the past two years voters have become substantially more distrustful of the Democratic Party. I asked political scientists who study political parties for their evaluation of the dual function of the Democratic Party. Their responses varied widely.Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, wrote back to say that one \u201cproblem the party seems to have is that it can\u2019t accommodate all social justice demands at once.\u201dIn the 1960s and 1970s, the party became \u201can advocate for urban areas and racial minorities,\u201d Enos argued, but thenslowly, over time, it has become less of an advocate for rural areas, union members, and other things associated with the white working class. This left a portion of the social justice agenda on the table for another party to capture and part of that capture was the election of Trump.that making so many policy issues into matters of rights and taking them to the courts was counterproductive. It put opponents in the position of denying other people their rights. The latter are more difficult to compromise because if it\u2019s a right, compromise is an abrogation of it.Fiorina pointed tothe anger my working class steelworker friends expressed about the concept of \u201cwelfare rights.\u201d Welfare is charity; no one has a right to it was their view. This was the transformation of an issue that previously would have been seen as an economic redistribution issue into what would be considered a social justice issue.Fiorina\u2019s example shows how what can be seen as \u201crights\u201d for one constituency can be seen as \u201ccosts\u201d for another. The Voter Study Group identifies 15 percent of voters who fit into what it calls the Democratic-Independent Liberal Elite category. This is the cohort that has often provided leadership for the social justice movement within the Democratic Party. Members of this group have generally been younger, more liberal, better educated and more affluent than average voters.When asked to rank issue priorities, there were some striking differences between these more liberal Democrats and the average voter.According to the survey, issues that the Democratic elite gave much higher priority to than the electorate at large included gay rights, 61.0 to 34.3; gender equality, 68.7 to 35; and racial equality, 65.7 to 38.8.Conversely, the issues given much higher priority by all voters than by Democratic elites included terrorism, 58.2 percent to 11.6 percent; crime, 57.4 to 18.2; taxes, 56.9 to 18.9; budget deficit, 50.7 to 5.3; religious liberty, 48.5 to 21.7; and immigration, 46.1 to 16.7.To put it bluntly, there is a huge gulf between the priorities of the Democratic elite, which exercises significant influence over party policymaking, and the general public. I would describe the evolution of the Democratic Party a little differently. From the 1930s to the early 60s, I think Mike Dukakis once described it best as the party of the workingman, families and the neighborhood.This, Glendon wrote, \u201cwas the Party when my father became the first Irish Catholic to be elected chairman of the board of selectmen in Dalton, Mass.\u201dThen, in the 1960s,came the Party dedicated to ending segregation and affording equal opportunities to all. That was the Party to which I enthusiastically belonged. I would also say it was the party of true liberals, men and women who were tolerant, open, and not too sure they were right. Soon, however,the party left all three of those features behind: it became the party of the radically autonomous individual, the party of top-down solutions, and sadly a party that would not even listen to dissent on certain issues.The overreliance on rights and courts to solve disputes has encouraged a focus on the individual at the expense of investment in the social fabric, and a winner-takes-all attitude at the expense of tolerance and compromise.The result, she and Kaplan argue, is that \u201cthe social ecosystem comprising the social capital, social networks, experiences in self-governance, and democratic norms upon which a free society depends has suffered.\u201dThese have been consistent themes in Glendon\u2019s work. Back in 1991, in \u201cRights Talk,\u201d she wrote:A tendency to frame nearly every social controversy in terms of a clash of rights (a woman\u2019s right to her own body vs. a fetus\u2019s right to life) impedes compromise, mutual understanding, and the discovery of common ground. A penchant for absolute formulations promotes unrealistic expectations and ignores both social costs and the rights of others.Under political siege, Democratic liberalism became unreceptive, if not hostile, to new, contradictory and sometimes frightening information. The public repudiation of racism and the stigmatization of overtly racist expression was a groundbreaking achievement of the 1960s and 1970s. The repudiation of racist expression had an unintended consequence, however, for liberalism and for much of the Democratic Party: an almost censorious set of prohibitions against discussion of family structure among the black poor, absent fathers, crime, lack of labor force participation, welfare dependency, illegitimacy and other contentious race-freighted issues.But Grossmann went on to acknowledge,It is nonetheless true that Democrats are likely to be pushing for lots of individual social changes at once, many of which are individually popular but collectively look to the right and to the middle like a project to remake society, undermine traditions, subordinate domestic strength to global concerns, and make American culture less unique.Because Democratshave trouble prioritizing the laundry list of goals and don\u2019t realize that individually popular goals \u2014 spur the economy, provide health coverage to those who need it \u2014 can become quite unpopular once they are combined and attacked as a big government project by liberal elitists.Despite this, Theodoridis believes that the Republican Party has a bigger problemreining in the fringes. Perhaps because the G.O.P. is a proxy for an ideological dimension, rather than a coalition of diverse interests, it is more likely pulled to the edge of the ideological spectrum.While Republicans have clearly been pushed well to the right of center by their activist wing, the results of House and Senate elections in recent years suggest continued public reluctance to give Democrats control of Congress. Since 1995, Republicans have held the majority in the Senate 15 years to the Democrats\u2019 9. Over the same period, Republicans have controlled the House 20 years to the Democrats\u2019 4.There is no way the Democratic Party would jettison the party\u2019s social justice wing nor should it. The record does suggest, however, that Democrats need to do a better job of managing the conflict between the centrist corpus of the party and both of its activist left wings \u2014 one cultural, one economic \u2014 if it expects to fully capitalize on the opportunities that President Trump and his allies have bestowed on them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Partisanship, Parasites, and Polarization", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre direct-marketing scams destroying the republic? A serious question.Opinion ColumnistAnd lately I\u2019ve been wondering if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to America. How much of our political sickness is the result of a parasitic infection? What I have in mind specifically is an infestation of direct-marketing scams that exploit and reinforce political partisanship, largely on the right, basically to sell merchandise. I\u2019ll come back to that. First, some notes on political economy.As Olson pointed out, the same goes for political action. Just because a political candidate\u2019s victory would be good for, say, farmers doesn\u2019t mean that farmers will give him or her money; each individual farmer will have an incentive to free ride on everyone else\u2019s contributions. So political action is normally undertaken by individuals or small, organized groups that stand to benefit directly. Either that, or it\u2019s a byproduct of other activities that are advantageous for their own reasons and can also be harnessed for political action, like memberships in trade associations or unions.So a lot of political action is driven by people trying to shape policy in a way that benefits them personally. But what the Shapiro/brain pills story drives home to me is that there\u2019s another important factor in our current political scene: the use of political action as a marketing ploy, by people out to make a buck selling stuff that has little to do with politics per se. Dear Reader, I\u2019m going to tell you something, but you must promise to keep it quiet. You have to understand that the \u201celite\u201d would not be at all happy with me if they knew what I was about to tell you. That\u2019s why we have to tread carefully. You see, while most people are paying attention to the stock market, the banks, brokerages and big institutions have their money somewhere else . . . [in] what I call the hidden money mountain . . . All you have to know is the insider\u2019s code (which I\u2019ll tell you) and you could make an extra $6,000 every single month. And some of the most influential voices on the right haven\u2019t just sold advertising space to purveyors of snake oil, they\u2019ve gotten directly into the snake-oil business themselves.Thus:  Why should marketing scams be linked to political extremism? It\u2019s all about affinity fraud: once you establish a persona that appeals to angry, aging white guys, you can sell them stuff that will supposedly protect their virility, their waistline, and their wealth. Now, normally we think of individuals\u2019 views and interests as the forces driving politics, including the ugly polarization increasingly dominating the scene. The commercial exploitation of that polarization, if we mention it at all, is treated as a sort of surface phenomenon that feeds off the fundamental dynamic. But are we sure that\u2019s right? The Alex Joneses, Ben Shapiros, and Fox Newses of the world couldn\u2019t profit from extremism unless there were some underlying predisposition of angry old white guys to listen to this stuff. But maybe the commercial exploitation of political anger is what has concentrated and weaponized that anger. In other words, going back to where I started this essay, maybe the reason we\u2019re in a political nightmare is that our political behavior has, in effect, been parasitized by marketing algorithms. Anyway, I think it\u2019s really important to realize the extent to which peddling political snake oil, whether it\u2019s about the economy, race, the effects of immigration, or whatever, is to an important extent a way to peddle actual snake oil: magic pills that will let you lose weight without ever feeling hungry and restore your youthful manhood.

They are key to who wins the House and Senate.Mr. Olsen, the editor of the \u201cFlyover Country\u201d section at UnHerd.com, is the director and a co-founder of the Voter Study Group.Most strategists and analysts say this November\u2019s midterms will be determined by turnout. According to this view, whichever party more fully energizes its partisans will come out on top. New data, though, shows this common wisdom has it exactly backward. It\u2019s the voters who sit between the two parties, not the party bases, who will choose which party wins.Two of these groups are of vital import: \u201cRomney-Clinton\u201d voters and \u201cObama-Trump\u201d voters. Each consists of people who changed which party\u2019s nominee they voted for from 2012 to 2016. Where they go will determine who wins because they are strategically placed in most of the target House and Senate races up for grabs this fall.\u201cRomney-Clinton\u201d voters are generally the sort of highly educated, affluent, more moderate voters who disapprove of Donald Trump. The most recent Voter Survey shows Mr. Trump had less than a 20 percent job approval rating among them; nearly 70 percent of these formerly Republican voters disapprove of his job performance. And they are taking this dislike with them to the voting booth. Forty-three percent say they will vote for Democrats this fall; only about 20 percent intend to back Republicans.\u201cObama-Trump\u201d voters are the people you\u2019ve heard a lot about recently: largely white, less educated and middle or working class. By and large the latest Voter Survey shows that they still like Trump: 76 percent approve of his performance. But like Romney-Clinton voters, they aren\u2019t yet completely sold on their new party\u2019s congressional candidates. While 41 percent say they will vote Republican in the fall, 44 percent say they are either unsure whom they will back or plan to vote for a third-party candidate. That\u2019s a lot of Trump backers who haven\u2019t yet made the leap to the G.O.P.These voters are also important to the House battle. Republicans hold 12 House seats that flipped from Obama to Trump. They are also seriously contesting five other open seats currently held by Democrats that also flipped. Hold onto some of these and make a few pickups and Republicans can offset some losses and minimize Democratic gains.Both types of voters are also in play in the key Senate races. Democrats represent five seats under attack this fall where Mr. Trump won by 18 percent or more. In each state Mr. Trump\u2019s margin exceeded Mr. Romney\u2019s by between 6 and 16 points. That\u2019s the Obama-Trump voter at work, and Democratic incumbents need to win the bulk of these voters back to have a shot. But in three other key states \u2014 Nevada, Florida and Arizona \u2014 the balance between the two types of swing voters is more even. Lesser-educated white areas swung to Mr. Trump, while more educated areas swung to Mrs. Clinton. The candidate here who can combine appeals to both groups simultaneously is likely to prevail.National polls show that Democrats have an edge, but as we saw in 2016, a national lead may not translate into a Democratic victory. Winning control of the House and Senate means Democrats have to fight on Republican turf, and that means talking to Romney-Clinton and Obama-Trump voters. How well they can talk to both at the same time \u2014 and how well Republicans do among the same groups \u2014 will determine whether we see a blue wave or another case of Democratic despair.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Campaigns Enter Texting Era With a Plea: Will U Vote 4 Me?", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cHi Marla,\u201d it read. \u201cThis is Nate volunteering w/ Beto For Texas. Beto O\u2019Rourke is running for Senate to represent Texans statewide, not special interest megadonors. And unlike Ted Cruz, Beto doesn\u2019t take any money from PACs. Can we count on your vote?\u201dMs. Hohner, a senior adviser for a financial firm, was puzzled. She had heard of Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat running against Mr. Cruz in November. But she had never volunteered for his campaign, given him money or agreed to be contacted by his volunteers.\u201cIt felt like a real invasion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first reaction was, who is this? How do they know my name? And how did they get my cellphone number?\u201dWelcome to the age of the political mass-text. Candidates in this year\u2019s midterm elections are still sending mailers, putting ads on TV and knocking on doors to drum up support. But they\u2019ve added a new, hard-to-ignore tool to their arsenal: personalized text messages sent to voters\u2019 phones.In a mobile-first age when TV ads are skipped and email inboxes automatically filter out junk and promotions, it\u2019s not surprising that campaigns are desperate for a tool that can reliably get voters\u2019 attention. What is surprising is how influential the lowly SMS text message, a tool that was invented during the elder President George Bush\u2019s administration, has remained.This year, as social media platforms like Facebook lure political advertisers with the promise of microtargeted ads, old-fashioned texting has had an unlikely resurgence. Both Democratic and Republican campaigns are relying on mass-texting apps that take advantage of a clever legal loophole to send huge numbers of texts per day without running afoul of anti-spam laws.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that texting is the breakout tech of 2018,\u201d said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist and founder of Learn Test Optimize, a newsletter about political marketing. \u201cThere\u2019s so much competition in the inbox, we\u2019re looking for other channels. For now, that\u2019s text messaging.\u201dMr. Wilson recently gathered a group of political strategists in a Washington office to talk, over dumplings and craft beers, about the sunny prospects for text messaging. The group agreed that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter were becoming crowded, and that text messages, which are read at higher rates than emails and are less invasive than phone calls, were a promising alternative.\u201cTexting is just a humane, better, higher-engaged channel,\u201d said Gerrit Lansing, a former chief digital officer of the Republican National Committee and co-founder of Opn Sesame, a texting app used by Republican campaigns.\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone under 45 who wants to be called,\u201d Mr. Lansing said.But this year\u2019s campaigns swear by a new breed of \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d texting apps that allow them to carry on thousands of individual text conversations, keep track of replies and answer questions from voters in real time. The phone numbers often come from political groups that sell or share voter data to campaigns.Automated bulk text messages \u2014 the kind sent by pharmacies and airlines \u2014 are strictly regulated. Users are required to opt in to receive them, and organizations can be fined for sending unsolicited messages.Peer-to-peer texts appear to be unregulated because they are sent individually. Even if a program automates the process of choosing a recipient and filling a message with canned text, a human user has to press send on each message.\u201cIt\u2019s not a blast communication,\u201d said Caitlin Mitchell, the chief mobilization officer for the Democratic National Committee, which is using peer-to-peer texting in hundreds of campaigns this fall. \u201cIt lets you have a genuine two-way conversation with voters.\u201dA spokeswoman for the commission said it had not decided on the issue, and would seek public comment first.Volunteers for Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for governor of Georgia this year, have sent more than 1.2 million text messages. Senator Doug Jones, the Democrat who prevailed in last year\u2019s special election in Alabama, set up \u201ctexting banks\u201d that sent 1.4 million texts to voters during that race. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose long-shot primary campaign defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, a 10-term incumbent in New York, used the texting app Relay to help drive voters to the polls.Roddy Lindsay, the chief executive of Hustle, a start-up that helps organizations use peer-to-peer texting, said the texting method \u201cgets back to the heart of what campaigns do, which is talking to people and winning hearts and minds.\u201dVictoria Nadel, a volunteer for Mr. Jones\u2019s campaign last year, used the Hustle app to reach Alabama voters, reminding them to vote and where their nearest polling place was. Hustle automatically supplied each text message with a name and a number. All she had to do was hit send \u2014 which she did, hundreds of times a day.\u201cIt\u2019s the best tool right now for getting out the vote,\u201d Ms. Nadel said.Text messages are not free \u2014 most peer-to-peer platforms charge 10 to 30 cents per conversation, with discounts for large clients \u2014 but they are less expensive than printed mailers and appear to be more effective than other communication methods. Hustle, which is used by many Democratic campaigns as well as groups like Planned Parenthood and the Sierra Club, says texts sent through its platform receive responses at twice the rate of phone calls, and 36 times the rate of emails. Opn Sesame says 90 percent of text messages are opened within five minutes.All this texting seems to translate to dollars and votes. According to internal tests done by the Democratic National Committee, voters who received text messages through Hustle as well as printed mailers donated to campaigns at an 8 percent higher rate than voters who received only mailers. And campaign officials said voters who received texts on Election Day were more likely to show up at the polls.\u201cWe saw an increase in turnout amongst the communities we reached out via text message during the primary election,\u201d said Priyanka Mantha, the communications director for Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign in Georgia.And not everyone appreciates the conversations. One Twitter user in Georgia posted a screenshot of a message she had received from a volunteer for Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign, asking if the campaign could count on her vote in November.Cain Rodriguez, 29, a theater artist in Dallas, said he had gotten dozens of text messages from Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign. The messages were annoying, but he admitted they were probably effective.\u201cI understand why it\u2019s an important tool for them,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore a text message.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the communications director for Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for governor of Georgia. She is Priyanka Mantha, not Matha.Advertisement"}

At least 82 people were killed in the quake, which was also felt on Bali, just to the west, the country\u2019s National Disaster Management Board said.Television footage showed panicked residents and tourists fleeing to safety on both islands, especially after a warning that the quake and major aftershocks could cause a tsunami.Most of the people killed in the magnitude-7.0 quake, which was first announced as a magnitude 6.8 and then revised upward, were from the northern and western regions of Lombok.At the international airports on Lombok and Bali, buildings sustained minor damage, Reuters reported, but operations were not disrupted, officials said.The law and home affairs minister of Singapore, K. Shanmugam, who was in Mataram, the capital of Lombok Island, when the quake struck, said on Facebook that his 10th-floor hotel room had shaken violently and the walls had cracked.\u201cIt was quite impossible to stand up.

Lots of cracks, fallen doors.\u201dNajmul Akhyar, the district chief of North Lombok, initially told Metro TV that at least three people had been killed, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Akhyar said, however, that because of an electrical blackout, he did not know whether there were other casualties.Later, the National Disaster Management Board reported that the death toll had risen to 37, then to 82.Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster management board, said in a statement that the earthquake was also felt in Sumbawa Island, to the east of Lombok.Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia\u2019s national Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, said in a televised statement that there were about 12 aftershocks or \u201csmaller earthquakes.\u201dThe agency initially reported that Sunday\u2019s earthquake did not generate a tsunami, but within minutes put out a warning that one may have formed off Lombok\u2019s north coast. It urged people to stay away from the sea. The tsunami warning was later lifted.In December 2004, a magnitude-9.1 earthquake off Sumatra set off a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.An earlier version of this article, using information from an official\u2019s television interview in Indonesia, misstated the number of earthquakes that struck on Sunday.

(He later apologized.) Mr. Shapiro and his followers saw in her refusal further proof of the left\u2019s antipathy to engaging with ideological difference.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of course, is under no obligation to debate someone who is not running for anything. She does find herself, however, in the comparatively unusual position of igniting the interests of men who want to argue with her, whatever their motives.It has not always been this way. When a victory over Joseph Crowley, the 10-term congressman she challenged in the Democratic primary seemed so improbable, he did not rush to join her on stage and argue about housing policy. The two candidates debated twice; on two other occasions Mr. Crowley said he could not attend because of scheduling conflicts, and on one of those he sent a surrogate, Annabel Palma, a former City Councilwoman, which left the impression that the girls ought to just work things out among themselves.Debates in particular have long wielded a special power to trigger male condescension. During the first with a female candidate to be televised nationally \u2014 the 1984 vice-presidential debate between George H.W. Bush and Geraldine Ferraro \u2014 Americans bore witness to Mr. Bush patronizing a prominent congresswoman, who served as the secretary of the House Democratic Caucus, on the subject of foreign policy. (\u201cLet me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.\u201d)Before Donald Trump stalked Hillary Clinton on stage, commandeering the frame in one of the 2016 presidential debates, Barack Obama had derided her as \u201clikable enough,\u201d in a primary debate eight years earlier.The indifference only fueled her resentment and propelled her to run. There are few things that can spark both rage and agency among women quite like being ignored.The Grechen Shirley campaign maintains that it has asked Mr. King to participate in five debates and that he has only agreed to one; he denies this. So far one debate is scheduled.Often incumbents will try to forestall debates with opponents who are new to the political scene for fear of advancing their celebrity but Governor Cuomo has been slow to debate his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, even though she is already famous. In July, the governor skipped a forum in Westchester with 700 people, and Ms. Nixon sat next to an empty chair. Her campaign had been counting the days since it had first tried to schedule a debate with the governor, and Wednesday would have been the 100th day.Then, on Day 98, the Cuomo campaign accepted an invitation from the CBS affiliate in New York to debate Ms. Nixon at Hofstra University on Aug. 29, a few days before the Labor Day weekend, when most of New York will be paddleboarding. The Nixon campaign has said that the terms of the debate were presented to it as a fait accompli.\u201cWe understand this isn\u2019t a level playing field,\u201d a spokeswoman offered in a statement. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been since the very beginning. Nothing is easy when you\u2019re an outsider, and it\u2019s even harder when you\u2019re a woman.\u201dRegardless, Ms. Nixon will be there.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of times Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joseph Crowley debated.

{"Headline": "When the Menu Says \u2018Organic,\u2019 but Not All the Food Is", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe term doesn\u2019t mean much in restaurants, which are not required to undergo the same rigorous certifying process as farms and food companies. He wrote to Bareburger\u2019s chief executive, Euripides Pelekanos, who eventually met with him and told him that 75 to 80 percent of the beef in the burgers was organic. This would count as \u201cmade with organic\u201d but not \u201corganic\u201d under the federal regulations.At this point, the typical customer would have just stopped eating at Bareburger. But Mr. Rosenberg was intent on making change: He went through the restaurant\u2019s trash and found containers for mayonnaise and tomatoes, neither of which had the organic seal. He started distributing fliers outside some outlets that asked, \u201cIs Bareburger REALLY organic?\u201d He called Bareburger\u2019s food suppliers to tell them that the restaurant was misrepresenting itself. Still, the word \u201corganic\u201d continues to appear on many of Bareburger\u2019s signs and on its packaging. \u201cTo me,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said, \u201cit seems like an attempt to deceive and an attempt to defraud.\u201dBut Bareburger is not necessarily breaking any rules. While farms and other businesses that want to advertise their wares as organic have to answer to certifying organizations that conduct annual inspections for the Department of Agriculture, restaurants do not. A restaurant can seek organic certification if it wants, but is not required to.There is no precise definition, however, of what constitutes a reasonable effort, and no monitoring body for enforcement. If the department receives a complaint that a restaurant is falsely billing its food as organic, Ms. Tucker said, it will investigate the claim and if necessary, send a letter asking the owner to stop using the term. In 2002, the Department of Agriculture started the National Organic Program to create uniform standards, like not using synthetic fertilizers or genetic engineering, for farms and other businesses that produce, handle or process food. To enforce the rules, the agency works with organizations that assess and certify compliance.Restaurants were exempted, Ms. Tucker said, because the biggest concerns at the time were farming practices and food production. The certification process is expensive, and it was thought that requiring compliance might impose too heavy a burden on restaurateurs.Mr. Pelekanos said he had never claimed that all of Bareburger\u2019s menu items were 100 percent organic. And he has no plans to seek certification for any of the 41 Bareburger restaurants in the United States.But at some newer Bareburger locations, words like \u201clocal\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d \u2014 and in certain cases no words at all \u2014 have replaced the word \u201corganic\u201d near the logo. Mr. Pelekanos said he didn\u2019t think Bareburger needed to stop using \u201corganic\u201d entirely. \u201cWhy are we going to run away from a word, when we have spent so much time and energy over the years to serve so much organic food in our restaurants, and we charge a premium for it?\u201d he asked.He said all the food served at the restaurant is organic. But he has chosen not to have it certified as such. \u201cIt is our own transparency and integrity that makes us organic, and not someone that puts the label,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government knows more about food than we do.\u201dMs. Tucker, of the National Organic Program, said a few restaurants around the country have chosen to undergo the rigorous process to be certified organic \u2014 though the department does not track them closely.\u201cWe saw the confidence that people had in the U.S.D.A. organic label\u201d at Costco, Ms. Welton said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure people coming through the doors of our restaurant had the same confidence.\u201dMr. Hoover said most of the Organic Coup\u2019s 16 locations are now making a profit. \u201cIn retail, you have this transparency in that you are required by the U.S.D.A. to label all your products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe restaurant industry is behind.\u201dSeveral certification organizations said that restaurants often approach them about becoming certified, but then are discouraged by the requirements.\u201cIt is doable, but it is not easy,\u201d said Alberto Gonzalez, an owner of one of New York City\u2019s first certified organic restaurants, Gustorganics, which operated from 2008 to 2015. Each dish, for example, involved as many as 25 ingredients, and all of them had to be organic; but some ingredients had only one source \u2014 a farm or producer \u2014 that could supply an organic version.\u201cIf there was a shortage, we were struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have nowhere to go.\u201dFor many diners, organic certification of restaurants doesn\u2019t seem to matter much. Some even distrust the designation.\u201cWhat\u2019s more important to me is the restaurant\u2019s mind-set and attitude toward the food chain,\u201d said Noah Youngs, who was having lunch recently at a Bareburger on the Lower East Side. \u201cPeople earn the label \u2018organic\u2019 all the time and still have terrible practices.\u201dMr. Rosenberg filed one last November about Bareburger, and didn\u2019t get a response until May, simply confirming receipt of the complaint. He said he hasn\u2019t heard anything further. The Department of Agriculture spokeswoman would not comment on the individual complaint, but said, \u201cWe are making progress toward the goal of a customer friendly system that is faster and even more transparent. There are many factors that impact the time an investigation takes.\u201dMr. Rosenberg\u2019s expectations are low. \u201cDo I expect the U.S.D.A. to do anything for me?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo. Zero. I don\u2019t think anyone cares.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, and a picture caption with it, misstated the type of beef Bareburger is currently using.

Although the photographers covered combat, few scenes in the book depict the blood-soaked drama of the battlefield. Instead, they offer relaxed portraits of American G.I.s and Vietnamese civilians taken between 1966 and 1972. They mostly show the long hours of boredom and tedium that dominate life at war.Both the book and exhibition also explore the outsize role of a publication led by two tenacious women, Marion von Rospach and Ann Bryan, both Stanford alumnae. Ms. von Rospach founded Overseas Weekly with her husband in Germany in 1950 for American military personnel stationed in Europe. Ms. Bryan opened the paper\u2019s Pacific office and published the first edition in 1966. Early on, Ms. Bryan, the only female bureau chief in Saigon, ran a one-woman show from her second-floor apartment, working as a reporter, photographer, editor and operations manager. Her mission was to write for soldiers in their own language. She fought for the right of women to report from combat zones despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 remarks from officers such as, \u201cWhat the hell is a woman doing here?\u201dThe paper earned its muckraking reputation \u2014 and the ire of the Pentagon \u2014 by printing articles on racism, drug abuse, the military justice system, and the sex-reassignment surgery of a transgender World War II veteran. It was put up for a Pulitzer Prize for exposing the underground activities of the American Nazi Party within the U.S. military.\u201cMany Army officers maintained that though the facts were usually right \u2026 the stories fostered disrespect for the military establishment,\u201d wrote The New York Times in a 1969 article.\u201cUnlike photographers working for major media outlets the Overseas Weekly photographers found that their subject was also their audience,\u201d wrote Eric Wakin, deputy director at the Hoover Institution, in the book\u2019s foreword. \u201cThey took photographs that were never intended for a civilian viewership.\u201d With the publication of the forgotten archives, a new generation of civilians and service members now has access to a valuable record of a war that killed one million Vietnamese and over 58,000 Americans, a toll that still resonates nearly half a century later.\u201cCombat scars everyone, soldiers and journalists alike. And the psychological wounds don\u2019t heal, even after fifty years,\u201d Mr. Greenspon wrote in his essay. \u201cNow, Hoover has stirred up a whole new set of traumatic recollections and resentments.

Papa, the fellow mobster who masterminded the brazen theft of 400 pounds of French Connection heroin and cocaine from a police vault, died on July 3 at a hospital near Ayer, Mass. He was 79.His death, which had not been announced, was confirmed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which did not specify a cause. He was being held at the Federal Medical Center-Devens, a long-term care facility about 40 miles west of Boston.Mr. Sperling was among the first defendants to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, after federal judges were empowered to impose that penalty in the early 1970s in response to what was viewed as a national crisis over narcotics crime and addiction.He spent nearly three-fourths of his life behind bars, including the last 45 years since his arrest in 1973 and subsequent conviction on drug-trafficking charges.Prosecutors called him \u201cthe operational kingpin of a highly organized, structured and ongoing narcotics network\u201d that smuggled heroin from France and distributed it mostly through black and Hispanic dealers on the East Coast.Mr. Sperling had a well-deserved reputation for violence.In 1977, he was indicted on charges of hiring three fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta to murder Mr. Papa, whom he suspected of turning police informant. Mr. Sperling was acquitted in the conspiracy, but two other defendants were convicted of fatally stabbing Mr. Papa in the back and chest at least eight times in a prison courtyard.Mr. Papa had been convicted of choreographing the audacious theft by rogue police officers of tens of millions of dollars worth of drugs from the New York Police Department\u2019s evidence room in Lower Manhattan in the early 1970s and replacing it with bags of flour and cornstarch. The crimes kick-started a consequential corruption investigation of the police.Mr. Sperling was also suspected in the death of Louis J. Mileto, whom police identified as a courier for the Sperling heroin ring. Mr. Mileto\u2019s frozen, headless and limbless torso was found in 1972 in the trunk of a gutted car in the Hudson Valley. He was identified by his teeth, which were found in his stomach. Investigators said he had swallowed them during a vicious beating.A 5-foot-5, barrel-chested high school dropout, Mr. Sperling was volatile, foulmouthed and unapologetic.When the police asked him to identify the source of two pistols and an ax that were found in the trunk of his leased car, and that were later linked to three murders, he replied, \u201cDamned if I know,\u201d adding, using an expletive, \u201cAnd you can be sure I\u2019ll never rent no car from Avis again.\u201dEven at his sentencing, when he faced mandatory life imprisonment, he affected a James Cagney swagger and delivered a tirade in which he refused, as he put it, to \u201cbeg for mercy\u201d (which Cagney ultimately did in his 1938 crime film \u201cAngels With Dirty Faces\u201d).\u201cAll I want is justice,\u201d Mr. Sperling insisted, \u201cwhich I couldn\u2019t get.\u201dTo which Judge Pollack replied, \u201cMr. Sperling has eloquently requested a just and fair sentence.\u201d The judge then meted out the maximum on each of several charges.Mr. Sperling was born on Dec. 29, 1938, in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, the gritty Midtown West neighborhood that was a notorious breeding ground for hooligans. His father, Irving, a jewelry salesman, died when Herbert was 1. His mother was Cecile (Shavitz) Sperling.Both parents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, and after Herbert Sperling\u2019s death, someone posted on Facebook the message, \u201cHerbie Sperling Rest in Peace, the last true Jewish gangster,\u201d one of his sons noted in a eulogy.According to a 1994 profile in Prison Life magazine, a copy of which resides in the New York Public Library\u2019s research collections, he was sent to a reformatory at 13 for truancy, worked as a bouncer and boxed as a featherweight.\u201cWhat happened to honor?\u201d Mr. Sperling was quoted as saying in Prison Life. \u201cAs a kid I was taught that being a tattletale was a bad thing.\u201dMr. Sperling married Josephine Chiaremonte, who died in 2001. He is survived by their sons, Nicholas, Gus and Guy; and nine grandchildren.Mr. Sperling transplanted the family from Little Italy in Manhattan to Bellmore on Long Island, where his fleet of three pleasure boats was moored nearby.\u201cHe wanted us to have a better life; he wanted us to have everything that he didn\u2019t have growing up,\u201d his son Gus said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cHe went to his neighborhood with a truckload of toys for the kids who didn\u2019t have any. He opened a pizzeria. He was trying to change.\u201dGus Sperling said in his eulogy last month, \u201cUnfortunately, in April of 1973 our lives would change forever.\u201d Not only was his father arrested, but Herbert\u2019s 67-year-old mother was also accused of complicity in his drug dealing by stashing cash and heroin in her Manhattan apartment. (She was acquitted.)\u201cMy brother Nick was 13, me, 9, and my younger brother, Guy, was 9 months old at the time,\u201d Gus Sperling said. \u201cOur lives were turned upside down.\u201dThe family held together, even when one of Herbert Sperling\u2019s grandsons died of an opioid overdose. They were sustained by daily phone conversations with the imprisoned patriarch.\u201cHe kept us going by always thinking he\u2019d get out,\u201d Gus Sperling said.He added: \u201cWe never talked about what he did, but I think it\u2019s because of the way he grew up, on the streets, and he didn\u2019t know anything different. I never asked him. I guess it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t really want to know.\u201dHerbert Sperling, insisting that he was a political casualty of the 1970s war on drugs, refused to inform on other felons.\u201cThey were trying to squeeze him,\u201d Alan Dershowitz, one of his appellate lawyers, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. \u201cHe was not willing to compose\u201d \u2014 make things up \u2014 \u201cor to sing.\u201dMr. Sperling made headway on some of the charges against him by filing a blizzard of appeals. But he acknowledged that the conspiracy accusation was, as he put it, legitimate.\u201cI\u2019m not innocent,\u201d he told Prison Life in the 1994 interview. \u201cBut life without parole? That\u2019s nuts.\u201cWhat I got is a slow death sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be doing me a favor if they put me in the electric chair and ended the story once and for all.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the year the James Cagney crime film \u201cAngels With Dirty Faces\u201d was released. It was 1938, not 1932.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ancient Burial Pits Reveal Sophisticated Rituals", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesHundreds of bodies were packed tightly in carved out bedrock, marked by pillars, a sign of organized \u201cmonumentality\u201d by some of East Africa\u2019s earliest herders. Roughly 5,300 years ago, a group of ancient sheep herders in East Africa began an extraordinary effort to care for their dead. These early herders dug through about 1,000 square feet of beach sands down to bedrock and gouged out burial pits. They interred their dead there: the bodies of men, women and children of all ages, many with personal items and ornamentation. Then, for reasons scientists don\u2019t understand, at about the same time that Lake Turkana stopped shrinking, the people decided to stop burying their dead this way. The pit wasn\u2019t yet full. But the herders covered it over with pebbles and then, to mark the spot, somehow managed to drag a dozen giant basalt pillars to the site from a kilometer or more away. There are five other sites around the lake with similar pillar markings, and previous research by another group suggests that at least one of them was also used as a monumental cemetery.\u201cFrom start to finish, over a period of what was at least several centuries, people were demonstrating a high degree of intentionality and planning and careful implementation of this idea that everybody should be buried together in this singular location,\u201d Dr. Hildebrand said. \u201cIn archaeology, we used to think we understood that monumental constructions were associated with sedentism and food and-or labor surpluses commandeered by elites,\u201d Dr. McIntosh said. \u201cThis was part of mainstream narratives about the \u2018rise of civilization.\u2019\u201d But excavations of sites like Lothagam North, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and Poverty Point in Louisiana show that ancient mobile populations could also build monumental works, Dr. McIntosh said.  The burial site also indicated the lack of an apparent hierarchy.\u201cThis truly was a place that accommodated all ages and life stages,\u201d Dr. Hildebrand said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t reserved for a chosen few or people of special high status. Everybody was accommodated there.\u201dMost were buried with ornamentation, including an infant who wore an ostrich eggshell bracelet. One man was buried with a headdress decorated with what researchers figured out were 400 carefully arranged gerbil teeth. He probably wore the headdress during life. Gerbils, Dr. Hildebrand noted, are not generally associated with power or strength.\u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re building this vast communal cemetery that required a ton of labor to create for several centuries,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, they\u2019ve got this crazy personal idea of style, where everybody decorates themselves in their own personal, eclectic way.\u201dDigging up these remains wasn\u2019t easy. Lake Turkana is very remote today, as it likely was in ancient times, Dr. Grillo said.It\u2019s also extremely sunny and windy, making excavations of fragile bones quite tricky, said Susan Pfeiffer, an emeritus professor at the University of Toronto, who served as the team\u2019s senior bioarchaeologist. The bones disintegrated when exposed to bright sunlight, and the windy conditions made it tricky to keep the dig area shaded, she said. The team has stopped digging at the site to avoid disturbing any more remains, although they hope to dig at several of the other pillar sites around the lake, Dr. Grillo said. Herders who live in the area today are not descended from these ancient cemetery-builders and do not view them as their ancestors, she said.But Dr. Hildebrand is now concerned about the future of the pillar sites. She and others on the team have been working with local residents, as well as the Kenyan national museum, to preserve Lothagam North. \u201cBefore, the site was naturally protected from human threats by its own distance,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, many more people have motorbikes.\u201dDr. Hildebrand said she remains impressed that these ancient Lake Turkana people reacted to the stress of so much simultaneous change by collaborating rather than fighting \u2014 a lesson, which she says has resonance in our own time.\u201cThese are people who responded to very difficult and what must have been both strategically and emotionally challenging conditions with exceptional creativity and community spirit,\u201d she said. For today, \u201cit\u2019s important as all these changes are taking place around us to retain our sense of community and to figure out how we\u2019re all going to collectively make sense of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Flourishing Business of Fake YouTube Views", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "Plays can be bought for pennies and delivered in bulk, inflating videos\u2019 popularity and making the social media giant vulnerable to manipulation.Martin Vassilev makes a good living selling fake views on YouTube videos. Working from home in Ottawa, he has sold about 15 million views so far this year, putting him on track to bring in more than $200,000, records show.Mr. Vassilev, 32, does not provide the views himself. His website, 500Views.com, connects customers with services that offer views, likes and dislikes generated by computers, not humans. When a supplier cannot fulfill an order, Mr. Vassilev \u2014 like a modern switchboard operator \u2014 quickly connects with another.\u201cI can deliver an unlimited amount of views to a video,\u201d Mr. Vassilev said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to stop it for so many years, but they can\u2019t stop it. There\u2019s always a way around.\u201dJust as other social media companies have been plagued by impostor accounts and artificial influence campaigns, YouTube has struggled with fake views for years.The fake-view ecosystem of which Mr. Vassilev is a part can undermine YouTube\u2019s credibility by manipulating the digital currency that signals value to users. While YouTube says fake views represent just a tiny fraction of the total, they still have a significant effect by misleading consumers and advertisers. Drawing on dozens of interviews, sales records, and trial purchases of fraudulent views, The New York Times examined how the marketplace worked and tested YouTube\u2019s ability to detect manipulation.Inflating views violates YouTube\u2019s terms of service. But Google searches for buying views turn up hundreds of sites offering \u201cfast\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d ways to increase a video\u2019s count by 500, 5,000 or even five million. The sites, offering views for just pennies each, also appear in Google search ads.By Michael H. Keller | Source: YouTube AnalyticsDevumi\u2019s customers included an employee of RT, a media organization funded by the Russian government, and an employee of Al Jazeera English, another state-backed company. Other buyers were a filmmaker working for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, and the head of video at The New York Post. (Al Jazeera and The Post said the workers were not authorized to make such purchases and were no longer employed there.)Multiple musicians bought views to appear more popular: YouTube views factor into metrics from the ratings company Nielsen and song charts including Billboard\u2019s Hot 100.Some companies bought views for clients with the promise of social media promotion that would result in real people watching their videos.Dr. Judith Oppenheimer, 78, paid a company $5,000 to promote a book she had self-published in hopes of securing a mainstream deal. Her video soon had over 58,000 views, delivered through Devumi.\u201cThere was no increase in sales and no book deal,\u201d she said. \u201cSoon after I signed the contract I thought, \u2018I\u2019ll have no proof of what they do or don\u2019t do.\u2019 Now it begins to make sense. They can do it in a day.\u201dPurveyors depend on constantly evolving tactics to deliver views, including automated or \u201cbot\u201d traffic and pop-under videos on unsuspecting users\u2019 computers, but YouTube says it has effective processes to defend against these approaches.\u201cThis has been a problem we have been working on for many, many years,\u201d said Jennifer Flannery O\u2019Connor, YouTube\u2019s director of product management. The company\u2019s systems continuously monitor a video\u2019s activity, and the anti-fraud team often buys views to understand better how these sites operate, she said. \u201cOur anomaly detection systems are really good.\u201dStill, the challenges are significant. At one point in 2013, YouTube had as much traffic from bots masquerading as people as it did from real human visitors, according to the company. Some employees feared this would cause the fraud detection system to flip, classifying fake traffic as real and vice versa \u2014 a prospect engineers called \u201cthe Inversion.\u201d\u201cThe problem itself was extraordinary,\u201d said Blake Livingston, a member of YouTube\u2019s fraud and abuse team at the time who has since left the company.But fixes were made that relieved the fake-traffic surge, which YouTube said resulted from an attack against the website.\u201cView count manipulation will be a problem as long as views and the popularity they signal are the currency of YouTube,\u201d Mr. Livingston said.It took Mr. Vassilev about 18 months to go from being on welfare and living with his father in Canada to buying a white BMW 328i and a house of his own.By late 2014, his website was on the first page of Google search results for buying YouTube views, fulfilling 150 to 200 orders a day and bringing in more than $30,000 a month, he said. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t believe you could make that much money online,\u201d he said. The Times reporter\u2019s order on his site, for 25,000 views, was fulfilled one day later.A spokeswoman for Google, which is owned by the same company as YouTube, said that sites selling views appeared in search results because they were relevant, but that there was \u201croom for improvement\u201d in warning users.Mr. Vassilev declined to name his clients but said that many orders came from public relations or marketing firms.Today, he fills most orders through SMMKings.com, a wholesale supplier run by Sean Tamir, 29. Mr. Tamir charges him about a dollar for a thousand views, which Mr. Vassilev resells for $13.99, throwing in 100 free likes.One purveyor, Carlton E. Bynum II, 24, uses advertising to attract customers. He collected more than $191,000 in revenue this year but spent over $109,000 in ads that appeared at the top of Google, according to financial records. His site, GetLikes.click, run from a home office in Houston, sells YouTube views as well as Instagram and Twitter followers, Facebook likes and SoundCloud plays.Google does not allow ads with terms like \u201cbuy YouTube views.\u201d But Mr. Bynum said one workaround was to misspell the words and submit an ad multiple times if it was denied at first. When asked about advertising for paid YouTube views, Google removed some of the ads, including Mr. Bynum\u2019s, but similar ones returned after two weeks.Before Mr. Bynum sold views, he was buying them for himself. After he was discharged from the Marine Corps last year, he began posting product reviews on YouTube and taking a cut when visitors made purchases using his links. The views he bought would often cause his videos to rank higher than his competitors\u2019 in search, he said. The effect would snowball: His videos would gain traffic through search, and he would make more money. (A YouTube spokeswoman said views were just one factor among many that affected search rankings.)\u201cIt worked great,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get views within a day. I can get likes within hours.\u201dMr. Bynum said he believed real people were watching his videos. \u201cBut let\u2019s say there\u2019s a small chance I\u2019m wrong and it is bots,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir videos are still getting ranked.\u201dMr. Vassilev, who also said he used fake views to increase the search ranking of videos promoting his website, makes no pretense that what he is selling is authentic viewership. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.The salesman on the phone said it would be simple: Elizabeth Clayton, a retired English and psychology professor, could pay Hancock Press $4,200 to publicize her self-published works of poetry. The company said online promotion, including 40,000 guaranteed YouTube views, would translate into sales, emails show.Ms. Clayton, 77, was optimistic. She had been publishing for seven years but had not sold much. One royalty check came to $1.47, another to $0.75. She signed up for Hancock to promote two videos, costing her $8,400, records show.\u201cThey told me if I got a certain number of hits I would sell a certain amount,\u201d she said.Instead of traditional marketing, Hancock paid $270 for 55,000 views from Devumi for each video, the records show. The views eventually reached about 60,000, where they remain. But there was no increase in sales. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t tell me anything about the people that were watching the video,\u201d Ms. Clayton said. \u201cI suspected something, but I couldn\u2019t get any information.\u201dWayne Hancock, the 92-year-old chief executive of the Arkansas-based company, said he believed real people were watching the videos. That\u2019s how Devumi marketed its views. Mr. Hancock\u2019s daughter, K. C. Shay, who helps run the business, dismissed Ms. Clayton\u2019s documents and the Devumi receipts as fakes.But Devumi records show that Hancock Press spent about $26,000 over three years, obtaining more than five million views for 75 or so authors. Interviews with six other Hancock clients are consistent with Ms. Clayton\u2019s experience.Many Devumi clients came from the music industry, where buying views is common and often seen as necessary. \u201cYouTube is one of the premier sources of music consumption and an important indicator of musical trends and popularity,\u201d said Silvio Pietroluongo, a vice president at Billboard.As a new artist, Aleem Khalid hired Crowd Surf, a promotion company, in 2014. Without his knowledge, he said, the firm bought 10,000 views each on three of his videos. They now have between 11,000 and 42,000 views. \u201cThe beautiful thing about these social media platforms is when they came out it was genuine. But now I feel it\u2019s all fake,\u201d said Mr. Khalid, 25. (Cassie Petrey, a co-founder of Crowd Surf, said she thought Devumi was producing real views, based on statements on its website.)Others who relied on Devumi said they were similarly surprised at the company\u2019s tactics. Ami Horowitz, the conservative filmmaker, bought 10,000 views for a video he appeared in \u2014 \u201cWhat We Learned at the People\u2019s Climate March\u201d \u2014 on the YouTube channel for Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 political influence group. Mr. Horowitz, who is often a guest on Fox News, also bought views for a video about the protests in Ferguson, Mo.In a statement, he said he had believed Devumi worked like traditional web advertising. But \u201cit wasn\u2019t what we expected,\u201d he said, adding that he never used Devumi or similar services again. A spokeswoman for Americans for Prosperity called the behavior unethical and said the group would \u201cnot knowingly engage\u201d in it.YouTube\u2019s engineers, statisticians and data scientists are constantly improving in their ability to fight what Ms. O\u2019Connor calls a \u201cvery hard problem,\u201d but the attacks have \u201ccontinually gotten stronger and more sophisticated,\u201d she said.After the Times reporter presented YouTube with the videos for which he had bought views, the company said sellers had exploited two vulnerabilities that had already been fixed. Later that day, the reporter bought more views from six of the same vendors. The view count rose again, though more slowly. A week later, all but two of the vendors had delivered the full amount.By Michael H. Keller | Source: New York TimesEven when it looks closely, YouTube can miss videos with fake views. A 2017 Google public report on disinformation during the 2016 election looked at RT\u2019s YouTube channels, concluding that there was \u201cno evidence of manipulation of our platform or policy violations.\u201d Yet The Times recently found that an RT employee bought fake views for videos in 2016, which YouTube acknowledged it did not detect.James Brown, a correspondent for RT, had purchased 30,000 views and 300 likes across three videos that focused on problems involving homelessness and immigration in Europe. Mr. Brown said he took Devumi at its word that the views would be real people. An RT spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the purchases and was conducting an internal review.\u201cIt concerns me that while Twitter and Facebook appear to have made some credible progress in this area, YouTube still struggles to identify inauthentic and coordinated activity on its platform,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cThe only way YouTube could eliminate this is if they removed the view counter altogether,\u201d said Mr. Vassilev, the fake-view seller. \u201cBut that would defeat the purpose of YouTube.\u201dTo test the effectiveness of websites selling fake YouTube views, a New York Times reporter created 13 videos using clips from presidential speeches. The reporter uploaded the videos onto a new channel under his first name and last initial and did not share or post them.Views were bought through nine vendors, sometimes with varying specifications. On one site, for example, the reporter purchased United States-targeted views, so-called high-retention views and generic ones. Aug. 6, 2018July 11, 2018April 23, 2018Jan. 27, 2018Advertisement"}

In a lot of places, nothing. But in some places, there\u2019s the mechanical brush. This bristly, swiveling, motorized apparatus spins when a cow touches it, allowing the animal to reach places it couldn\u2019t on its own. On average, cows will spend seven minutes a day rubbing their heads, necks and backs on these bulky body buffers. And some researchers think these mechanical brushes aren\u2019t just some spa amenity for dairy cows \u2014 they\u2019re important to the animal\u2019s well-being. Testing the animals\u2019 willingness to work for access to fresh feed, mechanical brushes and empty space, Dr. von Keyserlingk and her team trained pregnant, healthy, indoor dairy cows to open a weighted gate. By looking at how much weight they were willing to push before giving up, the researchers got an idea of the relative importance of each resource to the cows. The brushes may benefit farmers by keeping cows from destroying surfaces inside barns and pleasing consumers who increasingly want to know that the animals are healthy and, more important, happy. For the cows, using mechanical brushes may ward off parasitic outbreaks, scratch itches and remove dead skin. But grooming also helps many species \u2014 perhaps including cows \u2014 cope with stress. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t have is a gigantic cortex that can do things like fly to the moon or build that gigantic computer you\u2019re using right now,\u201d said Dr. Grandin. \u201cI\u2019m going to say the dairy cow enjoys it. It\u2019s like going to the spa.\u201d But Dr. Grandin and Dr. von Keyserlingk think because the cows are so determined to get to the brush, grooming with it may be more like the need to clip your nails. Mechanical brushes are required in Denmark, but not in the United States or Canada.

Egg-and-bread anything is a great combination, no matter how plain or fancy: fried egg sandwiches; soft-scrambled eggs on good buttered bread, a crisp baguette, perhaps; poached eggs on English muffins.As for a modern-day Middle Eastern approach, there was a Lebanese place, since closed, alas, where I often picked up lunch. All the food was fresh and colorful. One day, instead of the usual falafel and salad for my pita, I chose an item on the chalkboard, called herb omelet. It was lovely, full of parsley, onion and mint, served room temperature. I became obsessed with it, trying out other versions at home, adding more herbs. At some point, it was apparent I was conflating the Lebanese version, called ejjeh, with the Persian herb omelet known as kuku sabzi.Seeking clarification, I asked the Massachusetts chef Danielle Glantz, whose family comes from Zgharta in northern Lebanon. Her grandmother made three kinds of ejjeh: one with potato, onion, mint and parsley; one with onion, mint and parsley; and a deluxe one, with fatty lamb, potato, mint and parsley. The ejjeh was always served with pita, tahini and labneh (yogurt cheese). Evidently, I had invented a mash-up of the two. And mine, instead of being served with pita on the side, was actually a pita sandwich, filled with herbed omelet, topped with a pan-Middle Eastern chopped salad and a creamy yogurt tahini sauce. For me, it remains a delicious, if slightly mixed up, kind of egg on a roll.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the ingredients in a traditional Persian kuku sabzi. It does not contain mint.Advertisement"}

The food would stay roughly the same \u2014 more on this in a minute \u2014 but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints.Moments like this didn\u2019t tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group\u2019s design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot.While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions\u2019 locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice.Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, \u201cOur menu is kaiseki style, so it\u2019s like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.\u201d I must have looked confused because he added, \u201cSome dishes are going to be bigger than others.\u201dThe chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce.But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with pur\u00e9ed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be.I don\u2019t know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn\u2019t been seen much since the \u201990s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu.

{"Headline": "How Nixon Came Back", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFifty years ago, the former vice president executed the greatest reversal of fortune in American political history.Mr. Widmer is a historian. Yet it was a strange speech, alternating between genuine grace notes and darker rumblings from an American subconscious that was sullen and fearful after years of war and discord. Like tectonic plates grinding against each other, the tensions between these visions, alternatingly bright and horrific, would be difficult to resolve. Eight years earlier, Mr. Nixon had been a famously awkward candidate who tried much too hard, sweating it out to make it to all 50 states in 1960, while John F. Kennedy casually threw spiraling footballs for the photographers of Life and Look. But a lot had changed since then. Mr. Nixon\u2019s handlers, especially the younger ones, included a new breed of TV executive, who understood that Mr. Nixon could reinvent himself with softer lighting, better angles and fewer appearances. That, in essence, was the New Nixon. They devised a savvy strategy, outlined by one of their own, Joe McGinnis, in his classic book \u201cThe Selling of the President, 1968.\u201d Thanks to their tutelage, he now seemed a calmer kind of statesman who spoke gnomically once a day, with plenty of time to get the footage to the networks. The spread of color TV between 1960 and 1968 helped Mr. Nixon, too; it eliminated the ghostly pallor and 5 o\u2019clock shadow that had terrified schoolchildren in 1960. Air conditioning, another miracle, reduced the pools of perspiration that glistened when the lights burned too brightly. The coronation was scheduled for Thursday night, but Mr. Nixon had to survive robust late challenges from Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan. Like many, they were not convinced that Mr. Nixon was \u201cthe One,\u201d as the bumper stickers and straw hats proclaimed, a little desperately. But years of hard political work \u2014 doing favors, collecting debts \u2014 paid off for the candidate as he outlasted these final challenges. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina was a strong ally, helping him to fend off Mr. Reagan on the right and refusing to let the party\u2019s moderates anywhere near Mr. Nixon, especially when it came time for the selection of a running mate. A few weeks later, Democrats would fall apart more publicly in Chicago. But Miami Beach signaled a momentous shift for the Republicans as well. The nomination of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Agnew signaled a final defeat for moderate and liberal Republicans, as the party\u2019s power base shifted South, forever. Mr. Nixon understood that a major change had happened, and some of that drama entered his speech, one of the best he ever gave. He had been thinking about the speech for weeks, writing out concepts on his yellow legal pads while holed away at Montauk, on Long Island. He went for long walks on the beach \u2014 once into a fog so deep that he had trouble finding his way back. But the speech was full of taut sentences about a country that could become great again, exactly as he had. A near-disaster nearly prevented the speech from being given. The aide holding it, a former TV executive named Frank Shakespeare, was briefly separated from the peloton surrounding Mr. Nixon as he entered the hall. But they found each other just in time. Mr. Nixon then took the enormous stage with confidence, smiling incessantly, assuring millions of viewers that the New Nixon had arrived. The air conditioning was working. Then the speech began, sprinkling optimistic promises of greatness with dire warnings against non-greatness. Norman Mailer, covering the convention, wondered if Nixon were simply entering random data into a cosmic Teletype machine, like the supercomputer HAL in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d saying whatever the people wanted to hear. That was too harsh, but there was something to Mr. Mailer\u2019s observation that it was a strangely put-together speech. For long sections, he promised ever-expanding vistas of an air-conditioned paradise, in which all Americans treated each other decently. In one stretch, he almost seemed to channel the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., repeating \u201cI see an America\u201d much as Dr. King had chanted \u201cI have a dream.\u201d But in other sections of the speech, the old 5 o\u2019clock shadow grew back. Crime was out of control in America, and Mr. Nixon promised to restore \u201claw and order.\u201d The United States had paid too much for its alliances; it was time for the allies to step up and pay \u201ctheir fair share.\u201d He promised that he would \u201cstop pouring billions of dollars into programs that have failed,\u201d including welfare. Somehow, that would reduce crime. In short, less taxes, more greatness. Over and over, he spoke to the \u201cforgotten Americans,\u201d assuring them that greatness was right around the corner:America is a great nation ... And America is great because her people are great ... America is a great nation ... And it is time we started to act like a great nation around the world ... We are a great nation ... And we must never forget how we became great ... We make great history tonight. In a way, he did. The speech was a hit and helped propel Mr. Nixon to victory in November. One section, near the end, described a child listening to a train in the distance, forming \u201cdreams of faraway places where he\u2019d like to go.\u201d That image resonated when the audience slowly realized he was talking about himself, growing up in straitened circumstances, along a different coast. It was about as personal a moment as Mr. Nixon ever offered. He was buoyed by the speech and stayed up late with his advisers, excited. The final lines of the speech had promised to end \u201cthe long dark night\u201d and look out over a new dawn. That also seemed to be his plan for the evening. He nearly made it, but fell asleep around 4 a.m., muttering imprecations against The New York Times that could not be printed in his least favorite newspaper. In his speech, Mr. Nixon looked ahead, to the 21st century, and thought he might be inaugurating a new era of post-Democratic ascendancy. That did not quite happen, but the speech\u2019s themes have proven durable. Both Democrats and Republicans have tried to unite the country since then; most have failed. Some, like Mr. Reagan, veered toward the sunny side of Mr. Nixon\u2019s rhetoric. Others, like Donald Trump, have headed into the darkness. Some aspects of Mr. Nixon\u2019s speech even sound quaint today \u2014 he included Mexicans and African-Americans in his idealized version of the country and bore no hostility to the foreign-born. The speech mentioned building bridges, not walls. But in the end, his hatreds proved more powerful than his tautological vision of a country seeking greatness, simply by remembering that it was once great. As history now knows, more clearly than in 1968, there were misdeeds large and small in the era that was beginning on that August evening. Throughout Mr. Nixon\u2019s presidency, as Newsday reported in some hard-hitting journalism of the time, he gave constant favors to the Florida realtors who had helped to make him rich, bending the rules whenever he thought he could get away with it. That proved to be a slippery slope. He was lounging in a pool in South Florida with Mr. Rebozo when he first heard the news there had been a clumsy break-in at the Watergate apartment complex. Mr. Rebozo recalled, \u201cWe laughed and forgot about it.\u201dMr. Nixon\u2019s speeches tend not to be included in speech anthologies. But it would be difficult to find a richer document of the times. With this skillful address, he achieved his political goals and articulated an important new vision for the country, palpably different from the one Franklin D. Roosevelt had unveiled at Chicago in 1932. But in the end, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Worse, he sowed the seeds for future confusion by trying to take America back to a perfect place where it had never even been.

All these equations, and the technical understanding of how metals work and form.\u201dMs. Shabaik\u2019s experiences are hardly unique: as tens of millions of baby boomers live longer, their children will have to shoulder the burden of caring for them. Her raw and emotionally fraught new series, \u201cPersonality Crash,\u201d documents not just her father\u2019s decline, but hints at what awaits more and more Americans in the decades to come.The stark, black and white photographs are powerful in their honesty, and the camera is almost always unsparingly close. Though Ms. Shabaik photographed her father from 2013 until he died at the age of 80 on Jan. 1 of this year, these photographs deal almost exclusively with the last six months of his life.\u201cThat work was very bold and raw for the time,\u201d Ms. Shabaik said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there had been much, or any work done like that. Her fearlessness in making that work, and presenting her community to the public, probably sat with me quite a bit.\u201dSurprisingly, Ms. Shabaik noted that once dementia fully took over her father\u2019s mind, he seemed to achieve a measure of peace, as his awareness of his plight disappeared. While at one point he was cognizant of his decline, at the end, he lived only in his memories.Beyond sharing her father\u2019s story for the many out there who are, or will be dealing with similar issues, Ms. Shabaik also feels her work can allow people to develop further empathy for their loved ones as they slip into life\u2019s final phase.That was her primary purpose in working with her father, as they viewed the project as a collaboration. In fact, the term \u201cPersonality Crash\u201d came from him, during a conversation they had one day, when he was no longer able to write but could still express himself.His willingness to share his story is laudable, as most people would never want to be shown in such a weakened, vulnerable state. His daughter loved him very much, and between the two of them, they\u2019re giving us a glimpse into a world that most people don\u2019t want to see.\u201cThere is a distinction between what the disease does to somebody, and the true nature of that person,\u201d she said. \u201cThat relationship where you might think this person has gone crazy, and is being mean to you, that\u2019s probably not them.

{"Headline": "The West Bank Model Is a Failure", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd Israel\u2019s new nation-state law will import those failures into Israel itself. Mr. Peretz edited The New Republic for 35 years.In the seven decades of its independence, Israel has developed a unique model of statehood. This model can be understood in various ways, and these have evolved over the years, but any description of it always comes back to two terms: Jewish and democratic. There is no consensus on what it means for a state to be a \u201cJewish state,\u201d partly because only one state has ever made such a claim. At the same time, there is no practical consensus on what it means for a state to be \u201cdemocratic\u201d: Many have put the word \u2014 knowing it false \u2014 in their official names. The Israeli experiment is to honestly attempt to join these two types of pluralism, Jewish and democratic, to make a modern, progressive state. The Israeli model, through all its evolutions, involves in its roughest form a state whose symbols are Jewish; whose holidays and calendar come from the Jewish tradition; whose gates are always open to any Jew seeking refuge or a new home; whose government is accountable to an elected parliament; whose administration operates within the bounds of law; whose free market grows and brings in more people from more diverse backgrounds to participate in its activities; and whose people are entitled to the minimum civil and legal protections of a modern free society regardless of their religion or ethnicity. It was this model that absorbed penniless Jewish refugees from around Europe and Asia and made them, within the span of a generation, into free sovereign people with a North Atlantic standard of living. It was this model that, however imperfectly, absorbed the Arab minority remaining in Israel\u2019s borders after the unsuccessful effort by Arab governments to wipe Israel out at its infancy, and turned them into full citizens with a material and political quality of life arguably unmatched by Israel\u2019s Arab-majority neighbors. Why this is such a disaster takes some understanding of the character of the territories themselves. Fifty-one years ago, after Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, it seemed only natural that the very success of its social model could be exported to the newly conquered territories on the West Bank. These were, after all, territories with deep historical and religious significance for the Jewish people. They were won in an entirely justified war against an enemy that made its goal of genocide perfectly clear. And they were necessary to ensure the future security of the Israeli state.It is possible that bits of this export fantasy were not always doomed to fail. We\u2019ll never know if a different approach could have had different results, so we can assess the settlement project only as it has unfolded, and there is no doubt that it has failed. Israel has not brought the \u201cIsraeli model\u201d to the West Bank, not even partly.What has been created instead in the West Bank is an alternative model of the state. Where in Israel a Jewish majority of roughly 80 percent of the population ensures that the Jewishness of the state, however defined, is never seriously threatened, in the West Bank the Jewish population, even after 50 years of settlement, still doesn\u2019t reach 15 percent. The \u201cWest Bank model\u201d may or may not be Jewish, but if it is Jewish, it certainly isn\u2019t on account of demographics.And there is very little that is democratic about the West Bank model. Consider: 15 percent of West Bankers who are Jewish settlers vote in Israeli elections and the 85 percent of West Bankers who are Arabs can vote in the elections of the Palestinian Authority (when these are actually held). In practice, this means that West Bank Jews are voting for the government of a state they don\u2019t live in but whose army exercises sovereign authority over the territory they do live in. For West Bank Arabs, it means their democracy is doubly a sham: They can vote for a Palestinian Authority that fails to live up to any minimal standard of democracy, or, for that matter, of governance itself. But they can\u2019t vote in the elections of Israel, the state that actually controls the territory in which they live. Practically, the Jewish minority in the West Bank enjoys a monopoly of civil, political and social rights, and its supremacy is guaranteed by the presence of a large military force from Israel to protect it and its privileges. That is, ipso facto, the West Bank model.This isn\u2019t even the worst of it. The Jewish minority in the West Bank enjoys a Western standard of living by nearly every measure \u2014 income, education, health care, life expectancy, infrastructure, etc. Because of the political situation, because it is dependent for its survival on a corrupt Palestinian Authority, the Arab majority manifestly has no realistic hope of closing the gap. This is simply not the case for the admittedly imperfect relationship between Jews and Arabs inside Israel. Maybe slight border adjustments could bring the Israeli model to the tiny bits of West Bank land where large numbers of Jewish settlers live. These could be reciprocal if made in the context of an overall peace \u2014 but there\u2019s no sign that the Palestinian Authority will do anything other than refuse to negotiate under reasonable terms. Indeed, pointing out the awfulness of the West Bank model in no way absolves the Palestinians of responsibility for their refusal to make any kind of peace with Israel. But the bottom line is this: The Israeli model, such as it is, is not being exported to the West Bank.Quite the opposite. If there is any future for the West Bank settlement enterprise \u2014 not the border adjustments, but the fanatical ideological settlements deep in the territory \u2014 it won\u2019t be because of an export of the Israeli model but rather because of an import of the West Bank model into Israel. And this is what the corruptive nation-state law clearly starts to do: secure the power of the far-right wing by making Israel less democratic, more \u201cJewish,\u201d more tribal, less representative. The law is only a start: Tellingly, to ensure its passage, certain provisions were edited out of the final bill, including a section to allow the formation of Jewish-only communities that would have effectively denied the mixing of peoples and individuals that is Israel\u2019s aspiration and also its reality. A provision like this gives a good sense of where the bill\u2019s authors want to go next.

And now DeVos is making it easier for those very same kids to be cheated when they try to prepare for a career.It\u2019s quite a story, just as DeVos is quite a gal. Probably the first secretary of education with a $40 million family yacht that\u2019s registered in the Cayman Islands, presumably to avoid American taxes.Is that the yacht that got mysteriously untied the other day?But before I permit any more distractions, we need to discuss policymaking at the Department of Education:The Obama administration worked very hard to weed out bad for-profit colleges. The policy it finally came up with was to compare an average graduate\u2019s debt with the average graduate\u2019s earnings. Then cut off federal grants and loans to the schools that had a really terrible ratio. And give the students who\u2019d gotten a raw deal a chance to get their loans forgiven.Excuse me, but does this apply to, say, philosophy majors? My grandson is finishing up at the state university and I do not see how all these courses on Heidegger are going to get him work.No, we\u2019re talking about schools that are just there to prepare students for a career, whether it\u2019s computer engineering or cooking or auto mechanics.

{"Headline": "Before These Parasitic Wasps Finished Devouring Live Flies, They Became Fossils", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesIn fly pupae that turned to stone, scientists found evidence that wasps have been infesting other insects for tens of millions of years.Wasps are the horror-flick killers of the insect world. Sure, their stingers are scary, but it\u2019s their parasitizing practices that really send a shiver down the exoskeleton. Known as parasitoid wasps, these types of wasps are much smaller than the yellow jackets that make people panicky at picnics. With needlelike ovipositors, parasitoid wasps lay their eggs into or on top of other insects. As the young wasps grow, they devour their hosts and eventually kill them, sometimes by bursting through their abdomens like in the movie \u201cAlien.\u201d Dr. van de Kamp, Dr. Krogmann and their colleagues made the discovery while re-examining a collection of immature flies that fossilized during their pupa phase, which is a cocoon-like period that occurs between the larval and adult phases. The pupae fossils measure only 3 or 4 millimeters long and resemble grains of rice, but are as hard as stone. Most were found in the 1890s and early 1900s in southwestern France. In the 1940s, a Swiss entomologist named Eduard Handschin studied and described many of the fossils, after which they remained relatively forgotten.At first Dr. van de Kamp examined 29 ancient fly pupae using the X-ray imager, which \u201cunwrapped\u201d the fossils in front of the scientists in real time. The first nine were empty, just stones. But the tenth was special. \u201cI was getting bored. It was like \u2018O.K., stone. Another stone. O.K., another stone.\u2019 And then it was \u2018Wow!\u2019\u201d said Dr. van de Kamp. \u201cIt was immediately clear there was a wasp inside.\u201dThe find prompted him and his colleagues to re-examine more museum samples. Over the course of a week they took images of more than 1,500 fossilized fly pupae and found 55 with parasitoid wasps.  Dr. van de Kamp surmised what happened about 30 million years ago when an animal died and its rotting carcass attracted the flies. Inside the decomposing flesh, the flies laid their eggs. The eggs hatched and became larvae that feasted on the dead remains. The maggots began their pupal phase in hopes of leaving as flies. Enter the wasps. The insects most likely laid their own eggs inside the pupae, disrupting the fly\u2019s development. As the wasp larvae ingested the pupae, they grew into adult wasps. Then at some point before the adult wasps had the chance to emerge, they died and the entire thing \u2014 host and parasitoid \u2014 was fossilized.The team identified from the specimens four newly discovered wasp species. Two of the species, Xenomorphia resurrecta and Xenomorphia handschini, they named after the gut-busting Xenomorphs in \u201cAliens.\u201d Fitting for creatures so frightening.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Clarence Thomas the Supreme Court's Future?", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conservative justice\u2019s obsession with the past was on full display during the recent term.Ms. Greenhouse is a contributing opinion writer. Included in nearly all the commentary about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2017-18 term was the observation that this was the year that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy took a decided turn to the right. For the first time in memory, there was not a single case in which the current court\u2019s longest-serving justice, who announced his retirement on the term\u2019s final day in June, joined the court\u2019s four liberals to make a 5-to-4 majority. Considering Justice Kennedy\u2019s recent record, along with the indisputably conservative credentials of the man President Trump has chosen to replace him, it\u2019s tempting to shrug and wonder what the fuss over Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is about, or to assume that not much will change when he\u2019s confirmed. After all, isn\u2019t the Supreme Court\u2019s future already here?That we are in for years \u2014 decades, perhaps \u2014 of conservative dominance on the Supreme Court there is little doubt. But I want to frame a different question about the court\u2019s future. What will that conservatism look like? What does a conservative future really mean?It\u2019s going on 50 years since Warren E. Burger, President Richard Nixon\u2019s chosen chief justice and the first of his four Supreme Court appointees, took his seat in June 1969, initiating the turn to the right that continues to this day. Admittedly, it\u2019s been a fitful journey rather than a steady march. Different expressions of conservatism have been on display, including the states-rights revival under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist; the \u201coriginalism\u201d of Justice Antonin Scalia and, currently, the grumpy the-prosecution-is-never-wrong-and-the-government-is-always-right jurisprudence of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Against this backdrop, I want to focus on Justice Clarence Thomas and specifically on the record he compiled during the past term. There is something almost discordant about including Justice Thomas in a discussion of \u201cthe future\u201d because his highly personal and eccentric jurisprudence would take the court and the Constitution hurtling backward into the past. While Justice Thomas\u2019s unyielding view of originalism has been evident since he took his seat on the court 27 years ago, his output in the most recent term was little short of astonishing. In a term that produced only 59 signed opinions, I counted six important and long-enduring precedents that Justice Thomas would have wiped off the books as inconsistent with the original understanding. In another case, Justice Thomas reiterated his vigorous and longstanding objection to the \u201cnegative\u201d Commerce Clause. This is a doctrine that dates at least to the mid-19th century, prohibiting states from discriminating against out-of-state enterprises in favor of their own residents. It is based on the court\u2019s \u201cnegative\u201d interpretation of the Commerce Clause, which empowers the national government to regulate interstate commerce and so, by extrapolation, deprives the states of that power. The court has applied it dozens of times over many years as a bulwark against a feared \u201cBalkanization\u201d of the country. But it is not, as Justice Thomas has frequently pointed out, actually in the Constitution\u2019s text.In his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas agreed that the provision was unconstitutional. But \u201cearly American courts did not have a severability doctrine,\u201d he said, and \u201cour modern severability precedents are in tension with longstanding limits on the judicial power.\u201d Although \u201cno party in this case has asked us to reconsider these precedents,\u201d he concluded, \u201cat some point, it behooves us to do so.\u201dTo Justice Sotomayor\u2019s 14-page majority opinion, Justice Thomas attached a nine-page concurring opinion, agreeing with the Fourth Amendment analysis while attacking the exclusionary rule in general and its application to the states in particular. \u201cThe Founders would not have understood the logic of the exclusionary rule,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cThe exclusionary rule appears nowhere in the Constitution, postdates the founding by more than a century, and contradicts several longstanding principles of the common law.\u201d He said \u201cthe assumption that state courts must apply the federal exclusionary rule is legally dubious,\u201d and urged the court to revisit the entire issue.Why do I call this opinion my favorite? Justice Thomas, I\u2019m willing to assume \u2014 as I do of all members of the Supreme Court \u2014 is a man of high principle. Yet I searched his concurring opinion in vain for a citation to a nationwide injunction issued three years ago by a federal district judge in Texas and upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2016 on a 4-to-4 tie vote. The case was United States v. Texas. The subject was President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, known as DAPA, granting temporary deferral of deportation to the parents of the young \u201cDreamers\u201d who had received protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, DACA. The district court not only found in favor of the states that had challenged DAPA but, over the Obama administration\u2019s objections, gave the injunction nationwide scope. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the injunction on a 2-to-1 vote.In the spring of 2016, Justice Scalia had died and had not yet been replaced. A 4-to-4 tie at the Supreme Court upholds the lower court\u2019s judgment without an opinion and without identifying which justices are on which side. There is no doubt which side Justice Thomas was on. If he had any problem with a nationwide injunction then, he kept that to himself, rather than join the four liberal justices to make a 5-to-3 decision overturning the injunction.Taken individually, the opinions I\u2019ve discussed here may seem quite technical and rather unremarkable. Taken as a whole, as the work of a single justice during a single Supreme Court term, they paint an extraordinary picture of a judge at war not only with modernity but with the entire project of constitutional law. Is this the future of the Supreme Court? That\u2019s not my argument. Notably, in nearly all these cases, Justice Thomas spoke only for himself. And I have no reason to suppose that Brett Kavanaugh would follow in these footsteps.So no, the court\u2019s future is not already here, not yet. Those of us on the progressive side of the street are unlikely to look back on Justice Kennedy\u2019s final term with nostalgia. But soon enough, we may decide that it was the best we\u2019re going to see for a long time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Archaeologists Find 3,200-Year-Old Cheese in an Egyptian Tomb", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few years ago, a team of archaeologists cleaning sand from an ancient Egyptian tomb discovered a group of broken jars, one of them containing a mysterious white substance.\u201cThe archaeologists suspected it was food, according to the conservation method and the position of the finding inside the tomb, but we discovered it was cheese after the first tests,\u201d Enrico Greco, the lead author of the paper and a research assistant at Peking University in Beijing, said in an email.The ancient cheese, which was sometimes included in the feasts buried alongside wealthy Egyptians, was probably similar in consistency to chevre, but with a \u201creally, really acidy\u201d bite, according to Paul Kindstedt, a professor at the University of Vermont who studies the chemistry and history of cheese.\u201cIt would be high in moisture; it would be spreadable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not last long; it would spoil very quickly.\u201dAnd while the sample retrieved by Dr. Greco\u2019s colleagues may be old, others have discovered traces of ancient cheese or yogurt (the two can be difficult to distinguish) that long predate even the recent finding, Dr. Kindstedt said.\u201cOther groups have done a lot of work with extracting lipid residues, fat residues, from ancient pots going back as far as 7000 B.C.,\u201d he said.In fact, in 1942, a team of researchers reported a finding not dissimilar to that of Dr. Greco and his colleagues, Dr. Kindstedt pointed out. In a journal article, they described finding a substance in ancient Egyptian jars that they suspected to be cheese dating back to 3200 B.C. The samples, they wrote, had \u201cno smell and only a dusty taste.\u201dBut even if the cheese Dr. Greco tested isn\u2019t the oldest ever found, the findings stand out for another reason: the application of a state-of-the-art protein analysis.\u201cAs I say to my students every year when I get to Egypt, someone has to go ahead and analyze these residues with modern capabilities,\u201d said Dr. Kindstedt, who added that he plans to use Dr. Greco\u2019s paper in his teachings this fall. \u201cThis is a logical next step and I think you\u2019re going to see a lot more of this.\u201dIn their analysis, Dr. Greco and his colleagues found hundreds of peptides, or chains of amino acids.

{"Headline": "The Secret to Ant Efficiency Is Idleness", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScienceTakeBut that is fable, the ultimate in what scientists call anecdotal evidence. And new research at Georgia Tech suggests that although ant colonies are very efficient, that may be because 70 percent of them are doing very little \u2014 at least when it comes to tunnel digging.The reason, it seems, is that the ants were working in narrow tunnels where traffic jams could easily clog up the entire effort to build nests. So it helped if some of them took a pileup in the tunnel as a signal to suggest that they take a break. To come to this conclusion, they set up material for the ants in containers in the lab. After painting identifying codes on the ants, videotaping them and analyzing who was doing what, the team found several things.The ants were easily discouraged by traffic jams and were flexible enough to turn around and go back out the tunnel. It was the hardworking few who kept the job going. \u201cSome of them worked for five hours at a time just going up and down and up and down and up and down. And most of the other ants never appeared at the tunnel,\u201d Dr. Goldman said.This didn\u2019t have to do with some ants being lazier than others. His team could remove the hard workers and another group would take over and do just as well, and the same 70/30 rule would hold.After running various computer models of the behavior, he found out that this was the ideal distribution of work. And that the individual virtual ants had to have idleness built in as a potential response to a crowded tunnel.To get the digging done efficiently, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s only one good strategy\u201d \u2014 an unequal distribution of tunnel digging work and a willingness to turn away from work.If you start out in a computer model with eager diggers, he said, you have to add some programming that says, for any ant, \u201cI\u2019m going to get down there and then if it\u2019s taking too long, I\u2019ll turn around.\u201d He said, \u201cYou have to add a lot of this kind of giving up in the eager ants to make it actually work.\u201dHis team also tested this out with small robots and came up with the same conclusion. And this could matter quite a bit, he pointed out. The formula does not apply only to tunnel digging, but to any situation in which a traffic jam could stop progress, such as a swarm of robots entering a disaster site to search for survivors or hazards. Or imagine a lot of nanobots deployed into the bloodstream to deliver drugs to some site in the body.If this distribution of labor operates this way in your office, however, (the 30 percent may laugh knowingly now), there\u2019s no real solace to be taken from the ant experiment, unless you are digging a tunnel perhaps. Assuming everyone has their own computer, phone and cubicle, they could all be working all the time.It does, however, apply to kitchens with limited space. Too many chefs? But then we knew that.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alabama Beachgoers May Have Killed Hundreds of Protected Birds", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBeachgoers in Alabama who descended on the breeding ground of a threatened seabird species this summer scared adults away from their nests and used the eggs to decorate the sand, most likely killing hundreds of chicks, wildlife experts say.\u201cThey\u2019re very sacred to us because they are so sensitive,\u201d she said.\u201cThe population was doing so poorly elsewhere, this was basically one last shot for a large number of adults,\u201d Ms. Barnes said.Andrew Haffenden, a seasonal steward for Birmingham Audubon, lives on Dauphin Island, about three miles from the small shoal in Mobile Bay where the birds were nesting.He said he saw a volleyball net appear on the shoal earlier this summer, and on July 4, he saw 17 boats around it.\u201cI said, \u2018We really need to get out there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Haffenden recalled.After acquiring a boat, he and another member of the group visited the island on July 10 and discovered about 700 breeding pairs and more than 100 chicks that were too young to fly \u2014 making it the largest least tern colony in the state, according to Roger Clay, a wildlife biologist at the Alabama Division of Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly bigger than what we\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d he said, adding that a typical least tern colony would number around 50 to 150 birds.They also found the volleyball net and 26 eggs placed in a circle by visitors to the island, surrounding a dome of sand \u201clike jewels in the crown\u201d and left to bake in the sun, Mr. Haffenden said.Least tern parents will sit on their young in order to shade them from the sun. Each nest usually has two eggs.\u201cI always refer to them as the world\u2019s best parents,\u201d Ms. Barnes said, adding that the birds are tiny but fierce and will defend their young mightily.But if the parents or the nests are disrupted, the chicks will overheat and die.Some of the eggs that were used to decorate the sand had cracks or depressions indicating that they had been in the process of hatching, Mr. Haffenden said.Not all of the eggs were tampered with, Ms. Barnes said, but the activity on the beach scared the adult birds, preventing the eggs from receiving shade.When Birmingham Audubon returned to the shoal later last month, the group counted nearly 70 fledglings, about three weeks old. On Aug. 2, around 15 more were counted. But those numbers were nowhere near what they should have been, Ms. Barnes said.\u201cWe only confirmed an estimated 85 fledglings out of 1,400 birds,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s an astronomical loss for reproductive output for the species.\u201dThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act is enforced by the Fish and Wildlife Service. A spokeswoman for the agency said it and the Justice Department were investigating what happened in Alabama.In order to protect the birds, Birmingham Audubon did not report its findings to the public until after the least terns had completed their nesting cycle.Least terns typically start nesting in May, Ms. Barnes said, \u201cso by July, there should be chicks everywhere.\u201dMs. Barnes said the birds most likely gathered at this particular beach because they had poor breeding results elsewhere.On July 11, Birmingham Audubon fenced off the whole area and put up protective signs. The volleyball net has been removed.Since then, the group has not observed human footprints or any boats pulling up to the shoal, Ms. Barnes said. But the species still needs help to thrive.\u201cIt takes a community to protect our birds,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBest of the bivalves? Alison Roman says yes, and steams them in a pool of toasted garlic oil with dry white wine. I have more than a few unpopular opinions about food (sandwiches are just O.K.), but I think one that really gets people going is this: Clams are the best bivalves. There, I said it. Raw, they are milder, brinier and cleaner than an oyster. Steamed, they are juicier, meatier and less fishy than a mussel. They are perfect in every way.To convince you that this is true, I suggest cooking clams in a pool of toasted garlic oil with a dry, acidic white wine (nothing you wouldn\u2019t drink, please) and lots of thinly sliced celery, topped with tons of herbs and a squeeze of lemon. There could be smoked or spiced pork like chorizo, sausage or bacon added at the beginning with the garlic if that\u2019s your thing (it is absolutely my thing), but no pressure.To eat, I like to set the pot I\u2019ve steamed them in on the table along with some buttered toast or torn hunks of crusty bread for dipping and soaking up all the juices. If the clams are especially large, I have been known to go through the trouble of picking them from their shells, coarsely chopping them, and adding them back to the broth with the celery and chorizo, then spooning this mixture onto the toast, eating the whole thing in a civilized fashion with a knife and fork (alternatively, bare hands).When you\u2019re selecting the clams for this purpose, smaller is better. Littlenecks can come in varying sizes, but the sweet spot for me is one that is roughly between the size of a large grape and small apricot. They are the most popular and widely available clams, but if you have access to varieties like Manila clams (one of the smallest) or cockles (a small clamlike bivalve) then go for those, because they are sweet and mild and incredibly delicious.This steamed clam dish calls for a bone-dry, taut white that is as bracing and refreshing as a dunk in the ocean. That leaves a lot of territory: Both France and Italy abound in these sorts of wines. Muscadet from the Atlantic end of the Loire is a natural choice, as is Etna Bianco, made of the carricante grape, from Sicily. Vermentino from Liguria or Corsica (where it is called vermentinu) would be delicious. The sauvignon blanc wines of the Loire would likewise work well, as long as they are not too fruity or flamboyant. Chablis would be a slightly more elevated choice, while good aligot\u00e9 from Burgundy would be a delightful outlier. For sherry lovers, it will not get much better than a good bottle of manzanilla.

Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Not crazy like a fox, but crazy as a loon.So let me answer that question: Is he crazy? No, he\u2019s not. Not, at least, in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades \u2014 including recently \u2014 in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling, obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with, always on, outspoken to a fault even when he might be at fault, angry, charming, intense and also strikingly confident. Which is a long way of saying deeply human, with all the positive and negative characteristics that suggests. And that is why, to me, Elon Musk has become the id of tech. But his desires and needs are never unconscious or hidden; they are all out there in the brightest Technicolor for all to see. In the oddest of ways, he is transparent, so utterly direct that it is unsettling and even painful at times to those around him.This week I have talked to a lot of people who know Mr. Musk, including those who adore him and those who have had it with his brusque intensity. And what I found among his current and former colleagues is that they really have the exact same story about an impulsive and driven boss who runs a very hot and messy kitchen and does not spend a lot of time apologizing for it. Some grew weary of this and left, while others thrive under the withering lights. Still others left and then came back, drawn in by the glow.This is not a new phenomenon in tech, and especially in Silicon Valley, a place that needs its complicated gods.Too much? Sure, but it was a pretty good myth and even better since it was largely true. Over the ensuing years, Mr. Jobs used his famous reality distortion field to bend the news media and investors and everyone else to his will. He also warred many times with some journalists and investors, but no one remembers that anymore. His death, much too early and so very tragic, sealed his epic tale for eternity. And so it was Mr. Musk who became the obvious choice, although the comparison to Mr. Jobs is certainly not a perfect one. Mr. Jobs was elegant and spare and even quiet; Mr. Musk is all pomp and circumstance. Mr. Jobs traveled in his mind; Mr. Musk wants to die on Mars (just not on landing, as he told me in an interview a few years ago).What they do share is a proclivity for what is perhaps the most important element of all truly legendary makers of important things: Creative destruction.For Mr. Jobs, it was a bet-the-company approach that ushered in a whole new way of computing. For Mr. Musk it is a lot of big notions, any one of which would be hard to do alone, from electric self-driving cars to ubiquitous solar energy to landing a spent rocket ship on a platform in the ocean. Yeah, he did that, too.This is not to say I am an Elon fanboy, as I find the hagiography around him tiresome and even toxic when it comes to some of his acolytes, who cannot take one valid criticism of their leader without descending into madness. (And Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t do himself any favors by whipping them up \u2014 it\u2019s indulgent and irresponsible.) But I will say that this whole debate brings to mind something that an angel investor named Pejman Nozad said to me offhand many years ago, when he was bemoaning all the stupid start-up ideas that he saw littering the landscape. Silly social networks, dumb photo filter apps, yet another delivery service for millennials. \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d he said, \u201cis a lot of big minds chasing small ideas.\u201dMake no mistake, Mr. Musk\u2019s mind and ideas are big ones. He has said publicly, and others agree, that he is simply exhausted and under intense pressure, and these recent mistakes will soon be forgotten. But he has been careless, and fewer people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has tarnished his reputation by going after imagined enemies, fair critics and those who don\u2019t wish him well with the same tweet daggers. It\u2019s a huge waste of time, when what he has to do to seal his status is actually to build a strong and stable company that is not just revolving around his aura, and a team that does its best work with or without him.And, of course, delete that Twitter app off his phone. After all, can you imagine Steve Jobs tweeting? No, neither can I.Advertisement"}

Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.The surge suggests the tech industry\u2019s recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles.\u201cThis is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,\u201d said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s gone from being niche to being mainstream.\u201dApple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed.The Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d \u201cWar Room with Owen Shroyer,\u201d and \u201cReal News with David Knight.\u201d Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News.An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store.\u201cWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines.\u201dGoogle said it deleted Mr. Jones\u2019s channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment \u2014 not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones\u2019s podcast and his Infowars app.Google said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, \u201cIf an app violates our policies, we take action.\u201dFrom July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app\u2019s rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days.Researchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula.The Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a \u201cyou\u201d tab for saved articles.)On the tab that led to the outlet\u2019s news articles, a sampling of the app\u2019s stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (\u201cDemocrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!\u201d) to sensationalist (\u201cShock: FDA Acquiring \u2018Fresh\u2019 Aborted Baby Parts to Make \u2018Humanized Mice\u2019\u201d) to humdrum (\u201cCalorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years \u2014 Study\u201d).Many of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley\u2019s removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category \u201cInfowars Exclusives\u201d on the app included no stories.The merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills.One ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with \u201ccensored\u201d tape over his mouth and said: \u201cFight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special.

{"Headline": "Did Juul Lure Teenagers and Get \u2018Customers for Life\u2019?", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "The e-cigarette company says it never sought teenage users, but the F.D.A. is investigating whether Juul intentionally marketed its devices to youth.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The leaders of a small start-up, PAX Labs, gathered at a board meeting in early 2015 to review the marketing strategy for its sleek new electronic cigarette, called Juul. They watched video clips of hip young people, posed flirtatiously holding Juuls. And they talked about the name of the gadget, meant to suggest an object of beauty and to catch on as a verb \u2014 as in \u201cto Juul.\u201dWhile the campaign wasn\u2019t targeted specifically at teenagers, a former senior manager said that he and others in the company were well aware it could appeal to them. After Juuls went on sale in June 2015, he said, the company quickly realized that teenagers were, in fact, using them because they posted images of themselves vaping Juuls on social media.The former manager said the company was careful to make sure the models in its original campaign were at least 21, but it wasn\u2019t until late 2016 or January 2017 that the company said it decided the models in all Juul ads should be over age 35 \u2014 to be \u201cbetter aligned\u201d with a mission of focusing on adult smokers. Only in June of this year did the company again change its policy, this time to using only real people who had switched from cigarettes to Juul.The company recently modified the names of its flavors \u2014 using creme instead of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cucumber instead of cool cucumber. Juul said it \u201cheard the criticism\u201d that teenagers might be attracted to the flavors and \u201cresponded by simplifying the names and losing the descriptors.\u201d\u201cFrom our perspective, this is not about getting adults to stop smoking,\u201d the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, said in an interview. \u201cThis is about getting kids to start vaping, and make money and have them as customers for life.\u201dThe company, now called Juul Labs, denies that it ever sought to attract teenagers. James Monsees, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, said selling Juuls to youth was \u201cantithetical to the company\u2019s mission.\u201dMr. David said sales didn\u2019t take off until 2017, after Juul had improved its sales and distribution expertise, and, by then, had a more sober online marketing campaign.The former Juul manager, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition that his name not be used, saying he worried about facing the ire of the company, said that within months of Juul\u2019s 2015 introduction, it became evident that teenagers were either buying Juuls online or finding others who made the purchases for them. Some people bought more Juul kits on the company\u2019s website than they could individually use \u2014 sometimes 10 or more devices.\u201cFirst, they just knew it was being bought for resale,\u201d said the former senior manager, who was briefed on the company\u2019s business strategy. \u201cThen, when they saw the social media, in fall and winter of 2015, they suspected it was teens.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration announced it was investigating Juul\u2019s marketing efforts in April. Juuls and other e-cigarettes are regulated by the F.D.A. as tobacco products because nicotine derives from tobacco leaves. E-cigarette users inhale far fewer toxins than do smokers of traditional cigarettes. The nicotine inhaled while vaping is less a concern for adults than these toxins, but it remains a serious health issue for teenagers, whose brains are still developing.Juul, in a letter responding to the F.D.A.\u2019s demand for documents, said it had converted one million smokers to Juul, but the company data is drawn from self-reported surveys on its website and is unverifiable.\u201cTwo-thirds of adult smokers have stated they want to quit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s hard, and they\u2019ve probably tried many times to quit. We must recognize the potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products.\u201dBut Eric Lindblom, a former F.D.A. tobacco official who heads the tobacco control program at Georgetown Law, said Juul\u2019s internal concerns about teenage use demonstrate they are in some ways \u201cno different than the cigarette industry.\u201d\u201cThey are going to maximize their sales and profits any way they can,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to do that within the law, but they are going to press the gray areas as much as they can.\u201dOver the last three years, Juul has had a meteoric rise. It has become the dominant seller of e-cigarettes, now controlling a remarkable 72 percent of the market, according to Nielsen data. In July, the company completed a round of fund-raising for $1.2 billion, putting it in rarefied air. From a virtual standing-start in 2015, it is now valued by investors at $16 billion.Juul\u2019s other co-founder, Adam Bowen, said that he was aware early on of the risks e-cigarettes posed to teenagers, and that the company had tried to make the gadgets \u201cas adult-oriented as possible,\u201d purposely choosing not to use cartoon characters or candy names for its flavors.The F.D.A. has ordered Juul to turn over the company\u2019s research and marketing documents, including focus group data and toxicology reports, to determine whether it intentionally courted the youth market.The day after receiving the F.D.A. letter, Juul announced it would spend $30 million to combat underage vaping and recruited Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, who helped lead the multistate 1998 master settlement with tobacco companies, to run an advisory board to counsel Juul on its efforts. Mr. Miller said recommendations might include more controls on social media marketing and better surveillance of retail outlets, but the ultimate decision on how to spend the money remains with Juul.Mr. Miller says he sees huge potential in e-cigarettes. He believes Juul and other e-cigarette companies have already helped lower the adult smoking rate to 13.9 percent in 2017 from 16.8 percent in 2014. \u201cThe only plausible explanation is e-cigarettes,\u201d he said.A report from Citigroup, citing Nielsen data, said that sales of traditional cigarettes dropped 6 percent in the first quarter of this year and \u201cit\u2019s impossible to say what has caused the change for sure but the most obvious case is Juul.\u201dMr. Bowen, 42, and Mr. Monsees, 38, the company\u2019s founders, met in 2003 in a graduate product-design program at Stanford University, bonding over brainstorming sessions and cigarettes. Both had been smokers since their teens, and both have since quit; Mr. Monsees regularly uses a Juul.The culmination of the program was a masters thesis, and both had struggled to find a worthy subject. In 2004, about six months before the thesis was due, they got to talking about their smoking habits and, within days, were excitedly sending emails back and forth about developing an alternative to cigarettes.Big tobacco companies were experimenting with e-cigarettes, but there was no real market for them until around 2010, when NJoy, an Arizona company, became the industry\u2019s first darling. By 2013, e-cigarettes were a $1.7-billion-a-year business, still only a small fraction of the $90 billion cigarette business.But then NJoy gambled on an e-cigarette that looked virtually identical to a cigarette. It was a mistake, said Craig Weiss, the chief executive who pushed the so-called cigalike strategy and now consults for Juul. As NJoy\u2019s fortuned flagged, he said he realized that people didn\u2019t want a product that looked so much like a cigarette that it still left them with the stigma of being a smoker. NJoy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2016, later re-emerging.Juul initially developed a product in 2010 that looked like a fountain pen and distributed it in specialty vape shops. Its sales grew to a modest $30 million by 2015.Then the company found its current design, a sleek stick that looks like a flash drive, and largely stumbled onto a new way of delivering nicotine: it mixes nicotine with a chemical called benzoic acid. The result is that when Juul users inhale, they get a very quick and powerful burst of nicotine. This gives smokers a more cigarette-like experience, but medical researchers say it also makes the product more addictive for youth.The company launched its new product in June 2015, with starter kits costing $35, and packs of four nicotine refill cartridges selling for $16 \u2014 each roughly the equivalent of the cost of a pack of cigarettes. According to Nielsen, sales in the first month were roughly $1,500 and reached over $1 million that December. It began a steady climb, and then experienced explosive growth in the beginning of 2017, with sales rising 627 percent in the four weeks ending June 17, 2017, according to Nielsen and Wells Fargo Securities.The company said that toward the end of 2016 and around the beginning of 2017, it changed its social marketing campaign and guidelines to require all models to be over the age of 35.In the last two months, Juul has removed the flavor focus and now uses only \u201creal people\u201d who have used Juul to switch from smoking cigarettes, the company said.Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that he was prepared to be a fan of a product like Juul if it is responsibly marketed and shown to help adults quit smoking. But he cited a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that in 2017 2.1 million high schoolers and middle schoolers used e-cigarettes \u2014 \u201cand the reports about high school students using Juul are rampant,\u201d he said.Mr. Myers observed that Juul \u201cdelivers nicotine so much better than any comparable product on the market,\u201d and so its popularity means that \u201cboth the hopes of the e-cig fans, and fears of those concerned about e-cigs and kids, rise exponentially.\u201dOn Jan. 23, The Boulder Daily Camera published a front-page story about the growing concerns of local educators in Colorado about student use of Juuls.Five days later, Carrie Yantzer, the principal at Nederland Middle-Senior High School, received an email that immediately struck her as suspicious. The writer introduced himself as Bruce Harter, a former educator working with Juul to develop an anti-vaping curriculum for schools.\u201cI read about the challenges you\u2019re having with Juul,\u201d Mr. Harter wrote. He offered a free, three-hour curriculum provided by Juul to discourage teens from using e-cigarettes by teaching them about their brains and giving them mindfulness exercises.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found from focus groups with teenage Juul users is that young people don\u2019t understand the dangers of nicotine addiction,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey sometimes feel \u2018pushed\u2019 by friends to use e-cigarettes. We also found that they don\u2019t have operative ways to deal with stress and the emotional ups and downs of their lives right now.\u201dMs. Yantzer was angry. \u201cIt sounded preposterous,\u201d she said, and the company \u201cdeceptive.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t the only school administrator to get such a letter. The Boulder school district and, ultimately, the state of Colorado condemned the offer as a brand-building exercise that was tone-deaf at the very least.\u201cThe way we see this is a fox guarding the henhouse,\u201d said Alison Reidmohr, tobacco communications specialist for the Colorado Department of Public Health. \u201cA company that stands to profit from, and currently profit off, youth using a product can\u2019t be trusted to prevent use of this product.\u201dAshley Gould, Juul\u2019s chief administrative officer, said the company, because it has not built management around former tobacco-industry employees, was unaware the tactic had been used by cigarette companies. However, Juul\u2019s board of directors includes experienced investors, including Nicholas Pritzker, a billionaire whose family controlled one of the country\u2019s largest chewing tobacco companies, Conwood, which was acquired in 2006 by Reynolds American for $3.5 billion.For its part, Juul said it was still deciding what to do with that school program. Ms. Gould said the company did not realize the curriculum would offend or that the idea harked to a tactic big tobacco companies used decades ago. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should\u2019ve known.\u201dJuul has a new innovation in the works, a Bluetooth-enabled version of its e-cigarette that it hopes could push more smokers to switch without risking youth uptake. Mr. Monsees called it a \u201csmart\u201d e-cigarette.The Bluetooth-equipped Juul might provide a way for adult vapers to measure their nicotine use. It also might discourage teen use by disabling the device unless it\u2019s in the presence of its adult buyer, perhaps by linking it to the buyer\u2019s cellphone. The solution would still require effective controls on sales to minors at brick-and-mortar stores and online retail outlets.The company has also hired Jim Esquea, who was an assistant secretary at the health department during the Obama administration, and Gerald Masoudi, a former F.D.A. chief counsel.The company is also ratcheting up its lobbying efforts. It has reported spending $450,000 on lobbying so far in 2018 \u2014 substantially more than the $120,000 reported spent for all of 2017. It also recently started a political action committee, although no donations have yet been reported. In June, Kevin Burns, Juul\u2019s chief executive, gave $50,000 to the Republican congressional leadership fund.The centerpiece of Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s tobacco control strategy is a plan that would potentially greatly benefit e-cigarette companies, including Juul. It would require tobacco companies to reduce nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes so much that they were no longer addictive. The proposal is still in the early discussion phase, with the tobacco industry strongly opposed. But it would potentially make Juul, a potent nicotine delivery device, far more appealing to smokers.Mr. Monsees, a Juul co-founder, says he believes that e-cigarettes are a key to reducing smoking, and can be profitable without sales to teenagers.\u201cYes, I want to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on the board with a fiduciary duty that obligates me to make money.\u201dBut he added, \u201cThe best investor return in the long term comes from more adults turning away from combustible cigarettes.\u201dAlexandra Yoon-Hendricks contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Mr. Bal is the political editor of The Caravan magazine.NEW DELHI \u2014 On July 30, four million residents of the Indian state of Assam were effectively stripped of their nationality after their names were excluded from the recently formed National Register of Citizens.Indian authorities claim to have initiated and executed the process to identify illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, which shares several hundred miles of its border with Assam, but it has exacerbated fears of a witch hunt against the Bengali-origin Muslim minority in the state.The idea of such screening to determine citizenship goes back to the aftermath of the 1947 Partition of British India into India and Pakistan. A register of citizens set up in Assam in 1951 was never effectively implemented. Twenty-four years after the Partition, the mostly Bengali Eastern Pakistan seceded from Western Pakistan with Indian military help, and Bangladesh was formed on March 24, 1971. The brutal war that accompanied the formation of Bangladesh had sent millions of refugees into the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal.People born after 1971 could submit documents that link them to parents or grandparents who possessed the primary documents. So each person going through the process had to show a link to a name on the 1951 register and the only two voter lists \u2014 those of 1965-66 and 1970-71 \u2014 that were ever made public. The N.R.C. may well have set in motion a process that has uncanny parallels with what took place in Myanmar, which also shares a border with Bangladesh. In 1982, a Burmese citizenship law stripped a million Rohingya of the rights they had had since the country\u2019s independence in 1948. This began to change with the rise of the Hindu nationalists in India, who worked to frame the Bengali-origin immigrants as two distinct categories: the Bengali-origin Hindus, whom they described as seeking refuge in India from Muslim-majority Bangladesh, and the Bengali-origin Muslims, whom they see as dangerous foreigners who have illegally infiltrated Indian Territory.Apart from removing a huge number of voters who were likely to vote against the B.J.P., the party has already shown that as Mr. Modi struggles on the economic front, the N.R.C. will be a handy tool to consolidate Hindu voters in Assam \u2014 the majority of the people rendered stateless are Muslims \u2014 and the rest of the country going into the general elections in the summer of 2019.

{"Headline": "Taliban Launch Assault on Ghazni, a Key Afghan City", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces battled for control of the key southeastern city of Ghazni on Friday, with both sides claiming victory at the end of the day without any independent confirmation.If the Taliban takeover is confirmed, such a rout would be the insurgents\u2019 most important strategic gain in years. If it falters, it will be evidence once again that the insurgents can do serious damage but cannot take and hold territory.Local witnesses and health officials feared the casualty toll would be high. Zahir Shah Nikmal, head of the provincial department of public health, said 16 bodies and 40 wounded people had been brought to hospitals so far. Almost all were members of the security forces, he said, and officials were trying to arrange evacuations by helicopter for the critically wounded.The American military said it had sent helicopters to support Afghan troops in Ghazni, and that it had carried out one airstrike, using a drone.Afghan forces \u201cheld their ground and maintain control of all government centers,\u201d said Lt. Col. Martin L. O\u2019Donnell, a spokesman for the American military in Afghanistan. \u201cThis is yet another failed Taliban attempt to seize terrain, which will result in yet another eye-catching but strategically inconsequential headline.\u201dGhazni, a city of 280,000 people according to Afghan figures, sits astride the important Highway 1 linking Kabul and Kandahar, the second largest Afghan city, in the south. If the Taliban took Ghazni and held it, they would essentially have cut off the traditional Taliban homelands in the south from northern Afghanistan and the capital.Government officials denied the city was at risk of falling, but they conceded that the insurgents had fought to within 300 yards of the governor\u2019s office and police headquarters.\u201cFighting is ongoing but the whole city has not been taken by the Taliban,\u201d Mohammad Arif Noori, the spokesman for Ghazni\u2019s governor, said by telephone on Friday morning. \u201cWe will not allow them to take the city.\u201dZabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said on Twitter that the insurgents had infiltrated every part of the city. \u201cHundreds of Mujahedeen entered the city, captured the police headquarters and all six police districts and an important military base, Bala Hesar,\u201d Mr. Mujahid said in an emailed statement.\u201cAttacks are underway on the governor\u2019s office, the N.D.S. headquarters and other government offices,\u201d he said, using the acronym for the National Directorate for Security, the Afghan intelligence agency. Mr. Mujahid said the insurgents had closed Highway 1 to prevent reinforcements from reaching Ghazni.Government officials denied a Taliban claim that the insurgents had shot down helicopters, but confirmed that two had been forced to make emergency landings. They said both of the two helipads in the city were under attack and that medical evacuation helicopters were struggling to land.Residents reached by telephone in several neighborhoods, before phone links were cut midafternoon, said that heavy fighting was ongoing around them.\u201cTaliban are fighting with their whole power, they brought fighters from as many districts and provinces as they could,\u201d said one resident, Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, a member of the provincial council, speaking by telephone from the city. \u201cThere are Taliban militants in all roads and streets of the city, but they are facing strong resistance from government forces.\u201dBrig. Gen. Mohammad Radmanish, the spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense, denied Ghazni was under any serious threat. \u201cIt is just propaganda by the Taliban. The whole city is under the control of Afghan forces,\u201d he said. Six Afghan soldiers had been killed in the fighting, he said.Provincial councilmen from Ghazni complained that promised reinforcements never reached the city Friday, and in Wardak Province north of Ghazni, the insurgents blew up a small bridge on Highway 1 to cut off help, according to Abdul Rahman Mangal, spokesman for the governor of Wardak. He said security forces there reopened the road and were patrolling it to prevent Taliban ambushes.Ghazni council member Esmatullah Jamradwal was in Kabul but speaking all day by telephone to his colleagues, until the lines went down. \u201cThe government is lying about sending reinforcements and the situation being under control,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is under control, the security forces in government offices are just trying to block the Taliban from entering their offices.\u201dGovernment officials said their defense was hampered because the insurgents were operating in civilian neighborhoods, preventing airstrikes. \u201cCommando forces are responding to the Taliban attack but we are not carrying out airstrikes to prevent civilian casualties,\u201d said Mr. Noori, the governor\u2019s spokesman. He accused the Taliban of using the civilian population as human shields. Eight civilians had been wounded so far, he said.\u201cAll areas are in our control,\u201d Colonel Mashal said in a video, as gunshots were heard in the background. \u201cMembers of the Parliament, all the people have picked up arms with us.\u201dMany areas of Ghazni Province have been heavily contested by the insurgents in recent years, but this was the first serious attempt to take the provincial capital.Arif Rahmani, a member of Parliament from Ghazni, said the government had not acted on months of repeated warnings that the Taliban were amassing around and inside the city. He said that while the police had shown brave resistance since the assault began, they were low on ammunition and food and were struggling with communications, with the Taliban having forced phone networks to shut down.\u201cThe reality is that 70 percent of the burden of the fighting in Ghazni is on the shoulders of the police, and their structure has long since fallen apart,\u201d Mr. Rahmani said.The Ghazni assault comes at a critical stage in the Afghan war, when President Ashraf Ghani and the Americans have been trying to persuade the Taliban to enter peace talks.President Ghani\u2019s top adviser, Fazel Fazly, said in a Twitter post that Mr. Ghani had convened a security meeting and told officials that \u201cwe have sufficient number of security forces in #Ghazni.\u201dBy the end of the day, after nearly 18 hours of fighting, the situation remained unclear. With cellular telephone coverage cut off entirely from midafternoon, information was scarce. Cellphone companies said they were acting to protect their personnel and facilities.Senior officials in Kabul, speaking at a televised news conference at 4 p.m., were upbeat. \u201cThe Taliban suffered heavy casualties and have been pushed out of the city,\u201d said General Radmanish.In a telephone interview, deputy presidential spokesman Shahhussain Murtazawi said reinforcements of Afghan Police Special Forces and Army commandos had arrived and the city was under government control.The Taliban also boasted of victory, broadcasting telephone numbers for soldiers or policemen who wanted to surrender to call, and promising amnesty to anyone who turned themselves in.Mujib Mashal and Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

There is simply no precedent for imposing the political equivalent of the death penalty in such cases. The Obama campaign paid $375,000 in fines for its violations of election law. A similar case was unsuccessfully brought against the former Senator John Edwards for payments he made to keep an adulterous affair secret while he was running for president. Given all this, and Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president, we are left with a situation in which Democrats seeking adjudication of their allegations would have to pursue impeachment in the House and, if they were successful there, a subsequent trial in the Senate. But any such action is fraught with political peril. Turning the midterms into a referendum on impeachment could easily backfire. Campaign finance laws exist to ensure that the ability to influence elections is contained within prescribed boundaries. In other words, any violation of those laws represents illegal influence on an election. But if campaign finance violations now become impeachable offenses, what does the future hold? For one thing, elections wouldn\u2019t be able to settle anything. If a new precedent is set lowering the bar for removing a president from office, we will see more attempts to invoke that precedent and nullify elections. This would simply repeat what is happening now: an attempt to change a political conflict into a legal one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Alcohol Is Safe to Drink? None, Say These Researchers", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTake a NumberA large study of drinking habits in 195 countries contradicts widely shared advice on healthy drinking.No level of alcohol consumption conferred any health benefits, the authors also concluded \u2014 a finding that runs contrary to much previous research and public health guidelines in many countries.The analysis, involving 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, relied on 694 sources of data and analyzed 592 studies to determine the health risks of alcohol use. While the study is among the largest of its kind, it was also observational, linking population-wide consumption to population-wide trends. The methods left many experts unconvinced. The researchers relied on sales data and surveys to estimate the prevalence of drinking in each country and calculated alcohol consumption in standard drinks daily, defined as 10 grams, or about one-third of an ounce, of pure ethyl alcohol \u2014 the equivalent of 3.4 ounces of red wine at 13 percent alcohol, 12 ounces of beer at 3.5 percent alcohol or one ounce of 80-proof whiskey. They also devised a method for distinguishing alcohol consumption among tourists from that of resident populations, and linked consumption data to 23 health outcomes, ranging from car accidents, suicides and tuberculosis, to liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease and cancers.Rates of alcohol consumption vary widely by country, but in general the higher a country\u2019s income level, the higher the prevalence of drinking.The study, published in the Lancet, concluded that alcohol consumption is involved in 2.8 million deaths annually worldwide, making it the seventh leading risk factor for death and disability. Among people aged 15 to 49, alcohol use is the single most common risk factor for death and disability. In 2016, alcohol accounted for 6.8 percent of male and 2.2 percent of female deaths.\u201cThe main difference between alcohol and smoking is that no one is surprised that smoking is bad,\u201d said the lead author, Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of surprise, even among experts, that alcohol is as bad for you as it is.\u201dMany studies and most health guidelines suggest that moderate drinking \u2014 one or two drinks a day \u2014 is safe and may even reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke or diabetes. But Dr. Gakidou and her colleagues found that just one drink a day for one year increases alcohol-related health problems slightly, to 918 per 100,000 people from 914 per 100,000. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Documents Shed Light on the Life and Death of Thurman Munson", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe anguish still rises unmistakably from the pages of the deposition, which is now nearly 40 years old. In it, a witness named David Hall hesitates as he testifies, and a lawyer asks if he needs a short break. Hall declines and continues.By the time he is done, he has provided a devastating account of the final moments in the life of Thurman Munson, the Yankees catcher who died at age 32 when the plane he was flying crashed short of the runway at Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio on Aug. 2, 1979.Hall was in the plane when it slammed into the ground. In the deposition, he describes how in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Munson lay motionless, his head turned sideways and pressed against the instrument panel.\u201cHelp me, Dave,\u201d he said.Hall and Anderson tried. They strained to lift Munson\u2019s immobilized body from his seat, to free him from the wreckage, but they couldn\u2019t. And as smoke and flames engulfed the cockpit, Hall, a flight instructor who had previously taught Munson to fly propeller planes, and Anderson, a friend and business associate of Munson\u2019s, had no choice but to make their escape.Much has been written over the years about Munson\u2019s shocking death on that August day, but until now the depositions that were given in two lawsuits that were filed after the crash had remained stored away, out of the public realm. One of the suits, filed by the Yankees, was dismissed before it ever went to trial. The other, filed by Munson\u2019s widow, Diana, did go to trial, but the case was quickly settled after some initial testimony.The depositions provide a kind of oral history of Munson\u2019s life and death. They were uncovered this summer as a result of efforts made by Allan Blutstein, a lawyer who grew up on Long Island as a devoted Munson fan and has made a professional career of Freedom-of-Information actions, including recent, and controversial, filings involving employees at the Environmental Protection Agency.Blutstein did not need to make a Freedom-of-Information filing to obtain the Munson depositions. He simply had to be diligent and spend some money. After acquiring the documents, he made them available to The New York Times.The depositions, which include testimony from such notable Yankees as Reggie Jackson, Billy Martin and Graig Nettles, do not challenge the basic narrative of Munson\u2019s death \u2014 that he was a standout athlete who began flying less than two years earlier, in part so he could get home to Ohio to see his family on days off, and that he died while practicing takeoffs and landings at the airport.But what the depositions do provide is a revealing snapshot of Munson, who was sometimes a curmudgeon but was always the bedrock of a high-wattage Yankees team that had won the previous two World Series amid all the distractions served up by Jackson and Martin and George Steinbrenner, the team\u2019s unpredictable owner.It was Munson who continually played at a high level without creating controversies of his own. And it was Munson, the depositions suggest, who was both loyal and stubborn, both fierce and innocent.\u201cThurman had a routine,\u201d Gene Monahan, the longtime Yankees trainer, said in his deposition on May 29, 1981. \u201cHe used to come to the ballpark, have a couple of cookies and a glass of milk.\u201dTwo months before Monahan\u2019s deposition, Jackson \u2014 Munson\u2019s co-star and rival, and then, eventually, his friend \u2014 testified that Munson had become weary of the sport he played and all the time spent away from his wife and three children.\u201cHe was more interested in flying that goddamn plane than he was in playing baseball \u2014 to me,\u201d Jackson testified.Martin, in his deposition, said he was worried, as the team\u2019s manager, that Munson was draining himself by flying between games. \u201cI just kept telling him, you know, \u2018I don\u2019t like to see you flying during the season,\u2019 \u201d Martin testified.In her deposition, Diana Munson was asked if her husband took greenies, when he played, a reference to the amphetamines that many players, in the decades before drug testing, took for the jolt of energy they provided. She said that he had, but added that she thought he had stopped doing so once he started flying.\u201cAs a flier, he knew he could not take things into his body,\u2019\u2019 she testified. \u201cSo after he started flying, I never worried about greenies again.\u201dAll of those who gave depositions did so for two concurrent lawsuits, meaning they had to testify only once. The lawsuit filed by the Yankees sought reimbursement for the remaining money on Munson\u2019s contract. The wrongful death suit filed by Diana Munson sought $42 million in damages. Both suits targeted Cessna and FlightSafety International, the school where Munson learned to fly and became, by most accounts, a very good pilot.In her suit, Diana Munson claimed that Cessna pressured Munson to buy the $1.2 million twin-engine jet that crashed before he was ready to handle such a powerful machine. She also contended that her husband was not properly trained by FlightSafety International.Once her suit went to court, in May 1984, the case was settled in a matter of days and the terms were not disclosed. James Wiles, one of FlightSafety International\u2019s lawyers at the time, still contends there was no culpability in Munson\u2019s death on the part of either company. But a trial, he said, was just too risky.\u201cYou don\u2019t go into northeast Ohio where he was probably the most famous athlete at the time, and go against his widow and kids,\u201d Wiles, now 73, said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cYou just don\u2019t do it.\u201dWiles, who was present for all the depositions, recalled Martin being both cooperative and savvy in his testimony. He said Jackson had been notably profane but that his transcript had been cleaned up.Hall\u2019s testimony about Munson\u2019s final moments, taken on May 19, 1980, brought forth tears, Wiles said, but other moments were less emotional.He said that when Yogi Berra testified, he put a box of 24 baseballs in front of him and requested he sign them. Berra, who was a Yankees coach when Munson died, grudgingly obliged, but at one point asked if Wiles was authorized to make such a demand.\u201cIt\u2019s my deposition,\u201d Wiles said he told Berra.Much of the testimony from Yankees figures centered on Munson\u2019s physical and mental state leading up to the crash. Martin testified that Munson was the best catcher in baseball, better even than Johnny Bench, and so smart that he was the only catcher he had ever allowed to signal for a pitchout.But Martin also acknowledged that Munson, who played 11 years in the major leagues, was wearing down from the rigors of his position, and that he required more time at first base, the outfield and designated hitter to relieve pressure on his legs and knees.Munson had begun flying in spring training of 1978, and quickly grew devoted to it. There was testimony that Munson spent much of his spare time reading flight manuals and instruction books, even in the Yankees\u2019 clubhouse before games.And both Martin and Jackson testified that Steinbrenner \u2014 who did not give a deposition \u2014 had granted Munson special permission to fly his plane from city to city during the season, separate from the team.\u201cHe had a special deal with Steinbrenner,\u201d Jackson said in his testimony. \u201cYou know, Thurman was the most special Yankee when he was here. He could do anything he wanted to.\u201dJackson and Martin were passengers on flights that Munson piloted, as was Nettles. Nettles and Jackson flew with Munson from Seattle to Anaheim, Calif., after a game on July 12, 1979. Three days later, Martin flew with Munson from Anaheim to Kansas City, Mo., by way of Albuquerque.Jackson and Nettles recounted how, on their flight, the oxygen masks dropped down after a loud noise. They said Munson remained calm and landed the plane without incident. Martin described a flash of flames from one of the engines. Neither account was linked to the cause of the crash.Instead, the fault was attributed to pilot error, according to the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. It was determined that Munson was fatigued that day and did not properly go through his checklist and did not fasten his seatbelt.Charles Berry, an Air Force flight surgeon and medical officer at NASA for 14 years, testified in his deposition that \u201cpilot error caused by fatigue and overstress\u201d was the culprit, and he speculated that knee pain might have caused Munson to sleep improperly the night before.Critically, on the final approach, Munson never put down his flaps, which allow planes to fly at lower speeds. The plane crashed about 870 feet short of the runway at 4:02 p.m. and then slammed into a tree stump.Both Hall and Anderson, who was also a pilot, had flown with Munson on that fateful day only because they had run into him at the airport. Both testified at the 1984 trial before the settlement was reached.As for Blutstein, his route to the documents began in April on his way to pick up his daughter, a student at the University of Michigan. Driving through Ohio from his home in the Washington, D.C., area, he impulsively detoured to Munson\u2019s grave site in Canton and left a Yankees cap on the headstone.\u201cI spent a good deal of time there,\u201d he said, \u201cand I started to think about what happened. I knew about the suit. I thought it might give me some answers to questions I had for most of my life.\u201dAfter returning home, Blutstein began requesting information on the decades-old case, and his work in bringing other documents to light made it a routine task for him, but one that was time-consuming and expensive. He said he spent over $1,000 in fees and numerous hours filing forms and doing research. Of the 21 Munson files he requested, four were missing, including Anderson\u2019s. Those that were located, he said, had been stored in a warehouse in Chicago.Monahan testified that upon learning of Munson\u2019s death, he went to an empty Yankee Stadium and sat in front of Munson\u2019s locker for about five hours, almost in shock. Curiously, he testified that he tossed Munson\u2019s medical records into the trash.Monahan did not respond to a request for an interview, and neither did Diana Munson. Hall and Anderson declined to be interviewed.\u201cWhen Thurman got killed, you know, we just lost all \u2014 the whole season was just kind of lost,\u201d Nettles stated. \u201cWe just realized we couldn\u2019t do it and, you know, it demoralized a lot of us.\u201dOf everything he read, Blutstein said he was particularly moved by Hall\u2019s testimony recounting the crash and Munson\u2019s last words. As a boy, he said, he had often wondered how Hall and Anderson could have escaped the plane without saving his hero.But after reading the depositions, he said he contacted Anderson to apologize for harboring such feelings. He said he also reached out to Diana Munson to apologize for the fact that the uncovered depositions would inevitably resurrect painful memories. He did not hear back from her.That, in effect, has put Blutstein in the middle of the political battles gripping the country. In contrast, his fixation with the Munson case speaks to something else \u2014 to heroism and heartbreak, and to fate.And Blutstein said he would continue to spend money and invest time as he seeks the rest of the depositions in the Munson case. \u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u2019\u2019 he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Finally Picks a Science Adviser. And Scientists? They Seem Relieved.", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKelvin Droegemeier, a well-regarded meteorologist, has a long research record. But his views on climate change are not well known. President Trump will nominate Kelvin Droegemeier, a well-regarded meteorologist who studies severe storms, to be director of the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy.The director acts as the president\u2019s chief adviser on science. The post has been vacant since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, by far the longest the office has been without a director since the position was created in 1976.\u201cI am deeply honored to have been selected by President Trump to serve the nation as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and I look forward to the Senate confirmation process,\u201d Dr. Droegemeier, 59, said in a statement. Through a spokeswoman, he referred inquiries to the White House science office. Mr. Trump entered into negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear armaments without counsel from a senior nuclear physicist, for example. He withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement over the objections of most climate scientists. \u201cThe dismissal of scientific evidence in policy formulation has affected wide areas of the social, biological, environmental and physical sciences,\u201d said a statement signed by more than 1,000 members of the National Academy of Sciences in April.\u201cThe real question is, will he be listened to?\u201d said Phillip Larson, assistant dean of the engineering school at the University of Colorado Boulder, who served as adviser on space exploration during the Obama administration.Meteorologists praised Dr. Droegemeier for his distinguished research career. \u201cKelvin is an excellent choice \u2014 a highly qualified scientist,\u201d said William B. Gale, chief technology officer of the Global Weather Corporation and a former president of the American Meteorological Society.In the 1990s, Dr. Droegemeier recognized that new advances in radar technology and computers might make it possible to predict the development of thunderstorms. \u201cOther people were saying thunderstorms are too random and unpredictable,\u201d said Keith Brewster, a senior research scientist at the University of Oklahoma who first worked with Dr. Droegemeier as a graduate student. \u201cPeople were saying, you\u2019re crazy for even trying this.\u201dDr. Droegemeier went ahead anyway, devising new computer models that improved storm predictions. He became the director of the university\u2019s Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms. He went on to co-found the National Science Foundation\u2019s Science and Technology Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms, as well as the N.S.F.\u2019s Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere. Dr. Droegemeier is now vice president for research at the University of Oklahoma and the state\u2019s secretary of science and technology. Under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, he served on the National Science Board, which sets the priorities for the National Science Foundation and advises Congress and the president.\u201cHe has demonstrated many years of public service at the interface of science and policy,\u201d Rush Holt, president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said in a statement.If approved by the Senate, Dr. Droegemeier would advise the president on a daunting range of scientific challenges, from preparing for epidemics to responding to natural disasters. Mr. Larson said the long delay in nominating a director would make the job harder. \u201cHe\u2019s starting way behind unfortunately,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cHis science savvy would have been useful in the current and previous budget cycles.\u201dDr. Droegemeier will also have to contend with a boss who has called climate change a Chinese hoax.As a meteorologist studying short-term weather patterns, Dr. Droegemeier\u2019s thoughts on climate change are not widely known, and his name is not familiar to many researchers in the field. \u201cNo clue,\u201d said Gavin Schmidt, the director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution, said he only knew of Dr. Droegemeier from a few comments about climate change he had made to the media. \u201cHis statements make him sound extraordinarily sensible, compared to other Trump nominees,\u201d said Dr. Caldeira.J. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist at the University of Georgia, said that Dr. Droegemeier had a firm grasp of climate change and how it can supercharge extreme weather.\u201cJust having a voice in the room on climate that understands the equations, the scientific process and what is at stake is a huge win for science and the earth,\u201d he said.Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "What Must Survive a Corrupt Catholic Church ", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy making monasteries, of a sort, of our homes and hearts, we may develop the spiritual disciplines necessary to endure this seemingly endless trial. Mr. Dreher is the author of \u201cThe Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation.\u201dTwelve years ago, so was I. My once-fervent Catholic faith had been eviscerated by my covering the scandal as a journalist. Leaving Catholicism was the spiritual equivalent of a trapped animal gnawing off his own leg off to save its life. It was extraordinarily painful, but if I hadn\u2019t done it, depression would have consumed me and likely annihilated what was left of my Christian faith. In 2001, when I first began covering the Catholic sex abuse scandal, I interviewed the Rev. Tom Doyle, who destroyed his own clerical career by defending abuse victims. After the interview, the priest cautioned me that if I pursued this story further, it would take me \u201cto places darker than you can imagine.\u201d I left Catholicism for Eastern Orthodoxy, not because I expected to find a church free from sin, but because for various theological reasons, I thought it \u2014 not Protestantism \u2014 was the only way out. I needed valid sacraments, and I needed them in a church where I would not be overcome by fear and rage. In Orthodoxy, God gave me the graces of healing.It genuinely grieves me to see how much my Catholic brothers and sisters are suffering. I\u2019ve been there. I know that pain. And yet, for me, it was a severe mercy. When I converted to Catholicism in my 20s, I seized my faith like a sword to be wielded against the world and the church\u2019s enemies. Arrogant, proud, triumphalist \u2014 that was the kind of Catholic I was as a young man. That was not the church\u2019s fault: It was mine. And then it was all taken away from me. In my humiliation, I received the faith a second time, as a warm coat given to a shabby beggar on a cold winter\u2019s day. On the day I entered the Orthodox Church, my Ukrainian-born godfather said to me: \u201cNone of us have the right to look down on the Catholics. If our sins were exposed as theirs have been, we would be shamed too.\u201d Over the past 12 years, I have rebuilt a spiritual life based not on intellection, disputation and hero-worshiping the ecclesial institution, but on a simple way of prayer, fasting and repentance. You don\u2019t have to convert to Orthodoxy to live your Christian faith this way (though it helps). But Catholics and all Christians are going to have to be more deeply converted if they intend to hold on through present and future trials. Three years ago, the Rev. Cassian Folsom, a Benedictine monk in Norcia, Italy, the hometown of St. Benedict, warned me that the familiar world of go-along-to-get-along Christianity was going to die soon. Any Christian who wants to survive the coming darkness, he said, will have to live in a far more intentional and traditional way, in some sort of real community. Years earlier, Cardinal Francis George of Chicago famously observed that he expected one of his successors to die in prison \u2014 the idea being that the state will eventually persecute the church. Because of that, many Catholics have expected the gravest challenge to the church\u2019s survival to come from outside. The sex abuse scandal cannot be understood apart from a wider church crisis of corruption \u2014 sexual and otherwise \u2014 and loss of institutional authority. This general crisis was foretold by a surprising prophet. In 1969, a priest named Joseph Ratzinger made a startling prophecy on German radio. Four years after the end of the Second Vatican Council, he predicted that the Catholic Church was at the beginning of a great and wide-ranging catastrophe, one that would destroy its wealth, power and status. Father Ratzinger did not mention clerical sex abuse per se, but his remarks indicate a recognition that contrary to the official post-conciliar optimism, the church would not survive in its then-current state the cultural revolution shaking Western civilization. \u201cFrom the crisis of today, the church of tomorrow will emerge \u2014 a church that has lost much,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will become small and will have to start afresh more or less from the beginning.\u201dThe future Pope Benedict XVI went on, \u201cThe future of the church can and will issue from those whose roots are deep and who live from the pure fullness of their faith.\u201dThis is a challenge and a counsel of hope not just for the Catholic Church of our time, but for all churches, and all Christians. None of us can afford to be proud and complacent. Many of the old verities are tumbling down, like scales falling from our eyes. As painful as it may be, it is far better to see the painful truth than to avert our gaze from things that disturb our false peace.This crisis is systemic and will not be resolved by new policies and procedures, as the hapless episcopal bureaucrats want to think. Pope Francis is not going to swoop in to save the Catholic Church, and heaven knows that by now, the bishops cannot be relied on to reform and restore the church. If the church is to be rescued, it will have to happen in the everyday lives of the faithful, no longer deceived by illusions or false promises of faithless shepherds. Don\u2019t mistake me as an advocate of quiet stoicism. I think the Catholic laity should raise hell. Organize protests outside chanceries, withhold tithes to the bishop\u2019s appeal, make noise, demand change. It\u2019s your church, too \u2014 and your children\u2019s. Sending angry tweets about how all these bad priests and bishops deserve millstones is not enough. Still, as you act, never forget that a faith that endures is not forged on a protest line, or in institutional reformation. It is as it always has been: in the prayerful, sacrificial habits of daily life. I left the Catholic Church, but I still had to figure out a way to keep myself and my children Christian. By making monasteries, of a sort, of our homes and hearts, we may develop the spiritual disciplines necessary to endure this seemingly endless trial and to keep the light of faith burning brightly amid this new Dark Age.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Abortion Rights Will Die a Death by 1,000 Cuts", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court would mean the demise of not just abortion rights but also a century of progressive reforms. Ms. Mayeri teaches law and history at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s voluminous record, his opinion of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark abortion ruling, Roe v. Wade, and his views on legal precedent have deservedly been scrutinized in the lead-up to his confirmation hearings next week. But the Supreme Court\u2019s 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, more than Roe, holds the key to understanding the stakes of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s potential confirmation. It is Casey that now protects women\u2019s access to reproductive health care in states whose restrictions on health care providers and patients threaten to close clinics or ban abortions outright. And the political lesson conservatives learned from Casey all but guarantees that a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote not only to endanger abortion rights but to turn back the clock on a century of progressive reforms.On the eve of the presidential election of 1992, the court seemed poised to reconsider Roe in a case challenging several Pennsylvania abortion restrictions. Abortion-rights advocates thought Roe\u2019s demise certain. They worried most that the court might gut Roe without overruling it. A decision that openly reversed Roe might galvanize abortion-rights voters in November. But if women slowly lost the right to choose abortion, no electoral reckoning would follow. The court\u2019s decision in Casey surprised everyone: Justices Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David Souter co-authored an opinion that upheld the core holding of Roe but gave states more leeway to regulate abortion through \u201cinformed consent\u201d requirements, waiting periods and other barriers. Instead of the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d that doomed most restrictions under Roe, a more pliable \u201cundue burden\u201d standard would apply to abortion regulations. Activists on both sides condemned the ruling, but Casey included something for everyone. The decision placed abortion rights on firmer constitutional footing by grounding them in women\u2019s dignity and equality. Women, the court said, needed reproductive choice to determine their individual destinies and to participate fully in the economic and social life of the nation. At the same time, Casey upheld states\u2019 interest in protecting potential life, approving all but one of the challenged Pennsylvania regulations.For anti-abortion activists, Casey confirmed the paramount importance of judicial appointments. Casey\u2019s co-authors were all Republican appointees. Anti-abortion conservatives vowed that never again would they allow a Republican president to squander Supreme Court nominations on unreliable judges. Abortion opponents, like their adversaries, recognize the potential for electoral backlash if the court reverses Roe outright. Many would prefer abortion rights to die gradually and quietly. Merely by interpreting Casey to allow increasingly restrictive laws, the Supreme Court can stealthily smother choice without appearing to deliver a death blow.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this summer that she could not support a nominee who had \u201cdemonstrated hostility to Roe\u201d or to \u201cestablished precedent.\u201d Judge Kavanaugh reportedly told Ms. Collins recently that he considered Roe to be \u201csettled law.\u201d These statements should reassure no one. Casey, not Roe, is the established precedent that matters here. And it seems more likely that abortion rights will die a death by a thousand cuts through restrictive state laws allowed under Casey than by a reversal of Roe. Either way, a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to diminish reproductive freedom. It is also a vote to advance a larger agenda. Over several decades, the conservative legal movement has linked opposition to reproductive choice with constitutional theories that enhance the rights of corporations at the expense of human beings. Conservatives have tethered the anti-abortion cause to a selective libertarianism that opposes government regulation of business but authorizes expansive executive power and state intrusion on individual liberties. Judge Kavanaugh would not have passed Federalist Society muster if he did not demonstrate allegiance to these principles.With this confirmation vote, then, much more than abortion rights hangs in the balance. So does the country\u2019s ability to fight voter suppression, political corruption and racial intimidation; to protect clean air and water; to ensure safety for workers and consumers; to combat climate change; to enact sensible gun laws; to voluntarily integrate public schools; to provide necessary health care and preserve a basic social safety net; to protect civil rights and liberties; and to safeguard the integrity of all families. Americans who put aside their qualms and voted for the president to secure Supreme Court justices who would end legal abortion may pay a high price for their choice. With one more justice, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party will fully control all three branches of government, eliminating the last check on his power.It matters little, therefore, what Judge Kavanaugh says to senators about Roe or \u201csettled law.\u201d Conservatives have learned the lessons of Casey too well to permit the appointment of another justice in the Anthony Kennedy mold. And abortion rights are one of many inevitable casualties of this appointment. Senators who vote yes will bear responsibility for all of them.

Libel and slander are not.Mr. French is a First Amendment litigator and senior writer for National Review.Right now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it and undoubtedly there\u2019s a cover-up, there\u2019s actors, they\u2019re manipulating, they\u2019ve been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\u201dWould that it were that simple. Rather than applying objective standards that resonate with American law and American traditions of respect for free speech and the marketplace of ideas, the companies applied subjective standards that are subject to considerable abuse. Apple said it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Facebook accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d or using \u201cdehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d YouTube accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201chate speech and harassment.\u201d Exhibit A of how wrong the center has been: In June, it paid Maajid Nawaz $3.375 million for labeling him an \u201canti-Muslim extremist.\u201d This is rich, considered Mr. Nawaz is a former Islamist turned Muslim reformer.One doesn\u2019t even have to look to Big Tech to see the almost infinite malleability of the \u201chate speech\u201d label. In the name of stopping hate speech, university mobs have turned their ire not just against alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer, but also against the most mainstream of conservative voices, like Ben Shapiro and Heather Mac Donald.Dissenting progressives aren\u2019t spared, either. Just ask Evergreen State College\u2019s Bret Weinstein, who was hounded out of a job after refusing to participate in a \u201cday of absence\u201d protest in which white students and faculty members were supposed to leave campus for the day to give students and faculty members of color exclusive access to the college. The good news is that tech companies don\u2019t have to rely on vague, malleable and hotly contested definitions of hate speech to deal with conspiracy theorists like Mr. Jones. The far better option would be to prohibit libel or slander on their platforms. To be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike \u201chate speech,\u201d libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. It\u2019s properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims. It\u2019s a high bar. But it\u2019s a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever-shifting norms in language and culture and provides protection for aggrieved parties. Nor do tech companies have to wait for sometimes yearslong legal processes to work themselves out. They can use their greater degree of freedom to conduct their own investigations. Those investigations would rightly be based on concrete legal standards, not wholly subjective measures of offensiveness. Private corporations can ban whoever they like. But if companies like Facebook are eager to navigate speech controversies in good faith, they would do well to learn from the centuries of legal developments in American law. When creating a true marketplace of ideas, why not let the First Amendment be your guide? Advertisement"}

So far, no one has managed to draw a clear line between white food and black food in the South.

But his appearance before a judge was a remarkable reversal of fortune for the man who styled himself Mr. Trump\u2019s attack dog and fixer, a man quick with a threat of a libel suit or a promise to destroy journalists who vexed him or his boss. Mr. Cohen was forced to abase himself before a roomful of reporters, admitting to a wide range of serious wrongdoing, including tax evasion and bank fraud \u2014\u00a0while also directly implicating the president of the United States in federal campaign finance violations.In the most explosive admissions, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to committing two federal campaign finance violations on behalf of \u2014 and, according to Mr. Cohen, testifying under oath, \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of\u201d \u2014 President Trump. The charging document describes a scheme to pay off Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, and the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to buy their silence about their claims of affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen admitted to arranging for American Media, Inc. \u2014 publisher of The National Enquirer \u2014 to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 to keep her story quiet to protect the Trump campaign, thus causing a prohibited corporate campaign contribution. Mr. Cohen also admitted to arranging to pay Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence. Because the payment was intended to influence the election by protecting Mr. Trump, this constituted an illegal contribution far in excess of the personal contribution limits. Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t a necessary element to Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea, but he supplied it anyway. That implicates the president directly in what might be called \u201ccollusion\u201d: a conspiracy to commit a series of federal crimes, albeit not, in this case anyway, with Russians.But judges can, and often do, give credit for cooperation, and the government can always decide to recommend a lighter sentence later. And federal prosecutors clearly hope that Mr. Cohen will cooperate \u2014 his testimony that Mr. Trump directed his crimes was gratuitous unless prosecutors intended to lock him into that story for possible future use.Mr. Cohen could also provide information to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and testify before a congressional committee investigating the president\u2019s conduct. Mr. Davis suggested Tuesday night that Mr. Cohen has information about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian agents, and perhaps even about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreknowledge and approval of Russian hacking of Democratic servers. That\u2019s dynamite, and much closer to the Russian conspiracy that Mr. Trump has steadfastly denied.If Mr. Cohen has this great dirt, why hasn\u2019t Mr. Mueller already locked him in with a cooperation agreement? Mr. Mueller is a cautious man; Mr. Cohen, manifestly, is not. If the special counsel enlisted Mr. Cohen formally, that agreement would come with all of his credibility problems and tendency to act impetuously. Now Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea has thoroughly rattled the administration. Mr. Trump and his gaffe-prone lawyer Rudy Giuliani react badly to pressure and will most likely respond with incriminating statements. And Mr. Mueller will no doubt be watching. This is what federal prosecutors do best: provoke foolish reactions. Ken White is a former federal prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney at Brown White & Osborn LLP in Los Angeles.

{"Headline": "Honey, I Swept the Floor!", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveWhy do so many husbands feel the need to boast about completing simple household chores? With mine, it\u2019s all about branding.I stared at him. I had loaded the dishwasher that same day without feeling the need to tell anyone.Earlier he had washed the windows. Each time he walked back into the room, he pointed out the improved visibility: \u201cBoy, do those windows shine!\u201dI should have laughed at him, but I was too tired to think anything was funny, so I said, \u201cWho do you think filled the dishwasher, did two loads of laundry, car-pooled, cleaned the mustard spill in the refrigerator and billed a seven-hour day?\u201dMy husband didn\u2019t respond; he just started talking about the windows again.I have heard him tell clients: \u201cIf you fail to define your brand, your competition will.\u201d It took me a while to realize that he was applying the principles of branding to our marriage.Christopher and I both have jobs, sharing household duties and responsibilities for our two children. In our sane moments, we appreciate each other\u2019s contributions and our ability to forge a modern relationship. But when the chaos of our life gets to be too much, we turn on each other.It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the beginning of our relationship, living together in a tiny apartment on East 11th Street in Manhattan, Christopher and I rarely disagreed. We both loved the same spicy food and had grown up in the \u201970s as latchkey kids who watched \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d and ran feral while our feminist mothers changed the workplace.Together we supported each other\u2019s passions and compulsions, living in the moment with little regard for social norms or the future. Household tasks were divided up by aptitude or preference, not gender. Making the bed made Christopher feel organized and ready to start the day; I liked to vacuum. On weekends, we walked our dog around Chinatown in search of hot bean paste or wakame for the elaborate meals we cooked together. Always on the lookout for ways to crack each other up, we took pride in getting the other person to laugh so hard they spit coffee.Not until I was pregnant with our first child did we find ourselves on opposite sides of key issues. At first, we took turns on who got to make decisions: He followed my lead when I wanted to take a yearlong maternity leave, and I conceded to him on store-bought diapers.After our son was born, there was so much to do and so little time that everything turned into a negotiation: whose turn it was to sleep in, who got a night out with friends, whose dreams were more realistic and who got the full-time job with health insurance.We continued to divvy up tasks randomly as we always had, but the negotiations grew increasingly contentious. We had evolved enough to shed traditional roles and aspire to an egalitarian relationship, but that didn\u2019t solve the problem of nobody liking the drudgery of household chores, particularly the never-ending laundry and dishwashing. Without any division of labor or set roles, we each thought we were doing everything (because we were).While I just dug in without talking about it, Christopher would announce each completed task like a CNN correspondent dramatically reporting breaking household news: \u201cTrash has left the building!\u201dAfter our second child was born, his announcements grew more brazen. He would claim, for example, that he had \u201cdone the laundry\u201d after moving one load of wash to the dryer. But whenever I called him out on it, he wouldn\u2019t back down. The busier our lives became, the more his habit angered me and kept me on the defensive. But maybe that was the point.A pattern was starting. Christopher\u2019s announcements seemed to be a way of building a case for what he wanted to do \u2014 organizing the barn or launching the boat \u2014 rather than what had to be done, such as scheduling dentist appointments and ordering heating oil.His messages were strategic and part of a larger campaign. Christopher had spent his career developing identity management strategies for corporations, and he was now applying these skills to our relationship to build a more successful brand for himself.While he never actually came out and said, \u201cI do more than you,\u201d he didn\u2019t need to. By consistently claiming credit for everything he did, he was dominating the dialogue in our new domestic world order and positioning himself as the winner in the \u201cwho is doing more\u201d fight.By the time I figured this out, he had already captured a significant amount of brand mind share. Whose day was harder, whose parenting technique was better, who was responsible for cleaning the flotsam at the bottom of the garbage can \u2014 all of these conflicts could be branded or rebranded to his advantage. If I allowed Christopher\u2019s brand to take over our household, I would be in danger of becoming the AOL to his Google.Public relations is what I do for a living, so I was going to have to use my skills at home too. As soon as his car pulled into the driveway, I met Christopher at the back door and started firing off my own announcements: \u201cCleaned up vomit and poop today\u201d and \u201cWrote an article with a child climbing on my back.\u201dBut instead of conceding or validating my clearly more difficult day working from home with no child care, Christopher grabbed the broom and started sweeping Cheddar Bunnies off the kitchen floor in an overly theatrical way, as if he were trying out for the role of janitor in a community theater production. In one swift move, he shifted the conversation, drawing attention to what I hadn\u2019t done that day instead of what I had, making our messy kitchen the story and putting me on the defensive again.Social media has taught everyone to build personal platforms, so my problem wasn\u2019t unique. My friends \u2014 men and women \u2014 shared similar stories about how branding had invaded their marriages.One friend told me her husband had branded her \u201cthe expert\u201d (because she is a psychologist) to justify deferring to her with decisions involving their children\u2019s education or developmental needs. \u201cI finally realized he was just citing my Ph.D. to get out of the drudgery of dealing with school issues or having to read a parenting book,\u201d she said.Another friend said: \u201cAfter my husband cleans the garage or the pool, he makes each person in the family come for a separate \u2018viewing\u2019 so he can solicit praise and bask in his accomplishment.\u201dWith us, branding was even at the foundation of Christopher\u2019s parenting style. He introduced lofty public service campaigns about the importance of consistent bedtimes that lasted until it was my night to go out with friends. On those evenings, he\u2019d host movie dinners where nobody got to bed on time or brushed their teeth as he cultivated his \u201cDad is more fun\u201d sub-brand, distinguishing himself from my more practical brand of routines, eating your vegetables and \u201cHow do you know until you\u2019ve tried it?\u201d slogans.In the morning, when it was my shift again, I had to rouse our tired, cranky children and get them to school while hearing real-time testimonials from his new \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d: \u201cDad let us watch a movie you said we couldn\u2019t.\u201dThankfully the \u201cDad is more fun\u201d brand collapsed on its own after I went to visit a friend for a week and Christopher had to get the children to school every morning on his own.When we entered the most recent phase of our marriage, with both of us having full-time office jobs, I thought the \u201cWho does more?\u201d fight would end. But Christopher still manages to drive the conversation by complaining about how his longer commute that \u201ccrosses two state lines\u201d gets him home late, even though sitting on a Wi-Fi-equipped bus while sipping coffee and binge-watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d sounds a lot easier to me than handling all of the car-pooling, after-school activities and homework.Finally I confronted the issue head-on: \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. Stop branding in our house.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re busier than me?\u201d I said.\u201cI never said that.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe you should,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t you send a news release to The Portland Press Herald. The headline could read: \u2018How Does This Man Do It All?\u2019\u201d\u201cI really think it\u2019s more of a national news story,\u201d Christopher said with a smile.I laughed, but actually he\u2019s right. It is a national news story. From coast to coast, husbands are announcing, \u201cThe trash is out!\u201d and \u201cThe floor is swept!\u201d \u2014 constantly trying to seize the upper hand in the domestic chore branding war.Time to change the narrative.Brooke Williams is a writer and communications professional in Kittery, Me.Advertisement"}

Now some of those companies may be hitting a wall to adding new users.\u201cThere are limits to growth; the market cannot grow forever,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. \u201cThe faster they\u2019ve been growing in recent years, the sooner they were getting there.\u201dSnap, which began as a disappearing messaging app and has emphasized curation of content, has largely sidestepped some of the issues that Facebook and Twitter are facing. On Tuesday, the company disclosed the drop in users as it also posted a 44 percent jump in revenue to $262 million and a narrower net loss of $353 million for its second quarter from a year earlier.But Tim Stone, Snap\u2019s chief financial officer, cautioned that user numbers could continue to fall. He said Snap has historically experienced a dip in daily active users during the third quarter. He added that Snap\u2019s 100 million monthly active users in the United States and Canada \u2014 the first time the company has unveiled numbers for monthly active users \u2014 was \u201ca noteworthy achievement for a company that is less than seven years old.\u201dSnap has been dealing with a user backlash for months over a botched redesign of Snapchat. Late last year, the company changed the app to separate chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties, such as celebrities and publications.In a conference call on Tuesday, Snap\u2019s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, blamed the redesign for the drop in daily active users. He said with the changes, \u201cwe feel that we have now addressed the biggest frustrations we\u2019ve heard and are eager to make more progress on the tremendous opportunity we now have to show more of the right content to the right people.\u201dMr. Spiegel also said that retention of new users over the age of 35 \u2014 which is well outside Snap\u2019s core demographic of teenagers and younger users \u2014 had improved. He and Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, emphasized the relatively young age of Snapchat users and the amount of time they spend on the app \u2014 on average, 30 minutes a day \u2014 which may appeal to advertisers.Mr. Wieser said he agreed that the appeal to advertisers was more important than whether Snap continues to grab new users.\u201cThese are advertising businesses first and foremost,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are the product. Advertisers are the customer.\u201dStill, Wall Street had been anticipating that Snap\u2019s daily active users would reach 192 million in the second quarter, according to FactSet.Instead, Snap reported its users were at 188 million at the end of June. While that figure was up from a year ago, it was down 2 percent from 191 million at the end of March.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the percentage increase of Snap\u2019s revenue in the second quarter.

I\u2019m your grandfather-to-be. Please feel free to call me Poppa. We can\u2019t wait for your arrival in September. When your parents told us you were coming, I opened my mouth really wide and raised my eyebrows really high. I kept my face like that, speechless, for a full minute. Instantly I became drunk on the very idea of you.Now just between us, I\u2019ve never completely recovered from no longer having babies around. I still remember how it was with your uncle Michael, our firstborn, in those early years of his life. I kept him in my arms day and night. I could think of nothing else but him.I recognized that his dependence on my wife, Elvira, and me was absolute and nonnegotiable. We comforted him or he cried. We dressed him or he went naked. We cleaned him or he stayed dirty. We fed him or he starved. Caring for his needs took me out of myself. That, as anyone who knows me will tell you, was a change of pace long overdue.No one had ever needed me that much before. I had never even suspected I could feel so essential. It happened again when your mother, Caroline, was born. And I\u2019ve missed that feeling for more than 25 years. Now, for the first time in decades, I\u2019m looking forward to feeling that important again.But here\u2019s the hitch. I\u2019m going to miss out on a lot of your early life. Your mother and father live in southern Italy. You\u2019ll be growing up in Guardia Sanframondi, a hillside town about four times older than the United States. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll keep living in New York City, probably for another few years. I\u2019ll stay in a three-building apartment complex that has about as many people as your whole town. So we\u2019re going to be more than 4,000 miles apart, you and I. I\u2019m going to have to make do mainly as a long-distance Poppa. And I\u2019m really sorry about that.Of course I\u2019ll be in touch by Skype or Facebook Messenger and visiting you in Italy as regularly as I can. And I\u2019m going to model myself after my own Poppa, my maternal grandfather, Benjamin Sheft.My Poppa set the gold standard playing this role. He came from the city to visit our family in the suburbs every week. He played with my sister and me, chasing us around the house as we giggled. He made me, as his first grandchild, a top priority. He always asked about me, looked after me, cared about me. Poppa took me to see his office in a skyscraper right across the street from Grand Central Terminal. We went to Yankee Stadium together to watch Mickey Mantle hit home runs.Everything I will do from the moment you\u2019re born will be as a grandfather. It will be a new opportunity to do some good, especially since I\u2019ll be your only grandfather and will have to do double duty. Becoming a grandfather raises the stakes on everything else going on in my life. It gives me extra incentive to take care of my health, keep my head on straight and, yes, earn more money. So I\u2019m preparing to redefine myself accordingly and presumably be a better me.Toward that end, I\u2019ll be building on the tradition of unstinting attention and affection that my Poppa established. Once I get the green light from your parents on how you\u2019re to be raised, I\u2019m going to take you in hand all over town to show you off to anyone and everyone with a minute to spare. I\u2019ll read to you from the best books as soon as you\u2019re ready. And you can bet that we\u2019ll play any sport you\u2019re interested in trying \u2014 soccer, basketball, baseball, football, tennis, you name it.This much I can promise you, too. You\u2019ll be welcome to ask me about anything, anything at all, and I\u2019ll tell you whatever I know. I\u2019m going to hug and kiss you with all my heart and soul. I\u2019m also going to make you laugh. And that\u2019s because what I feel for you now is a love like none I\u2019ve ever felt before. Chances are, I\u2019ll never truly sober up. And then there\u2019s this. Within a few years I\u2019m planning to settle down in the same town as you, in a house right up the cobblestone street from yours.

{"Headline": "How Tech Billionaires Hack Their Taxes With a Philanthropic Loophole", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate in 2014, Nicholas Woodman, the founder and chief executive of GoPro, announced what appeared to be an extraordinary act of generosity.Mr. Woodman, then 39, had just taken his camera company public, and was suddenly worth about $3 billion. Now he was giving away much of that wealth \u2014 some $500 million worth of GoPro stock \u2014 to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, an organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that would house the assets of the newly formed Jill and Nicholas Woodman Foundation.The executive basked in prestige and gratitude. The Chronicle of Philanthropy named Mr. Woodman one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s most generous donors\u201d that year, placing him alongside established philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg.But four years on, there is almost no trace of the Woodman Foundation, or that $500 million. The foundation has no website and has not listed its areas of focus, and it is not known what \u2014 if any \u2014 significant grants it has made to nonprofits. An extensive search of public records turned up just one beneficiary: the Bonny Doon Art, Wine and Brew Festival, a benefit for an elementary school in California.Instead, the Woodman Foundation essentially exists as an account within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is not required to disclose details about how, if at all, individual donors spend their charitable dollars. Mr. Woodman, GoPro and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation all declined to discuss the Woodman Foundation.If the benefit to the needy is difficult to see, the benefit to Mr. Woodman is clear. After GoPro\u2019s initial public offering, he faced an enormous tax bill in 2014. But by donating via the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, he eased his tax burden in two ways. First, Mr. Woodman avoided paying capital gains taxes on that $500 million worth of stock, a figure that most likely would have been in the tens of millions of dollars. He was also able to claim a charitable deduction that most likely saved millions of dollars more, and probably reduced his personal tax bill for years to come.Mr. Woodman achieved this enticing combination of tax efficiency and secrecy by using a donor-advised fund \u2014 a sort of charitable checking account with serious tax benefits and little or no accountability.Donor-advised funds, or D.A.F.s, allow wealthy individuals like Mr. Woodman to give assets \u2014 usually cash and stock, but also real estate, art and cryptocurrencies \u2014 to a sponsoring organization like the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Fidelity Charitable or Vanguard Charitable. But while donors part ways with their money, they don\u2019t give up control. The sponsoring organizations make grants to hospitals, schools and the like only at a donor\u2019s request. So while donors enjoy immediate tax benefits, charities can wait for funds indefinitely, and maybe forever.For these reasons and more, D.A.F.s have become one of the most controversial issues in the charitable world.Proponents say D.A.F.s have democratized giving, because they are simple to create and the individuals who use them are more generous than those who establish family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d said Greg Avis, interim president of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \u201cThe donor has a tax benefit, and the beneficiaries are the nonprofits.\u201dBut to critics, D.A.F.s represent the worst of philanthropy today \u2014 a system of guaranteed perks for the rich and uncertainty for the rest.Unlike family foundations, which are required to distribute 5 percent of their assets each year and have historically been the way wealthy donors disbursed their philanthropic firepower, D.A.F.s have no distribution requirements, meaning that billions of dollars earmarked for charity can sit idle for decades. And because organizations that manage D.A.F.s are not required to report which funds give money to which causes, it is impossible to know how much money individual donors are giving away to nonprofit organizations.That D.A.F.s have become so popular with Silicon Valley billionaires has only added to their intrigue. Society is still reckoning with the dark sides of social media and online privacy, and there is concern that D.A.F.s \u2014 a dream vehicle for the overnight wealthy \u2014 may prove to be another instance of techno-optimists disrupting a system with unintended consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re a fraud on the American taxpayer,\u201d said Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey\u2019re a way for the affluent to have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dApproaching the Silicon Valley Community Foundation after a tech windfall has become a familiar pattern. In December 2012, just months after Facebook went public, Mr. Zuckerberg donated $500 million of Facebook shares to the group. In 2014, soon after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton donated a combined $846 million to the foundation. In both cases, the establishment of D.A.F.s allowed the men to reap a substantial tax advantage just when they needed it most.Some of this money is put to swift use. Mr. Zuckerberg has used his D.A.F. to give away tens of millions to schools and hospitals in the San Francisco area. Mr. Hastings has used his D.A.F. to give to the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley and the United Negro College Fund. In each case, the donors voluntarily publicized their gifts.Organizations that manage D.A.F.s say most of their account holders, anonymous though they may be, are similarly generous. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation distributed $1.3 billion during the last fiscal year to groups including the South San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Schwab Charitable, another big sponsor of D.A.F.s, said it distributed nearly $2 billion during the last fiscal year, making some 420,000 grants to nonprofits including Feeding America, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.Yet in the case of Mr. Woodman, there is reason to question how much money was made available for charity. He established his D.A.F. the day after GoPro stock approached its highest-ever price, about $95 per share. From a financial perspective, Mr. Woodman could not have timed his gift more perfectly.News of his donation sent GoPro shares tumbling as much as 14 percent the next day, as investors interpreted the move as a lack of confidence in the stock. By the end of the year, GoPro had lost more than a third of its value. By the end of 2015, the stock traded near $18 a share. Today, GoPro stock is worth less than $6 a share.\u201cSmart donors have been playing timing games with the charitable deduction for a long time,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a tax professor at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Columbus School of Law. \u201cIn this case, he potentially gets a very large deduction and gives nothing away. That\u2019s a disturbing public policy issue.\u201dOn Reddit, Mr. Woodman suggested that his wealth was reaching charities: \u201cThe Foundation has gone on to fund causes supporting women and children and will continue to do so!!!!\u201d Just how much money has gone to which organizations, of course, remains a mystery.When it comes to D.A.F.s, the United States tax code rewards the promise of good intentions. Wealthy donors \u2014 including many of the Silicon Valley billionaires who have asked the public to trust them with their digital lives \u2014 pledge to distribute their funds to charity once they get their tax break. But in the absence of rules requiring donors to give their money away, it is hard to know what public good comes in exchange for those lucrative write-offs.Skeptics see a system ripe for abuse. Donors might wait years to engage in meaningful philanthropic activity, or decide to simply leave the fund for their children to manage.\u201cWe\u2019ve put this rule in place that says you get maximum tax benefits when you make a donation,\u201d said Ray Madoff, a professor at the Boston College Law School and a vocal critic of donor-advised funds. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do anything with it.\u201dMs. Norley of Fidelity Charitable argues that on balance, account holders are generous. At her organization, roughly a quarter of the assets held in D.A.F.s have been distributed to nonprofits in each of the past two years. Other sponsor organizations report similar distribution rates.Yet such statistics can be skewed. In many instances, these figures include transfers from one D.A.F. to another. In the most recent fiscal year, for instance, Vanguard Charitable sent more than $15 million from its D.A.F.s to Fidelity Charitable. Sponsor organizations say this is simply a matter of wealthy donors adjusting their accounts. But it also creates the illusion of meaningful philanthropic activity where there is none.And while the overall payout rate at an organization that manages D.A.F.s may be substantial, the numbers could be warped by a few donors who give away huge sums, while a majority of donors give away virtually nothing at all.Critics argue that some sponsor organizations even have an incentive to keep funds undisbursed to charities. That is because D.A.F.s have emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for financial firms.For example, Fidelity Charitable, which is structured as an independent public charity, pays millions in annual fees to Fidelity Management, the big asset manager. Fidelity Management then invests the billions of dollars held in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s D.A.F.s, making money there as well. Vanguard, Schwab and Goldman Sachs all get millions in fees from their affiliated public charities. The more money held in D.A.F.s, the greater the potential earnings for the financial groups.The fact that D.A.F.s have become a profit center for Wall Street firms is a perversion of the philanthropic system, critics say.\u201cThe charitable deduction is not meant to give tax breaks to very wealthy people. It\u2019s meant to encourage giving to worthy nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, an attorney who worked for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, when Mr. Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got instead is a huge warehousing of funds with massive amount of fees being extracted by Wall Street.\u201dFidelity and Goldman brush off such criticism as misinformed, arguing that they are simply providing a valuable service to their clients by streamlining their charitable giving and offering them legal tax benefits. Some D.A.F. sponsors have rules in place that require accounts to disburse at least some money every few years.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Karey Dye, president of the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund, where Laurene Powell Jobs and the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer recently established D.A.F.s. \u201cPeople have irrevocably given money away to charity. Most often they are wanting to give money away to things that are meaningful to them and make a difference.\u201dAt the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the drive to accumulate assets appears to have been particularly intense. Former and current employees said the former chief executive, Emmett Carson, wanted to make the organization one of the largest sponsors of D.A.F.s in the country, and engaged in an arms race of sorts to woo big donors.In spite of his ouster, Mr. Carson appears to have succeeded in his goal. Thanks to big gifts from tech billionaires like Mr. Woodman and Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and the relatively new practice of accepting highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation is now one of the largest such groups in the country, with more than $13 billion in assets.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Washington has tried to take action. The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, was the first law to specifically address D.A.F.s. It established some basic rules that barred self-dealing, but stopped short of more fundamental changes, such as mandated distribution requirements or less generous tax breaks.\u201cWe were basically trying to undo a giveaway by the government,\u201d said Mr. Zerbe, who worked on that bill while he was at the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I\u2019m never convinced we can totally keep the weasels down the hole.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There also are a wide range of feelings about the transition process itself, and Ms. Dugan and Ms. Fabbre wanted to preserve that complexity.For Ms. Dugan, the most difficult recurring themes addressed how much people struggled or missed out on because they were unable to be their authentic selves until later in life. \u201cI was just struck by the extent to which pressure from society can be so damaging to people, and so limiting and cause so much pain,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a big deal to transition and in other ways it\u2019s such a small thing.

{"Headline": "Lobbyist Sam Patten Pleads Guilty to Steering Foreign Funds to Trump Inaugural", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An American lobbyist on Friday admitted brokering access to President Trump\u2019s inauguration for a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch in a scheme that highlighted the rush by foreign interests to influence the new administration.As part of a plea agreement under which he pledged to cooperate with federal prosecutors, the lobbyist, Sam Patten, pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent for a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party, and to helping the Ukrainian oligarch who had funded that party illegally purchase four tickets to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Although the charges were not brought by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Robert S. Mueller III, they stem from his team\u2019s work, and overlap substantially with its continuing investigation, suggesting that Mr. Patten could be a useful witness.The charges against Mr. Patten also represented the first public acknowledgment that prosecutors are looking into efforts by foreign interests to funnel money into Mr. Trump\u2019s political operation, including his inaugural committee.Prosecutors did not present any evidence that the inaugural committee was aware of the scheme. Questions to representatives of the inaugural committee on Friday about the illegal purchase of tickets went unanswered.During his campaign, Mr. Trump flouted traditional foreign policy by praising President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and suggesting that if elected he might be willing to ease sanctions levied against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine.That alarmed allies of Petro O. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, who is generally regarded as more pro-Western, and it emboldened his pro-Russian opponents, who had held power from 2010 to 2014 partly through the efforts of Mr. Manafort and his former right-hand man, Rick Gates.Forced into the opposition, the oligarchs formed a political party called Opposition Bloc, which worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in 2014, before largely shifting its political consulting and lobbying business to a company started by Mr. Patten and Konstantin V. Kilimnik. He is a Russian national who had worked closely with Mr. Manafort in Ukraine and is suspected by the United States of having ties to Russian intelligence.Prosecutors contend that Mr. Patten should have disclosed the work, which included lobbying and public relations assistance intended to \u201cinfluence United States policy,\u201d with the Justice Department pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Mr. Patten also attended an unspecified inaugural event with the oligarch, according to prosecutors. They contend that Mr. Patten arranged for the purchase of four tickets for $50,000 by funneling the oligarch\u2019s money through an American \u201cstraw\u201d purchaser in violation of rules barring the inaugural committee from accepting money from foreign nationals.Mr. Patten\u2019s lawyer declined to comment after a Friday court hearing in which Mr. Patten entered his guilty plea. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He was released after the hearing and awaits sentencing.Prosecutors did not identify the American who purchased the tickets, the oligarch or Mr. Patten\u2019s Russian business partner by name.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.And the description of the oligarch matches that of Serhiy Lyovochkin, who serves in the Ukrainian parliament and is an official in the Opposition Bloc, according to interviews and documents. Prosecutors say that Mr. Patten arranged meetings with congressional officials for the oligarch, and one former congressional aide recalled being introduced to Mr. Lyovochkin by Mr. Patten.Prosecutors also said that Mr. Patten helped the oligarch draft and place an op-ed in an American media outlet in February 2017 \u201cto address concerns regarding Ukraine\u2019s ability to work effectively with the new United States administration.\u201dA representative of U.S. News said editors had not been contacted by anyone in law enforcement about the op-ed.Mr. Lyovochkin surfaced prominently in the financial fraud trial last month of Mr. Manafort. Mr. Gates, Mr. Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman and Mr. Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man, testified that Mr. Lyovochkin was one of a clutch of oligarchs who paid Mr. Manafort more than $60 million to promote pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine.With Mr. Manafort\u2019s help, Mr. Yanukovych was elected president of Ukraine in 2010, a position he held for four years until he fled to Russia amid a popular uprising against his regime\u2019s corruption.Mr. Gates testified that Mr. Lyovochkin wired millions of dollars to Mr. Manafort\u2019s secret bank accounts from bank accounts in Cyprus held in the names of two shell companies to Mr. Manafort\u2019s secret bank accounts. Like the other Ukrainian oligarchs who financed Mr. Manafort\u2019s work, Mr. Lyovochkin was one of the top officials in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government.After Mr. Yanukovych was forced out of office, the oligarchs regrouped into an opposition force, continuing to pay Mr. Manafort for a time to help promote their views in the West.Mr. Patten traveled in the same lucrative foreign consulting circles as Mr. Manafort, but people who know them said their primary connection was through Mr. Kilimnik.Mr. Patten was born into elite Washington, as a grandson of the Georgetown socialite Susan Mary Alsop.He worked in Washington Republican politics, including for the State Department under President George W. Bush, and briefly for Senator Susan Collins of Maine.But Mr. Patten really made his name in international political consulting, coming to specialize in representing clients in former Soviet states. He worked with Mr. Kilimnik in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute in the early 2000s.In Ukraine, Mr. Patten and Mr. Kilimnik worked on the 2014 campaign of the former boxer Vitali Klitschko for mayor of Kiev, which was also supported by Mr. Lyovochkin.And Mr. Patten also worked extensively for interests in Kazakhstan.Mr. Patten also had a yearslong business relationship with Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Starting in 2014, the firm used Mr. Patten as a consultant for election campaigns and other projects in Africa, Europe and the United States, according to a person with direct knowledge of his activities.During the same year, Cambridge Analytica sought to drum up business in Russia, approaching the Russian oil giant Lukoil.In a Facebook post, Mr. Patten said he deeply regretted his failure to register as a foreign agent and was \u201cashamed\u201d that he had undermined much of his life\u2019s work, which he said had largely focused on promoting democracy abroad.Eileen Sullivan and Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Representation Is More Than Skin Color", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs it enough to look like the artist if you do not recognize yourself in the art?I remember the first time I fell in love with poetry. I was in 10th grade, and my world literature teacher, Ms. Joe, had assigned us the poem \u201cThose Winter Sundays\u201d by Robert Hayden. I read the poem and at once found myself engrossed in my own memory. I, too, recalled the coldness of my childhood home and the \u201caustere and lonely offices\u201d of my father\u2019s love. In his verses, Hayden made me feel seen. The poem provided a kind of relief, to know that my childhood was not a complete anomaly, and that others had grown up in similar spaces where love was convoluted by anger and loneliness. That day Robert Hayden became my favorite poet. I held on to this particular poem for years, memorizing it not only for the comfort it provided, but also as a reminder of what good art could do. Though admittedly it was a funny coincidence that we were both black, this hardly mattered at all. Hayden\u2019s work had always felt like an apt representation of myself, but for reasons far beyond our shared complexion.Over the past few years, the word \u201crepresentation\u201d has stormed popular discourse. It began in 2015 with April Reign\u2019s hashtag campaign #OscarsSoWhite, which indicted the Academy Awards for a lack of nominations for actors of color. Since then, creative figures across industries \u2014 film producers, gallery curators, print advertisers \u2014 have been called upon to ramp up inclusivity in their respective fields in hopes of advancing popular culture away from white, male dominance toward gender and racial equality.And who could argue with such a worthy goal? The need for representation of marginalized identities in art is evident, especially when considering a larger fight against racist patriarchal social and political institutions. However, when considering our current fixation on representation, I have to wonder if we have overlooked other meaningful ways of being represented, those that can be pinpointed only in life experiences and emotional phenomena beyond the visible self. When I think of all the \u201cblack art\u201d being ushered in by this new era, I feel conflicted. As a black person, I enjoy seeing artists whose careers are finally being given due praise and whose voices are at last being amplified. However, a question arises of what it means to be truly represented. Is it enough to look like the artist if you do not recognize yourself in the art?When the film \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was released in theaters, it was regarded as a historic moment for black representation in the comic book world. During the premiere weekend and for months after, my social media feeds were flooded with family members, colleagues and strangers affirming the importance of the film. \u201cI saw myself in this film,\u201d many of them claimed. When I finally saw the film, I did not recognize much of myself in it. Sure, I saw my old neighborhood in Oakland, Calif. I saw black people who looked like me, dressed like me and spoke like me. However, the film did not reflect my experience as a black American, my relationship to slavery or my interactions with other members of the African diaspora. I walked away feeling wholly unrepresented. However, while representation may be a praiseworthy standard for creative industries, it cannot be the benchmark against which we measure good art. Good art must do more than reflect our own images back at us. It must move us to a place beyond our obsession with identity, sense of tribalism and fear of others. When I imagine the happy medium between representation and good art, I am reminded of my favorite author, James Baldwin, who once put it this way:I think of these words and am at once transported back into my high school literature class. I read Hayden\u2019s verse, and at once I recognize myself \u2014 not in the poet but in the poem. Beyond my blackness, he sees me clearly for who I am. In this moment I am connected to him and all those ever engrossed in the \u201caustere and lonely offices of love.\u201d Bianca Vivion-Brooks is a writer based in Harlem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Too-Narrow Vision of Religious Freedom", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration embraces a laudable desire to expand religious tolerance, but its own intolerance toward some undermines the message. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Even President Trump\u2019s fiercest critics can find something to applaud in the administration\u2019s campaign to protect and advance religious freedom around the world. But the initiative\u2019s good intentions are in danger of being undermined by the administration\u2019s political agenda, which emphasizes the American strain of evangelical Christianity over other beliefs. In addition, the administration is pursuing immigration and foreign aid policies that belie its stated defense of religious rights. Yet, the event, headlined by Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, was clearly meant to appeal most to the evangelicals who are among the president\u2019s most fervent political supporters, reflecting a selectivity that is antithetical to the very concept of religious freedom. President Barack Obama made a point of reaching out to the Muslim world, as well as to other faith communities. And like previous presidents, he tended to consider religious rights within the broad spectrum of human and civil rights. Countries that deny religious freedom invariably restrict other freedoms as well.Supporting people facing religious persecution overseas is both a moral burden of the United States and an exercise in self-interest.

{"Headline": "They Thought Hemophilia Was a \u2018Lifelong Thing.\u2019 They May Be Wrong.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExperimental gene therapies have yielded promising results in early trials. But the drugs have left some patients worried that success will not last. Scientists are edging closer to defeating a longtime enemy of human health: hemophilia, the inability to form blood clots. After trying for decades to develop a gene therapy to treat this disease, researchers are starting to succeed. In recent experiments, brief intravenous infusions of powerful new treatments have rid patients \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 of a condition that has shadowed them all their lives.There have been setbacks \u2014 years of failed clinical trials and dashed hopes. Just last week, a biotech company reported that gene therapy mostly stopped working in two of 12 patients in one trial. But the general trajectory has been forward, and new treatments are expected by many experts to be approved in a few years.No one is saying yet that hemophilia will be cured. Currently the gene therapy \u2014 which uses a virus to deliver a new gene to cells \u2014 can only be used once. If it stops working, the patients lose the benefits. For now, \u201cwe are anticipating that this is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment,\u201d said Dr. Steven Pipe, director of the hemophilia and coagulation disorders program at the University of Michigan and a lead investigator of a clinical trial conducted by the biotech company BioMarin.The successful treatments are so recent it is hard to say how long they will last. But for the few patients who have been through the clinical trials successfully, life after treatment is so different that it\u2019s something of a shock.Those most severely affected must inject themselves every couple of days with the missing proteins, clotting factor VIII or factor IX. The shots keep hemophiliacs alive, but levels of clotting proteins drop between injections. Even with regular injections, people with hemophilia risk uncontrolled bleeding into a muscle or joint, or even the brain. They must be extremely careful. Once bleeding begins, a joint may bulge as the joint space fills with blood. When the bleeding stops, the joint may be damaged. Even a routine flight is risky, said Mark Skinner, a 57-year-old attorney in Washington with hemophilia who is a past president of the World Federation of Hemophilia.\u201cCarrying luggage around, you can twist the wrong way and immediately trigger a bleed,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you can get hit with a cart going down the aisle.\u201dPeople with hemophilia often are taught as children to avoid most sports and to find professions that will not require much physical activity. Many move to cities to gain easier access to treatment.They may change jobs to get insurance needed to cover medical bills for hospitalizations and surgeries that can reach $1 million a year, plus an average of $250,000 to $300,000 a year for the clotting proteins. (The shots alone can cost as much as $1 million per year.)Despite their vigilance, most with severe disease eventually develop permanent joint damage from bleeds, often leading to surgery for ankle fusion or hip or knee replacements at an early age. Most live with chronic pain from past bleeds. For older patients, there is an additional complication. The clotting proteins used in the 1980s were contaminated with H.I.V. and hepatitis C. Nearly everyone with hemophilia got infected. \u201cIt\u2019s a really optimistic time,\u201d said Dr. Lindsey A. George, a hematologist at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a principal investigator for Spark Therapeutics, one of several companies developing gene therapies for hemophilia.The goal of gene therapy is to reduce or eliminate patients\u2019 need for injections with clotting factor and to reduce the number of bleeds. The gene to be inserted depends on whether the patient has hemophilia A, caused by a mutation in the gene for factor VIII, or hemophilia B, caused by a mutation in the gene for clotting factor IX. Although the symptoms are the same with both forms of the disease, hemophilia A is by far the most common.Results from the two companies\u2019 preliminary trials were not perfect. Patients in Biomarin\u2019s hemophilia A trial got, on average, normal or above normal levels of factor VIII in their blood, but in the second year, those levels dropped to a median of 46 percent. It\u2019s not clear why.Patients in Spark\u2019s hemophilia B trial only reached on average 35 percent of normal blood levels of factor IX. But those levels have remained steady for the two years they have been followed. The good news is that those levels are sufficient for blood to clot, because normal levels are more than people need. After dreaming of a cure for decades, some treated patients are trying to adjust to newfound freedom.John Brissette, 39, a computer user interface designer in Hanover, Mass., said hemophilia A always dominated his life. He spent childhood yearning to be active like other kids. But bleeds into his joints put him on crutches for days at a time or forced him to keep his arm in a sling. He would be out of school for a week, then back, then out again with yet another bleed. He was embarrassed by nosebleeds that would not stop. As an adult, he had to have his damaged ankle bones fused. His elbow, after numerous bleeds over the years, gives him chronic pain. Foreseeing more pain and injuries in the years to come, Mr. Brissette began seeking out gene therapy clinical trials. Eventually, he enrolled in a Spark trial. (The company has an experimental hemophilia A drug, too.) He received a single infusion on April 19. His blood levels of factor VIII rose from zero to as high as 30 percent of normal and so far have stayed there.\u201cI have not had a single bruise. I have not had a single bleed,\u201d Mr. Brissette said. He has not given himself a shot of clotting factor since the procedure. But he is still struggling to let go of a lifetime of wariness. As he tries to do work around the house or run around with his children, he is unable to shake the dread that he will bleed.\u201cI\u2019ve become a very cautious person,\u201d Mr. Brissette said. At first, hemophilia seemed ideal for gene therapy. Normal blood levels of clotting proteins range widely, from 50 percent to 150 percent of average. A gene therapy for the disease would not have to provide much to be effective for patients.And researchers knew just which genes to insert into patients\u2019 liver cells. The genes for hemophilia A and B were isolated in the early 1980s. In those patients, clotting proteins have persisted at those levels ever since. Then scientists stumbled upon an unexpected bonanza. They found a man in Padua, Italy, who had a genetic mutation that made cells churn out as much as 12 times the usual amounts of factor IX.Investigators realized that they could put the mutated gene into a virus and use it to insert the mutated gene into the cells of patients with hemophilia B. The advantage was that they would not have to use so much virus \u2014 and the lower the dose, the less likely the immune system would attack.\u201cWe dropped the dose four-fold,\u201d said Dr. Kathy High, a hematologist who is president of Spark. \u201cOur first patient was a 23-year-old nurse. His level of factor IX rose to around 30 percent and has remained there for two years,\u201d she said. The nurse has not needed to inject factor IX and has had no bleeds, she added.But hemophilia A has been more daunting.The viruses used to carry modified genes into patient cells are called adeno-associated viruses. They cannot carry a large gene, and the gene for factor VIII, needed to treat hemophilia A, is enormous. After 15 years of effort, investigators finally discovered they could reduce the gene to a manageable size by slicing out portions that turned out not to be needed.No longer are scientists and patients dazzled by a treatment that raises blood clotting factor levels merely to 6 percent of average. \u201cMy thinking has evolved,\u201d said Mr. Skinner of the World Hemophilia Foundation. The results that companies are reporting now \u201creally seemed unimaginable\u201d just a few years ago, he added. Hemophilia would be \u201ca lifelong thing,\u201d said Jay Konduros. Then the brothers joined Spark\u2019s gene therapy trial for hemophilia B. The actual infusion of the experimental drug was anticlimactic, Jay Konduros recalled. He walked into a hospital in Philadelphia, sat in a chair and had an intravenous drip for half an hour. That was it.Now levels of factor IX in Jay Konduros\u2019s blood are around 50 percent. Bill, who also joined the trial, has levels closer to 75 percent. Neither has required any factor IX since their gene therapy.Both struggle to accept the fact that, for the moment, their lives are very different. \u201cWhen I hit myself or strain a muscle or twist, I immediately revert to thinking like a hemophiliac,\u201d Bill Konduros said. \u201cYou go on high alert. Is the ache spreading? Is it throbbing?\u201dOne day in May, Jay fell, landing on his forearms. Both wrists hit hard on concrete, and he struck the left side of his thigh, already damaged from previous bleeds.He took a few deep breaths and told himself, \u201cYou will be O.K., you will be O.K.\u201d He worried, anticipating disaster. That night he stretched. He examined himself. Nothing seemed damaged. He woke up in wee hours of the morning and nervously examined himself again. He was fine. He waited three days to call his brother and tell him: He was now a normal person who had a minor fall.\u201cYou hear a lot of things described as miracles or miraculous,\u201d Bill said. \u201cI guess I would say this truly is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Round in Australia\u2019s Political Churn", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe latest coup holds a warning for all Western democracies: A constant turnover of leaders doesn\u2019t appease voters. It only increases their disillusionment with democracy.Mr. Megalogenis is the author of \u201cAustralia\u2019s Second Chance.\u201dThere is a warning for all advanced democracies in Australia\u2019s political impatience: The churn in leaders doesn\u2019t appease voters. It only increases their disillusionment with democracy.The short story of Australia\u2019s descent to international ridicule begins with the refusal of the main parties to adapt to challenges of the 21st century. They have borrowed the worst of United States presidential politics, with its obsessive focus on the leader, and grafted it onto a Westminster system of parliamentary government that was designed for collaboration and compromise.The prime minister is not even mentioned in the Australian Constitution, yet the office has evolved into a paradoxical position of supreme authority and permanent vulnerability. The government becomes synonymous with the leader, and while the leader is riding high in the opinion polls, the job is safe, and the leader\u2019s agenda can be turned into legislation.But the prime minister serves at the whim of the party in control of Parliament, and both sides have acquired an impatience with leaders who fall behind in the polls. And so they keep sacking their leader, repeating the mistake of seeking salvation in the next messiah.There is no proof that changing an unpopular leader ultimately helps a political party. On the contrary, each party that swapped prime ministers between elections suffered heavy losses in the next election.Labor lost its majority after Mr. Rudd was toppled. And when he reclaimed the prime ministership from Ms. Gillard in 2013, he led Labor to a landslide defeat. The conservatives, similarly, had their majority reduced to a single seat after Tony Abbott was replaced by Malcolm Turnbull before the last election.The Labor experience should have discouraged the conservatives from indulging in back-to-back coups. But even this recent memory did not deter the government\u2019s right-wing members from initiating their assault on Mr. Turnbull this week.The turmoil on the conservative side is more ideological than the personality clash between Mr. Rudd and Ms. Gillard. Labor has, in fact, been relatively stable since its two fallen prime ministers left the Parliament. But there is no sign that the eventual departure of Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Abbott, who represent the moderate and right wings of the conservative Liberal Party, would bring an end to the conservative culture war. What will gall the Australian public is the inability of the system to correct for the leadership instability of the past decade. The deeper crisis is one of relevance. Parliament remains woefully removed from the people it serves, being less diverse and more masculine than the population at large. In previous eras of leadership chaos, most notably in the 1970s, the parties were still able to govern effectively, for example by securing historic reforms across the spectrum, from the removal of the White Australia Policy and the introduction of Indigenous land rights to the expansion of the social safety net and the first tentative steps toward economic deregulation. By the turn of the 21st century, Australia had added a world-class universal health care system and gun restrictions to its social and economic model.But Parliament has been a broken record of gridlock since 2009, when Labor and the conservatives failed to reach an agreement on climate change policy. The hard right of the Liberal Party and its coalition partner, the Nationals, have run a successful decade-long campaign of obstruction, refusing to even concede the need for action on climate change. It was Mr. Turnbull\u2019s proposal to honor Australia\u2019s commitment to reduce emissions under the Paris agreement that triggered this week\u2019s uprising. He surrendered to internal pressure and withdrew his plan, but they came for his job anyway.The upshot is that the conservatives, once the great pragmatists of Australian politics, no longer value bipartisanship. This winner-take-all approach is shared by Labor and has reinforced the policy paralysis. Both sides have taken office over the past decade with a backward-looking agenda, devoted to repealing the signature legislation of their predecessors.The real tragedy for Australia is that democracy may seem even less relevant to the people in the coming decade. George Megalogenis is an author and commentator. His latest book is \u201cThe Football Solution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The First Palestinian in Jerusalem\u2019s City Hall? ", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "OpinionRamadan Dabash doesn\u2019t care if you call him a collaborator. Supported byMr. Friedman, a journalist, is the author of the memoir \u201cPumpkinflowers: A Soldier\u2019s Story of a Forgotten War.\u201dJERUSALEM \u2014 Western observers interested in Jerusalem can be forgiven for thinking the most politically significant building in this city is a low limestone edifice featuring American flags and Marines \u2014 the embassy opened in May by the Trump administration to international fanfare and criticism. But anyone attentive to the fate of this place in the summer of 2018 would be advised to look past the embassy to an obscure structure a half-mile to the south.This building has no flags at all. Instead there are Arabic books on a wheeled shelf in the lobby, a few boys with soccer haircuts and girls with hijabs, and a modest sign welcoming you to the community center of Sur Baher.It\u2019s there, in the Palestinian neighborhood of Sur Baher \u2014 a four-minute drive from my Jewish Israeli neighborhood of Talpiot \u2014 that you can find Ramadan Dabash, the center\u2019s chairman, who\u2019s running a renegade campaign for a seat on Jerusalem\u2019s City Council. In a city where more than a third of the 860,000 residents are Palestinian, there should be nothing strange about Mr. Dabash\u2019s candidacy. But a victory in the Oct. 30 election would make him the first Palestinian representative at City Hall \u2014 and the personification of a political shift that isn\u2019t making headlines. Mr. Dabash, a civil engineer, was born in Sur Baher a few months before Israel captured it in a war with Jordan in 1967. Unlike the West Bank, which was placed under military occupation pending a peace deal with the Arab world, East Jerusalem was declared by Israel to be part of Israel proper.That meant people here, including the Dabash family, were given residency status and access to Israel\u2019s systems of universal health care and social welfare. They were allowed to apply for citizenship and vote in municipal elections. But nearly no one in East Jerusalem did either of those things, seeing them as an unacceptable \u201cnormalization\u201d of Israeli control. For the past 51 years, Mr. Dabash and the other Arab residents of Jerusalem have lived an ambivalent and disadvantaged political existence. In the last election in 2013, according to City Hall, not even 2 percent of them cast a ballot.This has helped keep Jerusalem\u2019s Palestinians in limbo and has contributed to a gap that\u2019s clear to anyone who spends time in the city\u2019s Arab neighborhoods, which are neglected, crowded and unsafe. Eighty-three percent of children in East Jerusalem are poor, according to Israeli government statistics, twice the rate in the city\u2019s west.That reality, Mr. Dabash says, is why he\u2019s flouting his community\u2019s political taboo to run. \u201cFifty-one years is enough,\u201d Mr. Dabash told me a few weeks ago in one of the classrooms at the community center he helped found four years ago. \u201cWe can\u2019t be left hanging between heaven and earth.\u201dThe Palestinian Authority, based in nearby Ramallah, sees participation in Jerusalem elections as a form of collaboration. Last month a council of Islamic clerics banned any involvement. Mr. Dabash says he has faced backlash in the form of hostile phone calls and messages on Facebook and WhatsApp groups, where he\u2019s tarred as a \u201ctraitor\u201d or a \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2014 epithets that carry a threat of violence. But he\u2019s determined to forge ahead, armed, perhaps, with the striking results of a poll released this year, that found 58 percent of Jerusalem Palestinians support voting. Just 14 percent said they were opposed. About 7,000 votes are needed to win a seat, depending on turnout. Because Jewish residents here are split acrimoniously between mainstream Israelis and the ultra-Orthodox, if Palestinians have even a few seats, they\u2019ll control crucial swing votes. But pundits who\u2019ve predicted Palestinian turnout in previous elections have been wrong. History and national sentiment mitigate against it, and there\u2019s a big difference between supporting the idea of voting and actually showing up on Election Day. Mr. Dabash is not a leftist. He quoted the Quran throughout our conversation and spoke warmly of his 12 children and four wives. (Polygamy is illegal in Israel but permitted by Islamic law, and authorities often turn a blind eye.) He didn\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019d be comfortable at a coexistence conference funded by European N.G.O.s, but rather like a guy you\u2019d want to run your union \u2014 a blunt operator who\u2019d give an opposing negotiator a hard time.To explain why he\u2019s running, Mr. Dabash pulled out his smartphone to show me photos of a nearby kindergarten overrun with mice and cockroaches. He pointed out the window toward Har Homa, a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, which has the kind of facilities that Palestinians can only dream of. In all of Arab Jerusalem (he slammed the table for emphasis) there isn\u2019t a single municipal pool. They need teachers, classrooms and jobs. The way Mr. Dabash sees it, the chances of a peace deal are nil. With Hezbollah, Hamas, the Islamic State and the Syrian war all within a three-hour drive from here, an Israeli pullout isn\u2019t happening anytime soon. To get things done, Mr. Dabash has been willing to play ball not just with Israelis but with the Israeli right, the only real political force in this conservative city. Last year, he even went so far as to briefly join the Likud party. The political cost of this approach is high: The closer he gets to Israelis, the more suspect he becomes in the eyes of his potential voters. He points to the community center, which is funded by Israel, as proof he can work the system and get results. \u201cIsrael says it\u2019s Jewish and democratic,\u201d he said. \u201cI say, O.K., show us your democracy.\u201dOver the past five years or so, watching from west Jerusalem, it\u2019s been clear that remarkable changes are afoot in the city\u2019s human landscape. Not long ago, it was unheard-of to see Palestinian salespeople in Israeli stores. Now it\u2019s commonplace. Palestinian enrollment at Hebrew University is up dramatically, as are requests for Israeli citizenship. The number of East Jerusalem wage earners employed in West Jerusalem is now estimated at close to 50 percent. The trend is driven not by good will but by economic interests: by demand for labor in Jewish Jerusalem, and by a lack of better options for Palestinians. The city remains unequal, there are periodic acts of terrorism, and there\u2019s no reason to be sanguine about the future. But at the same time, worlds that have long been distinct are moving closer together. All this helps explain why dark predictions of violence at tense moments, like the embassy opening, have failed to materialize. It was against this backdrop that the community center opened in Sur Baher, a place where many residents have traditionally had ties to Hamas. The center\u2019s birth was telling. Shortly after the opening ceremony, attended by Mayor Nir Barkat, residents opposed to normalization set it on fire. Others then repaired the damage. These days it draws a few hundred people every week. The community center also marks a trend on the Israeli side, namely a willingness to invest in Arab residents. In May, the government allocated $560 million to projects in East Jerusalem. If all that money gets where it\u2019s meant to go, it will be the largest single investment in Palestinian Jerusalemites since Israel took control a half-century ago.Following all of this makes you more aware of the peculiarities and paradoxes on which the city rests. One, for example, is that the movement on the Israeli side is coming not from the conciliatory left but from the nationalist right. The left traditionally hoped that one day East Jerusalem would be transferred to Palestinian rule and wouldn\u2019t be Israel\u2019s problem \u2014 hardly an incentive to invest.

{"Headline": "The Memphis Police Spied on Activists", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy father spied on activists for the Memphis Police Department in the 1960s. A new lawsuit suggests not much has changed.Ms. McCollough Seletzky is writing a book about her father, who was a spy for the Memphis police department during the late 1960s. I\u2019ve often wondered about the 10 file cabinets of domestic surveillance records that officials in the Memphis Police Department doused with fuel and burned in 1976, the year I was born. What portion was related to my father, Marrell McCollough? He spied for the department from 1968 to 1972, spending part of that time as a mole in a local Black Nationalist group called the Invaders. The police were worried the group would interfere with garbage collection by strikebreakers during the 1968 sanitation strike. He was performing that role \u2014 dropping off two college students and an aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Lorraine Motel\u2019s parking lot \u2014 when he found himself at the scene of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination. Dad is the man kneeling over Dr. King in the iconic photograph taken in the shooting\u2019s aftermath.When those files were destroyed, my family thought a painful episode in our history had come to an end. We were wrong. Yet it appears that the Memphis police department has been doing just that. In a 35-page order on Aug. 10, Judge Jon McCalla concluded that the city violated the consent decree by engaging in political intelligence, though questions of fact remain as to the extent of and purposes behind the city\u2019s actions. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed in February 2017 by four people named on the police department\u2019s list of dozens of people restricted from entering City Hall without a police escort. In addition to naming participants in Black Lives Matter and other protest movements, the list included demonstrators who had participated in a \u201cdie-in\u201d on the front lawn of the mayor\u2019s home in December 2016, as well as people associated with those protesters. How did the department identify the protesters\u2019 associates? As it turned out, it would have been almost impossible for the activists to shield their social contacts from law enforcement. Police had wrapped Memphis in a dense web of surveillance: software to comb social media for information about protests and activists, still more software to map relationships between people and events, and more than a thousand cameras \u2014 perched on tall poles, mounted on trucks, affixed to buildings \u2014 capturing footage that could be monitored around the clock. High-tech surveillance tools like these are commonplace among police departments in large cities. Many departments guard this information closely, claiming that its disclosure would help criminals and jeopardize investigations. But large numbers of innocent people are also subject to law enforcement\u2019s digital trawling. For example, in 2016 Georgetown Law Center found that the faces of about half of all American adults appear in searchable police databases that use facial recognition technology, making great masses of people trackable without their knowledge or consent.The Memphis police didn\u2019t rely solely on cutting-edge technology to monitor protesters, though. They also appear to have used a fake Facebook profile named Bob Smith to cozy up to activists and access private posts. They sent uniformed and plainclothes officers to observe protests, noting the participants and taking photographs. They tracked private events, including a \u201cBlack Owned Food Truck Sunday\u201d gathering.As I read the court\u2019s ruling, paged through the pleadings and exhibits, and scanned the news coverage, I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of disbelief that the city was retreading the same old ground, surveilling activists. \u201c2016: A Year of Social Unrest Reminiscent of the late 1960s and early 1970s,\u201d reads a slide in an internal police department presentation on its investigation of protesters. But it isn\u2019t just the unrest that hearkens to those times \u2014 it\u2019s also law enforcement\u2019s reaction.I thought about all the times Dad and I went back and forth about the ethics of his undercover work befriending activists and posing as a member of their group. How I wrestled with his explanations and my own reactions, trying to remain nonjudgmental, always questioning whether or not I was making excuses for him.Memphis\u2019 historic sanitation strike had just begun when Dad began working for the unit in February 1968. He was just a couple of months out of the police academy and one of the department\u2019s few black officers. The higher-ups who assigned him to infiltrate the Invaders told him the group might pose a danger to the public, might be planning crimes. Memphis had never seen a collection of people like them before, with their militant rhetoric and Black Power swagger.But for the most part, the Invaders weren\u2019t dangerous, as Dad told the unit in the oral reports he called in on most evenings. He says he never violated anyone\u2019s civil liberties. And I believe he stayed on the right side of the line, as he knew it. I still struggle with it, though, even as I try to imagine myself in his predicament as a black rookie officer during that turbulent era.Although the department coordinated its intelligence-gathering efforts with the F.B.I., he says he didn\u2019t know anything about Cointelpro, the F.B.I.\u2019s secret operation to monitor and disrupt political organizations. (The program, which involved police departments around the country, later became infamous for hounding Dr. King.) \u201cI was never tasked to do any of the stuff that we know happened,\u201d he said.But he wasn\u2019t privy to everything that was going on. He didn\u2019t prepare his own written reports \u2014 he called them in on the phone. Any documentation would have depended on how the person he spoke with remembered what he said. And while the department\u2019s records of what happened are mostly gone now, the smoke\u2019s stench still lingers, polluting the air.Leta McCollough Seletzky is a former litigator who is writing a book about her father.Advertisement"}

And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

But in recent years world-changing has been co-opted by the rich and the powerful.At first, you think: Rich people making a difference \u2014 so generous! Until you consider that America might not be in the fix it\u2019s in had we not fallen for the kind of change these winners have been selling: fake change.This is how the winners benefit from their own kindness: It lets them redefine change, and defang it.Mr. Tovar wasn\u2019t denying the $150 billion in wealth, or that more of it could have been paid as wages. Rather, he seemed to suggest that charity made up for these facts.The rub against such an idea isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s also that it dilutes our idea of change. It casts an app and a safety net as the same.Fake change, and what it allows to fester, paved the road for President Trump. He tapped into a feeling that the American system was rigged and that establishment elites were in it for themselves. Then, darkly, he deflected that anger onto the most vulnerable Americans. And having benefited from the hollowness of fake change, he became it \u2014 a rich man who styles himself as the ablest protector of the underdogs, who pretends that his interests have nothing to do with the changes he seeks.President Trump is what we get when we trust the rich to fix what they are complicit in breaking.In 2016, Mr. Trump and many of the world-changing elite leaders I am writing about were, for the most part, on opposite sides. Yet those elites and the president have one thing in common: a belief that the world should be changed by them, for the rest of us, not by us. They doubt the American creed of self-government.A successful society is a progress machine, turning innovations and fortuitous developments into shared advancement. America\u2019s machine is broken. Innovations fly at us, but progress eludes us. A thousand world-changing initiatives won\u2019t change that. Instead, we must reform the basic systems that allow people to live decently \u2014 the systems that decide what kind of school children attend, whether politicians listen to donors or citizens, whether or not people can tend to their ailments, whether they are paid enough, and with sufficient reliability, to make plans and raise kids.There are a significant number of winners who recognize their role in propping up a bad system.

{"Headline": "What Guant\u00e1namo Says About Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs an appeals court judge, he signed on to decisions that deprived detainees of the chance to contest their detentions.Contributing Opinion Writer For a long time, I made it a point to write about Guant\u00e1namo at least once a year. There was usually some new development to hang a column on. But the real reason was that, having chronicled the riveting legal saga sparked by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s decision to create a legal black hole at the U.S. Navy base there in which to imprison hundreds of men captured in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the aftermath of 9/11, I felt an obligation to show that I was still watching, even if most people no longer were.But gradually, as President Barack Obama left office with his promise to close Guant\u00e1namo unfulfilled, and as President Trump blustered about opening the island prison to new arrivals, and as the military commission that is supposed to try the accused 9/11 perpetrators has yet to set a trial date after six years, there has seemed nothing to say. (Since his inauguration, President Trump has permitted the release of one Guant\u00e1namo detainee, leaving an inmate count of 40, down from 780 at its peak.)True, back in June, when Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, there were a few comments about his important role in the Supreme Court majority that pushed back against both the White House and Congress in a series of Guant\u00e1namo decisions more than a decade ago. But those few references were quickly buried in the avalanche of speculation on what Justice Kennedy\u2019s departure will mean for the future of gay rights and the right to abortion.I\u2019m writing about Guant\u00e1namo now because of a little noticed order that came down earlier this month from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That\u2019s the court on which President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has sat for the past 12 years. The order, and the appeal that produced it, provide a bridge between past and present, between Justice Kennedy and his former law clerk who would replace him, between a battle over the rule of law now fading into history and a battle over the future of the Supreme Court that will play out when Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing begins next week. The author of the majority opinion in Boumediene was Justice Kennedy. The vote was 5 to 4, and the split was even more bitter than the vote count suggests. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a dissenting opinion that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. also joined, warned of \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d from the decision and predicted that \u201cit will almost certainly cause Americans to die.\u201dJustice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion was powerful, a paean to the rule of law that echoed well beyond a particular military prison on a particular island. \u201cWithin the Constitution\u2019s separation-of-powers structure,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfew exercises of judicial power are as legitimate or as necessary as the responsibility to hear challenges to the authority of the Executive to imprison a person.\u201d That was especially so when detention was by executive authority rather than following a trial and conviction for a crime, he said. \u201cIn this context the need for habeas corpus is more urgent,\u201d he added. \u201cThe habeas court must have sufficient authority to conduct a meaningful review of both the cause for detention and the Executive\u2019s power to detain.\u201dDid these words by his old boss ring in Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s ears as he signed on to opinions that left the promise of the Boumediene decision an empty one? And if not, why not? I don\u2019t know. But I do know that Guant\u00e1namo has always been a mirror that reflects back on ourselves. And the reflection in this instance gives us another hint of what the substitution of Brett Kavanaugh for Anthony Kennedy may mean for the future of the court and the country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back From the Dead, Parma Embraces a Soccer Renaissance", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerPARMA, Italy \u2014 Eight trophies are lined up along the back wall of the museum at Parma\u2019s Stadio Ennio Tardini. Each one is polished to perfection, placed on a plinth and bathed in a soft spotlight, picking out the glint of silver and the gleam of gold. The effect is one of deep reverence, an almost holy glow.They are the museum\u2019s focal point, its culmination and conclusion. All of the other displays \u2014 montages of past glories, portraits of beloved faces, iconic jerseys preserved in glass cabinets \u2014 build up to them. It is to those trophies that all of Parma\u2019s history leads.For a while, though, those plinths stood empty, and the spotlights were switched off. In Parma\u2019s darkest moments, when the club sank into oblivion, it was auctioned off. The trophies that had been proof of how high this club had flown \u2014 becoming one of Italy\u2019s grandest houses, a force in both Serie A and in Europe \u2014 came to symbolize how far it had fallen.Now, everything is where it should be. The trophies are back in pride of place, on their plinths, under their lights. And Parma \u2014 or, at least, its spiritual successor \u2014 is preparing, once again, for life in Serie A. \u201cWhen you look at all of this,\u201d said Angelo Manfredini, the president of Parma Clubs, an umbrella organization for the team\u2019s fan groups, as he walked around the museum, \u201cthat is where this club belongs.\u201dIt was a stunning fall, even by the standards of Italy \u2014 where every year a handful of clubs flirt with, and often fall into, liquidation.In the 1990s, Parma was redolent of wealth and glamour, an unremarkable provincial team transformed into one of the world\u2019s great clubs by the largess of Calisto Tanzi and the Parmalat dairy empire. It was one of Italy\u2019s sette sorrelle, the Seven Sisters who dominated Serie A when it was the best league in the world. Twice, Parma won the UEFA Cup, the forerunner of the Europa League.Tanzi\u2019s money brought some of the world\u2019s finest players to the Ennio Tardini: Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, Lilian Thuram, Fabio Cannavaro. In Parma, they call that period the anni di oro: the golden years.In June of that year, the last of the oxygen ran out. The club\u2019s assets \u2014 the training facility, the bench from the manager\u2019s dugout and, most painful of all, those trophies \u2014 were put up for sale.A new team, Parma Calcio 1913, backed by several local industrialists, was formed that summer, but everything had been lost. \u201cI never worried that soccer in Parma would die,\u201d Manfredini said. \u201cI never thought there would be no more games at the stadium ever again, because there were people in the city who would make sure there were.\u201dWhen he traveled to Arzignano, a small town near Vicenza, to watch the first game of the new club\u2019s debut season \u2014 \u201cWe were meant to be in Europe that year,\u201d he said, \u201cand instead we were there, playing on this pitch that was not much more than a field\u201d \u2014 he could not have imagined that, only three years later, Parma would be back in Serie A, preparing to face the likes of Juventus, A.C. Milan and Napoli again.He was not the only one. \u201cI saw people in tears in Arzignano, because of everything that had happened,\u201d he said. Even inside the club, such an outcome must have seemed impossible. Luigi Apolloni, a former player, was the new team\u2019s first manager. On his first day at work, the phones were still dead.In May this year, there were tears again. For the first time in Italian history, a team had traveled all the way from Serie D to Serie A in consecutive seasons: three years, three promotions. \u201cThe parties lasted until 6 a.m.,\u201d said Raffaella Palmieri, standing behind the bar of the Red Caf\u00e9, a regular haunt for Boys 1977, the club\u2019s ultra group.The achievement is celebrated in Parma\u2019s marketing slogan for this year\u2019s season tickets: Come noi nessuno mai, the club proclaims \u2014 there has never been anyone like us. The A in mai is capitalized, to celebrate Parma\u2019s place in Serie A.Expectations, of course, are not what they used to be. Though the club is now under majority Chinese ownership \u2014 Jiang Lizhang and his Desports group, investors in the Minnesota Timberwolves, took a 60 percent stake last year \u2014 nobody is demanding a return to the days when Parma could field a team of superstars.\u201cAll that matters this year is staying in Serie A,\u201d Manfredini said. Jiang has said the aim is solely to \u201cstabilize\u201d in the top flight.That has not dampened the enthusiasm. Parma is a genteel, tranquil sort of a place \u2014 it regularly ranks in the top 10 in Italy\u2019s standard-of-living index \u2014 and, in the blistering August heat, at the height of vacation season, it is especially somnolent. Anybody who can afford it has escaped the city and headed to the beach.But still, inside Parma Clubs\u2019 office, just outside the gates to the stadium, a steady line of fans waits to pick up the ID card that is now required to attend games. Some 11,500 season tickets have been sold already; demand is so high that Parma has extended sales for an extra two weeks.When Parma launched a special edition alternate jersey this summer, it sold out in two days. Orders came in from as far afield as the United States and Brazil.In the run-up to its first game of the season, a likely sellout against Udinese on Sunday, the local television channel was running a series of three documentaries on the rinascimento, the club\u2019s rebirth.There is a sense of order being restored, that everything is in its rightful place once more, that things are \u2014 at last \u2014 how they used to be. But, to many, what is more significant, and what lies at the root of the excitement, is what has changed.\u201cThe city feels more connected to the club than it used to be,\u201d said Chiara Montanini, the manager of Bar Gianni, a cafe around the corner from the Ennio Tardini. It is a sentiment that Manfredini echoes.\u201cWhen we need to, people in Parma know how to work like a team,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of fans who had left because of the problems came back to the club after the disaster of 2015. What we went through made that attachment stronger.\u201dThat is not to say the memories of the golden years have been tarnished, though, or even faded: The walls of Bar Gianni are decorated with murals of Crespo and Alessandro Melli, two stars of the anni di oro. Original, match-worn jerseys from that period hang above the bar in the Red Caf\u00e9.In June, about 8,000 fans packed into the stadium for Operazione Nostalgia, a game between a team of former Parma players \u2014 including Crespo and Ver\u00f3n \u2014 and a select side of 1990s stars from other Italian clubs.The fans had been told to attend wearing any jersey they liked, as long as it came from that era: Lazio, Roma, Milan and Fiorentina were all represented, as well as Parma. \u201cThe Tardini is a symbol of \u201990s football,\u201d Andrea Bini, Operazione Nostalgia\u2019s organizer, wrote on Facebook.For the first time in a long time, though, it feels as though that is not all it is. Down in the museum, the trophies are back in their rightful place. When they were auctioned off, several local industrialists bought them, Manfredini explained, and then gifted them back to the new club, a symbol of old glories.They are no longer, though, the end of history. Parma, at last, has other things to celebrate. The club, like the spoils of its past, is back where it belongs.Advertisement"}

We can\u2019t buy the scene where the president goes to a rally right after all these stories break and he\u2019s got the crowd yelling, \u201cDrain the swamp!\u201d This is the same time you\u2019ve got his first two congressional supporters hit by corruption indictments. I know it\u2019s supposed to be irony, but it\u2019s teetering on insanity. However, we don\u2019t want you to drop the congressmen completely. We liked the detail about one orchestrating an insider trade at the White House picnic. And having the other use campaign funds to get a plane ticket for his pet rabbit was a nice touch. Would you think about making it a fuzzy puppy? Then when everybody gets off the plane the puppy could try to lick the president and our hero/villain would recoil. Nothing audiences like better than hating a man who hates dogs.The castFor the lead, we\u2019re wondering if we could talk Liam Neeson into gaining 50 or 60 quick pounds for the part. And maybe a younger Ray Liotta type for the sleazy fixer. We\u2019re not buying your current version of the president\u2019s other lawyer. He\u2019s supposed to be a big hero from 9/11 and yet every one of his lines screams \u201cincompetent great-uncle who gets drunk at Thanksgiving.\u201d You\u2019ve at minimum got to give him a different background, like fixing parking tickets. If we can work that out, we\u2019re thinking maybe this is a job for Danny DeVito.The cheery Republican House leaders who ignore everything that\u2019s going on don\u2019t have a big part, but we think it\u2019d be a terrific acting opportunity for the Backstreet Boys.As to the women \u2014 we like the stripper. (Reese Witherspoon? Jennifer Aniston?) When she gets paid off to keep quiet about having sex with the about-to-be president, can you give her some special phrase we could feature in the promos? Like \u201cKazowie, Mr. Candidate!\u201d Or \u201cReal leaders use condoms.\u201dWe\u2019re a little concerned you\u2019ve made all the lead characters so repulsive that people aren\u2019t going to want to go see the film. Mandy has a good suggestion \u2014 take a second look at the wife. Right now she\u2019s way too wooden, and nobody will believe that pair has had sex since Dick Cheney was in power. How about making her a former federal prosecutor who gave up the chance to be attorney general to stand by her man? Is he grateful \u2014 or ticked off that she didn\u2019t take the job and shield him from investigators? Not a plot twist we\u2019ve ever seen before.Foreign affairsWe\u2019re looking for serious international sales, so definitely let\u2019s take this guy to a big meeting with leaders overseas. Maybe a little bit of action when he runs over the head of the European Union in his golf cart.However, nobody here likes the whole Russian subplot. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. You\u2019ve got a lead character who\u2019s in trouble for that girlfriend payoff plot, and for having a whole pile of crooks in his administration. (How many characters, by the way, can get indicted before the credibility fizzles?) And then you have this other whole huge subplot about colluding with the Russians to fix the election. Sorry, any president who had all these messes at once would be out the door in five minutes.Another problem with the first lady: You gave her an immigrant background and a heavy accent. So far, so good. (This is the point where we start fantasizing Meryl Streep.) But you\u2019ve also got your lead railing all the time about stopping immigration. Does that make sense? Just don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to get anybody to buy that package.FinallyThis is an important note from Larry: At the peak of the action, our main man is six feet deep in investigations and he goes out to give a speech to his supporters. In which he keeps reminding them that he won the Electoral College. Now our audience is going to hear that and realize this is a president who didn\u2019t win the popular vote. Larry thinks you should drop that detail and let him win the popular vote. Otherwise, he\u2019s so compromised from the get-go that people will start walking out with the opening credits.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Did Pope Francis Know?", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Catholic Church needs leaders who can purge corruption even among their own theological allies. The pope is failing that test. Opinion ColumnistDuring the Catholic Church\u2019s synod on the family in Rome in 2015, a rough-and-tumble affair in which Pope Francis pushed the assembled bishops to liberalize Catholic teaching on remarriage and divorce, one of the attendees, by the pope\u2019s own invitation, was the retired Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels. Danneels was a natural pick in one sense: One of the church\u2019s prominent liberals, he had been part of a circle that supported Jorge Bergoglio in the run-up to his election as Francis, and in a synodal fight with conservative bishops, the pope needed all the allies he could get.Vigan\u00f2\u2019s document, extraordinary in both content and tone, claims that after years of failed American attempts to get Rome to take action, Francis\u2019 predecessor, Benedict XVI, placed the already retired McCarrick under some form of sanctions \u2014 moving him out of his residence, restricting contact with seminarians, limiting public appearances. It further claims that despite being told that McCarrick was a sexual predator, Francis removed those sanctions, raised McCarrick\u2019s profile and relied on him for advice about major appointments. Oh, and it calls on Francis to resign.As yet none of the Vatican figures named in the document have stepped forward to either confirm or deny the meat of Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account. Francis himself offered only a deflecting comment on his flight back from post-Catholic Ireland. However, Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., already embattled over sex abuse cover-ups in his own past, has issued a statement denying that Vigan\u00f2 ever communicated directly with him about restrictions on his predecessor.Meanwhile the pope\u2019s defenders have pointed to Vigan\u00f2\u2019s own anti-Francis conservatism (manifest in some of his sweeping claims) as reasons to disbelieve his charges, while noting that McCarrick appeared at many events, including with Benedict himself, in the period when he was supposedly under sanctions.In which case it\u2019s also easy to imagine a scenario in which Francis didn\u2019t technically \u201clift\u201d those sanctions so much as acted in ignorance of them, or of their seriousness. He might have been given some knowledge, by Vigan\u00f2 and others, of the allegations against McCarrick but either assumed they couldn\u2019t be that bad (at this point the cardinal mostly stood accused of imposing himself on seminarians, not teenage minors) or else chose to believe a denial from the accused cardinal himself. Why? In part because of perceived self-interest: Francis needed allies, McCarrick was sympathetic to the pope\u2019s planned liberalizing push, and the pope wanted his help reshaping the ranks of American bishops.In this scenario Francis would be guilty of self-deception and incuriosity but not as nakedly culpable as Vigan\u00f2 implies. And if it\u2019s easy to imagine this scenario because of the Danneels example, it\u2019s also easy to imagine because that\u2019s how things have proceeded consistently in the church since the sex abuse scandals broke: If a given predator or enabler is \u201con side\u201d for either conservatives or liberals, he will find defenders and protectors for as long as events and revelations permit.But the inevitable, even providential irony is that this sort of team thinking never leads to theological victory, but only to exposure, shame, disaster. Indeed, the lesson of these bitter decades is that any faction hoping to lead Roman Catholicism out of crisis should begin with purges within its own ranks, with intolerance for any hint of corruption.Now those allies may be the ruin of his pontificate. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the pope should resign \u2014 not even if Vigan\u00f2 is fully vindicated. One papal resignation per millennium is more than enough. That cop-out should not be easily available to pontiffs confronted with scandals, including scandals of their own making, any more than it should be available to fathers. Instead the faithful should press Francis to fulfill the paternal obligations at which he has failed to date, to purge the corruption he has tolerated and to supply Catholicism with what it has lacked these many years: a leader willing to be zealous and uncompromising against what Benedict called the \u201cfilth\u201d in the church, no matter how many heads must roll on his own side of the Catholic civil war.

The second suspect, Ciara Martinez, 30, was charged with the same five crimes, the police said early Thursday.No additional information about the suspects was immediately provided.Word of the arrests came just hours after the police identified the deceased woman as Lisa Velasquez, a missing 25-year-old who lived in the Melrose Houses. The authorities said she had been beaten to death and dismembered.Investigators on Wednesday were searching a four-family apartment building at 1006 Longfellow Avenue in the Bronx, a police official said. Detectives came and went from the two-story building in white hazmat suits, carrying bags to a white tent surrounded by signs saying crime scene.A medical examiner ruled that Ms. Velasquez\u2019s death resulted from \u201cmultiple blunt-impact injuries\u201d that fractured her skull.Ms. Velasquez, who went by the nickname Izzy, was raised during her teen years by her grandmother in a 14th-floor apartment in the Melrose Houses, a housing project on Courtlandt Avenue in the South Bronx known for gang conflicts, relatives and neighbors said.An aunt, Jacqueline Perez, said Ms. Velasquez had moved out of her grandmother\u2019s apartment a couple of years ago, but still visited frequently. The family last saw her on Aug. 21, when she dropped by to pick up a bag. \u201cShe left in a rush and said she had to help a friend in danger,\u201d her aunt said. Her relatives did not know who she meant or where she had been living.\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking the way she was tortured,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, she didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201dThree passers-by, two women in their 30s and a 63-year-old man, discovered the bags containing Ms. Velasquez\u2019s limbs on Tuesday shortly after 7 p.m. on the Barretto Point Park shoreline.The victim\u2019s left foot was jutting out of a bag that also contained her left arm and was found underneath the Tiffany Street Pier; a second bag was empty; an unopened third bag contained her right arm and leg, the police said.The toenails on her left foot were painted, and a woman\u2019s shirt was also found near the remains, the police said.Discoveries of human remains are rare, but not unheard-of, in New York.Ms. Odom was identified by her mother after the authorities disclosed that her torso had the word \u201cChocolate\u201d tattooed above her left breast.There have been no arrests in Ms. Odom\u2019s case and the police said their investigation was continuing.Matt Stevens and Mariana Alfaro contributed reporting and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attempted Hacking of Voter Database Was a False Alarm, Democratic Party Says", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe blunder was caused by a lack of communication between the national committee and one of its state branches, the officials said. The Michigan Democratic Party had hired hackers to simulate an attack known as phishing, but did not inform the national committee.The jolts of panic caused by what turned out to be an intraparty action underscored the fear of another major breach of the party\u2019s systems just weeks before the midterm elections, even as computer security has been made a priority and shored up since 2016. American intelligence officials have said there continue to be real threats from Russia to interfere in American elections.\u201cThere are constant attempts to hack the D.N.C. and our Democratic infrastructure, and while we are extremely relieved that this wasn\u2019t an attempted intrusion by a foreign adversary, this incident is further proof that we need to continue to be vigilant in light of potential attacks,\u201d Mr. Lord said in a statement.Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, called the situation a \u201cmisstep\u201d and said it was part of efforts to improve cybersecurity \u201cespecially as the Trump administration refuses to crack down on foreign interference in our elections.\u201d\u201cIn an abundance of caution, our digital partners ran tests that followed extensive training,\u201d he added.In 2016, Russian state-backed operatives penetrated the Democratic National Committee using a phishing campaign, in which hackers create website login pages that appear to be legitimate to trick unsuspecting users into giving up their user names and passwords. Hackers can then use the stolen credentials to log in to systems like email or voter registration databases.Now campaigns often test their employees with phishing simulations like the one conducted by the Michigan party, in which it had third parties set up a fake page that mimicked the party\u2019s login page for its voter-registration website.That page was detected late Monday by the cybersecurity firm Lookout, which informed the Democratic National Committee. The fake page appeared to be aimed at hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Votebuilder database, which Mr. Lord has referred to as \u201cthe party\u2019s most sensitive information.\u201dThe database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and computer files. Its successful penetration could have set off other hacking in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.\u201cPhishing attacks to get credentials or install malware are the ammunition that\u2019s currently being used to attack our election systems,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, an election security expert and the chief technologist of the Center for Democracy and Technology.In an interview, Mr. Lord said that the fake page did not contain any educational features \u2014 leading the Democratic National Committee to believe it was an actual hacking attempt rather than a test.\u201cIt very closely mimicked the infrastructure you\u2019d see actual hackers using,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time that it was detected by outside parties, it did not exhibit any of the characteristics of a training system.\u201dThe committee\u2019s incident response plan requires it to notify law enforcement in the event of a hacking attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to make sure that when we believe that we are the victim of a criminal act, that we take appropriate action and involve law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Mike Murray, the head of security intelligence at Lookout, said it was essential that the activity was caught, even if it was benign.\u201cYou don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a false alarm until you show up with the ladders and the fire trucks and the hoses,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to detect bad people doing bad things, regardless of whether that\u2019s crime or espionage or some kid messing around. We don\u2019t want anybody to be attacked.\u201dWith the midterms just over 70 days from now, political groups and systems administrators have been on high alert about hacks and foreign meddling.Eileen Sullivan and Noah Weiland reported from Washington, and Kate Conger from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Power Corrupts", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationInstitutional breakdown on display in the Catholic Church and the Oval Office.Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.I\u2019m not Catholic, so I\u2019m a bit reluctant to opine on a religion not my own. But I just don\u2019t understand why the church has been so slow to deal with this. I\u2019ve been reading these sorts of stories for nearly 20 years and we never seem to reach the bottom. What\u2019s the reason?But you\u2019re right: The celibacy vows just seem to me so unnatural and perverse and yet so fundamental to the traditions of the church. And maybe \u2014 I\u2019m going out on a limb here \u2014 that\u2019s a reason perverse people find their way into the ranks of the church. I say that knowing a majority of priests are not pedophiles and knowing also that sexual abuse happens in other religions and institutions. But what other explanation is there for the extent of the crisis? In the meantime, I hope that the bishops and cardinals who looked the other way and covered up the abuse are prosecuted for behavior that would make the Mafia blush. One of the big divisions between conservatives and liberals is whether government can do things better than the for-profit private sector. Obviously it\u2019s a matter of where one draws the line. Where would yours go?The United States could really use something like the French Foreign Legion to fight twilight struggles like the one in Afghanistan. The alternative is indefinite American commitment, which is costly and probably politically unsustainable; or abandoning Afghans to the untender mercies of the Taliban. A private company in the mold of Blackwater is obviously different from the Legion, which is a branch of the French military, but the idea of subsidizing a mercenary force of some description may be the least unattractive alternative.I know our readers will be able to name 50 reasons how this could go badly wrong, including incompetence and lack of accountability. It\u2019s what gives me pause, too. I would just note the other alternatives also have their moral and political costs. As far as for-profit schools go, I\u2019ve never understood why they shouldn\u2019t have a role to play in higher education, so long as they aren\u2019t lying to their enrollees the way Trump University allegedly did. Some for-profit schools were driven out of business by the Obama administration for leaving students with mountains of debt and little gainful employment. But how is that not also true of plenty of not-for-profit or public institutions?My main belief is that higher education is ripe for reinvention and we should be encouraging innovation and experimentation in the area, regardless of the tax status of this or that school.This is one area where the quest to make more money isn\u2019t a good spur to improvement. That goes double for elementary and high schools.Sorry, go on.Fraud and dishonest services should always be punished. I\u2019m not opposed to regulation if it is applied equally and isn\u2019t overly burdensome. But there seems to be an ideological hostility to for-profit schools that doesn\u2019t serve the interests of students seeking the combination of focus and flexibility that for-profit schools might be able to provide. The market does a lot of things very well; no reason education can\u2019t be one of them. And, you know, those for-profit schools might just be able to provide teaching (or janitorial) jobs for those hapless Yalies. So I say three cheers for the Obama administration, which homed in on for-profit schools and actually tried to judge whether the debt their students took on was balanced out by the income of their graduates.But so far the only person to be affected is the former C.I.A. director John Brennan. Trump is doing it to punish Brennan for speaking out so forcefully against his presidency. That\u2019s juvenile, stupid and unnerving. But if he doesn\u2019t go further, it isn\u2019t exactly earthshaking. To be honest, I don\u2019t see why so many former government officials need security clearances to begin with.Any serving C.I.A. director will have reasons to bring his predecessors into some confidence, whether because they need advice or because some issue was handled by that particular predecessor. I haven\u2019t always agreed with John Brennan, but I still think he\u2019s an outstanding public servant. Trump is just so \u2014 small. Still not sure what we did to deserve him. Hey, we never got to Omarosa! I\u2019d feel robbed if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that, given the way she\u2019s dribbling her revelations out bit by bit, we\u2019ve probably got a couple of hundred more pieces of incriminating evidence to go. Which I look forward to conversing with you about soon. See you in September.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Will Never Be an Age of Artificial Intimacy", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe big ideasRobots may be better than nothing, but they still won\u2019t be enough. A professor in the program in Science, Technology and Society at M.I.T.\u201cThere are people who have tried to make friends, but stumbled so badly that they\u2019ve given up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when they hear this idea of robots as companions, well \u2026 it\u2019s not like a robot has the mind to walk away or leave you or anything like that.\u201dYet through our interactions with these machines, we seem to ignore this fact; we act as though the emotional ties we form with them will be reciprocal, and real, as though there is a right kind of emotional tie that can be formed with objects that have no emotions at all.  In our manufacturing and marketing of these machines, we encourage children to develop an emotional tie that is sure to lead to an empathic dead end. On top of this, it has become fashionable for psychologists to critique empathy, a unique form of human connection, just at a time when we are embarking on relationships with objects with none to give. The coincidence is too convenient: Children will lose the ability to have empathy if they relate too consistently with objects that cannot form empathic ties. Technology challenges us to look at our human values. We can try to use technology to cure Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s, which would be a blessing, but that blessing is not a reason to move from artificial brain enhancement to artificial intimacy. And yet that is the kind of talk that one hears these days. The narrative begins with the idea that companionate robots would be \u201cbetter than nothing,\u201d better because there aren\u2019t enough people to teach, love and tend to people. But that idea quickly shifts into another: robots would be better than most anything. Unlike people, they would not abandon you or get sick and die. They might not be capable of love, but they won\u2019t break your heart.From better than nothing to better than anything. These are stations on our voyage to forgetting what it means to be human. But the forgetting begins long before we have a robot companion in place; it begins when we even think of putting one in place. To build the robots, we must first rebuild ourselves as people ready to be their companions.I\u2019ve heard it before, but still I\u2019m rattled. I stand accused by my happy technologist colleagues and their unrelenting enthusiasm. Accused of what? Species chauvinism, I suppose. My colleagues make assumptions about the future of being human with which I am not comfortable. First, that it is our human nature to want to evolve toward being more than human and, ultimately, immortal. The steps to get there are small. We will want to cure brain diseases. And from there, we will want to have superior brains. And from there, we will want our brains to live forever. I am an outsider to these cheerful pronouncements, which are not so much a conversation about human values as a technological ideology about what posthuman values should be.Ironically, to deny the need for death is to deny the humanness of having real conversations about it. Technologists presented us with artificial intelligence, and in the end it made us look differently, and more critically, at the kind of intelligence that only people have. It is an intelligence that is tempered with knowledge of our bodies, of our place in families and history. Now, science goes a step further and presents us with artificial intimacy, yet another form of A.I. Again, this is an intimacy that does not make room for human empathy or what human beings in their bodies experience as the fear of death, loneliness, illness, pain. We diminish as the seeming empathy of the machine increases. It is technology forcing us to forget what we know about life.In life, you are struck by the importance of presence, of the small moments of meaning, the miracle of your child\u2019s breath, the feelings of deep human connection. When you are thinking about technology, your mind is not on all of that. We program machines to appear more empathic. Being human today is about the struggle to remain genuinely empathic ourselves. To remember why it matters, to remember what we cherish. These days, to be human is to keep one\u2019s mind on the glory that one is.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Murder Mystery in Ancient Monastery Reverberates in Coptic Church", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWADI NATRUN, Egypt \u2014 Christian monks living in the solitude of Egypt\u2019s deserts have always faced the threat of attack from outside. In the early centuries, they built drawbridges and windowless towers to repel marauding nomads.More recently, barricades and armed police officers ring the monasteries to guard against Islamic State suicide bombers, who target Christians.But now, to the shock of the faithful, it turns out that danger also lurks inside the monastery walls.The death of Bishop Epiphanius, the abbot of the fourth century Monastery of St. Macarius, last month has set off an ecclesiastical murder mystery worthy of a Dan Brown novel. More than a simple whodunit, the case has exposed simmering tensions of a theological, if not personal, nature in an influential corner of the Coptic Orthodox Church.A scholar of ancient manuscripts with a frizzy beard typical of Orthodox clerics, Bishop Epiphanius, 64, was found at dawn on July 29, lying in a pool of blood outside his monastic cell. Injuries to his skull indicated he had been hit on the head with a blunt object, possibly a pipe, the police said.The intrigue deepened days later when the Coptic authorities defrocked a younger monk, Isaiah, who had clashed with the bishop in the weeks before his death. Soon after that, another monk, Faltaous, 33, slashed his wrists and tried to throw himself from a four-story building.Faltaous was hospitalized and treated for his injuries. On Aug. 11, Egyptian prosecutors said Isaiah had been charged with the murder of Bishop Epiphanius after confessing to the crime. Two days later they said that they had detained Faltaous for questioning.Beyond that, not much more is known. The police have sealed off the monastery to interview 150 people, including staff members, monks and bishops. The Coptic patriarch, Pope Tawadros II, has issued orders apparently aimed at tightening discipline among the country\u2019s 2,000 monks.New admissions to the monasteries have been suspended for a year; monks require permission to travel outside; and they have been given a month to close their Facebook and Twitter accounts.The bishop\u2019s death has become the subject of feverish news coverage in Egypt and, in private among Copts, much speculation. What would motivate two monks to plot against their bishop in a remote desert monastery, presuming they are the culprits? Possibilities floated by Coptic officials, experts and monks in interviews include theological disputes, financial misdeeds and even talk that the two monks had a close personal relationship they feared might be exposed.One senior church official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that, during a search of the monastery, Egyptian police officers had uncovered compromising material on a cellphone that could offer a motive. He declined to provide details.\u201cThis is about more than just the death of a bishop,\u201d said Ishak Ibrahim, an expert on the Coptic faith at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock to the entire church.\u201dAt the nearby Monastery of St. Pishoy, seven miles from the scene of the bishop\u2019s death, monks declined to comment, citing orders from superiors. But like everyone else they were eager to discuss the rumors privately. \u201cIt\u2019s is very unfortunate. I see these as two men who have been touched by the tongue of Satan,\u201d said a deacon providing a tour of the monastery. But he added, \u201cwe cannot judge them.\u201d\u201cAll of us are weak,\u201d the deacon went on. \u201cAnd if they repent, Jesus will accept them.\u201dA failed suicide bombing at a church in northern Cairo last weekend left just the bomber dead but was a reminder of the threat.Bishop Epiphanius\u2019s death opens a window on the cloistered world of the desert monasteries, which have enjoyed a major revival in the past 50 years and have come to occupy a central place in the Coptic faith. Four of the most famous monasteries are in Wadi Natrun, north of Cairo, an area once known for the salty lakes that provide the sodium carbonate used by the ancient Egyptians for mummification, now dotted with farmland reclaimed from the desert.Bishop Epiphanius was viewed as a senior figure in a reformist Coptic movement that has been gaining momentum inside the church under Pope Tawadros, said Samuel Tadros, an expert on the Coptic Church at the Hudson Institute in Washington. His appointment, in May, to position in which he would work as a liaison with the Catholic Church was seen as a sign that conservatives were being sidelined, Mr. Tadros said.But Bishop Epiphanius also faced opposition inside his own monastery. Earlier this summer the bishop considered expelling Isaiah, the monk now in custody, for \u201congoing violations,\u201d Archbishop Angaelos said.\u201cHe had been given several opportunities to cease what he was doing and to stop those violations,\u201d said the archbishop, declining to specify the nature of the violations. After the bishop was killed, the monk was defrocked, he added.The scandal has shattered the image of the monks as austere servants of God, devoted to prayer and solitude, that is held by many Copts in Egypt. Some question whether Copts are ready for the full truth about why the bishop was killed.\u201cI had no doubt from the beginning that this was personal,\u201d said Mr. Tadros, citing confidential information he received from Coptic officials about the case. \u201cYet the ramifications of the murder are likely to continue with the church for a long time.\u201dPope Tawadros promised in a sermon last week that the truth about the murder would come out, no matter how difficult.The uproar led to the newspaper being pulled from news stands, and its publisher being sentenced to three years in prison.For now, the St. Macarius monastery is closed to outsiders. One monk, speaking by phone from the monastery, said the police were still questioning witnesses. He acknowledged there had been tensions before the killing, but declined to say much more.\u201cWe have problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do not want to speak about it.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshMagdy Samaan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rug Hunting in Grizzly Country", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time in more than 40 years, Wyoming will allow hunters to shoot the big bears. It\u2019s a bad idea.Mr. Kerasote has written about nature and wildlife since the 1970s. KELLY, Wyo.What hasn\u2019t been as widely discussed is the shaky reasoning behind managing grizzly bears like other wildlife rather than by what might be called hunting\u2019s law of proportionality. In the case of killing a grizzly, it means you\u2019ve done something that has been considered difficult and dangerous. And it was, when you were hunting with a spear. But anyone who has shot a high-powered rifle knows that knocking off a grizzly bear is no more than an exercise in marksmanship, like shooting an elk. The difference is, you eat the elk. Grizzly bears are not hunted for their meat. Wyoming\u2019s hunting regulations make this clear. If you shoot what\u2019s called a \u201cbig game animal\u201d in Wyoming, like an elk, a deer or an antelope, you\u2019re legally bound to bring all the edible portions of the animal out of the field. But if you shoot what\u2019s called \u201ca trophy animal,\u201d like a mountain lion, a black bear and, now, a grizzly, all you have to bring out is its skull and pelt.Unfortunately, these arguments often fall on deaf ears in Wyoming, where some otherwise-smart politicians continue to claim, at least in private, that we should hunt grizzly bears because \u201chere in Wyoming, it\u2019s our culture to shoot animals.\u201d We can only hope that the federal judge hearing the challenge to the delisting, Judge Dana Christensen, makes a stab at changing that culture, before 20 or so scarce grizzlies, including perhaps 399 and 610, are made into rugs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Let\u2019s Not Throw the Word Treason Around", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocratic politicians should stop acting like internet trolls. Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness and a contributing opinion writer.When they talk about President Trump, why are so many Democratic politicians talking about treason? Whatever they may truly believe, why are they letting their inflammatory rhetoric become decoupled from the facts?By doing so, they are setting the country on a dangerous, unpredictable trajectory that could lead to a crisis of political legitimacy. And by indulging their own worst instincts, these Democrats are guilty of fomenting the extreme, intemperate rhetoric for which they have consistently criticized the president. If it were only activists or internet trolls claiming that Mr. Trump committed treason, it could, perhaps, be excused as excessive passion or immaturity. But these comments are also coming from elected Democrats with increasing regularity. Last week, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, tweeted at the president, \u201cLet\u2019s be 1,000% clear: if you worked with a hostile foreign power during your election, it\u2019s called TREASON.\u201d The caps are in the original. Nor is it just Senator Merkley. Other prominent Democrats, including Steny Hoyer, the House minority whip, have done it, too. Mr. Hoyer said that he agreed with John Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, that Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, Finland, last month was \u201cnothing short of treasonous.\u201d Representative Adam Smith of Washington State, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said that it was \u201chard to see\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s actions as \u201canything other than treason.\u201d The list keeps growing. Perhaps such rhetoric arises from a sense of political impotence. After all, Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress. Or perhaps Mr. Merkley, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Smith and the others believe it. Maybe they think that Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will one day uncover the smoking gun that has become an article of faith among Trump haters. What that would look like is anyone\u2019s guess. In this fraught political climate, smoking guns are probably in the eye of the beholder. You may firmly believe that a smoking gun exists, but so far, no proof has been offered. And no, Mr. Trump holding a news conference with Mr. Putin isn\u2019t it. Neither is the indictment of Paul Manafort for his business dealings with Ukraine. Indicting a Russian troll farm or a dozen Russian intelligence officers for hacking won\u2019t do it, either.Russia did achieve its main goal in the election, and it wasn\u2019t to pick a winner. It was to sow the seeds of internal division, to pit Americans against one another. In this, it was successful beyond its wildest dreams. Democrats should not have taken the bait. What\u2019s worrying is that Democrats appear not just to oppose the president\u2019s policies, but also the man and, increasingly, the process that put him in office. Crying treason and hounding the president\u2019s staffers and supporters out of public spaces using bully-boy tactics is poisonous. Somewhere along the line, \u201cresistance\u201d became \u201cTreason!\u201d and Democrats embraced the paranoid style in American politics. Saying you are going to resist is the language of politics, of working within the system, of elected representatives engaged in reasoned debate as they try to limit the president\u2019s ability to deliver on an agenda with which they disagree. It implies hope for the next election and the one after that. Even the threat of impeachment, while ill advised, recognizes a constitutional process that requires the action of a majority of the people\u2019s elected representatives in the House. It\u2019s worth remembering that unlike \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d treason is a capital offense. Should we take Mr. Merkley, Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Smith and the others tossing around this most serious accusation at their word? Do they believe that the United States Congress should send Mr. Trump to the scaffold as the British Parliament did to Charles I during the English Civil War? Perhaps Democrats are merely being hyperbolic and playing to the base, looking for money and votes. Vicious as that would be, I hope that is the case. But given the persistence with which the accusation is made, one gets the sense that they are serious. What do they think would happen if they prosecuted their claim to its final conclusion? What would be the effect on the country? Do they think the 63 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump would suddenly embrace Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer as saviors of the republic? Not likely. Rather, it would precipitate a fundamental crisis of confidence. Once this crisis was upon us, no one could know where or how it would end. In the absence of proof of treason that meets a broadly accepted definition, such accusations are patently irresponsible and destructive. It is the language of people who believe that politics is pointless and that its institutions have become ineffectual. Are Democrats willing to pull down our institutions and tear apart the social and political fabric that holds us together? Opposition to the president based upon gratuitous definitions of treason cannot realistically be separated from opposition to the millions of fellow citizens who voted for him, who in turn see the cry of treason as a self-serving attack on them and their choices.What to do? Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents must accept that they lost a free, fair and open election. There is no evidence of anything anyone but the most cloistered partisan could call treason. Dispense with conspiracy theories and fantasies about gaining power by any means other than the ballot box. Stop the frivolous accusations of treason. And then set about the hard work of persuading the American people and earning their votes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mount Fuji\u2019s Got Mail. A Bone-Rattling Bulldozer Ride Brings It Down.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJapan DispatchATOP MOUNT FUJI, Japan \u2014 Search for \u201cTop of Mt. Fuji\u201d on Instagram, and you\u2019ll discover thousands of posts documenting the hikers who have made it here to the summit of Japan\u2019s best-known volcano.But for many trekkers, sharing photographs of their feat on social media is way too new school.Instead, they would rather send an old-fashioned piece of snail mail from the tiny post office atop Mount Fuji, one of the few places in Japan where a postmark is still more coveted than another \u201clike\u201d on Instagram or Facebook.\u201cWe thought it would have more meaning,\u201d Toshiyuki Kasahara, 43, said of the postcards that he and his two sons, Yushun, 8, and Seijin, 6, deposited in the mailbox to send home after arriving on the summit last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial record that they can keep.\u201dMount Fuji \u2014 or \u201cFuji-san\u201d in Japanese \u2014 is considered sacred in Japan, and its snow-capped visage has been memorialized in countless artworks, making it an international symbol of the country.About 300,000 people climb it each year, including school groups, corporate teams and tourists from around the globe. Making it to the top of Japan\u2019s highest mountain takes a vigorous four- to six-hour hike, but it does not require much special equipment or skill.For those who reach the summit, one reward is the view: a breathtaking sweep of the mountain and the clouds skittering above; many climbers time their arrival to coincide with the sunrise.The post office atop Mount Fuji is also a popular attraction for many summiteers, and close to 18,000 people visited it last summer, sending nearly 97,000 pieces of mail. At a time when many post offices across Japan are experiencing steep declines in mail volume, the mountain\u2019s outpost thrives.But transporting all that mail down the 12,388-foot peak takes considerable effort, even in the absence of rain, sleet or snow. That\u2019s where the bulldozer comes in \u2014 or, technically speaking, a close cousin of one.Two or three days a week during the 40-day span of the summer hiking season that ends in August, a weather-beaten crawler tractor (a bulldozer minus the blade in front) trundles up the 2.8 mile Fujinomiya trail to collect crates of postcards and letters. After descending 4,500 feet in altitude, the tractor hands off the mail to a regular postal van.Officials at Japan Post, which runs more than 24,000 post offices across the country, said the Mount Fuji branch collected about 12.1 million yen, or nearly $109,000, in revenue last year, but declined to say how much it costs to service this vertiginous route.Motohiko Matsumi, postmaster of the Mount Fuji branch, said as long as hikers climbed the mountain, the postal service would want to keep open its most famous, and highest elevation, branch.\u201cThe people who climb Fuji-san want to make a special memory,\u201d Mr. Matsumi said. \u201cSo we are not so much worried about this particular post office.\u201dTo experience firsthand what\u2019s involved in delivering mail from the summit, I climbed aboard the tractor last month for the bone clattering four-hour round trip up and down the mountain. The company that operates the vehicle, Fuji Concrete Service, not only collects the mail, but also delivers food and drinks six days a week to the huts along the path where hikers stop for meals, bathroom breaks and naps.The crawler tractor rumbling up Mt. Fuji.Motoko Rich/The New York TimesEmbarking from what is known as the new fifth station \u2014 which is where the paved road ends, at 7,900 feet, and hikers often start their climbs after arriving by car or bus \u2014 workers piled a front-loading bucket and the back of the tractor with boxes of curry mix, potato chips, soybean bars, beer and vitamin drinks, as well as toilet paper, plastic spoons and tanks of gas.Also on board were 10 people being shuttled up the mountain, some clinging to metal railings and others sitting on dirt-encrusted jump seats. The passengers included staff members for the various rest huts, as well as a doctor and medical student heading to a four-day stint at a first aid clinic.Yuichi Furuya, 52, has driven the tractor six days a week for the last seven years. When he fired up the deafening engine and nosed the machine onto the rock-strewn dirt path, it quickly became apparent that his view from the glass-enclosed cab was completely blocked by the overfilled bucket in front.But this hardly slowed him down. Dressed in a tan jumpsuit and popping tabs of chewing gum into his mouth, Mr. Furuya deftly switched the gears of his machine as if he were playing a musical instrument. Dirt spewed from beneath the tractor, blowing into every crevice of the cab.\u201cAbout 40 percent of the route is inside my head,\u201d he said. The rest he navigated by peering down at the ground and watching the trail embankments.Through hairpin turns and jostling that threatened to dislodge internal organs, Mr. Furuya occasionally made a call on his cellphone and flipped through delivery invoices with one hand while keeping his left hand on the gearshift. All the while, he listened to a soundtrack of electronic dance music, his fingers tapping out rhythms on his right thigh.\u201cI am young at heart,\u201d said Mr. Furuya. \u201cI listen to music that calms me down.\u201dThe rattling finally stopped when we reached the mountaintop and crowded into the tiny post office. Two workers were at the counter selling postcards, stamps and certificates to hikers who wanted an official commemoration of their climb. Postal workers take shifts lasting five to seven days at the Mount Fuji branch, sleeping on bunk beds in back.While the mountaintop post office is certainly one of the more unique branches, the postal logo is ubiquitous throughout the country. Japan\u2019s postal system got its start in the 1870s, when the country was establishing its national identity, and the post office was often the first institution of the central government to open in villages.The post office atop Mount Fuji opened in 1906. Originally, postal workers carried the mail down the trail by foot. The crawler tractor has been making the trek for the last half-century.On the day I made the trip last month, Mr. Furuya and an assistant collected 11 plastic crates, each holding about 2,000 pieces of mail, and loaded them into the back of the bulldozer.Maj. Craig Gulledge, 34, who serves in the United States Air Force at the Yokota Air Base on the fringes of Tokyo, had made the climb in under four hours and dropped by the post office to send postcards to his wife, parents and a nephew and niece.\u201cNo one ever sends mail anymore,\u201d Major Gulledge said. \u201cSo this is a classic cheap souvenir.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Liberals, Don\u2019t Lose Faith in the First Amendment", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cole, a lawyer,\u00a0has argued five First Amendment cases before the Supreme Court.Have conservatives hijacked the First Amendment?Critics are increasingly making this claim, maintaining that under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the First Amendment, once an important safeguard for progressive speech, has become a boon to corporations, conservatives and the powerful.But in most instances, the First Amendment doesn\u2019t favor speech of the right or the left; it simply takes the government out of the business of controlling speakers by virtue of what they say. It often empowers the powerless. And most important, it helps check official abuse.But these developments should not lead liberals or progressives to lose faith in the First Amendment. For starters, the amendment\u2019s core requirement is that the government must remain neutral regarding the content and viewpoint of speech. As a result, a decision protecting conservative speech will equally support liberal speech.When the Roberts court ruled that the First Amendment prohibited holding the Westboro Baptist Church liable for displaying anti-gay signs outside a military funeral, its rationale would equally protect Revolutionary Communist Party demonstrators holding anti-Christian signs outside the Westboro Baptist Church.Some argue that the First Amendment\u2019s very neutrality is problematic, because in an unequal society, the amendment will favor the haves over the have-nots. We all have a formally equal right to speak, but only George Soros, the Koch brothers and a handful of others can spend hundreds of millions of dollars advancing their preferred candidates or positions.But this argument proves too much. All rights are more valuable for the rich. The rights to have an abortion, to send your children to private school, to exclude others from your property or to hire your own criminal defense lawyer are all more fully enjoyed by people with resources. Social inequality may be a reason to support progressive taxation or robust equal protection guarantees; it\u2019s not a reason to retreat from free speech principles.In a more fundamental sense, the First Amendment favors people without power and influence. In a democracy, the rich and those in the majority don\u2019t need constitutional protections; they can generally enact their desires through ordinary political processes. The targets of censorship are typically dissidents, outsiders, the marginalized.History illustrates the point. The Constitution\u2019s speech protections did not emerge fully formed when the nation was founded. During World War I, for example, the Supreme Court upheld long prison sentences for merely criticizing the war. Over many years, anarchists, communists, labor unions and civil rights activists fought for and earned the speech rights we know and take for granted today.Nor is the First Amendment outmoded. The need for its protections are as urgent as ever. In just the last year or so, my organization, the American Civil Liberties Union, has invoked the First Amendment to defend high school students disciplined for walking out from school to call for gun control, as well as other students penalized for posting pictures of guns on social media; a student newspaper denied funding after publishing a satire of \u201csafe spaces,\u201d as well as fans of a hip-hop band labeled gang members; Milo Yiannopoulos and the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, both of whom were denied permission to advertise on the subway by the Washington Metro Authority; and anti-Trump as well as pro-Trump demonstrators. We\u2019ve defended flag desecraters, union organizers, and citizens blocked from their representatives\u2019 Facebook sites for their criticism. And that\u2019s just the beginning.As even this very partial list shows, government officials continue to be tempted to silence people for their views. Some of our clients are liberal, others conservative, but all have been singled out because they have upset those in power.Not every First Amendment argument is justified, of course. The A.C.L.U. supported the public sector union in the Janus case, for example, saying that charging workers for services that the union is required to provide to them is not a First Amendment violation, any more than requiring people to pay taxes for government policies they oppose. But even if conservatives sometimes win free speech cases they should lose, now is not the time for anyone to dismiss the First Amendment as a tool of conservatives.Since Donald Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, Americans have been exercising their First Amendment rights to engage in resistance: demonstrating, calling their representatives, associating with like-minded citizens in defense of core values, shedding light on official abuse through the free press, and expressing themselves on social media.When one party controls all three branches of the federal government, the checks and balances have to come from the people. It\u2019s on us. And it\u2019s the First Amendment that gives us the tools to act \u2014 including the rights to speak, associate, petition the government and enjoy a free press.The fact that conservatives benefit from the First Amendment is not something to bemoan. It is part of the constitutional bargain. It simply means the First Amendment is operating as it should, neutrally preserving the lifeblood of democracy. Advertisement"}

I\u2019d like to be part of the fix for that, to start bringing us back together to find some solutions and to do some things together.In an earlier television ad, Bredesen \u2014 a Harvard graduate with a degree in physics and a business executive who founded HealthAmerica Corporation \u2014 made his opposition to polarization explicit: \u201cI\u2019m not running against Donald Trump.\u201d There are \u201ca lot of things I personally don\u2019t like about Donald Trump,\u201d Bredesen says,but he is the president of the United States and if he has an idea or is pushing something that is going to be good for Tennessee, I\u2019m going to be for it no matter where it came from. And likewise, if I think it\u2019s not going to be good for Tennessee I\u2019m going to be against it.On Tuesday, Democratic primary voters demonstrated a strong preference for centrist candidates; in May and June, they chose progressives. Looking toward the general election in November, there is evidence in support of both the Abrams and the Bredesen strategies. The first message expressed support for positions best described as non-adversarial and focused on expanding economic opportunity:It\u2019s getting harder and harder for people to earn the life they want. That\u2019s because the economy has changed dramatically, but government is stuck in the past. To solve this, we need an opportunity agenda for the Digital Age so that everyone everywhere has the opportunity to earn a better life.The second message takes a decidedly adversarial stance toward the rich and illustrates an approach based on economic populism:The American people must make a fundamental decision. Are we prepared to take on the enormous economic and political power of the billionaire class, or do we continue to slide into economic and political oligarchy? This is the most important question of our time, and how we answer it will determine the future of our country.For all intents and purposes, the result was a draw. The first message \u2014 similar to Bredesen\u2019s approach \u2014 got slightly more support from respondents (75 agree, 17 disagree), compared with 69-19 for the second message.

The authors argue that more extreme candidates tend to do poorly in general elections in large part because they skew turnout in the general election away from their own party and in favor of the opposing party.Hall and Thompson contend that this happens because their positions \u201cactivate the opposing party\u2019s base more than their own.\u201d When the Republican Party picks a nominee from the far right, or the Democrats from the far left, voters in the opposite party \u201cactually have a stronger incentive to turn out when an extremist is nominated, because the extremist is so far away from them ideologically.\u201dThe Data For Progress survey, conducted by YouGov Blue, polled 1515 adults July 13-16 and found, the authors assert, strong public support for ending cash bail except for those who \u201cwere a violence or flight risk\u201d (45 percent support, 24 oppose); \u201chaving the government produce generic versions of lifesaving drugs, even if it required revoking patents held by pharmaceutical companies\u201d (51-21); and \u201cfederal funding of community job creation for any person who can\u2019t find a job\u201d (55-23).Six in ten (59 percent) favor a national health plan, or Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan \u2014 including a majority of both Democrats and independents and about one-third of Republicans.Thirty-eight percent oppose such a plan.In addition, support for universal Medicare increasesamong the overall public (75 percent) and among partisans (87 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of independents, and 64 percent of Republicans) when framed as an option for anyone who wants it, but people who currently have other forms of coverage can keep the coverage they already have.Kaiser did warn, however, that itis unclear how support would fare if these proposals became part of the larger public debate as previous Kaiser Family Foundation polling has found the public\u2019s attitudes can be quite malleable.The Data for Progress survey found that other progressive policies face substantial opposition. Reparations, in the form of \u201coffering compensation or tax credits to descendants of slaves,\u201d was opposed 48-27. Giving every American $1,000 a month to be \u201cpaid for by raising taxes on people making more than $150,000\u201d was opposed 43-37. Section titles include \u201cThe Democratic Party simply cannot move to the center; the base won\u2019t allow it\u201d and \u201cThe path forward is unleashing nonvoters, not targeting the mushy middle.\u201d The Democratic Party woke up this morning with a clear signal from Tuesday\u2019s primary elections: The #Resistance means business. The more progressive candidate won in Democratic primaries around the country.The Data For Progress and Third Way surveys provide a case study in how seemingly similar polls can produce antithetical conclusions.Third Way asked voters:Thinking about what the government in Washington, D.C. could do to directly help you and your family, which of the following policies should be the greater focus: Policies that spread opportunity to more people and places or policies that address income inequality?Opportunity beat inequality 46-25.Another question posed by Third Way: would voters choose a candidate who A) supports these three issues \u201ca single government-run health care plan for all Americans, raising the minimum wage to $15, free college for all Americans\u201d or a candidate who B) supports these three issues \u201ccreating 1 million new apprenticeship positions, giving every American who works a private retirement account on top of Social Security, eliminating all federal taxes on the first $15,000 of income.\u201dCandidate A loosely fits the Abrams mold; while Candidate B loosely approximates Bredesen, Candidate B won out, 46-23.gains in white-collar suburbs will be critical to Democratic prospects in the Georgia governor\u2019s race between African-American Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp; the highly competitive Tennessee Senate contest between former Democratic Governor Phil Bredesen and Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn; and the more uphill, but still competitive, challenge by Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas.Mobilizing African-Americans, Latinos and other nonwhite voters \u201cundeniably represents an essential part of the equation for Democrats across the region,\u201d Brownstein writes. Still, he adds, increased minority participation is \u201cnecessary, but not sufficient.\u201d In key regions of the South and perhaps particularly in Georgia, President Trump has provided momentum for the two-part Democratic strategy Brownstein suggests: winning over well-educated white suburbanites offended by the president and mobilizing minorities enraged by the president. It remains to be seen whether a durable coalition can form around offense and outrage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Absolute Necessity of the New-Mom Friend", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the trenches with a baby, you need someone to text at 2 a.m.Ms. Sullivan is a novelist.My friend Cathy and I recently took an afternoon off and got a couples massage. We lay side by side in a small candlelit room, almost completely naked and entirely at ease. It was the third time we had met in person. In February 2017, our mutual friend, Steph, introduced us over email. Steph\u2019s first child had just been born. Cathy and I were both due in June. Steph said she\u2019d found it helpful to have another pregnant friend when she was pregnant, and since we both lived in New York \u2014 me in Brooklyn, Cathy on the Upper East Side \u2014 she thought we should connect. As our due dates grew closer, Cathy and I transitioned from the occasional polite email exchange to rapid-fire text messages at all hours. In the first 11 months of our children\u2019s lives, we never once saw each other. Especially early on, Brooklyn and the Upper East Side might as well have been London and Tokyo. But we texted every day, usually somewhere between 10 and 20 times. We got each other through post-birth recovery, nursing woes, the search for child care, high chair selection, the transition to solid foods, road trips and sleep. So many texts about sleep. We sent each other gifts in the mail. We texted pictures and videos. When my son was 8 months old, I found out I was unexpectedly pregnant again. Cathy was one of the first people I told, and the only one who responded with, \u201cI had a feeling.\u201dBefore I became a mother, I dreaded the thought of making new mom friends almost as much as childbirth. The idea of having to bond with women whose only connection to me was the fact that we happened to have procreated around the same time seemed highly unappealing. The popular narrative I\u2019d heard most about mothers of young children was that they tended to judge one another mercilessly. I thought I\u2019d be fine without this sort of forced companionship. I had plenty of friends who\u2019d had children already. Yet those same friends swore that meeting other brand new mothers was essential, and that these strangers would soon be some of the most important people in my life. I learned that they were right upon skipping the formalities and going straight to discussions of nipple pain and milk supply with Cathy, and two other women as well. I\u2019ve also spent the last year texting dozens of times each day with Olessa and Siobhan, whose sons were born within weeks of my own. We three are lucky enough to live near each other. During maternity leave, we\u2019d try to meet up once a week. We breast-fed together in the cafe at Whole Foods. I am usually a modest person, but I almost immediately abandoned the idea of covering up with a blanket while nursing my son. Not to make a statement, but because I am highly uncoordinated. I sometimes wondered if, seeing us there, people thought it was a poorly-attended La Leche League demonstration. Olessa and I worked together years ago and were longtime friends. I had never met Siobhan. But our time together each week felt like a small miracle. I didn\u2019t have to explain my strange new self to them. We were all obsessed with our babies. We were all overwhelmed. If one of us started crying for no reason, the others just passed her a tissue and kept talking. I trust these women more than anyone. We take advice from each other before doctors or parenting books. We often make different decisions for our children, and yet there is never a hint of judgment. As we\u2019ve found our footing, our conversations have moved to topics beyond babies. There\u2019s a built-in intimacy there, and so it feels natural to talk about other important life events too. I hope it worked out this way for those women I eavesdropped on at Le Pain Quotidien. Maybe by now they\u2019re all getting some sleep, and they joke about the time nobody could remember Kate\u2019s name. A friend told me recently that she still talks every day to the mothers she leaned on when their now-10-year-olds were newborns. Some of them, she said, were people she knew beforehand, but this shared life event, unlike any other, accelerated their bond. I thought then of Steph, who introduced Cathy and me. She was only a casual acquaintance until we connected over being pregnant. She was so generous with her knowledge and time. She sent an enormous spreadsheet detailing all the things I needed to do and plan and buy before the baby came. Our friendship was solidified when I asked her what the frozen maxi pads on the list were for, and she calmly explained in great detail. I\u2019m almost 37. It\u2019s been a while since I made so many close friends all at once. When I think back on it, circumstance was at the root of every lasting friendship I\u2019ve ever had \u2014 the girls I grew up with just happened to live on the same street as me; my college friends just happened to choose the same school. As I get older, more set in my ways, there\u2019s less room for these chance meetings to occur. I\u2019m now more than halfway through my second pregnancy, and although I\u2019m much better prepared this time, I\u2019ve been feeling wistful that my original new mom friends won\u2019t be along for the ride. You need people who are in the trenches with you because you forget so fast what babies are like. Already, I cannot recall what a child does at four months vs. five months vs. six. Recently, I got an email from a woman who is due two weeks after me. We\u2019ve long been fond of one another, but we\u2019ve never hung out one-on-one or even exchanged phone numbers.

{"Headline": "Are Germany\u2019s Garden Gnomes Endangered?", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGentrification threatens the country\u2019s tradition of urban gardening.Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.BERLIN \u2014 It\u2019s quiet in Germany. School\u2019s out, Chancellor Angela Merkel is on vacation and the country is recovering from the latest government crisis. Kleing\u00e4rten are not confined to, but have always had a particularly important function for, the cities. In the industrializing, rapidly urbanizing 19th century, they were a refuge for poor workers who had to live in overcrowded and gloomy apartment buildings. Crops from small gardens helped the city\u2019s poor to survive the economic crisis that followed World War I. They were where people slept after they were bombed out during World War II. They were where Eastern Germans grew the strawberries they could not buy in the Communist regime\u2019s economy of scarcity. In the postwar West, however, they have always been a luxury. They became the place where the urban petty bourgeoisie could act out its dream of perfect orderliness. The Kleingarten is a German clich\u00e9: narrow but perfectly ordered, shrewd but likable, above all an idyll amid the swirling roughness of the world.Or at least it used to be. The Kleingarten is getting caught up in a massive urban conflict: the fight over space. But driven by the ecological movement, rising housing prices and smaller apartments, families like Robert\u2019s have discovered the gardens. Like many others, Robert, too, is seeking a timeout from his stressful job. He wants his kids to learn about nature, and he wants a safe place for them to play. \u201cIt\u2019s so relaxing to dig a bed, or to cut a tree,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn the garden, I can really forget about everything.\u201d However, the changes in the social mix of the club did not go without debate. All the lines of tension in German urban society crossed in the Kleingarten. \u201cIt was the older folks against the younger ones, Easterners against Westerners, the newly arrived against long time Berlin residents,\u201d Robert said. While many new gardeners wanted to open the area to nonmembers, and envisioned the gardens as a space for neighborhood meetings and festivities, many of the older ones insisted on privacy and closed gates. Some of the older and less well-off members had been pushed out of gentrifying neighborhoods like Prenzlauer Berg; now those who had driven up the rents became their garden neighbors. The tensions in Bornholm I were exacerbated by outside changes, too. The Berlin State Senate has promised to control the rising housing prices in the city and build 30,000 apartments in the next three years. The Senate is looking for cheap land to develop, and much of the land occupied by Kleing\u00e4rten is city land. Berlin\u2019s government is considering turning some into housing developments. Bornholm I is said to be on the list.At first, Pankow\u2019s small gardeners were divided over how to respond. But eventually the outside threat had a unifying effect, Robert said. Together, they persuaded the Pankow district administration to lobby the Senate to protect Kleing\u00e4rten areas from development. Similar stories, playing out in other Kleing\u00e4rten, have led to a citywide campaign to save them.Conflict over how to share the city\u2019s limited space is the future, and not just in Berlin. Germany\u2019s Kleing\u00e4rten may no longer be a necessity for struggling urban dwellers, but they still give urbanites a desperately needed connection to nature. But it takes more than just yard work to make them function: We have to share our precious urban communal space with others, we have to follow its rules. In this urban world of scarcity and constraints, Germany\u2019s Kleing\u00e4rten have turned from symbols of conformity into places of individuality, creation and empowerment \u2014 and, at least at Bornholm I, a place where people with very different backgrounds and worldviews can labor side by side. Not all of them will survive the housing crisis. But the fight will be fierce.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect measurement conversion. Four hundred square meters is equal to 478 square yards, not 437 yards.Advertisement"}

The Bogles have vowed never to let guests return.\u201cWe are farmers,\u201d Mr. Bogle said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be famous.\u201dOn July 20, the first guests arrived, a manageable throng of about 150 people. \u201cEveryone was respectful,\u201d Mr. Bogle said. The family met tourists from New York and Australia and discussed the merits of rotating crops. One guest from Dubai huddled under a tree during a thunderstorm, Mr. Bogle said. They invited him inside until the storm passed.\u201cIt was eight days of amazing,\u201d Mr. Bogle said.Indeed. On July 28, the first car arrived at 6:45 a.m. Two more cars came a half-hour later. Even more showed up after that.

Enterprising sunflower peepers, though, maneuvered their cars along side roads and pulled out their cameras for one last shot.\u201cThey were knocking down sunflowers and taking flower heads with them,\u201d Mr. Bogle said. \u201cWe went from a week of amazing to that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve described it as a zombie apocalypse,\u201d he added. \u201cThere were so many cars.

{"Headline": "From Maritime Bairrada in Portugal, Wines of Freshness", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourThe Atlantic climate imbues these reds and whites \u2014 made from little-known Portuguese grapes \u2014 with elegance, grace and the potential to age.For many Americans, the wines of Portugal are a great unknown.Unlike those of France, Italy or Spain, Portuguese wines do not carry with them much of an identity. A mention evokes no particular image except perhaps for port, the famous fortified wine. The problem is few Americans drink fortified wine anymore. If consumers do, my impression is that they are more likely to be interested in Madeira (also from Portugal, but produced on a far smaller scale than port) or sherry from Spain. The confusion is partly a result of Portugal\u2019s greatest strength: its reliance on grapes that have been indigenous to Portugal. A tried and true strategy of winemakers in underappreciated but ambitious regions in the last quarter of the 20th century was to gain global attention by planting well-known French grapes like cabernet sauvignon, merlot, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, and then making wines in internationally popular styles \u2014 potent, oak-aged reds, for example. After gaining critical approval, primarily from Americans, producers eventually reverted to grapes that were historically identified with their areas.But Portuguese winemakers never played that game. Although some international varieties can be found, most regions stayed true to their own grapes, which perhaps hampered efforts to market Portuguese wines outside of the country.The maritime climate, along with the clay and limestone soils, is the key to the red wines of Bairrada, which are characterized by a natural freshness that in the best examples is retained as the wines age and leads to a rare elegance and grace. The climate can also be a curse, as humidity can be trapped between the ocean and the D\u00e3o hills, and the leading red grape, baga, is susceptible to rot.Farmers who made their own wines back then used traditional techniques, involving long macerations of the juice with the skins, producing wines that were profoundly tannic and rustic, though rarely high in alcohol.\u201cWhat I remember was the vibrancy of the acidity and the balance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey reminded me of nebbiolo.\u201d De Sousa also offers an occasional experimental baga. A 2009 Vinho d\u2019Autor ($40), was made from baga grapes that Paulo Sousa, the winemaker, believes did not fit into either the Colheita or the Garrafeira, its higher-end baga. The Vinho d\u2019Autor was decidedly old school: structured and tannic, rich and mouth-filling (but not heavy), long and delicious, just what one would want with roasted meats. Maybe my favorite de Sousa wine, however, was a white, the 2016 Reserva Branco, lively, linear and mineral, with the aroma of fresh flowers. The \u201916, about $20, was the first vintage of this wine, Ms. Laufer said, and only a small quantity was produced. It was in Portugal in the spring of 2017 that I tried Niepoort\u2019s 2012 Poeirinho, an enchantingly fresh, precise and graceful baga. I asked him by email what drew him to Bairrada.\u201cIt was always my big love,\u201d he said. \u201cI always was amazed by the soils, the climate (difficult) and particularly baga.\u201cIt is the finest terroir in Portugal with the perfect grapes suited to it,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt ain\u2019t easy, but when right, it can be some of the best in the world.\u201dPerhaps it\u2019s time to reconsider.An earlier version of a photo caption misstated the surname of the winemaker at Sid\u00f3nio de Sousa.

When I met his future wife, who is engaging and kind, we got along immediately. But at their wedding, she and her family treated my parents disrespectfully: They weren\u2019t seated at the main table, allowed to make toasts or acknowledged in any way. Her parents also refused to attend a reception hosted by mine. I still get along with my brother and my sister-in-law, but I\u2019m deeply angry at him for allowing our parents to be humiliated. This has created a rift: My parents are bitter, and my brother either doesn\u2019t notice or care. How can I solve this? SONAYou don\u2019t mention your brother being utterly clueless, so let\u2019s assume he noticed your parents\u2019 third-class treatment at his wedding and their ensuing bitterness. You also don\u2019t mention any conflicts that caused the in-laws to behave like monsters. And life is usually more shaded than your innocents-and-villains story. That leaves two options: Your brother has already staged a campaign for kinder treatment of your parents and lost, or he doesn\u2019t care \u2014 at least not enough to risk his happy new home life.Either way, do not position yourself at the center of this family feud. I get that you feel protective of your parents, but this is not your battle. You shaming your brother is not the long-term solution here. Your parents need to find their own voices to speak with him and his in-laws. If they do, I hope it\u2019s a modulated one and not laced with fury. They need to woo your brother and his wife, not drive them further away. As for you, say to your brother, \u201cMom and Dad are upset about the wedding. Why don\u2019t you talk to them about it?\u201d And to your parents: \u201cStewing isn\u2019t going to help anything. You should talk to him.\u201d Then stop!

Recently, we discovered that these posts are lifted, word for word, from the Twitter feeds of famous comedians, authors and political commentators. But our friend doesn\u2019t credit them; he acts as if he is the author. Facebook friends say how clever he is. (The weird thing? He\u2019s funny enough to write his own posts.) Should we say something? He\u2019s stealing people\u2019s material, but it isn\u2019t for financial gain. We don\u2019t know what to do.FRIENDSPilfering other people\u2019s intellectual property (or using their work without attribution) is as bad as stealing their handbags. The fact that your friend isn\u2019t making money through humor is irrelevant. His actions discredit the originality of hard-working writers, even if his Facebook cohort is only 100 strong. This joke thief may be lazy or intellectually insecure, but who cares? He\u2019s a close friend, and his persistent plagiarism needs to stop. The next time you see him, say, \u201cYou\u2019re talented enough to come up with your own Facebook posts. Why not leave Jon Favreau alone, or at least credit him when you quote his work?\u201dI love it when my parents come to visit, and I\u2019m happy to cook for them. In return, they insist on doing the dishes. The problem? They leave them covered in grease. So, I stay up late and sneak into the kitchen to rewash them. I\u2019ve told them not to worry about the dishes \u2014 without luck. How can I handle this without criticizing their dishwashing skills?R.I\u2019m sorry, but your parents are not delicate hothouse orchids. These are the same folks who watched you stomp up the stairs at 15, screaming, \u201cI hate you!\u201d They can take it. And they want to pitch in. So, the next time they\u2019re filling the sink with warm water, simply ask them to put more soap on the sponge: \u201cIt cuts the grease better.\u201d Then you can stay up late seething about those terrible bangs they gave you in second grade. My husband and I make dinner dates with others at restaurants. We schedule a time to meet, and if we arrive early I\u2019m comfortable waiting it out. But my husband texts, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d I think this puts pressure on the other party, and I don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s done to me. Thoughts?S.H.As with most things, it depends, right? If my partner or brother or best friend sent me your husband\u2019s text, I\u2019d simply receive it as a data point and go about getting to the restaurant at a comfortable pace. With anyone else, I\u2019d share your stress, even (especially!) if the texter added: \u201cNo hurry!\u201d Worse, this stress often comes with a helping of resentment: We made a date.

Since the late 1990s, reducing animal shelter populations through adoption has been a prime piece in the \u201cno kill\u201d strategy. Shelter hours have been extended to accommodate working people in the hopes they\u2019ll visit and find a pet. Volunteers and staff members post cute photos and videos online; supervised dog \u201cplay groups\u201d let would-be adopters see animals happily romping together, rather than caged and lunging at the bars. Thousands of independent rescue groups of all sizes have taken custody of shelter animals; they have fostered, groomed, spayed and neutered them, medically treated and trained them, and found them homes. All of this is a good thing. The problem is that while regions like New England and the Pacific Northwest report shortages of shelter animals, nationwide it\u2019s a different story. Because of the continued high intake volume in many states, the United States still euthanizes up to two million dogs and cats a year, with rates highest in disadvantaged communities. Not coincidentally, shelter intake is higher in those communities as well. Take parts of Los Angeles, which has had an explicit no-kill policy for its shelters since 2012. At the moment, every public shelter in the city is full, and the South Los Angeles shelter, in one of the most densely populated and disadvantaged parts of town, has been crowded for months, with dogs being housed two and three to a cage. A big part of the reason shelters fill is poverty: An estimated one-quarter of shelter animals are there after their owners have surrendered them because of family dysfunction or financial pressure. A dog may be sick and there\u2019s no money for a vet; a landlord may be threatening eviction. The animals of the poor end up in shelters even when their owners desperately want to keep them. If a dog gets out and is picked up by animal control, for instance, impound and reclamation fees and fines can make retrieving it unaffordable. Ignorance and misinformation about sterilization, and not enough affordable, easily available surgery options, result in even more dogs that no one can care for. Adoption promotion and events like low-price giveaways address none of these issues and can create problems of their own by enabling abusers and, far more commonly, impulse buyers. Adoption becomes a feel-good \u201cnumbers\u201d game, in which we carefully and proudly track only how many animals have left the shelter. No one notes how many of them end up back in the system. The head of a well-established rescue group told me that just days after a \u201cclear the shelters\u201d event, she saw three recently adopted dogs being returned to two Los Angeles-area shelters. \u201cThe adopters had \u2018changed their minds,\u2019\u201d she said. Indeed, no one knows how any of these animals fare at all. A longtime Los Angeles shelter volunteer observed that \u201chad Valerie not come across the path of the Ghetto Rescue people, no one would even know her story.\u201d Carol Mithers is a Los Angeles-based journalist writing a book about dog rescue and poverty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ohio State Gives Urban Meyer a 3-Game Suspension (and the Benefit of the Doubt)", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 After a news report that raised questions about what the famed Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer knew about past domestic violence allegations against one of his closest assistant coaches, he wanted to know one important thing. How to delete old text messages on his phone.Meyer and a top athletic administrator discussed how to adjust the settings, a university report released on Wednesday said, and when Ohio State\u2019s investigators obtained the phone, they discovered no messages on it older than a year.Still, they gave him the benefit of the doubt, a running theme in the report that found missteps on Meyer\u2019s part related to his handling of the case but no unassailable evidence of a cover-up or that he \u201cdeliberately lied\u201d about his knowledge of the case.\u201cWe cannot determine,\u201d the report said, \u201cwhether coach Meyer\u2019s phone was set to retain messages only for one year in response to the Aug. 1 media report or at some earlier time.\u201d\u201cIt is nonetheless concerning that his first reaction to a negative media piece exposing his knowledge of the 2015-2016 law enforcement investigation was to worry about the media getting access to information and discussing how to delete messages older than a year,\u2019\u2019 the report said.The university report, which led trustees to suspend Meyer for three games for not following proper procedures in informing administrators about a troubled employee, details a long list of problematic conduct by the assistant football coach Zach Smith: a 2013 charge of drunken driving; running up a $600 or so bill at a strip club on a recruiting trip; failing to show up at scheduled recruiting visits at high schools; taking sexually explicit photos of himself at the White House during a team visit; an addiction to a stimulant prescription drug used to treat A.D.H.D. that resulted in his being admitted into a drug treatment facility; and having a sexual relationship with a secretary on the football staff.All along, Meyer found reasons not to act or said he was not aware of what was going on. There were no criminal charges filed in the domestic violence case. He had talked to Smith, who promised to do better. He was unaware of certain messages Smith\u2019s wife had sent to his wife, Shelley. Ultimately, Meyer fired Smith on July 23 after Smith\u2019s former wife obtained an order of civil protection against him.\u201cRepeatedly, Zach Smith\u2019s conduct was met with reprimands and warnings by Coach Meyer, but never a written report, never an investigation and no disciplinary action until July 23, 2018,\u201d the report said.Confronted by investigators delving into what he knew and when, Meyer admitted, \u201cI followed my heart, not my head,\u201d when handling Smith, whose grandfather Earle Bruce, a revered former Ohio State football coach, was a mentor to Meyer.\u201cAs I reflect, my loyalty to his grandfather Earle Bruce, who was my mentor, likely impacted how I treated Zach over the years,\u201d Meyer said.The decision to suspend Meyer came after a marathon private meeting of the university\u2019s board of trustees that stretched close to nine hours on Wednesday. As the meeting wrapped up, a group of fans stormed the building in which it was held, chanting support for Meyer.Against the backdrop of a nationwide, intensifying focus on addressing abuse of women, the board decided that Meyer\u2019s missteps in the case did not rise to a cover-up but warranted punishment.The board deliberated extensively over how many games Meyer should miss and painstakingly reviewed the report that had been prepared by investigators, and it brought Meyer and others in for questioning, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a confidential session.Meyer was also suspended, without pay, for the remainder of the preseason \u2014 crucial preparation time for college teams. He will miss the season opener against Oregon State on Sept. 1, as well as games against Rutgers and Texas Christian, a top 20 team. He will, however, be permitted to work with the team outside of games beginning Sept. 2.Ohio State\u2019s athletic director, Gene Smith, was also suspended without pay, from Aug. 31 to Sept. 16.Here are the findings of an independent investigation looking into Coach Urban Meyer\u2019s handling of domestic violence accusations against Zach Smith, one of his assistant coaches.\u201cTheir handling of this matter did not exhibit the kind of leadership and high standards that we expect of our athletic director, head coach, assistant coaches and all on the football staff,\u201d a university statement said.Meyer, one of the most successful coaches in college football \u2014 he won national championships with Ohio State in 2014 and with Florida in 2006 and 2008 \u2014 appeared somber at a news conference on Wednesday night following the board meeting.Meyer had been on paid administrative leave since Aug. 1 after allegations surfaced that Meyer knew Zach Smith had been accused of domestic violence since 2015, when the accusations were made. Meyer said in July that he had just learned of the case, but after being put on leave he released a statement saying he had misspoken and had \u201cfollowed proper reporting protocols and procedures\u201d after learning of the incident in 2015. Smith was fired in July.The university\u2019s report said Meyer \u201cdid not deliberately lie.\u201d The report said that Meyer had learned of the domestic abuse case from Gene Smith, the athletic director, and that they had monitored the case for months without following university protocol to inform other officials.The report, written by the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairwoman Mary Jo White and her team from the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, found that Meyer had acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d in not reporting the allegations, but his actions were ultimately \u201cnot sufficient,\u201d White said at the news conference on Wednesday night.Smith\u2019s lawyer, Brad Koffel, released a statement on Wednesday evening: \u201cZach Smith married a woman he should not have married. Vengeance against her ex-husband regrettably resulted in collateral damage to Urban Meyer, Gene Smith and the Ohio State University. Trying cases in the media is a dangerous precedent for every other coach in America.\u201dMeyer arrived midmorning to the site of the board\u2019s meeting, the Longaberger Alumni House, just across from the football complex. Shelley Meyer showed up hours later. And in the late afternoon, some eight hours after the meeting began, Gene Smith entered the building.As evening approached, the clamor of football practice nearby could be heard under the direction of the interim coach, Ryan Day.The saga began in earnest on July 23, when Zach Smith was fired after the independent journalist Brett McMurphy reported on Facebook that Courtney Smith had requested a protection order against him. He also reported that Zach Smith had been accused of domestic violence in 2009, when he was an assistant to Meyer at Florida, and in 2015, when they were both at Ohio State.A week earlier, at a news conference for the Big Ten Conference, Urban Meyer said that he had known of the 2009 accusations and that he and his wife had talked with the Smiths after a police investigation. But when confronted with questions about the 2015 allegations during the news conference, Meyer said he had learned of the accusations only the night before.Meyer, who has also coached at Bowling Green State and Utah, is entering his seventh year at Ohio State and has a career coaching record of 177-31, with an 11-3 record in bowl games.At Florida, along with the national championships came a string of players who had trouble with the law. He left the university in 2010, citing health and family reasons, but was hired a year later by Ohio State when the team was reeling from a tattoos for cash scandal.Meyer is set to make $7.6 million this season, among the highest salaries for college football coaches, and his contract runs through 2022. Because of his suspension, he will forgo six weeks of compensation.Serge F. Kovaleski and Melissa Gomez contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the U.S. Is Fighting Russian Election Interference", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Trump administration officials warned on Thursday that Russia is trying to interfere in November\u2019s midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election and vowed to combat Moscow\u2019s aggression.\u201cThis is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus,\u201d said the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.Here is what you need to know about Russia\u2019s interference and American efforts to fight it.Russia is trying to spread propaganda on hot-button issues using social media, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has said, highlighting what he called persistent and pervasive efforts. Moscow\u2019s strategy, he said, is to exacerbate sociopolitical divisions.Mr. Coats again singled out Russia on Thursday, saying its disinformation campaign is ongoing. \u201cWe continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States,\u201d Mr. Coats said at the White House. Mr. Wray also cited attempts to manipulate news stories, spread disinformation and escalate divisive issues.Intelligence and law enforcement officials are also looking out for voter suppression efforts, illegal campaign financing, hacks targeting elected officials and voting infrastructure, he said.As for computer security, experts see political campaigns as vulnerable, particularly in state and local elections, where campaigns frequently lack the money and expertise to forestall attacks. Microsoft detected spear-phishing attacks, apparently by Russian intelligence, targeting computers of two 2018 election candidates, a senior company official said last month; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat seeking re-election, said last week that her Senate office computer network was one of them.\u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong. But I think we\u2019ll see attacks on campaigns in which the Russians in particular have already stolen information,\u201d said Eric Rosenbach, an intelligence veteran and cybersecurity expert at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.Nationally, the two major political parties stepped up security after the 2016 breach of computers at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Voting machines, often described as old, insecure and lacking a paper trail, are more secure than widely understood. Four in five Americans vote on machines that incorporate paper ballots or backups. Many state voter-registration databases also have been hardened against outside attack since 2016. While it is possible to hack voting devices to rig an election, experts say, intruding into enough of them to change the outcome would be extremely difficult.Election officials and the Department of Homeland Security set up a council to coordinate the response to threats, and the department offers security scans, equipment and other services to election officials nationwide. Top state election officials are gaining security clearances to see and assess threats, and in February, all 50 states and more than 1,000 localities opened a center to exchange data. Virtually every state has taken steps to lock down its election processes.A public-private committee has also approved a new standard for voting equipment that will significantly improve security. More voting machines than ever have verifiable paper backups, and nearly all should have them by 2020, said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. States also are adopting more advanced auditing techniques for vote counts.The most important work the intelligence community has done, according to current and former officials, is to penetrate foreign networks and spy on Russian groups conducting the attacks. The agencies have also monitored networks in the United States to try to detect information campaigns as they begin.\u201cThey are gathering intelligence,\u201d said Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department official who is now a partner at Perkins Coie. \u201cThey are trying to figure out what our adversaries are planning and what is being done. That includes penetrating foreign networks and other kinds of spying they do. And they are doing surveillance on U.S. networks to detect influence of all kinds.\u201dIntelligence agencies are working more closely with technology companies, though some firms have said too little intelligence has been shared, hampering Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to detect threats and warn Americans.Mr. Coats has said the intelligence agencies and White House consider threats to the electoral system a top priority. Mr. Coats has called not just on technology companies to boost protections but also to make sure Americans take steps to verify the information they consume. \u201cIt is essential that we all apply critical thinking to all sorts of information,\u201d he said.Mr. Coats\u2019s appearance at the White House was important for informing the public, said Laura Rosenberger, a former Obama administration official and the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cBuilding resiliency in the population is really important to inoculate against the effect of some of this,\u201d she said.Cybersecurity experts praised Thursday\u2019s briefing as an important step to bringing high-level focus to the fight against interference. But they said that to deter Russia, Moscow needs to believe that the United States will impose costs beyond the sanctions and other punishments it has doled out, and that requires Mr. Trump to make clear he will act against interference.\u201cIf you are going to stop what is going on, that could require a presidential-level decision,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said.An earlier version of this article misspelled on a second reference the last name of a former Justice Department official. He is Michael Sussmann, not Sussman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who\u2019s Afraid of a White Minority?", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe battle over how to project the future population of the United States has profound political implications.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The question of whether America will become a majority-minority nation \u2014 and when that might happen \u2014 is intensely disputed, of enormous political import and extraordinarily complex. Two articles that appeared in the opinion section of The Times over the past few years made the case that misleading statistical artifacts used by the Census Bureau have increased the fear of a majority-minority America, a fear that played a crucial role in the 2016 election.Not so fast, say William Frey of Brookings, Lilliana Mason of the University of Maryland and Justin Gest of George Mason University. They argue that mixed-race Americans who identify as white are not always viewed \u2014 or accepted \u2014 as white by other Americans. As Mason put it to me in an email, \u201cpeople who are racially motivated to dislike immigrants\u201d will \u201cnot be assuaged by the argument that one day immigrants will just be white people.\u201dAlba writes:Currently, 14 to 15 percent of infants born in the United States are multiethnic or multiracial, a number that was just 11 to 12 percent in 2000. But despite the fact that most of those children have a white parent, inadequacies in the census classifications mean that the great majority of them are identified as nonwhites. This is important, because most partly white individuals behave like whites in sociological terms. They grow up in neighborhoods with many whites, have white friends as adults, think of themselves mostly as white or partly white, and marry whites.considers race and ethnicity to be two separate and distinct concepts. What is race? An individual can report as White, Black or African-American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, or some other race. Survey respondents may report multiple races. What is ethnicity? Ethnicity determines whether a person is of Hispanic origin or not. For this reason, ethnicity is broken out in two categories, Hispanic or Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. Hispanics may report as any race.When Hispanics who identify themselves as white are added in, the white share of the population actually grew modestly between 2000 and 2017 from 75.1 percent to 76.6 percent. This raises a question: If the census dropped the binary non-Hispanic white-minority division and instead stressed the large number of people of mixed ancestry who self-identify as white, would the anxieties of whites fearful of a majority-minority America be lessened?A second question is how many Americans who are currently inclined to see immigrants as outsiders and as threats to the nation\u2019s culture will perceive those coming from Asian, Latin American, African, Middle Eastern and North African nations as part of the American mainstream \u2014 even as more of those migrants intermarry. And what about the second-, third- and fourth-generation offspring of increasing numbers of Latino-white and Asian-white unions?Trump has driven home not only to his base but to many others the message of a threatening majority-minority future. Alba himself worries that the majority-minority prediction has become lodged in American thinking. In an email, he wrote thatthe notion of the majority-minority society has a powerful hold on the public imagination at the moment. But I continue to believe (or hope) that another view of the evolution of our society can eventually win out, especially given the toxic impact on our politics of the majority-minority idea.They asked one half of the respondents to read a story about the \u201cconventional narrative about the decline of non-Hispanic whites\u201d and the other half to read a story detailing \u201cthe growth of Hispanic and Asian-American populations\u201d but that \u201calso mentioned the rise of intermarriage and reported the Census Bureau\u2019s alternative projection of a more diverse white majority persisting the rest of the century.\u201dOf those who read the first version, \u201c46 percent of white Democrats and a whopping 74 percent of Republicans expressed anger or anxiety when reading about the impending white-minority status.\u201d Of those who read the second version, \u201conly 35 percent of white Democrats and 29 percent of white Republicans expressed anger or anxiousness.\u201dThe image of these immigrants has been contaminated by Trumpian portrayals of criminals, benefit hunters, and opportunistic job competitors. Further, the vision of a more hybridized whiteness is still a couple decades away, and political minds are notoriously myopic.It is not, Gest argued,a strategy to reassure white Trump supporters, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Those immigrants will soon be white too.\u201d There is a pervasive perception that Latinos, Africans and Asians are simply too different, too far removed from what Sam Huntington called the \u201cAmerican creed.\u201dLilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, shares Gest\u2019s pessimistic assessment. As a general rule of thumb, Mason argued, \u201cpeople don\u2019t respond well to being told that they\u2019ll think differently one day. It comes across as patronizing and can cause them to stick to their original idea even more strongly.\u201dMason believes that even though growing numbers of those with mixed parentage think of themselves as white, many other whites are not currently prepared to accept that claim:Bart Bonikowski, a professor of sociology at Harvard, argues that in the contemporary political climate, the fear of cultural disruption has become so pervasive on the right that realistic facts and figures make little difference. As he wrote in an email:My sense is that actual levels of migration, shifts in immigrants\u2019 ethnic identification, and changing rates of intermarriage are, at best, only loosely coupled with perceptions of cultural threat among white voters, particularly those with moderate levels of education and those living outside of urban centers. Even though actual levels of undocumented migration from Mexico \u2014 and net migration from that country in general \u2014 have decreased in recent years, this in no way diminished the potency of Donald Trump\u2019s xenophobic discourse in the 2016 presidential election. Indeed, this was true despite the fact that aggregate favorability toward immigrants has been steadily increasing in the United States over the past decade.Bonikowski elaborated:The reason for this is that many Trump supporters have long held strong ethnonationalist sentiments, but these sentiments have only recently become politically salient, as Trump, and other Republicans before him, have actively stoked fears of demographic and cultural change and channeled them into powerful resentments toward minority groups. For many voters, such resentments are not rooted in everyday experience, not least because they tend to live in ethnically homogeneous, predominantly white communities, but rather, they are shaped by powerful nativist narratives perpetuated by right-wing politicians, partisan organizations, and media outlets.Given the slow and in fact, last year, negative growth of the white population along with its rapid aging \u2014 it is important for older whites to understand that the only way we will have a growing labor force will be to embrace the younger racial minority populations.Frey described projections that many young people of mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds will self-identify as white as \u201cquite speculative.\u201d He questioned putting forth such projections for the sole purpose of potentially appealing to Trump supporters \u2014 many of whom do not seem to be interested in other demographic facts such as last decade\u2019s decline of undocumented immigration to the U.S., or the greater number of migrants coming from Asia than from Latin America.Howard Lavine, a professor of political science and psychology at the University of Minnesota, staked out a middle ground, pessimistic in the short term, less so in the long term:Intermarriage \u2014 especially among whites and Hispanics \u2014 may produce a substantial percentage of children (and grandchildren) who identify as white, but I doubt that such predictions will go far in currently assuaging the race-based status threat that many working class-whites feel today, and that Donald Trump exploited so successfully.Over time, however, Lavine argued, as races and cultures become less distinct (more assimilated), Republican voters who are dispositionally intolerant of difference (e.g., authoritarians) will find the political climate less threatening and the category of race per se less politically relevant. Could a more multifaceted narrative than the binary white vs. minority projection into the future lessen the anxiety of some whites? Michael Barber, a political scientist at Brigham Young, doubts it:The actual date at which the U.S. becomes majority-minority is probably irrelevant to the typical Trump voter or Republican in general. My guess is that perceptions matter much more than reality.Their research shows, Barber writes, that partisans have extremely biased perceptions of the \u201cother\u201d party, including survey data showing that people \u201cthink that 32 percent of Democrats are LGBT (vs. 6 percent in reality) and 38 percent of Republicans earn over $250,000 per year (vs. 2 percent in reality).\u201d With this in mind, Barber argued, \u201cit isn\u2019t a stretch to imagine that people think we\u2019re already a majority-minority country when in fact we aren\u2019t at all.\u201dSome of those I contacted suggested that only Trump and his fellow Republicans have the power to change the anti-immigrant, anti-minority tone of the political conversation. Nathan Kalmoe, a political scientist at Louisiana State University, argued, for example, thatPoliticians and other opinion leaders play an important role in helping citizens make sense of the threats and opportunities they face. I expect the views of many white Americans would shift if President Trump and other leaders who deploy ethnonationalist messages collectively changed their tune, at least in terms of attitude intensity and priority.In the highly unlikely event that that happened, \u201cprejudices wouldn\u2019t vanish, but they would be less politically potent for most people.\u201d More realistically, Kalmoe wrote, \u201cas long as prominent leaders continue to mobilize white fear and anger on the issue, citizens who trust them will follow.\u201dFrom a broader perspective, the current majority-minority controversy is a continuation of the never-ending, never-resolved struggle in this country over how to deal with a rapidly transforming multiracial, multiethnic society. Robert Jones, the C.E.O. of the Public Religion Research Institute, put the problem this way in an email:Throughout American history in particular, the question of whiteness has been at the center of these debates, fueled by the fact that social privileges and political rights were tied to whiteness.Historically, this has played out in the practices of the Census Bureau and the Citizenship and Immigration Services that \u201crecorded race and ethnicity categories over time, e.g., \u2018Celt\u2019 and \u2018Hebrew\u2019 once appeared outside of the \u2018Caucasian\u2019 category.\u201d Jones argues thatat the current moment in U.S. history, we actually need the admittedly fictional concept of \u201cwhiteness\u201d to understand recent events that are driven by a motivation to defend a perceived threat to white demographic and cultural dominance: the mass murder of nine worshipers in Charleston by the Confederate flag wielding Dylann Roof, the white supremacists marching in Charlottesville chanting \u201cyou/Jews will not replace us,\u201d and even the unlikely but unflagging support for Donald Trump among white evangelical Protestants nostalgic to resurrect the cultural world of the 1950s.Jones captures the strength of the racial and ethnic divisions that have characterized the nation since its founding:The troubling truth of American history is that it\u2019s precisely the binary understanding of white vs. nonwhite that has been at the center of our bloodiest battles, harshest laws, and fiercest debates. The U.S. social and political landscape would be unrecognizable but for the power of the concept of whiteness.It\u2019s certainly a problem we keep coming up against.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Could Save the Church. Will He? ", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe current crisis could be a chance for him to advance his radical vision and turn a crisis into an opportunity for renewal.Mr. Gibson is the director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University. The Roman Catholic Church\u2019s clergy sex abuse crisis has come roaring back to life as if it were the worst days of 2002, when the scandal tsunami out of Boston seemed to inundate the entire church. It has all landed on the desk of the current pope, and the scandals have the potential to undermine the Francis pontificate. It shouldn\u2019t. Indeed, if Pope Francis lives up to his own words and actions, this could be a chance for him to advance his vision of church reform and turn a long-running crisis into an opportunity for long-term renewal. Only Rome could investigate bishops, they said, and only the pope could punish them. That wasn\u2019t likely. The Vatican under John Paul II was not very keen on the United States hierarchy\u2019s new policy against priests, and the pontiff certainly didn\u2019t want to throw his own bishops under the bus. Now the scandal has even some of John Paul\u2019s staunchest fans questioning the wisdom of his canonization in 2014, and it bedeviled Pope Benedict up to his stunning 2013 resignation. The church, he was saying, had to undergo a moment of kenosis, of self-emptying, like Christ on the cross, surrendering power and prestige and privilege in order to truly become what she is called to be. As pope, he has saved his harshest rhetoric for his fellow clerics, especially the cardinals and bishops, criticizing them as \u201ccareerists\u201d and \u201cairport bishops\u201d who spend more time flying around the world than tending their flock. Pope Francis\u2019 vision of the church is clearly more radical than the defensive posture of John Paul or the nostalgic traditionalism of Benedict. But is he willing and able to implement it? When Archbishop McCarrick was found to have molested minors as well as young men, the pope not only ordered the retired 88-year-old churchman confined to virtual house arrest but also accepted his resignation as a cardinal. These are encouraging steps, but much more is needed: not only the kind of spiritual renewal that Pope Francis demands but also the kind of systematic change that can safeguard children and vulnerable adults, restore some credibility to the institutional church and begin to dismantle the culture of clericalism \u2014 the spiritual elitism of holier-than-thou cliques who cover for one another as they try to run the church. But on the issue of abuse, the Catholic right is often proving to be the pope\u2019s unlikely ally, with many calling for a top-to-bottom overhaul. It\u2019s a simple first step, but even that would have been unthinkable under the ecclesiology of previous pontificates. Now such changes are both unavoidable and integral to the kind of humble, open church that Pope Francis desires. They also work. As soon as a victim reported his allegations against Archbishop McCarrick to the Archdiocese of New York, reportedly late last year, a review board opened an inquiry, and Archbishop McCarrick was removed from ministry. \u201cTest everything; retain what is good,\u201d Saint Paul wrote to the Thessalonians nearly 2,000 years ago. It was good advice for the church back then, and it is even more relevant today.  Advertisement"}

Because of the president\u2019s hyperactive use of his trade authority, the scale of this pain is unusually high. But the reality is that this disregard for the consequences inflicted on buyers in the industries downstream from tariffs is nothing new. In fact, thanks to the handiwork of interest groups who benefit from the tariffs and the politicians who serve them, it\u2019s embedded in our trade system, sometimes even in the legislation itself. Why is such a half-baked justification so easy to spin? In large part, it has to do with the Commerce Department, which is responsible for measuring a given tariff\u2019s impact. A department report on a tariff measures the direct impact on an industry \u2014 say, steel manufacturers \u2014 as well as steel-consuming industries and the economy more broadly. The good news is that there\u2019s an easy fix: Change the statutes so that commissioners are required to consider the effects of trade restrictions on downstream industries and consumers. This cronyism explains how the steel industry is directly involved in deciding which companies do or don\u2019t receive exemptions from the steel tariffs and why so few exemptions have been granted.

The Islamic State\u2019s main concentration is in the south of Nangarhar Province, in eastern Afghanistan, but they had another major group in the northern province of Jowzjan, particularly in Darzab, the district that was Mr. Nemat\u2019s stronghold.Mr. Nemat refused to give details of the fight against the Taliban or to reveal why he had decided to surrender. He was critical of the government, however, saying that the Afghan National Army had promised to send helicopters to evacuate him and his followers, who included 30 women.\u201cIt was an emergency situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were promised choppers around 9 p.m. last night to evacuate us, but unfortunately nothing came.\u201dInstead, the Islamic State fighters fled on foot to government lines, but more could have escaped the Taliban pursuit, Mr. Nemat said. \u201cWe lost contact with the others last night. I think they contacted the Taliban or went somewhere else.\u201dAmong his followers, he said, were about 25 to 30 foreigners, mostly from Central Asian countries, but also two Frenchmen, known only by Arabic pseudonyms, Abu Mohammad and Abu Mariam.In addition to Mr. Nemat, who is also known as Mufti Nematullah Qaweem, the other Islamic State military commander, Maulavi Habib ul-Rahman, surrendered to the Afghan government forces, according to Abdul Hafiz Khashi, the deputy police chief of Jowzjan Province. The two leaders are brothers-in-law.\u201cThe areas the Daeshis controlled were taken by the Taliban,\u201d Mr. Khashi said.The police chief of Darzab, Capt. Mohammad Ismail Mubarez, said the Taliban had forced the Islamic State fighters to surrender to the government side. \u201cTwo hundred of them surrendered,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came at four in the morning with their weapons.\u201dAccording to Maulavi Abdulhai Hayat, head of the Jowzjan provincial council\u2019s security committee, about 2,000 Taliban militants recently gathered in Jowzjan from as far away as Helmand Province in the south, with the aim of destroying the Islamic State. While both the government and the Taliban wanted to stop the Islamic State in the north, there was little sign of cooperation between them in the recent battle, he said.After a month of heavy fighting in the area, the Islamic State fighters suffered 100 fatalities and were pinned down to two villages in Darzab, and when the final battle began two days ago, those militants offered to surrender to the government, Mr. Hayat said.To facilitate that, government forces then bombed Taliban positions to prevent them from capturing all of the Islamic State fighters themselves, he added.Mr. Nemat suggested in the interview on Wednesday that he might be ready to switch sides again. \u201cIf you\u2019ll remember,\u201d he said, \u201cin the past I brought 200 of my men and joined the government.\u201dFor the time being, however, Afghan officials said that Mr. Nemat and his followers were prisoners, not allies. After switching allegiance to the Islamic State, many of them boasted of engaging in acts of extreme barbarism that are that organization\u2019s calling card, such as beheadings and the use of child soldiers.Residents of Darzab traveled to the Jowzjan provincial capital, Sheberghan, to petition the governor to punish the Islamic State prisoners for the crimes they committed while in control of their area, according to local officials.Najim Rahim reported from Mazar-i-Sharif, and Rod Nordland from Kabul, Afghanistan.

Usually, he found politics distasteful. \u201cFolks who know me know that I\u2019m not exactly a political person,\u201d Mr. Thompson told the crowd of roughly 150 people gathered on the Bowery Hotel\u2019s rooftop for the Aug. 1 event.\u201cPolls are not capturing who the new electorate is,\u201d Ms. Nixon said. \u201cWe have a younger, more progressive, more diverse electorate. Those are the people that are going to turn out for me.\u201dL. Joy Williams, a senior adviser to the campaign, described the approach as seeking out the voters that most campaigns left \u201con the table.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten people who say, \u2018No one has ever knocked on my door for a campaign,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s really engaging those pockets all across the state that exist, engaging them because no one has ever engaged them in a real discussion.\u201dDismissing the polls in favor of anecdotes about \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cexcitement\u201d may seem like at best an excuse and at worst a delusion for a candidate who is 30 points behind. Ms. Nixon herself has acknowledged her path to victory is narrow. But there are reasons to not completely discount her approach.Much of the campaign\u2019s attempts to woo disengaged voters has unfolded digitally. The campaign has blasted registered Democrats with text messages and recruited longtime Instagram followers for canvassing shifts.Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign page has run more than twice as many Facebook advertisements as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s has since May, according to the social media site\u2019s political advertisements archive, although the governor\u2019s team said those numbers did not account for how many people actually saw each post. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, has lavished $5 million on television advertisements in the last month alone \u2014 more than twice the total amount of money Ms. Nixon has raised overall.\u201cYou don\u2019t approach them by putting up TV ads on \u2018Jeopardy,\u2019\u201d Christine Marinoni, Ms. Nixon\u2019s wife, said of the Nixon campaign\u2019s target voters. Ms. Marinoni, a former education organizer, has played a key role in shaping the campaign\u2019s outreach efforts. \u201cThey\u2019re online 24-7, and they\u2019re on in a very specific way, and you have to be smart about how to find them.\u201dAt the Bowery Hotel event, when Jumaane D. Williams, Ms. Nixon\u2019s chosen candidate for lieutenant governor, asked the crowd \u2014 mostly millennials, many nonwhite \u2014 if any had received a call from Siena, the college that conducted several of the recent polls, no one raised a hand. Few seemed to understand what or who Siena was.But there is also reason to be skeptical of the campaign\u2019s optimism. While Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign, with its potent blend of celebrity and \u201cblue wave\u201d rhetoric, has attracted an unusual amount of attention for a rookie candidacy, much of that attention may not translate into ballots.Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign has boasted of a record number of individual contributions, but nearly half of her donors do not live in New York State, according to campaign finance filings. One attendee at the Bowery Hotel said Ms. Nixon had helped inspire her to pay more attention to politics, but noted that she was a Canadian citizen. One of the event\u2019s hosts, Shariffa Ali, said she had just received her artist\u2019s visa as an immigrant from Kenya.Other candidates around the country have cited Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win as a blueprint for their own campaigns, but few have matched her success, despite also promising to engage new voters.And the progressive blocs that Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign has declared will drive her to victory are not united in their support. After the national progressive group Indivisible endorsed Ms. Nixon, several local branches issued an open letter of dissent: In their Facebook groups, members worried about Ms. Nixon\u2019s lack of governing experience. Prominent women\u2019s and gay rights groups have backed Mr. Cuomo.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to fish where the fish are,\u201d said Peter Warren, acting chairman of the Albany chapter, of Ms. Nixon\u2019s perceived focus on voter-dense New York City. But as a result, he said, \u201cthe interest was not red-hot\u201d in issuing an endorsement.The criticism that Ms. Nixon has focused too much on city dwellers is a common one, albeit one her team dismissed, citing visits to Syracuse to discuss immigration policy and to Hoosick Falls on environmental issues.Ms. Nixon may also benefit from voters who are not so much pro-Nixon as anti-Cuomo, as the governor\u2019s gun control policies have made him deeply unpopular in rural areas, including among Democrats. Although Ms. Nixon largely shares Mr. Cuomo\u2019s views on gun control and has called for further restrictions, the Siena polls have consistently shown her with more support upstate than downstate.That diverse amalgam of New Yorkers \u2014 those tired of Mr. Cuomo, those who have never heard from Mr. Cuomo, those thrilled about Ms. Nixon \u2014 is who Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign is relying on next month. \u201cTo a certain extent, the larger conversation on who the typical voter is for the campaign, is sort of an outdated model,\u201d Ms. Williams said.But no matter the mold of voter, first they will have to turn out. Ms. Ali, one of the hosts of the Bowery hotel fund-raiser, acknowledged that one event might not be enough to drive her friends to the polls.\u201cI think there were some people who were there that night who were like, \u2018Hm, O.K., I\u2019m here for Shariffa. I\u2019m here to support my friend. And it also happens to be a Cynthia Nixon event,\u2019\u201d she said.But even if they did not end up voting for Ms. Nixon \u2014 as Ms. Ali, here on an artist\u2019s visa, would not be able to do \u2014 she was excited about the potential to start a political conversation.\u201cLike many of my peers, I\u2019d been sort of apathetic in the sense that I actually have no sway,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cNow that I know this is possible, and I do have some kind of influence, I would like to try and see how many more young people I can encourage to get involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Militarization is not the answer.Dr. Chavez is a political scientist who focuses on democracy, the rule of law, and security in Latin America and the Caribbean.As James Mattis embarks on his first trip to South America as secretary of defense, he has the opportunity to declare United States support for police and judicial reform as the best method to fight crime and violence. It is the perfect time to highlight the dangers of militarization; three of the four countries on the secretary\u2019s itinerary \u2014 Brazil, Argentina and Colombia \u2014 have to varying degrees turned to their armed forces for domestic security. Unfortunately, as we\u2019ve seen in Mexico, reliance on the military jeopardizes the protection of human rights and can actually exacerbate citizen insecurity. Mexico\u2019s track record reveals another important danger: Once a country starts down the path toward militarization, it is difficult to change course. Both Mexico and Colombia illustrate that reliance on the military weakens the incentive to strengthen the police. When Calder\u00f3n deployed the military 12 years ago, it was meant to be short term. Last year, however, Mexico passed an Internal Security Law that institutionalizes the domestic role of the military, further normalizing and prolonging militarization.In his bilateral meetings and public remarks, Secretary Mattis should emphasize United States support for overhauling law enforcement and strengthening the criminal justice system to address the impunity that plagues much of Latin America. Until nations have the institutional capacity to hold criminals accountable for their actions, citizen security is impossible. And only after the police have the ability and incentives to meet their legal responsibility of providing public security will governments relieve the military of the internal security mission. Rebecca Bill Chavez served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Western Hemisphere affairs from 2013 until 2017.

Recently, a writer\u2019s casual online search for one of his own ancestors accidentally led to a wealth of unknown documentation of Hughes\u2019s early life, including evidence of a different birth year. Hughes, the story has long gone, was born near midnight on Feb. 1, 1902, in Joplin, Mo.Mr. McHenry was having dinner with a fellow poet who also grew up in Topeka. Both had ancestors who had been active in populist state politics in the late 19th century, and they wondered if the two men had known each other.\u201cI was just bouncing from name to name,\u201d he said.It was from Dec. 20, 1901 \u2014 the year before Hughes, who spent his early years in Topeka and Lawrence, Kan., was supposedly born.\u201cI was wondering if I should wake up my wife to tell her,\u201d Mr. McHenry recalled. \u201cI really struggled to fall asleep.\u201d It was possible that the item referred to another person with the same name. But the next morning, Mr. McHenry did a more targeted search, and found an item from May 17, 1901, listing some recent visitors to town, including \u201cMrs. Carrie Hughes and little son Langston,\u201d who had been on their way to Buffalo: Hughes\u2019s mother\u2019s name was Carrie. And biographers had already established that James Hughes, Langston\u2019s father, who had left the family shortly after his son\u2019s birth, was living in Buffalo. \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought, \u2018I got it, it has to be the same Langston Hughes,\u2019\u201d Mr. McHenry said.He later then found a third item, from Jan. 17, 1902, referring to a visit by \u201cMrs. C.M. Hugnes and son.\u201d (Yes, early newspapers had a lot of typos.) That gave him a total of three references to Hughes before his supposed Feb. 1, 1902, birthday. Mr. McHenry, who freely admits he is not a Hughes expert, shared his finds with Hughes scholars in Kansas and beyond. Mr. McHenry also contacted Dr. Rampersad, a retired professor at Stanford, who called the newly unearthed evidence compelling, even if it doesn\u2019t upend our understanding of Hughes.\u201cIt is on the one hand unimportant, but on the other hand quite important,\u201d said Mr. Rampersad, whose own research was done well before the era of digitization. \u201cYou want to know when your subject was born.\u201dHughes was born into a distinguished family. His grandmother\u2019s first husband was a comrade of John Brown and died in the 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry. One of his great-uncles was the first black congressman from Virginia.His mother, Carrie, worked for a time as a traveling agent for The Plaindealer. As with many newspapers at the time, its society page served as a kind of proto-Facebook, chronicling the minutest doings of a community that was often ignored by the white press.\u201cDo you want to know where your friends are, who they visit, what they are doing? What the race is doing in general? Read the Plaindealer,\u201d went a sales pitch just below the first item Mr. McHenry found. So far, Mr. McHenry has discovered more than a dozen published references to Hughes from his infant and toddler years. One item from 1907 reported that he had injured himself falling into a rosebush; a week later, another noted that he was better.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that many other major literary figures got into the paper so frequently before they were even school-age,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.Initially, Mr. McHenry wondered if Hughes\u2019s mother, who sent him to the white elementary school in Topeka, rather than the \u201ccolored\u201d school across the tracks, hadn\u2019t waited an extra year to enroll him in first grade, to provide some protection against racism. \u201cMaybe his mother deemed it advantageous for him to be older, and for them not to know,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.Even if the change in Hughes\u2019s birth year came from his mother, \u201csuch reinvention does connect with other kinds of black improvisation,\u201d Mr. Young said.So will the birth year on the mosaic at the Schomburg itself need revising? Not necessarily, Mr. Young said. \u201cI keep thinking about how the archive is still alive,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning things about people we already know a lot about.\u201d An earlier version of this article misstated Langston Hughes's possible ages at the time of his birthday in 1991. He would have been 89 or 90, not 79 or 80. An earlier version of this article also misstated the month of Louis Armstrong's birth date, as listed in Baptismal records.

{"Headline": "Katie Cannon, 68, Dies; Lifted Black Women\u2019s Perspective in Theology", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rev. Dr. Katie Cannon, the first black woman to be ordained in a leading branch of Presbyterianism and a groundbreaking scholar who helped elevate the perspective of black women in church and academic thought, died on Wednesday in Richmond, Va. She was 68.Dr. Cannon was a foundational voice in womanist theology, which seeks to escape the white- and male-centered views of religion and ethics and to value the experiences and insights of black women in those areas.In her teaching, at various seminaries and divinity schools and in books like \u201cBlack Womanist Ethics\u201d (1988) and \u201cKatie\u2019s Canon: Womanism and the Soul of the Black Community\u201d (1995), she pushed to broaden the definitions and frames of reference underlying religious and ethical thought.\u201cWhat Cannon launched insists that God\u2019s creation is much larger and more diverse when we listen to and learn from the moral wisdom found in the everyday lives of Black women,\u201d the Rev. Dr. Emilie M. Townes, dean of the Divinity School at Vanderbilt University, wrote in an email. \u201cHer insistence that we listen and learn also helped give other groups who had been left out of scholarship or ministry a way to claim their space under the sun.\u201dKatie Geneva Cannon was born on Jan. 3, 1950, in Kannapolis, N.C. Her father, Esau, and mother, Emanuelette Corine Lytle Cannon, were both ruling elders in the Presbyterian Church but enrolled her in a kindergarten class at a Lutheran church, the only early childhood education available to black girls in Kannapolis, Dr. Cannon said.\u201cBy 5,\u201d she told The Presbyterian Outlook earlier this year, \u201cI could recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the Beatitudes, Psalm 23, the Ten Commandments and answers to catechism questions, such as \u2018Who is God?\u2019 and \u2018Why did God make us?\u2019 \u201dBut even at that young age she recognized a disconnect between much of the Christian message and the heavily segregated world in which she lived.\u201cIt was against the law to go to the library,\u201d Dr. Cannon told The Charlotte Observer in 2005. \u201cI couldn\u2019t play on that swing. By 4 or 5, I was wondering: \u2018What did we do as black people that was so bad? A good God would not do this.\u2019 \u201dAs a girl she worked alongside an aunt cleaning and cooking in a white family\u2019s home, the best job she or her aunt could hope for at the time. In 1963 she heard the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech on television, but those stirring words did not alter her day-to-day reality.\u201cI really thought we were going to be free,\u201d she said. \u201cBut nothing really changed.\u201dShe came to see education as her only way out of a limited life. Graduating from Barber-Scotia College in Concord, N.C., in 1971, with a degree in education, she enrolled at the Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary at the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta.The typical course of study for a woman at the center at that time led to a master\u2019s degree in Christian education, but instead she pursued a master of divinity degree.She earned her master of divinity degree in 1974 and became the first black woman to be ordained in the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, a branch of the church that has since merged into the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).She continued her education at the Union Theological Seminary in New York, earning a doctor of philosophy degree there in 1983. It was a period of intellectual ferment at the seminary, and Dr. Cannon was very much a part of that, bringing an academic\u2019s rigor to the questions she had first asked herself as a child and finding that much of what was heard in churches, including from black male ministers, marginalized the experience and wisdom of black women.\u201cThe number of Black women seminarians and doctoral students reached a critical mass and began to insist that the religious worldviews and insights of Black women were important to the life of the church and the health of the academy,\u201d Dr. Townes wrote in her email. \u201cAs a Christian ethicist, Katie Geneva Cannon centered Black women\u2019s voices and experiences in her scholarship and her commitment to the church to broaden and deepen the rich resources found outside of a White, male-centered canon.\u201dDr. Townes and Dr. Cannon together edited \u201cWomanist Theological Ethics: A Reader\u201d (2011).Womanism \u2014 a term generally attributed to the novelist and poet Alice Walker \u2014 examines the intersection of feminism, racial identity and more, finding points of both commonality and conflict. In just one example of how Dr. Cannon applied a womanist approach to theology, she wrote of how the Christian idea of suffering was usually defined from the perspective of a white and male dominant class, which, with a comfortable existence, could view it as a choice.\u201cIn dominant ethics a person is free to make suffering a desirable moral norm,\u201d she wrote in \u201cBlack Womanist Ethics.\u201d \u201cThis is not so for Blacks. For the masses of Black people, suffering is the normal state of affairs.\u201dDuring her career Dr. Cannon was on the faculties of Temple University, Episcopal Divinity School and Harvard Divinity School.She is survived by her mother; three sisters, Sara Cannon Fleming, Doris Cannon Love and Sylvia Moon; and two brothers, John and Jerry.In the tribute video made for her education award, Dawn DeVries, one of her fellow professors at Union Presbyterian Seminary, said Dr. Cannon had a rare distinction.\u201cShe literally I think started a branch of theology that didn\u2019t exist before she started doing theology,\u201d Dr. DeVries said. \u201cNot many of us are going to be able to say that at the end of our careers.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was an association of countries with shared interests, institutions and values \u2014 particularly the values of liberty, democracy, free markets and the rule of law \u2014 which made the post-World War II world, though far from perfect, a steadily more prosperous, free and decent place for more and more people. This community of democracies was also a beacon, a refuge and a magnet for those who wanted to embrace its values but were denied them where they lived.Toppling Qaddafi without building a new order may go down as the single dumbest action the NATO alliance ever took.Democracy was never the dominant driver of the uprising against Qaddafi. It was much more a revolt by anti-Qaddafi tribes in eastern Libya. But when you just let a tribal revolt rage in a country with few real institutions, you end up with what you have in Libya today: multiple tribes and militias all competing for power and control of oil, creating vast zones of disorder, which both African and Arab refugees and economic migrants can take advantage of to reach the Libyan coastline to try to catch a human trafficking boat to Italy.In 2017, the biggest migrant groups to arrive in Italy mostly via Libya were from Nigeria, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Bangladesh and Eritrea.An Italian official expressed great disgust to me over the fact that Italy\u2019s economy has lost hundreds of millions of euros by participating in E.U. sanctions on Russia \u2014 to help deter Russia from encroaching on Central Europe \u2014 while Central European E.U. countries, like Hungary, have refused to take a single one of the migrants who have sailed to Italy\u2019s shores. Italy has the anti-immigrant government it has, an Italian refugee expert explained, because the world and the rest of the E.U. \u201cturned its back on Italy,\u201d where unassimilated migrants are now visible in the streets, squares and train stations. \u201cThere have to be shared E.U. migration quotas,\u201d he added, consistent E.U. \u201clegal pathways\u201d for immigration and a strategy to improve effective and accountable governance in Africa, not just paying off warlords there to collar refugees. \u201cThe movement of people will happen,\u201d said another Italian official. \u201cThe question is: Do we manage it or not?\u201dThat\u2019s for sure. The total population of Europe/Russia today is about 740 million people, according to the United Nations, and Africa\u2019s is 1.2 billion. By 2050, Europe-Russia will shrink to around 700 million and Africa will double to 2.4 billion. If disorder spreads in Africa, the current crisis will seem tame and manageable by comparison.In March, Italy\u2019s annual security report warned of foreign online \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d in its elections then. The vote brought to power the most pro-Putin, anti-immigrant, anti-E.U. coalition ever to rule Italy: the League and the Five-Star Movement. Trump actually pressed British Prime Minister Theresa May to make a sharp Brexit from the E.U., if she wanted to have a free-trade agreement with the U.S., and he characterized the E.U. not as a partner on trade but as a \u201cfoe.\u201d Trump seems to prefer that the E.U. fracture so he can try to strike better trade deals with the countries individually. How else to explain these irrational moves?One of the first foreign visitors to come to Italy to high-five its new government of Euro- and NATO-skeptics and anti-immigrant populists was Trump\u2019s former brain, Steve Bannon, who reportedly said of the ruling coalition: \u201cIf it works in Italy, it is going to work everywhere. \u2026 It is going to break the backs of the globalists.\u201dThis is such foolish talk. It was the U.S. and what became the E.U. that took the lead in not only repelling communism but in shaping the rules and catalyzing institutions that managed the key global issues after W.W. II \u2014 like trade, migration, environment and human rights \u2014 helping more people around the globe grow out of poverty faster than ever before. We need the U.S. and the E.U. \u2014 joined by the other Group of 20 nations \u2014 to play a similar role today. The change in the pace of change in the climate, globalization and technology has thrown up a whole set of new challenges very fast \u2014 extreme weather, cybercrime, crypto-currencies, social networks, deepfake technologies, self-driving vehicles, artificial intelligence, biological design tools and questions of how to distinguish among refugees, economic migrants and asylum seekers. These can be managed only through global cooperation and new rules. If the community of democracies fractures, and we return to a more 19th- and 20th-century great power competition, who will write the new rules for the 21st century? Who will help Libya or the struggling countries of sub-Saharan Africa create governance and nurture their human capital to escape disorder, so their people don\u2019t feel the need to emigrate to survive or thrive. Russia? China? I don\u2019t think so. There will be a global leadership vacuum, a free-for-all, with terrible consequences. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How FireEye Helped Facebook Spot a Disinformation Campaign", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 FireEye, a cybersecurity company that has been involved in a number of prominent investigations, including the 2016 attack on the Democratic National Committee, alerted Facebook in July that it had a problem.Security analysts at the company noticed a cluster of inauthentic accounts and pages on Facebook that were sharing content from a site called Liberty Front Press. It looked like a news site, but most of its content was stolen from outlets like Politico and CNN. The small amount of original material was written in choppy English.Facebook\u2019s latest purge of disinformation from its platforms highlighted the key role that cybersecurity outfits are playing in policing the pages of giant social media platforms. For all of their wealth and well-staffed security teams, companies like Facebook often rely on outside firms and researchers for their expertise.The discovery of the disinformation campaign also represented a shift in the bad behavior that independent security companies are on the lookout for. Long in the business of discovering and fending off hacking attempts and all sorts of malware, security companies have expanded their focus to the disinformation campaigns that have plagued Facebook and other social media for the past few years.Founded in 2004 in Milpitas, Calif., FireEye has a work force of about 3,000 people, a fraction of Facebook\u2019s. But it employs security analysts with particular skills, including employees who are fluent in English, Arabic, Russian, French and Italian, helping them to identify and track misinformation around the world.Lee Foster, the manager of FireEye\u2019s information operations analysis team, described in an interview with The New York Times how his company spotted the Iranian disinformation campaign. He declined to say whether his research into the Iranian campaign was on behalf of a particular client because FireEye has a policy against naming who it is working with.\u201cIt started with a single social media account or a small set of accounts that were pushing this political-themed content that didn\u2019t necessarily seem in line with the personas that the accounts had adopted,\u201d said Mr. Foster. Many of the fake accounts, which sprawled across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, shared content from Liberty Front Press.Over two months, Mr. Foster and a small group of analysts mapped the connections between the accounts and unearthed more of them.The evidence pointed toward Iran. A website for Liberty Front Press was initially registered to an email linked to ads for web designers in Tehran before being switched to a registrant purportedly based in San Jose, Calif.The web designer email had also been used to register another news site. That site, in turn, was associated with a number of email addresses linked to even more inauthentic news sites. Digging deeper, FireEye found that many of the Twitter accounts sharing Liberty Front Press content were linked to Iranian phone numbers, although the profiles claimed to be operating in the United States.Stepping from fake news site to news site and from Twitter to Facebook, FireEye pieced together a campaign that tried to influence audiences in the Middle East, as well as in the United States, Britain and Latin America.The analysts were careful to collect data without being noticed. \u201cI have to be conscious about tipping off the operators of this,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cI want to make sure I\u2019ve got everything, so we don\u2019t deal with one small component of the threat and we find out there\u2019s this whole other cluster of it.\u201dThose loose affiliations make it difficult to pinpoint which attacks are directed by Iranian authorities.FireEye\u2019s information set off Facebook\u2019s own investigation, which uncovered three other Iranian disinformation efforts and another that appeared to originate in Russia.\u201cThey typically posed as news organizations and didn\u2019t reveal their true identity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also engaged in traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack people\u2019s accounts and spread malware, which we had seen before and disrupted.\u201dThe Russian pages discovered by Facebook were unrelated to FireEye\u2019s research. Facebook said the accounts were linked to people that law enforcement in the United States had identified as Russian military intelligence. Unlike other fake pages that have been attributed to Russians over the last year, those accounts posted content focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine.FireEye\u2019s information operations analysis team was formed in 2016, when hacked emails from several political figures were beginning to appear on the site DCLeaks. \u201cAll through that period, we were tracking the Russian effort to influence U.S. elections,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cObviously, social media is a very important kind of medium by which these campaigns are undertaken.\u201dMr. Foster had been tracking influence campaigns long before they became a major narrative in American politics. He previously worked at iSight Partners, a cyberintelligence firm acquired by FireEye in January 2016, where he tracked so-called hacktivist groups like Anonymous.An attack on Sony\u2019s computer network by North Korean hackers in 2014 put cybersecurity companies on notice that they had to pay more attention to information warfare. The Sony intrusion was destructive to technical systems, \u201cbut there was more to it than that,\u201d Mr. Foster said. \u201cIt was about conveying a message and trying to influence an audience.\u201dIn time, \u201cwe realized there was a bigger kind of potential threat there that we need to address,\u201d he added.The Sony attack was also a game changer for governments and other major companies, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, which has analyzed misinformation on Facebook. Thousands of embarrassing emails between Sony executives were dumped online. The hackers also stole employees\u2019 personal information, including Social Security numbers, and wiped Sony\u2019s servers.The incident prompted officials in the United States to establish protocols for sharing information about cybersecurity threats and influence operations, Mr. Brookie said.But information sharing still seems to have its limits.Unlike Facebook, Twitter did not receive advance notice from FireEye about the fake Twitter profiles the security company had uncovered. Several of them were still live Tuesday night, hours after Facebook\u2019s announcement. Twitter has since suspended 284 accounts based on the information revealed by Facebook and FireEye, the company said in a tweet.As internet outlets struggle to keep up with influence campaigns, Mr. Foster believes complex disinformation schemes will become more common.\u201cWhat this is great for demonstrating is, it really doesn\u2019t matter what the political goals or ideological goals are, these techniques are seen as an attractive way to try to achieve them,\u201d Mr. Foster said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Was It Illegal for Trump to Revoke Brennan\u2019s Security Clearance?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president not only violated the former C.I.A. director\u2019s First Amendment rights but also made it harder for the government to draw on his expertise.Mr. Smith is a former general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency.President Trump\u2019s unprecedented decision to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency \u2014 and his publicly stated intention to consider revoking clearances of a list of other administration critics \u2014 raises fundamental questions about national security, presidential authority and the First Amendment. I believe the president has grossly abused his authority and violated Mr. Brennan\u2019s First Amendment right to speak freely. The president\u2019s actions are therefore unconstitutional and demand a response from Congress.Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan foresaw the risks of unconstrained presidential authority over classified information and security clearances. In 1997 he led a commission that recommended, among other things, that Congress enact a statutory basis for the system, to ensure that information was classified only for genuine national security reasons and to provide due process for those who were not granted a clearance or had their clearance revoked. Many of the recommendations were adopted, but Congress chose not to enact a statute.Should the president revoke the former officials\u2019 clearances merely because he doesn\u2019t like what they say about him or his policies, they may suffer financially, but our national security will suffer more by the inability of the government and the private sector to draw upon their decades of experience and distinguished service. The classification and clearance system was established by executive orders and various implementing regulations. The system is designed to ensure that information is classified properly and that the process for granting and revoking clearances is fair, including a right to appeal in case of a revocation. But nowhere in these foundational documents is authority to revoke a clearance because the individual exercised his or her First Amendment rights.Obviously the president needs to be able to revoke security clearances, when justified: The First Amendment does not protect an individual holding a clearance who discloses properly classified information without authorization \u2014 even if done in the course of criticizing the president or his policies. Mr. Trump\u2019s statement justifying his revocation of Mr. Brennan\u2019s clearance makes no such allegation. It is hard to conclude that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are anything other than a \u201csanction\u201d to punish and intimidate Mr. Brennan and others who dare to speak out. Fear of the state\u2019s unconstrained power is what Vladimir Putin and other autocrats use to govern. But fear is no way to govern a democracy. Because the individual agencies grant and \u201chold\u201d the clearances of the former officers, the president\u2019s statement directs the agencies to \u201cimplement this determination.\u201d Before carrying out his order, the agencies should seek the advice of the Department of Justice as to whether the president\u2019s direction is consistent with the First Amendment. At the same time, Congress should look at Senator Moynihan\u2019s recommendations and enact those that are necessary, particularly to protect against future abusive conduct by a president. Congress should leave the standards for classifying and declassifying with the president, but should enact a statute providing that the president cannot classify information for any reason other than the protection of national security. Also, as recommended by Senator Moynihan, Congress should establish an independent executive branch office to oversee the revocation of clearances that assures due process to individuals.I do not know whether Mr. Brennan or others who may have their security clearance revoked by the president will choose to litigate. But if they do, it will be up to the courts to decide whether the First Amendment still matters in the age of Trump.Jeffrey H. Smith, senior counsel at the law firm Arnold & Porter, served as the general counsel of the C.I.A. from 1994 to 1995.An earlier version of this article misstated the year of a Supreme Court case regarding the president's power over security clearances.

{"Headline": "Designing the Death of a Plastic", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "Decades ago, synthetic polymers became popular because they were cheap and durable. Now, scientists are creating material that self-destructs or breaks down for reuse on command. Supported byThe plastic did not simply melt. Its building blocks, the synthetic polymers within, had reverted to their molecular units. \u201cIt was a phenomenal feeling,\u201d he said of the successful experiment.Most synthetic polymers \u2014 Greek for \u201cmany parts,\u201d because they are long chains of many identical molecules \u2014 were not designed to disintegrate or disappear. On the contrary, they were meant to last as long as possible once they began replacing metals and glass in long-lasting things like automobiles and airplanes. The environmental effects of plastic buildup and the declining popularity of plastics have helped to spur chemists on a quest to make new materials with two conflicting requirements: They must be durable, but degradable on command. In short, scientists are in search of polymers or plastics with a built-in self-destruct mechanism. \u201cIt\u2019s two diametrically opposed criteria that we\u2019re trying to juggle,\u201d Dr. Feinberg said. It\u2019s easier to mold a robust plastic without destroying it, he says, but at the same time, it should not last forever. While not a silver bullet for the problem of plastic waste, self-destructing plastics could also enable new applications in drug delivery, self-healing materials and even some electronics. The starting point requires picking polymers that are inherently unstable, and often historically overlooked because of their fragility. Given a choice, their units would rather stay as small molecules. What scientists do is force those molecules to link up into long chains, and then trap the resulting polymers. \u201cAs soon as you start the process,\u201d explains Jeffrey Moore, Dr. Feinberg\u2019s supervisor at the University of Illinois, \u201cthey just keep going.\u201d Dr. Feinberg\u2019s polymers were imprisoned in circular loops instead of being open-ended chains. By themselves, the loops were stable. For the self-destructing plastic, Dr. Feinberg mixed the polymers with a little bit of yellow, light-sensitive dye. When light shines on the plastic, the energized dye molecules rip electrons out from the polymers. The loops break, exposing the polymer ends, and the polymers unzip.Other scientists trap their polymers by capping the ends of the long chains or linking the chains together into networks. By designing these traps to fail upon meeting certain triggers like light or acid, scientists can control exactly how and when their polymers unzip. In theory, these next-generation polymers could help mitigate pollution problems associated with plastic products. If the units were collected after unzipping to make new polymers, that would lead to chemical recycling. Most recycling done today simply involves melting the plastic and remolding it. \u201cIn my view it has great potential, the problem is to make it cheap enough and to make the properties competitive enough to be useful and have market penetration for the consumer,\u201d Dr. Hillmyer said.Instead, scientists like Dr. Hillmyer are focusing their attention on higher-value materials like the polyurethane foams commonly found in mattresses and car seats. In 2016, Dr. Hillmyer and his team made a polyurethane from unzipping polymers that was chemically recyclable. Molecular units derived from sugar linked up to make the polymers, which then cross-linked into polyurethane networks. The foam remains stable at room temperature but unzips into units if heated above 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Having unzipping polymers and fully recyclable products is a step forward, but consumers still have to do their recycling right. \u201cPollution exists because the material wasn\u2019t collected,\u201d says Steve Alexander who leads the Association of Plastic Recyclers. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sort properly, no matter what it is, it is just trash.\u201d Collection and sorting remain the biggest problems for recyclers today, he says. The key, says Ramani Narayan, a polymer chemist at Michigan State University, is to have clear, well-defined disposal environments for any object that\u2019s reached its end-of-life.Arguably, he says, biodegradable plastics also have a self-destruct mechanism, provided they end up in the right place with the right microbes. But they\u2019ve suffered from years of false advertising and consumer confusion. For that, Dr. Narayan is leading a push toward compostable plastics, starting with disposable utensils and food packaging from his spinoff company Natur-Tec. Compost could divert not only single-use plastics associated with food, but also food waste. \u201cBy using the word \u2018compostable,\u2019 it defines the environment,\u201d he says, and that, for consumers trying to pick the right bin, is \u201ccritical.\u201dBeyond recycling, unzipping polymers can enable new applications ranging from drug delivery to materials that automatically heal themselves, Dr. Moore said. For these applications, the units must be safe and benign. A potential candidate is glyoxylate, says Dr. Gillies, which is a molecule that occurs naturally in soil microorganisms. Dr. Gillies\u2019 team made unzipping polymers from glyoxylate units and put different caps on them so that they could be deployed in many different scenarios. \u201cWe have a universal backbone and we can just change the end cap to make it responsive to different things,\u201d says Dr. Gillies, like light in the fields or a low oxygen environment in tumors.For Dr. Moore, the goal is to make materials that can heal themselves. \u201cWe want our materials to be able to recover from damage and maintain performance over long periods of time,\u201d he says. While waiting for these next-generation polymers to appear, current commercial plastics are still being pumped out on the scale of 400 million metric tons a year. And those plastics were intended to be as strong, as robust and to last as long as possible, says Dr. Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a holy grail challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revealing the Lives of Black Fathers", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRace StoriesWhen Robyn Price Pierre walked down the street with her husband and newborn baby, she often noticed the curious stares and smiles her spouse received from strangers as he pushed his daughter\u2019s stroller. She soon realized why: It was the surprise of passers-by encountering a scene that\u2019s mostly invisible in mainstream culture \u2014 a black man as a devoted parent.To find her subjects, Ms. Price Pierre, along with her husband and Francesca Epps, the project\u2019s director of production, looked to their family, classmates, friends and social media contacts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to go far to secure over 400 pages of content,\u201d Ms. Price Pierre wrote. \u201cSo the fact that these men are absent in mainstream media and the broader culture says more about who is at the helm of these media companies.\u201dThe book, which includes short texts by some of the fathers and an introduction by the writer and educator Jelani Cobb, explores the many facets of its subjects\u2019 lives: Eric, protectively embracing his children, expresses joy knowing that he helped his children become \u201csensitive, caring, empathetic, thoughtful human beings\u201d; Darnell, posing with his son on his birthday, proudly wears a Superman T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cPapa\u201d; Jermaine, fearful of \u201cmessing up,\u201d dotes on his daughter; and Pernell, walking hand in hand with his child, affirms that raising \u201ca young lady is not the sole responsibility of the mother.\u201d The myths of black fatherhood as dysfunctional or failed prevail despite ample evidence to the contrary. A 2013 survey by the National Center for Health Statistics affirmed that African-American fathers were just as, and by many measures more, responsible care givers than men of any other racial group. Yet, rarely do the findings of these studies \u2014 or the reality of the full and rich lives represented in \u201cFathers\u201d \u2014 appear in mainstream portrayals of African-American men.Ms. Price Pierre, who is also working on a book about the legacy of violence in the United States, said that this inability to acknowledge the humanity of black men ultimately endangers them. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t see someone\u2019s humanity, it allows you to do very unconscionable, and often violent things to them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt allows you to separate children from parents and put them in cages; it allows trained officers to use excessive force that often leads to death; it allows a vigilante to kill an unarmed young boy wearing a hooded sweatshirt, denying him a future that may have included the rite of passage into fatherhood; and it allows regular citizens to stay silent and therefore complicit in all of it.\u201d\u201cFathers\u201d is among a number of recent projects devoted to honestly portraying black masculinity and fatherhood \u2014 including Zun Lee\u2019s powerful photo book, \u201cFather Figure: Exploring Alternative Notions of Black Fatherhood\u201d (2014) and Barry Jenkins\u2019s Academy Award winning film, \u201cMoonlight\u201d (2016), a tender coming-of-age drama and lyrical meditation on masculinity. In the end, these works exchange mainstream culture\u2019s simplified and fearful view of black life with rich and complex depictions meant to inspire, empower and educate. Ms. Price Pierre says that as she worked on the book, her understanding of its nuanced representations of black fatherhood became more salient and urgent. In the end, \u201cFathers\u201d does more than challenge a troubled present. It imagines a more just and dynamic future, one liberated from damaging stereotypes and misconceptions.\u201cUltimately, I began to understand \u2018Fathers\u2019 in a different way,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt began to feel almost like an archival project \u2014 the archiving of our humanity. Because when future generations, or civilizations look back, if they look at our media, our newspapers, what will they know of us? Will they know that we, black folks, black fathers in this case, lived and loved?\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

I\u2019m also close to his daughter Meghan. This is the compliment he once gave me. This is what I said back. I voted for him this many times. I agreed with him on these issues but not those. It\u2019s difficult to describe how pained I am. Here\u2019s a photo of me looking mournful.Were these hymns to McCain or arias of self-congratulation? The line blurred as the focus swerved from the celebrated to the celebrator.A measure of this is inevitable and even right. One of the best ways to convey someone\u2019s impact on the world is to demonstrate and universalize his or her effect on us, and our own stories and memories are our inimitable additions to the conversation. But a little of the first-person singular goes a long way.The rest of us have neither the megaphones nor megalomania of Trump and Madonna, but we have some of the same impulses when weighing in on famous people\u2019s deaths. We find the one point where we intersected with them. We wedge in our own biographies. We flaunt our own r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.We assert our character through our grief \u2014 or our lack of it. (No shortage of cranks on Twitter deemed this past weekend an appropriate occasion to revel in their distaste for McCain.) It\u2019s classic virtue signaling, gauchely timed and in need of a more specific phrase. Virtue grieving? Obituary opportunism? To wade through reactions to the losses of McCain, Franklin and other public figures who have died this year is to wallow in anecdotes, information and statements of principle that are obliquely or clumsily attached to the sadness at hand. I blame social media, which can make some kind of immediate response seem almost compulsory, like a homework assignment. It\u2019s a midwife to bad judgment and a narcissism multiplier, with its promise of likes and shares.I also blame journalism, which is in a phase that encourages its practitioners to treat big developments as branding opportunities, carve our own niches in others\u2019 narratives and become characters as well as guides. Doing that without preening is tricky business, and so many of us bungle it that I\u2019m not going to single out anyone in this column. For similar reasons, I\u2019m not going to point fingers at the politicians and aides who pivoted so awkwardly from McCain to their own navels. I first noticed a surfeit of oddly boastful eulogies when Nora Ephron died six years ago. It seemed that everyone in Hollywood, New York and Washington knew her.

{"Headline": "As Hong Kong Clamps Down, a Tiny Political Party Finds Itself in the Spotlight", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A tiny political party in Hong Kong has emerged as one of the city\u2019s most discussed political topics thanks to government efforts to ban it and cancel a public talk by its founder.That move raised questions about growing restraints on political freedom in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory. As the government seeks to curtail people\u2019s ability to advocate for ideas like greater autonomy or even independence, it has added to concerns about a deteriorating environment for free speech in Hong Kong.Andy Chan, the founder of the party, which claims at most a few dozen members, said that the crackdown had given it an unexpected lift.\u201cThey keep on suppressing us, and now we\u2019re on the news, even international news,\u201d he said.The ban would be the first use of the public-security ordinance against a political party since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China. The law is typically used to crack down on organized crime.As they wait for the party\u2019s response, due by Sept. 4, the authorities have moved to further isolate the group, with China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of Hong Kong not to host a talk next week by Mr. Chan.The Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club\u2019s board of governors said Monday that the public had the right, and journalists had the responsibility, to hear different sides of any debate.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s top official, said Sunday that such a talk was \u201ccompletely unsuitable.\u201d She added that the decision of whether to hold it was up to the club, but called it \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cregrettable.\u201dMr. Leung raised the question of what he called a \u201ctoken rent\u201d the club pays the government for the historic building it occupies in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district.Mr. Leung said the rent was a sign of the government\u2019s support for the club and freedoms of speech and the press. But Mr. Chan and others took that mention as a veiled threat to raise the rent or even oust the club from the building.Ms. Lam, however, said the organization had paid market rent rates since 1982.Francis Moriarty, a former FCC board member, said that when he left the board three years ago the club paid about $77,700 a month in rent, and that it had invested huge sums in renovating, maintaining and improving the 19th-century building, the former site of a cold-storage warehouse for a dairy.But it maintains a key role on free speech issues, speaking up for imprisoned journalists, criticizing restrictive policies around the region and offering a venue for events that might have trouble being booked elsewhere in the city.Since the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, when democracy advocates occupied major intersections of Hong Kong for nearly three months, activists have found their ability to speak out increasingly restrained here.The event that included Mr. Wong was moved to the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club. Mr. Wong himself did not attend the rescheduled event, skipping it to join a protest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rum Enthusiasts Have a New Obsession: Fresh-Cut Sugar Cane", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwo rums, distilled from sugar cane juice rather than molasses, have intrigued bartenders and popped up on cocktail menus.Most rum in the Caribbean is made from molasses, the byproduct of refining sugar cane. By definition, molasses-based rums are more processed than those made from fresh sugar cane. So it makes sense that a rhum agricole, with its grassy, smoky, funky notes, would seem more \u201cpure.\u201d Many enthusiasts consider these to be the world\u2019s finest expressions of rum.But over the past several months, an unaged rum from Haiti called clairin, also made from fresh-pressed sugar cane juice, began popping up on cocktail menus. Clairin certainly ticks all the romantic boxes. Authentic? Clairin is distilled in remote Haitian villages, often by homemade stills in the same way it has since the 19th century. Pure? Clairin is made from native, sometimes wild, sugar cane varieties that have been lost elsewhere in the Caribbean. Rustic? The raw ingredient is usually transported on horseback and often crushed by the power of oxen. Mr. Biondi poured three expressions of clairin, each bottle named for the distiller (Clairin Casimir or Clairin Vaval), listing the village, the variety of sugar cane (such as Hawaii or Madame Meuze) and noting that it\u2019s spontaneously fermented with wild yeast. \u201cPure sugar cane juice rum is always a bit more sophisticated,\u201d Mr. Biondi said. \u201cMolasses is just not a complex raw material.\u201d These were fiery, spicy, edgy rums, all clocking in at more than 96 proof.\u201cThey\u2019re funky and unique and cross a lot of different categories,\u201d said Sother Teague, Amor y Amargo\u2019s beverage director, from behind the bar. \u201cFunky like Jamaican rum, grassy like rhum agricole, earthy like mezcal.\u201dMr. Biondi enjoyed the mention of mezcal. \u201cWe always make the comparison with mezcal,\u201d he said. \u201cComparing clairin with rhum agricole is like comparing mezcal with tequila.\u201dOne group, unsurprisingly, has not appreciated La Maison & Velier\u2019s sales pitch as the mezcal of rum: those who produce and import Martinique rhum agricole. \u201cI\u2019ve had more questions about clairin lately than anything else. It\u2019s more confusion, more noise,\u201d said Ed Hamilton, whose company Caribbean Spirits imports Neisson, La Favorite and Duquesne rhum agricole.\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be drawn to the authenticity of these projects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real passion for products that are out of the grasp of large industrial companies.\u201d But Mr. Cate acknowledges that modern craft bartenders have \u201casbestos palates, and they want to be shocked,\u201d and are therefore inevitably drawn to spirits like clairin.Rhum agricole and clairin, distilled from the juice of fresh-cut sugar cane, can be a new experience for those used to sipping molasses-based rums. Complex grassy, funky and earthy flavors are balanced by the underlying sweetness. Here is a selection of both aged and unaged examples to seek out. (All bottles are 750 milliliters.)

{"Headline": "The Beast in Me", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big ideasWe tend to forget we are animals, until we become prey. It was the perfect distance to see a grizzly: close enough to make out the rolling power of her gait and the light gold fur on her back, and far enough away for us to feel safe. We watched her for several minutes, remarking on her beauty, then continued up the trail into a stand of stunted, high-altitude pine, the trunks just tall enough to obscure our vision. When we emerged, the bear had traversed and descended along our path and was now only 100 yards away. A football field. A quick sprint. Several things happened in my mind at once: I realized the bear was following us, I realized she wanted to eat us, and I realized that I was an animal.It was a strange epiphany. To be human today is to deny our animal nature, though it\u2019s always there, as the earth remains round beneath our feet even when it feels flat. I had always been an animal, and would always be one, but it wasn\u2019t until I was prey, my own fur standing on end and certain base-level decisions being made in milliseconds (in a part of my mind that often takes 10 minutes to choose toothpaste in the grocery store), that the meat-and-bone reality settled over me. I was smaller and slower than the bear. My claws were no match for hers. And almost every part of me was edible.My partner looked at me. I looked at her. We turned and sprinted back into the trees the way we\u2019d come.In the pounding of our footsteps, below the wild panic, I remember a distinct thrill of pleasure. Not in a suicidal sense (I was too frightened to look back, and certainly didn\u2019t want to feel the bear\u2019s jaws on my neck), but as a matter of perspective. The feeling was tied most closely to relief. Every other thing I\u2019d been worrying about that day, from whether I\u2019d worn enough sunscreen to whether my partner really loved me, fell aside. I had one concern: to get us away without being eaten.Civilization itself is an attempt to protect us from this feeling. From its earliest iterations in fire-starting and cave-dwelling to its current zenith in the construction of megalopolises, as well as the careful documentation of every birth and the methodical laying bare of each strand in every helix, civilization is a way of setting ourselves apart from the prey we once were. Building walls, both physical and informational, to keep out the bears.Yet even atop the highest tower in the most prestigious university we remain animals, directed by the same base-level needs and emotions that motivate living creatures from bonobos to rats. I\u2019ve seen flashes of our animal selves in the most unlikely places: genius professors reduced to grunting rage, and overweight shut-ins catching a falling object with sudden, instinctive grace.We were only halfway through the pine stand when a park ranger met us, running full speed from the other direction holding the largest gun I\u2019d ever seen. He told us to get behind him. His neck shone with sweat. We peeked around his shoulders (and gun) at the bear, which was now lingering at the edge of the trees. \u201cShe\u2019s almost 12,\u201d he said, catching his breath as we backed along the trail. \u201cIt gets harder for them to find food at that age. She\u2019s been displaying increasingly aggressive behavior.\u201d I hardly noticed the fact that he seemed to know this particular bear intimately (I\u2019d later learn that rangers track many of the grizzlies in the park), and instead had the strange image of my own grandmother in her last days, hunting game with desperate, bloody abandon, rather than living in the guest room of our house.Of course there are aspects of our communal society \u2014 caring for the old, the domestication of livestock, the cultivation of crops \u2014 that link us to only a few other species, and other aspects, such as the written word, that link us to none as yet discovered, but in no place but our own minds have we truly transcended our animal brethren. In bonobo societies, both the best and worst aspects of humanity have been documented: from a complex language of facial expressions, to helping the disabled, to the adoption of orphans, to the manipulative and violent pursuit of power. As the anthropologist Clifford Geertz famously said, \u201cMan is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun.\u201dMost days, I remain fully entangled in this web, cursing at my smartphone while rolling across the earth in 4,000 pounds of steel. Yet there is something of the experience with the bear that remains inside me, a gift from my moment of pure terror. It\u2019s the knowledge of my animal self. That instinctive, frightened, clear-eyed creature beneath my clothes. And it brought with it the reassuring sense of being part of the natural world, rather than separated from it, as we so often feel ourselves to be. My humanity, one cell in the great, breathing locomotion spreading from sunlight to leaves to root stems to bugs to birds to bears. All of us fragile, all of us fleeting, all of us prey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Asian-American Teen Idol Onscreen, Finally", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you see someone who looks like you, it reveals what is possible. Ms. Han is the author of \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201dTeenage years are all about crushes. Crushes so deep you wanted to inhabit the other person, be inside their skin, see the world through their eyes. Before there was Pinterest or Tumblr, we used actual bulletin boards made out of cork, and we would pin our onscreen crushes on them with little pushpins. Mine had Dwayne Wayne from \u201cA Different World\u201d in his flip-top glasses, and Jordan Catalano from \u201cMy So-Called Life,\u201d leaning against a locker. Oh, how I loved the way he leaned.No matter how I did my hair, I was never going to look like any of my idols or any of the girls in my cherished Delia\u2019s catalog. No average girl would ever achieve that impossible ideal, but if she was white, she did see a glossier version of herself in movies and on magazine covers and TV. As an Asian-American girl, I didn\u2019t have that experience. I started writing stories at a young age, but not once did it occur to me that I could grow up to be a writer. Who could I look to? My favorite authors were Ann M. Martin and E.L. Konigsburg and Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary and Lois Lowry and Norma Klein. They were all white women, and they seemed so stately to me, so elegant. A whole world away. When I sold my first middle-grade novel in 2005, it wasn\u2019t that common to put an author photo on the back flap, but 24-year-old Korean-American me insisted. I wanted Asian girls to see my face. And more than that, I wanted them to see what is possible. My young-adult novel, \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d is about a girl who writes secret love letters to boys when she wants to get over them. They\u2019re for her eyes only \u2014 except one day, they all get sent out. Even before the book came out in 2014, there was interest in making a movie. But the interest died as soon as I made it clear the lead had to be Asian-American. One producer said to me, as long as the actress captures the spirit of the character, age and race don\u2019t matter. I said, well, her spirit is Asian-American. That was the end of that. What would it have meant for me back then to see a girl who looked like me star in a movie? Not as the sidekick or romantic interest, but as the lead? Not just once, but again and again? Everything. There is power in seeing a face that looks like yours do something, be someone. There is power in moving from the sidelines to the center.Having a book made into a film is a career-changing moment for authors. But authors have little control over any aspect of the moviemaking process. Once you hand over the rights, no one is obligated to listen to anything you say. I ended up deciding to work with the only production company that agreed the main character would be played by an Asian actress. No one else was willing to do it. Still, I was holding my breath all the way up until shooting began because I was scared they would change their minds. They didn\u2019t. When it came time to talk about our heroine Lara Jean\u2019s aesthetic, I made a mood board for the producers. I pinned pictures of girls on the streets of Seoul and Tokyo and Shanghai. Asian streetwear meets the \u201990s with a dash of the \u201960s. Of course I included a picture of my beloved Alicia Silverstone. In the final scene of the movie, Lana Condor, who plays Lara Jean, wears a plaid, pleated skirt and knee socks. When she came running out of her trailer that day, she gave me a little curtsy and I felt like both a proud mom and 13-year-old me all over again. I hope teenage girls see Lana Candor and feel the way I felt about my teen idols. Constance Wu, Awkwafina, Gemma Chan of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d Kelly Marie Tran of \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u2014 I hope they all end up on someone\u2019s bulletin board. Because when you see someone who looks like you, it reveals what is possible. It\u2019s not just maybe I could be an actress. It\u2019s maybe I could be an astronaut, a fighter, a president. A writer. This is why it matters who is visible. It matters a lot. And for the girls of 2018, I want more. I want the whole world. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Students Pour Into Dhaka\u2019s Streets to Demand Safer Roads", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Thousands of students paralyzed parts of Bangladesh\u2019s capital on Sunday to protest the country\u2019s abysmal road safety conditions. Teenagers dressed in school uniforms erected checkpoints across the city, forcing the police and government ministers to observe traffic laws that are otherwise poorly enforced.The protests in Dhaka, the capital, have entered their second week with no signs of abating, with demonstrators demanding justice after two students were killed and 12 others wounded when a bus plowed into a bus stop on July 29.The protests intensified on Sunday when university students joined the middle and high school students who have led the movement so far. The newcomers joined in solidarity after a pro-government student union joined the police\u2019s ranks and clashed with protesters on Saturday, wounding dozens.On some days the protests have attracted up to 15,000 students, with parents leaving work to join their children and restaurants offering free food to demonstrators.The students\u2019 ability to organize and to enforce poorly obeyed laws has embarrassed the governing party, the Awami League, as it heads into elections in December.Students responsible for checkpoints have forced the police and government officials to provide driver\u2019s licenses and car registration. They have also helped ease street congestion by forcing Dhaka\u2019s drivers \u2014 notorious for driving on the wrong side of the road or skipping traffic lines \u2014 to obey laws.\u201cIf children like us can establish discipline in traffic management, why can\u2019t the traffic police do it?\u201d said Tameem Dari Khan, who recently graduated from high school and is waiting to attend university. \u201cIt\u2019s because they get bribes. They are not interested to check properly, so they can get some illegal benefit.\u201dOn Thursday, students asked a police sergeant on a motorcycle to show his license, which he refused to do. When the sergeant slapped a young boy, the students attacked him and set fire to his motorcycle.Despite that episode, most interactions at student-run checkpoints have been peaceful. A government minister traveling in his motorcade was stopped at a checkpoint last week, and was then forced to ride with his security detail after his chauffeur failed to produce a driver\u2019s license. Students have turned over unlicensed drivers to the police.Although the government was reluctant to use violence at the start of the protests, the police\u2019s violent turn this weekend may encourage more students to come out, observers said. The governing party has also blamed the opposition for stoking protests.\u201cWe will go for tough action if the limit is crossed,\u201d he said.For many, the protests are about much more than the country\u2019s hazardous road conditions. They also symbolize the poor governance and corruption across Bangladesh.The student movement has demanded that the death penalty be imposed on the driver who careered into the bus stop at full speed on July 29, and that the government enforce more rigorous traffic laws.Mr. Khan is also the head of Bangladesh\u2019s powerful transportation lobby, which activists say is a conflict of interest.The transportation sector has long operated above the law, with powerful officials either owning private bus companies or relying on its workers for political support. By bribing officials, transportation companies obtain driver\u2019s licenses for employees, who are often first-time drivers. They also bribe the police to get out of deadly accidents or allow their decrepit buses to continue along commuter routes.\u201cThe transportation sector is absolutely corrupt,\u201d said Iftekharuzzaman, who goes by one name and is the executive director of Transparency International, Bangladesh.The student protesters accused the government of blocking free speech. But the telecommunication minister, Mustafa Jabbar, said in an interview that a technical issue had prevented mobile providers from offering faster connections.Other officials said the mobile internet speeds had been purposefully slowed after rumors that the Awami League party detained, killed and raped several demonstrators at one of their offices in Dhaka.The rumors quickly spread on social media and escalated violence across the capital on Saturday afternoon, culminating when several thousand students marched on the Awami League office. But they found no evidence that protesters had been unlawfully detained there and publicly denounced the rumors as false, tamping down protesters\u2019 rage.\u201cI think mobile operators\u2019 problems have come as blessings for all of us \u2014 otherwise we would get more rumors by now,\u201d said Mr. Jabbar, the telecommunications minister.If the government is behind the move to slow the country\u2019s internet, Bangladesh would be the third South Asian country in recent months that has tried to harness the power of social media to prevent violent protests from escalating.Advertisement"}

And so college freshmen, who just a few months ago tossed their high school graduation caps into the air and heard \u201cOh, the Places You\u2019ll Go!,\u201d begin a new season of angst. We figured you might want to weigh in, too. Use the comment section to tell us about your own experience. All the jobs I\u2019ve had have required a bachelor\u2019s. I don\u2019t think I would have even gotten in the door for an interview without it.\u2014 Chris Michelier, NashvilleFor my undergrad, I attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, N.Y.), and majored in biomedical engineering. Now, as a Ph.D. student and aspiring engineering professor, I absolutely use this major in my career! With that said, I do think that it is a case-by-case basis in whether it matters where you attend college. For me, attending RPI was certainly a benefit. The school itself has great name recognition for engineering, and the overall curriculum there is excellent for students desiring to pursue a professional engineering career. Additionally, I was able to pursue independent research as an undergraduate and develop close relations with my professors. All of these factors enabled me to further my career and pursue a BME Ph.D. at a leading institution.\u2014 Lexi Rindone, MarylandI went to American University and graduated in 2015. AU is far from the Ivy League, but the extremely international cohort of students, and diverse network I was able to build have helped me land every job I've had in the past five years. Every country I've lived in during the past five years has connected me back to my D.C. and/or AU networks. My current job in London I landed indirectly from a referral from a former classmate in D.C. I think that over all, the caliber of the university that you went to is inarguably important, but the culture of the overall environment is more impactful.\u2014 Nicola Brooks, LondonI think where you went to college can really make a difference if the school you attend offers you a multitude of internship opportunities (and financial support for internships), career exploration opportunities, and alumni contacts. Those opportunities tend to be more prevalent in schools with large endowments.I wanted to be a genetic counselor but no one at the time (early 1980s) could tell me how to become one so I majored in biology. I kicked around for a year trying to figure out what to do and hit on the idea of becoming a medical librarian so I got my master\u2019s in library science. I decided to go back to school and get an emergency management master\u2019s degree. And now I work as a project manager for emergency preparedness for a health care association. It\u2019s been a very weird and lengthy route but I\u2019ve always been able to parlay my previous job into something new and different and somehow have kind of come full circle back to a health care association. I love being able to translate dense science into language and concepts accessible to nonscientists. \u2014 Lisa Fenger, New YorkI was a writer/performer from an early age.

Little did I know that as a \u201cfinancial adviser\u201d I\u2019d be writing and performing my own sales scripts, but that\u2019s what I did for the next 26 years \u2019til retirement at age 65. My clients would say, \u201cLance, how did someone with your theatrical background become a financial adviser?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I always replied, \u201chow did Ronald Reagan become president of the United States?\u201d \u2014 Lance Jencks, Newport Beach, Calif. I went to a community college, Orange Coast College, in Costa Mesa, Calif., because I had no idea what I wanted to \u2014 or could \u2014 do with my life. Those two years allowed me to mature and gain leadership experience though student government. I had some of my best professors there. Then I transferred to CSU Fresno, for a degree in English, then later, a master\u2019s in American literature at CSU Long Beach. College for me gave me the tools to examine and inquire, and it ignited my curiosity. I believe that community colleges are too often overlooked as a first step to a richer life.\u2014 Judith Smith, Scottsdale, Ariz.Personally, I see community college as a way to inexpensively test the waters of higher ed, as well as being a much more supportive environment. They do a lot with less funding, limited resources, and a broad range of student needs, and situations, so they are like the MacGyver of college education.I am a college student now. After high school many years ago, I went straight into MacMurray College as an Elementary/Deaf Ed major. A few attempts to return and seven more children later, here I am starting over! My goal is to teach at the high school level. I have learned it is never too late to return to goals which were put aside.\u2014 Cynthia Fernstaedt, ArizonaI\u2019m still in school, this time working on a Ph.D. Every moment of it has been spent both understanding what it means to be a doctor of social sciences studying transgender identity, as well as a transgender woman. It\u2019s been hell \u2014 and the greatest gift I\u2019ve ever received. I got a four-year fellowship to learn what it means to be myself and \u2014 hopefully \u2014 how to help other transgender people who are not as lucky as myself. Indeed, I can say with no hyperbole whatsoever that the University of Oregon has saved my life.\u2014 Bethany Grace Howe, Eugene, Ore. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Calving Season: Coming of Age on a Montana Cattle Ranch", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsA teenager helps her family save newborn calves during a snowy spring.Mr. Reich is a documentary filmmaker.Montana\u2019s harsh winter persists into April. That\u2019s bleak by most metrics, but especially so if you\u2019re a cattle rancher \u2014 the snows continue straight into calving season. When I spent a winter there to make this short film, I was astonished by the conditions: Pregnant cows would wander off alone to give birth and drop their babies into freezing ice, and calves would shiver as they struggled to survive their first night. To save the newest members of their herd, ranching families work through the snowy nights in rotating shifts, searching for newborn calves with their flashlights and pulling them into the warming shed. I met this ranching family after visiting the nearby town of Marmarth, N.D., a few miles east of the Montana border. It was a strange, nearly forgotten little town of a hundred residents that had been a thriving community before the railroad was rerouted, and now it represented the cycle of boom and bust that has come to characterize so many towns in that area. The family who rented me my room owned a cattle ranch and were preparing for calving season. It was not long before I met their seven children, grandparents and great-grandparents. We shared Christmas dinner. I was adopted. Seeing what goes into raising animals for consumption was an eye-opening experience. What struck me most was the intimacy and comfortable relationship each child had with the life and death of the animals. Their jobs on the farm were not just excuses to teach responsibility; they were critical to the family\u2019s livelihood. I could not help comparing how drastically different their childhoods were from mine growing up in the suburbs of San Francisco. Like the children in this film, most cattle ranchers are born into the job. It is hard and often thankless work that can stretch for months with no days off, and everything comes down to a successful calving season. All so we can eat.I hope this small story reminds us of a bigger perspective \u2014 that though life is hard, it is still filled with compassion and beauty as the cycles of birth and death go on.

{"Headline": "America\u2019s Never-Ending Culture War", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe issues that drove protesters to Chicago in 1968 are still motivating our partisan divide, 50 years later.Mr. Kazin is a co-editor of Dissent and a professor of history at Georgetown. On the evening of Aug. 26, 1968, I was arrested on a street corner in Chicago for a dubious crime: protesting a political event. This was, of course, the Democratic National Convention, which was about to nominate as its presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey, the vice president, who had staunchly supported the decision to send half a million troops to pursue a deeply immoral and doomed mission in Vietnam.I joined hundreds of others in jail that night. Many of us at the time felt we had a duty to oppose the war, and we certainly felt the historical weight of the moment. But I don\u2019t think any of us expected that the conflict \u2014 not just over the war, but over two visions for American society \u2014 would still be raging, half a century later.The day I was released, a confrontation between helmeted police and nonviolent demonstrators erupted in front of the Hilton hotel in downtown Chicago. It was shown live on TV for a full 17 minutes. Viewers saw police brutally attacking men and women with mace and clubs. The video, replayed over the next few days, shocked and angered millions who opposed the war.But pollsters soon found that twice as many Americans sided with the police as sided with the protesters. Whatever their views on the intervention in Indochina, a majority seemed to believe that the young, allegedly unpatriotic troublemakers had it coming. Mayor Richard Daley thundered, in defense of his men in blue, that his administration and the people of Chicago \u201cwould never permit a lawless, violent group of terrorists to menace the lives of millions of people, destroy the purpose of a national political convention and take over the streets.\u201dIn many ways, the civil war fought out in Mayor Daley\u2019s city that summer has never really ended. The ugly 2016 campaign and Donald Trump\u2019s embattled administration are only the latest episodes in a long conflict fought on several fronts \u2014 cultural, social and political. This \u201cdiscord\u201d is hardly \u201cunprecedented,\u201d as journalists and some political scientists have claimed. Nor has the United States recently \u201clost a sense of common purpose\u201d and a \u201csense of common narrative,\u201d as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN this spring.Not only do Americans continue to debate, often angrily, about when and how the police should use violence against unarmed civilians. Liberals and leftists still battle with conservatives over most of the other big issues that roiled the nation back then: affirmative action, the right to abortion, freedom for gays and lesbians, curbs on corporate power, environmental protection, the politics of academia \u2014 and rulings by the Supreme Court that cheer one camp and infuriate the other.Of course, the identities and targets of the combatants have shifted over the years. Now it\u2019s progressives who accuse the Supreme Court of making decisions based on ideology rather than law. And who could have imagined that liberal Democrats would be defending the F.B.I., while conservative Republicans denounce it?But the harsh divisions among Americans in 1968 have largely endured. They are rooted in profound disagreements based on culture and creeds that are impervious to compromise. If one thinks abortion is murder or that L.G.B.T.Q. people deserve every right that heterosexuals have, the very idea of finding a middle ground is abhorrent. The mutual hostility between religious conservatives and liberals \u2014 and nonbelievers \u2014 that emerged in the 1960s also fuels these seemingly irreconcilable differences. Each side is convinced it represents a majority \u2014 and a moral one at that.The absence of a stable partisan majority also keeps our domestic conflicts on a persistent burn. Richard Nixon\u2019s victory in 1968 and his landslide re-election four years later tore apart the New Deal coalition that had dominated national politics, with barely a pause, since the early 1930s. Of the 11 presidential contests from 1976 to 2016, Republicans have won six and Democrats five. But on just four occasions has the Republican victor gained a plurality of the popular vote.Control of one or both houses of Congress has swung back and forth too. In 1951, the eminent political scientist Samuel Lubell observed that the Democrats were like the sun, the Republicans the moon. \u201cIt is within the majority party that the issues of any particular period are fought out,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhile the minority party shines in reflected radiance of the heat thus generated.\u201d But for the past half-century, the major parties have been more akin to asteroids that occasionally collide but whose gyrations move neither of them much closer to the center of the political solar system.Since the late 1960s, officeholders have sought to gain an advantage for their side by stoking the fires of conflict. This has been a consistent habit more on the right than among liberals. \u201cDividing the American people has been my main contribution to the national political scene,\u201d acknowledged Spiro Agnew, who served as Nixon\u2019s vice president until he resigned in disgrace in 1973. \u201cI not only plead guilty to this charge, but I am somewhat flattered by it.\u201d During his first term in Congress a few years later, Newt Gingrich accused Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill of placing \u201cCommunist propaganda\u201d in his office. Last June, Eric Trump emulated these predecessors as well as his own father when he told Sean Hannity on Fox that Washington Democrats are \u201cnot even people.\u201dUntil recently, prominent Democrats tended to avoid responding with incendiary statements of their own. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all sought to win over independent voters with promises to make bipartisan agreements and transcend the bitter fights of the 1960s. Most Americans first heard of Mr. Obama when he famously declared at the 2004 Democratic convention, \u201cThere\u2019s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d During Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, his chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities undertook a \u201cCivility Tour\u201d to resist what he called \u201cpolarizing attitudes\u201d that \u201ccan jeopardize social cohesion and even public safety.\u201dBut such conciliatory rhetoric seems na\u00efve when a Republican president spews belligerence before most Americans have finished their breakfast. Progressive activists and Democrats in Congress both routinely refer to President Trump as a \u201cfascist,\u201d a \u201ctyrant\u201d and a witting stooge of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. And after Michael Cohen incriminated Mr. Trump in court this week, they are also calling him a \u201ccrook.\u201d Conservatives, of course, return the fire with talk of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy to overturn the will of the voters. As this year\u2019s midterm election draws closer, the language will burn even hotter.As a New Leftist in 1968, I did not worry that Americans were fighting one another on the streets of Chicago and around the nation. I only wanted to figure out how my side could come out on top. Now, as a professor, I teach the virtues of empathizing with one\u2019s adversaries, of understanding why those with whom you vehemently disagree think what they think and do what they do. But as a historian, I also know that civil wars, even cultural ones, seldom end with settlements that please both sides. Until the left or the right wins a lasting victory, America will remain a society rent in two.Michael Kazin is a co-editor of Dissent and a professor of history at Georgetown.

But let me also say that he and Facebook, the huge social network that he started in college, have been working humanity\u2019s last nerve for far too long now. Every week, it\u2019s something, and that something is never good.This comes as no surprise to anyone at this point, except for maybe President Trump. I suppose we should be grateful that this time it was Facebook\u2019s management that revealed the news, in a departure from the company\u2019s previous stance of stubbornly resisting pressure from the government and the media to be more transparent. (Over the past months, it has copped to trouble in Brazil, Mexico and Russia, which is a good sign, although a report on Sunday from Britain\u2019s Parliament rebuked the company for being \u201cunwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee\u2019s questions.\u201d)The arms race metaphor is a good one, but not for the reasons Facebook intended. Here\u2019s how I see it: Facebook, as well as Twitter and Google\u2019s YouTube, have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age. All these companies began with a gauzy credo to change the world. But they have done that in ways they did not imagine \u2014 by weaponizing pretty much everything that could be weaponized. They have mutated human communication, so that connecting people has too often become about pitting them against one another, and turbocharged that discord to an unprecedented and damaging volume. They have weaponized social media. They have weaponized the First Amendment. They have weaponized civic discourse. And they have weaponized, most of all, politics.Which is why malevolent actors continue to game the platforms and why there\u2019s still no real solution in sight anytime soon, because they were built to work exactly this way. And ever since, they have grown like some very pernicious kudzu and overtaken their inventors\u2019 best efforts at control. Simply put, the inventors became overwhelmed by their own creations, which led to what I can only describe as a casual negligence, which led to where we are now. At a recent employee Q. and A. I did at YouTube, for example, one staffer told me that their jobs used to be about wrangling cat videos and now they had degenerated into a daily hell of ethics debates about the fate of humanity.At least Mr. Zuckerberg has traveled a long way in admitting the problem and has said more than any other digital C.E.O. that he regrets that he had not taken action sooner. I certainly did not see it coming, either, when I first met him, in the fall of 2005, although in hindsight the signs that he would get it really wrong were right there in front of me. He was just a hair over 21, as gangly as you\u2019d imagine he would be, when he slipped quietly into the cramped room at Facebook\u2019s shabby then-headquarters in downtown Palo Alto, Calif.The start-up was hot, well funded and interesting, but Mr. Zuckerberg had already gotten a reputation as arrogant, in part for putting \u201cA Mark Zuckerberg production\u201d on the bottom of the site and for a business card he had that read, \u201cI\u2019m the C.E.O., bitch.\u201dOn that forced stroll, there was one word that he kept coming back to: Facebook was a \u201cutility.\u201dIt was a curious metaphor to choose, because it was not the effortlessly hip image of his rival back then, Myspace, nor the multicolored everlasting Willy Wonka party that was going on over at Google. It was a dull, blue, helpful, we-keep-the-lights-on-ma\u2019am concept that was, thinking back on it, quite telling. That\u2019s because it was based in the idea that Facebook was essentially benign. Worse: Mr. Zuckerberg stuck with this mix of extreme earnestness and willful na\u00efvet\u00e9 for far too long. Because what he never managed to grok then was that the company he created was destined to become a template for all of humanity, the digital reflection of masses of people across the globe. Including \u2014 and especially \u2014 the bad ones. Not so much. Unfortunately, the conversation soon turned into a late-night freshman-year dorm-room debate, as he stumbled into a controversy of his own making by using Holocaust deniers and their appalling falsehoods as an example of how much dreck should be allowed on the platform. While that statement ate up all the news, I was more struck by something else. I kept pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on how he personally felt about the damage his creation had done. Was he beginning to understand the power that he held, and that the world that he controlled was not such a rosy place? Facebook was \u201cprobably,\u201d he admitted, \u201ctoo focused on just the positives and not focused enough on some of the negatives.\u201d Fair enough. But it was impossible to get him to acknowledge any personal pain as both the creator and the destroyer.\u201cI mean, my emotion is feeling a deep sense of responsibility to try to fix the problem,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cIn running a company, if you want to be innovative and advance things forward, I think you have to be willing to get some things wrong. But I don\u2019t think it is acceptable to get the same things wrong over and over again.\u201dIt was a classic Silicon Valley engineer\u2019s roll-up-your-sleeves answer, which leaves many cold when it comes to, say, the manipulation of democracy. Fending off bad actors like the Russians has been and will be increasingly expensive; it may even be impossible. But Facebook could have done much more than it did, and it certainly needs to do more than it\u2019s doing. Mr. Zuckerberg is now trying to fend off talk in Washington of regulating his company like the thing he once told me it was: a utility. He has also spent the last month meeting over dinners with a range of academic experts on free speech, propaganda and more to try to understand where to go from here.Call it the education of Mark Zuckerberg and Silicon Valley, but on the world\u2019s dime. How much that has \u2014 and will \u2014 cost is probably immeasurable.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Striving for Justice and Equality With a Camera on New York's Streets", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSFor decades, Builder Levy photographed protests and social issues, as well as the neighborhoods where he taught in New York, to counter media depictions he saw as problematic.Builder Levy taught in the New York City public school system for 34 years. Most of that time he spent working in black and Hispanic neighborhoods, where he encountered rich cultures and warm family life. But that was not how those neighborhoods were portrayed in most of the published images he saw \u2014 so he photographed them himself when he was not at work.\u201cI looked at my photographs as a counter to the racist depictions the mass media had of the very students I was teaching,\u201d he said.For as long as he can remember, Mr. Levy wanted to help make a \u201cmore socially and economically just world,\u201d he said. Weaned on the progressive ideals of his parents, who were steeped in leftist politics during the McCarthy era, he became an activist as a teenager. As a student at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, he circulated a petition in 1957 calling for school desegregation and joined a civil rights march on Washington. Later, after taking a photography class while studying art at Brooklyn College, Mr. Levy started bringing a camera along as he and his friends protested and picketed over both national and local issues. Some of his images from a protest of de facto school segregation in New York were published in Freedomways magazine, a leading African-American political and cultural periodical.After his retirement in 2000, he returned to photographing protest marches and demonstrations as a \u201cpartisan participant\u201d intent on helping to change the world, he said.\u201cI lived a relatively tame and self-contained life,\u201d Mr. Levy, 75, said. \u201cBut with photography I was able to live a more intense and fulfilling life. Through my photography I am trying to change the consciousness of the world. I believe real change comes from the bottom up.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The BLT, as You\u2019ve Never Seen It", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteCrunchy, spicy and quick to make, BLT tacos are a simple after-work dinner, or a brunch you can make while you\u2019re still half-asleep.Not only were these BLTs lighter than the usual sandwich, they also had a far more exciting texture. Without the bread slices smothering the shatter and snap of bacon and lettuce, there\u2019s a lot more crunch.My version stays pretty close to his, though I did gussy up the tomatoes a bit, dicing them into a salsa with lime juice, cilantro and jalape\u00f1o. But if it seems like one too many things to chop on a weeknight (or weekend morning), skip it and slice up a ripe tomatoes instead.Another minor deviation: I also added avocado to the tacos for creaminess. But if you can\u2019t get a good one, leave it out.The bacon, however, is nonnegotiable in any BLT, taco or otherwise. I like cooking my bacon spread out on a rimmed sheet pan in the oven because I can do a lot of it all at once, and I don\u2019t have to stand over it like when it\u2019s frying. Also, all that splattering bacon grease stays behind the closed oven door, where I can pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.While the bacon bakes, you can make the salsa (or slice the tomatoes), cut up the avocado and mix the spicy mayonnaise. I like the vinegary sharpness of Cholula hot sauce here, but Tabasco and Crystal are two other good bets. Just stay away from sriracha, which is slightly sweeter than what you\u2019d want for this particular combination.Just before serving, warm the tortillas. If you\u2019ve got a gas burner, you\u2019ll be able to get a little char on them. Or warm them individually in a dry skillet. Either way, be sure to wrap them in a kitchen towel to keep in the heat.All told, it\u2019s dinner in under 30 minutes \u2014 or an unexpected but still bacon-filled brunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Sabotage of Obamacare Is Illegal", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA president doesn\u2019t have the right to dispense with laws he dislikes.Mr. Bagley and Ms. Gluck are law professors.But Mr. Trump isn\u2019t a king; he doesn\u2019t have the power to dispense with laws he dislikes. He swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That includes the requirement, set forth in Article II, that the president \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201dFaithfully executing the laws requires the president to act reasonably and in good faith. It does not countenance the deliberate sabotage of an act of Congress. Put bluntly: Mr. Trump\u2019s assault on Obamacare is illegal.Among Mr. Trump\u2019s first acts in office was to issue an executive order instructing his agencies \u201cto waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of\u201d any part of the Affordable Care Act that they could. That order has prompted a series of administrative actions aimed at undermining the law.To make it harder for people to enroll in Obamacare plans, for example, the administration shortened the open enrollment period on the health care exchanges from three months to six weeks; cut 90 percent of the funding that the exchanges had used to advertise open enrollment; and slashed the funding available to groups that help people navigate the complex enrollment process.To sow chaos in the insurance markets, Mr. Trump toyed for nine months with the idea of eliminating a crucial funding stream for Obamacare known as cost-sharing payments. After he cut off those funds, he boasted that Obamacare was \u201cbeing dismantled.\u201d This month, the Trump administration dealt what may be its biggest blow yet to the insurance markets. In a new rule, it announced that insurers will have more latitude to sell \u201cshort-term\u201d health plans that are exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules. These plans were designed to provide people insurance for small gaps in coverage, like those created when switching jobs. They had previously been limited to three months.Under Mr. Trump\u2019s new rule, however, such plans can last for 364 days and can be renewed for up to three years. That rule joins an earlier one that allowed businesses to join together to create \u201cassociation health plans\u201d that also evade the Affordable Care Act\u2019s strictures. In effect, these rules are creating a cheap form of \u201cjunk\u201d coverage that does not have to meet the higher standards of Obamacare. This sort of splintering of the insurance markets is not allowed under the Affordable Care Act as Congress drafted it.The Trump administration\u2019s goal is not only to weaken the Affordable Care Act but also to trick the public into thinking, as opponents of the law like to say, that Obamacare is \u201ccollapsing under its own weight.\u201d Let\u2019s be clear: If the Affordable Care Act collapses, it is because the president demolished it.Never in modern American history has a president so transparently aimed to destroy a piece of major legislation. What makes Mr. Trump\u2019s sabotage especially undemocratic is that Congress has repeatedly considered repealing the law \u2014 and repeatedly declined to do so.

Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to destroy the law any way he can is an unconstitutional usurpation of power.The lawsuit asks the court to strike down the administration\u2019s new rules and to enjoin the president from further sabotage.

After all, no court has ever held that the president has the power to consciously aim, in bad faith, to destroy Congress\u2019 handiwork. Yet with his attacks on this law, that is precisely what Mr. Trump has been doing.

{"Headline": "Fierce and Unpredictable: How Wildfires Became Infernos", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMISSOULA, Mont. \u2014 In a large metal warehouse, Mark Finney opens a tall, clear glass tower and pours alcohol into a tray at the bottom and lights it. When he closes the door, an open vent at the bottom sucks in air and suddenly fire spirals upward, a narrow column of flame 12 feet tall.\u201cNature hides its mysteries pretty well,\u201d Dr. Finney said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but the physics of how fires behave is largely mysterious. We\u2019re in the days before the Enlightenment in this field. We need better science.\u201d In recent years, the researchers have found to their surprise that the energy release rate of a wildfire is variable. \u201cAs it gets bigger, it burns fuel at a higher rate, and that means they are a lot less predictable than we thought,\u201d Dr. Finney said. Immense piles of long-burning wood and underbrush can suck in air from below \u201clike a forge,\u201d Dr. Finney said, quickly twisting into a violent fire whirl and burning three to eight times faster than a routine blaze. During a fire, heat rises in a vertical column, and as it rises and cools, it pulls in more hot air at the bottom and can create enough energy to begin spinning. A fire whirl can pick up and toss around a fire truck. In 1989, near Susanville, Calif., a fire whirl swept up four firefighters, burning them seriously. \u201cThe fuel conditions we\u2019re seeing have implications for fire behavior beyond our current understanding and models,\u201d Dr. Finney said. \u201cIt can lead to fire behaviors beyond any kind of control.\u201d The bombing campaigns of World War II offered a guide to fire spread. Military researchers would use aerial photos to study structures in German and Japanese cities and plan their attacks accordingly. \u201cThey learned how to bring cities down by creating firestorm conditions,\u201d Dr. Finney said. \u201cThey learned a lot, and it\u2019s directly related to very large forest fire behavior.\u201dAnother factor under examination is the \u201cspotting\u201d behavior produced by embers. Increasing amounts of deadwood are leading to more spotting \u2014 the shower of hot embers that high winds pick up from burning trees and scatter a mile or two in front of the flames. These showers set homes, forests and everything else in their path on fire. The Sundance fire in Idaho in 1967 cast embers eight miles in advance of the flames, and in Australia some eucalyptus trees \u2014 which also grow throughout California \u2014 have been shown to spot 10 to 15 miles in front of a blaze. Their characteristic papery bark catches fire first, splintering and soaring into the sky like flaming paper airplanes.Even the more normal spotting range of a mile or two signals that many homes and many cities that are within a forest \u2014 like Redding, Calif. \u2014 can be devastated by spotting and fast-moving flames. \u201cIt pretty much renders fire containment impossible,\u201d said Dr. Finney.Researchers at Oregon State University are studying the physics of ember generation and transport to better predict which forest types in different conditions will generate firebrands and where they will rain down.\u201cThey are a major method of fire spread,\u201d said David Blunck, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the university. \u201cIf there are structures a certain distance from the fire, it would be ideal to know the risk from spotting in order to evacuate or put in defenses.\u201d Juniper trees, with their lacy foliage and flammable oils, produce some of the hottest embers and are not recommended for planting near houses in fire zones. Fire weather is not well understood, either. Extreme fires can occasionally create so-called pyrocumulus clouds above the flames, which sometimes bring severe thunderstorms, including lightning, which in turn can start more fires. The clouds have been seen forming above California\u2019s fires this season. A wildfire in the Texas Panhandle earlier this year was so strong it created an especially powerful thunderstorm called a supercell that included one-inch hail and high winds.Even the basics of flame spread are being studied. \u201cWe still have a hard time describing a pile of sticks burning, let alone a complex fuel bed of trees and shrubs,\u201d said Sara McAllister, a research mechanical engineer at the Missoula lab.With better forecasting, experts hope people will find fires less overwhelming and frightening, and be more accepting of controlled burns to keep wildfires from becoming catastrophic. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken an ecosystem that was sustained by fire,\u201d said Dr. Finney, \u201cand turned it into one that is destroyed by fire.\u201dWhile lichen tolerated less severe fires, researchers found, growth did not return as long as 16 years after major fires. Major home developments in the wild-land-urban interface \u2014 in and near the forest \u2014 have mushroomed, making it far more difficult for firefighters to protect such vastly populated areas during a fast-moving blaze.There\u2019s no doubt a warmer world is changing the nature of fires, even if it\u2019s not the main culprit. California just set an-all time record for high July temperatures, and fuels in the forest are drier than they have ever been. Triple-digit temperatures \u201cpreheat the fuels, and it makes them much more receptive to igniting,\u201d said Scott L. Stephens, a fire ecologist at the University of California, Berkeley.The heat also appears to be changing nighttime fire behavior. \u201cThere are more nights of not having recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cAt night, the sun goes down, temperatures go down and humidity goes up. You could count on that to make sure you could do suppression activities. But fires now have so much severe behavior at night, almost the same as the day.\u201d He pointed to the Valley Fire that swept through Lake County California in 2015. \u201cIt moved uphill in the middle of the night and caught people off guard,\u201d Dr. Stephens said. While warmer temperatures are a factor, Dr. Finney said, we shouldn\u2019t just throw up our hands. \u201cThe climate is changing, there\u2019s no dispute about that,\u201d Dr. Finney said. \u201cBut it becomes an excuse to do nothing.\u201d Thinning forests with heavy equipment or hand crews helps reduce fire severity, but in the end the only way to solve the problem of these big fires \u201cis to remove the materials that carry fire, with prescribed or managed fire.\u201d        Advertisement"}

The surprise announcement of the overseas matches as a fait accompli, after earlier changes to the match calendar that have created later kickoff times and far more matches on weekdays, forced the players to go public with their concerns, said Aganzo, who suggested that a strike to protest the latest move was a serious possibility.\u201cTo take a unilateral decision is a lack of respect,\u201d Aganzo said, after a meeting of his association that was attended by players representing 14 of the league\u2019s 20 teams. \u201cWe are the protagonists of this sport, together with fans and referees. We have many things to say, and we are tired of not being valued.\u201dDetails about the first relocated match were vague, but Tebas and Stephen Ross, the owner of Relevent, suggested the first Liga game in the United States could be played in Miami, possibly as soon as this winter, and could involve at least one of the Spanish teams that are far more popular than the others \u2014 Real Madrid and Barcelona (although Atl\u00e9tico Madrid has recently challenged this duopoly).La Liga\u2019s international revenues are set to rise about 9 percent annually over the next four years, but Tebas has been pushing to further expand the profile of Spanish soccer overseas, in line with that of Premier League in England.The league is also hoping to raise international interest in teams other than Real Madrid and Barcelona. This month, La Liga also struck a deal with Facebook, which bought the rights to show all league games in India and other South Asian countries.Aganzo criticized Tebas for making a 15-year deal without talking to the players, and he warned that the players would go as far as staging a strike to prevent having to move overseas during their season. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me about a strike,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re willing to pursue this to the end.\u201dNeither La Liga nor Relevent responded to the players\u2019 criticism.The players are also demanding a review of the match calendar. Once confined to the weekend, La Liga games are increasingly happening midweek, and the kickoff times are staggered in an effort to attract larger audiences in different time zones.Some games begin at 10 p.m., or slightly later \u2014 a move that Spanish soccer officials have defended as a way to protect players from the summer heat.Real Madrid opened its season at home on Sunday against Getafe at 10:15 p.m., in front of 48,446 spectators. It was its smallest home crowd in almost a decade, although that could be attributed to a reason other than the inconvenient start time.Two matches were played on Monday, including what was arguably the opening round\u2019s most intriguing contest, between Valencia and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.Aganzo expressed concern about the Monday games, saying, \u201cThe world of soccer is getting used to things that aren\u2019t natural.\u201d He invited Tebas \u201cto put on the outfit of a soccer player\u201d and \u201csee soccer from another perspective: It\u2019s not only business and money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now they are cropping up at hotels, unsettling guests, spreading via social media with the hashtag #TravelingWhileBlack, and leading some in the travel industry to revisit diversity training and evaluate its effectiveness.\u201cThe incidents did not seem to create some new wave of sensitivity training or messaging,\u201d said Bjorn Hanson, a professor in the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University School of Professional Studies, who explained that hotel employee training in diversity is common in an industry built upon welcoming people from around the world. \u201cAs a person in the guest-facing role, you will experience the opportunity to welcome people of different backgrounds, religions, customs and sexual orientations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost part of the job description to serve different backgrounds.\u201dBut diversity training also varies, even under a single corporate umbrella. For example, Marriott mandates inclusion training for all employees at the hotels it manages within 90 days of hire. But when it comes to franchised hotels or those more loosely bound to Marriott, such as the Art Ovation Hotel, the company says it can only suggest training and make the tools available to franchisees rather than require it. The Art Ovation Hotel said all of its employees undergo anti-discrimination training. After the incident involving a racial slur, employees of the Country Inn & Suites by Radisson in Newport News, which is also a franchise, were \u201cre-trained on code-of-conduct policies related to expectations and guiding principles for appropriate workplace behavior,\u201d according to the company.\u201cIsolated incidents like this one are very unfortunate, but provide an opportunity for the company to reinforce the importance of our guest service expectations with our franchisees,\u201d wrote Laura Langemo, a spokeswoman for Radisson Hotel Group, which includes Country Inn & Suites by Radisson, in an email.Instilling racial and cultural sensitivity is difficult because it is generally not reviewed or evaluated on the job the way more quantifiable tasks such as computer skills (for example, checking in a guest) are, said Jamie Perry, an assistant professor of human resource management in the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University\u2019s Cornell S.C. Johnson College of Business.\u201cThat basic level of awareness, that these people look different from me or are different culturally, is a first step in any successful diversity program, helping employees be aware of differences,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of things we\u2019re seeing in the news get at that underlying implicit bias that people have and are not aware of until it\u2019s \u2018Oh my god, that came out of my mouth.\u2019 Training creates a dialogue about differences.\u201dThere may still not be enough of it, however, as travel experts expressed dismay, but not surprise, at the news.\u201cIf I encounter racial discrimination, I\u2019m going to say something about it, but I always keep my cool,\u201d she said. \u201cAddress them head on, calmly, with a level head if possible and escalate it to the people who matter, whether that\u2019s a head office or manager.

But maybe they shouldn\u2019t have been.While some saw this as a sign of her political weakness, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was tapping into a sharp shift in the way that Democrats understand immigration. In much the same way that the Democratic Party has had a reckoning on financial deregulation, the punitive 1994 crime bill and the callous welfare reforms of the mid-90s, incumbents are now facing criticism for their votes on immigration. From the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act in 1996 to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Democrats have voted overwhelmingly to help construct the apparatus that President Trump is using to engage in a campaign of mass deportation. And candidates like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez are forcing them to take those votes seriously. Ayanna Pressley, who is challenging another incumbent, Michael Capuano, in the Seventh Congressional District of Massachusetts, has also called for abolishing ICE. In Delaware, Kerri Evelyn Harris, running against Tom Carper, another incumbent who supported the creation of the agency, has too. In Minnesota, Ilhan Omar, who wants to replace Keith Ellison, who is running for attorney general, notes that ICE is relatively new. \u201cICE\u2019s mission was created in 2002 \u2014 they\u2019ve only been around for 15 years,\u201d she told me. \u201cIn that time, they have grown to be an agency whose mission is to tear families apart and put fear into immigrant, refugee and undocumented communities. ICE has only become increasingly militarized, brutal and unaccountable.\u201d For her, the call to abolish ICE is a demand to create an immigration policy \u201cbased in compassion.\u201d Abolishing ICE is not only a campaign issue among upstarts in primaries in deep blue districts. Mark Pocan, a representative from Wisconsin who is a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said his concerns about ICE stem from the increasingly racist overtones of the agency\u2019s enforcement priorities, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to send every possible signal that there are people who don\u2019t belong in this country, and it\u2019s not people from Norway. This is being done almost exclusively on race. Sitting in the parking lot outside of a Head Start school is not for the security of the country.\u201d Antonio Alarc\u00f3n, another member of Make the Road Action, told me, \u201cWe demand the elimination of an agency that keeps terrorizing our communities, that keeps separating families and putting our families in jails. As a Dreamer, I know what it\u2019s like to live in fear, with your family, of ICE coming to knock on your door.\u201d My think tank, Data for Progress, which tracks the phrase \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on Twitter, has seen a deep level of engagement on this issue. There has been a more than fivefold increase in tweets containing the phrase \u201cabolish ICE\u201d from the first five months of the year to June and July. I have also analyzed Voter Study Group data, which provides some insight into why the movement to abolish ICE has taken hold among so many Democratic voters. The survey is a panel, meaning it interviews the same group of individuals at two points in time. I looked at white Democrats who identified as Democrats in both surveys. In 2011, 60 percent of white Democrats supported a path to citizenship, 24 percent were opposed and 16 percent weren\u2019t sure. In 2016, 74 percent favored a path to citizenship, 16 percent were opposed and the rest didn\u2019t know.  The Voter Study Group also asks respondents whether undocumented immigrants make a contribution to society or are a drain on it. In 2011, 40 percent of white Democrats said undocumented immigrants make a contribution, 16 percent said neither and 31 percent said \u201cmostly a drain\u201d (the rest were unsure). By 2016, 61 percent of white Democrats said undocumented immigrants made a contribution, 10 percent said neither and 22 percent said mostly a drain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Are Merging With Robots. That\u2019s a Good Thing. ", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE Big IdeasThe old boundaries of the human self are being blurred by technology. The risks are real, but the potential is astounding. Mr. Clark is a professor of logic and metaphysics. Here are some things that are true today:Artificial intelligences already outperform us at many tasks and are now able to train themselves to reach competencies (in restricted domains such as chess or Go) that we can barely comprehend.The controlled use of hallucinogenics and other drugs may soon be part of mainstream therapy for depression, loss, anxiety and other conditions.Sex and companionship robots are already here.The human genome itself is now an object of control and intervention.Gender is becoming more visibly fluid than ever before, and there is emerging a place in human society for a wonderfully wide spectrum of ways of being (personally, politically and sexually).Technological devices like cellphones and tablets are being used to help offset types of biological damage, such as a highly impaired memory, that just a few decades ago would have condemned victims to constant care.Sports for people with disabilities, whether adaptive or para-sports, are positively expanding our images of health and fitness in ways that would have been hard to imagine just a few decades ago.Neuro-enhancement, the improvement by drugs, practices, or implants of normal mental functioning, is possible and may soon become the norm.What does it mean to live in this kind of emerging world? It is to live in a world marked more by possibility, fluidity, change and negotiability than by outdated images of fixed natures and capacities. This is a world of remarkable personal and social possibility. Sharing and group solidarity are now easier than ever before, and the communal mapping of new electronic trails is enabling multiple once-hidden demographics to command social, commercial and political respect. It\u2019s a world where human intelligence itself is poised for repair and reinvention. And one whose bedrock nature is itself becoming fluid, as digital overlays augment reality with personalized pointers (the information-rich cousins of the contemporary elves and pixies of Pok\u00e9mon Go). It\u2019s also a world permeated by a growing swath of alien intelligences (just ask Alexa, although she won\u2019t really admit it).All this blurs the boundaries between body and machine, between mind and world, between standard, augmented and virtual realities, and between human and post-human. At the cusp of these waves of change, this is also the moment at which, increasingly, inclusivities of one kind (extensions of personal, social and sexual freedom) bump up against the threat of new forms of exclusivity, as the augmented, fluid, connected cyber-haves increasingly differentiate themselves from the unaugmented, less connected, cyber have-nots. Perhaps this is part of the price of all that laudable loosening? After all, there was a time when written scholarly text was itself the province of only a few groups of enviably-positioned humans. In the end (and with the inventions of cheap mass-production) the transformative potential of text was set free, and it reshaped the world.This is a moment to be savored, even as we sound new notes of care and caution about the speed, nature and range of these changes. Part of this process involves getting used to the alien nature and pervasive reach of the many new subintelligences that now surround us. These are the algorithms that talk with us, that watch us, that trade for us, that select dates for us, that suggest what we might buy, sell, or wear. They are the algorithms that pool information about us, and that will slowly permeate the full range of human-built environments, from bridges to roads to cities and more minor intelligent devices.These are not yet intelligences like our own. But some of their greatest potential lies in the ways we humans might cooperate with them to form new hybrid systems that deliver the best of each. On top of all this, new understandings of the mind and brain are helping to break down the old boundaries between the psychological and the physical, as we learn not just how deeply the body matters to the mind, but also how the brain helps predict and construct the world of human experience.We now glimpse the next steps in human cultural and cognitive evolution, continuing the trend that started with the arrival of human language and the (much later) invention of writing and the external storage and transmission of ideas. The new steps herald an age of fluidity and demand answers to a host of questions and issues that need to be addressed in conversations like this one. The two most important such questions are simply: How should we negotiate this dauntingly large space of human possibility? And what costs are we willing to tolerate along the way?The first is a question of practice, the second of ethics. Practically speaking, it will not be easy to decide in a world of so many possible ways of being, so many enhancements and augmentations, and so many social practices, which ones are for us. Here, immersive virtual reality may play a useful role, allowing the cheap and easy, if somewhat superficial, exploration of multiple ways of being. For example, work from the BeAnotherLab uses immersive virtual reality, with body tracking, to enable us to (in a small way) experience being taller, shorter, or having a differently gendered body.Ethically speaking, we need to ask what new costs and inequalities the freedoms and augmentations of some may mean for others. We need to ask if we are willing to tolerate some inequality as part of the rollout process for a more fluid and interconnected world. Issues of privacy and the right to control (including to trade or sell) our personal information are vividly with us. Not knowing quite where we as protected selves stop and the world around us begins, law and policy struggle to decide if (for example) information stored on our phones is enough like information stored in our heads to warrant the same protections. Law, education and social policy currently lag behind many interacting waves of change. What is up for grabs is what we humans are, and what we will become.

{"Headline": "13 Faces That Tell the Story of 2018", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "Usually you only get to dream about a candidate like Chrissy Houlahan. People in the Philadelphia suburbs actually get to vote for her.She\u2019s brainy: a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering from Stanford, a master\u2019s in technology and policy from M.I.T. She\u2019s bold: service in the U.S. Air Force. She has entrepreneurial bona fides from her years as the chief operating officer of an athletic wear company but also had a top job for a group promoting childhood literacy. She\u2019s a wife and mother, with two grown daughters.So why, at 51, has she set her sights on the House of Representatives, when she never ran for any office before?The answer is Nov. 8, 2016. To vote for Hillary Clinton, she put on a pantsuit. Her gay daughter wore all white, honoring suffragists. That night they broke out the Champagne. \u201cI thought that history would be made,\u201d Houlahan recalled.When it wasn\u2019t, her father, a Holocaust survivor, cried, fearing what Donald Trump\u2019s victory could mean for the vulnerable and the powerless. Her daughter panicked about L.G.B.T. people. \u201cUnnerving,\u201d Houlahan called it, and her response was \u201cto be part of the solution.\u201d She has since raised about $3 million and emerged as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s best bets to turn a red seat blue.There are many ways to measure the urgency with which Democrats are approaching the 2018 midterms but perhaps none better than the mettle, motivations and number \u2014 much larger than in recent congressional elections \u2014 of first-time candidates who have jumped into the fray.They\u2019re creatures of an atypically tense moment with especially high stakes. They\u2019re mirrors of the anxieties that so many Americans feel. They\u2019re emblems of a yearning for new faces and approaches. They\u2019re the year\u2019s biggest stars and stories.\u201cThese aren\u2019t people who\u2019ve done debate club and gone through and checked all the boxes to become perfect political candidates,\u201d said Katie Hill, 30, an advocate for the homeless who is the Democratic nominee in Southern California\u2019s 25th District, considered a tossup. \u201cThese are people who have tried to do something different \u2014 serve in the military, do social work, be teachers.\u201dHill is trying to unseat a Republican incumbent, Steve Knight, 51, in a patch of exurban Los Angeles that Clinton won in 2016. Her campaign is built partly around her deep roots there, in contrast to the unsuccessful Democratic nominee two years ago, a Yale Law grad who\u2019d moved into the district a month before announcing his candidacy.Halfway across the country, in the 14th District in Illinois, Lauren Underwood, 31, is also the Democratic nominee for a Republican-held seat, also making her first bid for office and also displaying a sensibility that\u2019s hardly run-of-the-mill in politics.When she talked about campaigning as an African-American woman and shrugging off the sexism in particular that she encounters, she invoked Beyonc\u00e9 and her alter ego. \u201cShe steps onstage and she\u2019s Sasha Fierce,\u201d Underwood explained over breakfast at the EggCited Pancake House in Naperville. \u201cIt\u2019s just this armor. I\u2019m very clear that Lauren Underwood and Lauren Underwood for Congress are different. And people can say all kinds of nasty things on the internet about Lauren Underwood for Congress. It is no reflection of who I am.\u201dUnderwood is a registered nurse with a master\u2019s in public health. (Her sister, Lindsey Underwood, is an editor in the Smarter Living section of The Times.) Her concerns about American health care, informed by her own diagnosis as a child with a manageable heart condition, were the main prompt for her candidacy, though she quickly discovered an aptitude for the campaign trail. In the district\u2019s Democratic primary, she trounced the six white men running against her, getting about 57 percent of the vote. Her nearest competitor got about 13 percent. Her general-election prospects are iffy, given the Republican tilt of the district, but this is an unpredictable year.Most if not all of the 13 first-time candidates photographed by Damon Winter of The Times \u2014 a representative sample \u2014 had a specific issue or cluster of issues that propelled them into politics. But the issues themselves varied widely, demonstrating how much in America right now seems damaged or just plain broken.The state of health care, coupled with questions about how safe the Trump administration is keeping America, galvanized the Democratic nominee in Michigan\u2019s Eighth District, Elissa Slotkin, 42, who has given party leaders hope for snatching another congressional seat. After Sept. 11, she decided to make a career in intelligence and national security and held a succession of jobs at the C.I.A., the White House, the State Department and the Department of Defense. She worked under a Republican president and under a Democratic one. And like most first-time candidates, she wondered why the parties can\u2019t cooperate, insisted that they must and expressed a strong desire to help make that happen.\u201cIn a different world,\u201d Slotkin said, \u201cwe would be able to lock a bunch of people in a room and figure out how to correctly reform the Affordable Care Act.\u201d But in this one, \u201cbecause of partisan vitriol, nothing can get done.\u201dHe was sitting in a busy restaurant on Staten Island, which makes up most of the 11th District. The district is represented by a Republican, Dan Donovan, who is favored to keep his seat. Rose, 31, claimed complete confidence that he\u2019d stage an upset. He noted that although he was a political novice with little name recognition, he got more than 64 percent of the vote in a primary field of six Democrats.Besides, Rose said, he\u2019s a fighter. A former Army captain with a shaved head, a square jaw and rapid-fire speech, he led a platoon in Afghanistan when he was 26. He was awarded a Purple Heart after sustaining head and knee injuries there.Take Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee \u2014 and the favorite to win \u2014 in New Jersey\u2019s 11th District, where the Republican incumbent is retiring. Sherrill, 46, is a former federal prosecutor and before that spent nearly 10 years in the Navy, much of it as a helicopter pilot. She believes that voters value that service.\u201cThey have an idea of veterans as people they can count on to go to Washington and continue to put the people of the country first,\u201d she said.Hegar and her husband have two children, ages 1\u00bd and almost 4, and she said that she agonizes over what America\u2019s crumbling alliances, Trump\u2019s attack on the judiciary and his demonization of the media could mean to their futures.\u201cWhen my youngest was a little over 5 months old, he was crying in the middle of the night,\u201d she recalled in an interview in her campaign office in Round Rock, Tex., just north of Austin. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hungry cry or a diaper cry. He had either had his first nightmare or heard a noise \u2014 something had scared him. It broke my heart. I\u2019m bouncing with him and singing to him and saying, \u2018Mommy is going to take care of you. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u2019 And I started realizing that if I meant that, then I had to do this, because I do think my children will look back on this time and ask me, \u2018What were you doing?\u2019 And I have to tell them that I was doing everything I could.\u201dIn New Jersey\u2019s Third District, Andy Kim, 36, has trumpeted that he\u2019s outraising the Republican incumbent despite his pledge of no corporate PAC money. That\u2019s a promise that a majority of first-time candidates in the Democratic Party have apparently made.They're an impressive and impressively eclectic group. The Democratic nominee in Texas\u2019s 32nd District, Colin Allred, 35, is a Berkeley-educated lawyer who worked in the Obama administration, but he also played several seasons of professional football with the Tennessee Titans.Leslie Cockburn, 65, the Democratic nominee in Virginia\u2019s Fifth District, was a television news producer whose 35-year career in journalism included \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS, \u201cFrontline\u201d on PBS and two Emmys.Kathy Manning, 61, the Democratic nominee for North Carolina\u2019s 13th District, is a celebrated Jewish philanthropist who was the first woman to head the Jewish Federations of North America.Like Houlahan, Cockburn and Manning are taking a big swerve to enter politics and doing so relatively late in the game. But for them, as for younger candidates, Trump\u2019s rise and reign call for extraordinary measures. And if you\u2019re a Democrat who ever did or might aspire to political office, this year may be your best opportunity. \u201cThe chaos that\u2019s going on in the Trump administration and the things happening in Washington created a unique atmosphere,\u201d Allred said, adding, \u201cSo many of our fundamental values are on the line.\u201dNext door to Texas, in New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small, 33, wagered that while the state\u2019s Second District, where she grew up, was represented by a Republican and had voted for Trump in 2016, it was potentially fertile ground for Democrats this year. So Torres Small, a former U.S. Senate aide whose husband is in the state\u2019s Legislature, began trying to rustle up the right candidate.\u201cI called some people,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked a few folks to run.\u201d And somewhere along the way, she had another idea, one that would break the chain of white men who have represented the district since its creation in 1969.\u201cI thought: Why isn\u2019t my name on that list?\u201d she said, articulating a question that, in some form, is asked by every first-time candidate. \u201cWhat if the person who\u2019s supposed to run is me?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Should we be surprised that a man who\u2019s so frequently compared to a needy adolescent has chosen Twitter as his favorite medium?A corollary to Erikson\u2019s observation might be that of David Elkind, another developmental psychologist, who in 1967 wrote about the \u201cimaginary audience\u201d phenomenon in adolescents \u2014 the idea that teenagers somehow see themselves as stars of their own productions, believing themselves to be watched by an eager, if sometimes judgmental, public.And if we were being honest, we\u2019d probably concede that political and opinion Twitter has made many otherwise well-adjusted people a bit obsessed with their new publics, checking just a bit too frequently whether that brilliant aper\u00e7u they just typed has begun its viral zoom. (Politicians and pundits: not exactly creatures known for their secure egos.)A few years back, the sociologist Robert Faris described high school to me as \u201ca large box of strangers.\u201d The kids don\u2019t necessarily share much in common, after all; they just happen to be the same age and live in the same place. So what do they do in this giant box to give it order, structure? They divide into tribes and resort to aggression to determine status.The same can be said of Twitter. It\u2019s the ultimate large box of strangers. As in high school, Twitter denizens divide into tribes and bully to gain status; as in high school, too-confessional musings and dumb mistakes turn up in the wrong hands and end in humiliation. We become, in other words, teenagers, who are notoriously poor models of self-regulation \u2014 in large part because their prefrontal cortices are still developing and their dopamine circuits are pretty busy seeking stimulation. The psychologist Laurence Steinberg describes adolescents as \u201ccars with powerful accelerators and weak brakes.\u201d The neuroscientist BJ Casey deems them \u201cmore Kirk than Spock.\u201dThe hormonal Twitter brain may even explain the typographical preferences of our president. You know who likes all caps? Teenagers. BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THINGS, O.K.?Do we really want something so important, so vital, as our political conversation to be conducted in a teenage register and defined by teenage behaviors? Do we really want to have this discussion on a medium that makes us lose sight of our adult selves?Not all of Twitter is uncivil. It varies a great deal by neighborhood. Doctor Twitter is not real estate Twitter is not gardening-enthusiast Twitter. Not all of political Twitter is devoid of rational discussion, either. There are thoughtful participants who make me think, make me laugh, direct me to news and analyses I\u2019d never otherwise see.And yes, I\u2019m as susceptible to Twitter excesses and indiscretions as anyone. I\u2019ve tried recently to scale back. (I know. You didn\u2019t notice. I was never particularly good at it.) But really, I should stop. I should show up for things I love \u2014 movie and book news, pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope, funerals. Twitter does a beautiful funeral. Remembering-Philip-Roth Twitter was so much better than Trump\u2019s-Deep-State-Paranoia Twitter, the Side B option of my feed that day.It\u2019s probably not an accident that it takes a glimpse of our own mortality to turn us into our most deliberative, mature selves on this medium.Most parents of teenagers will tell you that the best response to adolescent deviltry, tough as it is, is to let kids make their own mistakes and hope that one day they realize they\u2019re inflicting harm.The problem is, Twitter rewards us for our mistakes. It isn\u2019t designed to let us grow up. The time in our lives we were so happy to leave behind \u2014 the time cruelties were experienced with an especial intensity \u2014 we are living all over again. For all we know, the effects of the new unkindness we\u2019ve sown may be just as hard to undo.Jennifer Senior, who most recently was a book critic for The Times, will be joining Opinion as an audio columnist in September.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Extinct Cave Bear DNA Lives On in Brown Bears", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesModern brown bears are carrying a bit of genetic material passed down from the cave bear, in a study that suggests extinction does not always vanquish a species\u2019 genes. About 25,000 years ago in Western Europe, the last cave bear drew its final breath and the species went extinct. The finding challenges our view of extinction, said Ludovic Orlando, a professor at the Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who was not involved in the research.\u201cExtinction does not imply that genetic material is gone forever,\u201d he said via email.In the new study, researchers initially set out to learn more about the cave bear by studying its genetics. Almost as a lark they compared the genetic sequence they\u2019d derived for the cave bear with an existing sequence of a brown bear, said Axel Barlow, the lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Potsdam in Germany. The results surprised them. \u201cThere was a really quite obvious signal of hybridization between these species,\u201d Dr. Barlow said. Wondering whether their results were a fluke, the team then compared the cave bear genome to that of seven other brown bears \u2014 one ancient and six modern \u2014 and found the same genetic mixing. Cave bears contributed from just under one percent to 2.4 percent of the genomes of brown bears, the study showed.\u201cWe did not expect to find this at all because they\u2019re really quite diverse in terms of their evolution,\u201d Dr. Barlow said.The team was also able to determine that the genes flowed both ways between species, with the cave bears also carrying some brown bear DNA. The most recent transfer of genes came from the cave bear to the brown, the study found. Brown bears are more closely related to polar bears than they were to cave bears from whom they diverged more than a million years ago, he said. Cave bears were largely herbivores, while brown bears are meat-eaters and about 20 percent smaller than cave bears, with more delicate bones. A brown bear would probably have looked \u201cwimpy\u201d next to a cave bear, he said.They both shared roughly the same territory until about 25,000 years ago in Europe, Dr. Barlow said. Two Alaskan brown bears also showed the presence of cave bear DNA, suggesting an unexpected diffusion of genes that needs to be investigated further, he said. Pontus Skoglund of the Francis Crick Institute\u2019s Ancient Genomics Laboratory said in some ways it was not surprising that similar creatures who shared the same geography would intermingle and have overlapping genetics. But it does force scientists to change their definition of a \u201cspecies,\u201d as animals that don\u2019t interbreed, he said. \u201cIt confronts this idea of species that many people have in biology and emphasizes how we really need to take in this empirical data that gene flow does occur,\u201d Dr. Skoglund said.

{"Headline": "Indigenous Australians Use Tech to Expose Police Abuse", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPERTH, Australia \u2014 In one video, a black prisoner screams \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times as he is pinned down by a group of guards. In another, a police car swerves to run down a black teenager. As the young man has a seizure in the street, the officers handcuff him rather than offer first aid.Though reminiscent of recordings that have made headlines in the United States, the videos were not shot in New York or Ferguson, Mo. They were taken in Sydney and Perth, Australia.Activists in Australia say such videos of police officers abusing Indigenous Australians are an important way to expose systemic brutality, and they have begun teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people how to use technology to protect their rights \u2014 and themselves.\u201cBut if it\u2019s not on camera it never happened, our boys and girls are \u2018making it up,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt is the legacy of the white man\u2019s legal system, but vision, a picture \u2014 it\u2019s worth 1,000 words.\u201dMr. Eades knows the power of such images. He posted a video to Facebook of the altercation between the police and Mr. Farmer that went viral. The video helped lead to the suspension of the officer driving the car and an investigation by the Western Australia Police Force.This month, Mr. Eades invited civil rights activists from the National Justice Project, a Sydney-based nonprofit legal service, to Perth to teach Indigenous people how smartphones and social media can be used to expose police misconduct. Inspired by Black Lives Matter, the legal activists have traveled across Australia hosting workshops as part of a program called Copwatch.Indigenous Australians are disproportionally targets of the police, increasing the likelihood of their arrest, abuse and imprisonment. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are incarcerated at 13 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians. They make up 27 percent of Australia\u2019s prisoners, compared with 3 percent of the overall population.The Copwatch workshops, activists said, are intended to teach people their legal rights and how to safely record interactions with police officers.\u201cStand back, don\u2019t become part of it, de-escalate,\u201d said George Newhouse, a lawyer for the National Justice Project, relating some of the advice his colleagues offer. When recording video, he added, \u201cmake sure your footage is saved to the cloud. In some situations, police try to delete videos.\u201dParticipants were also instructed to disable the facial-recognition and thumbprint-scanning features used to unlock some smartphones because they can be used by the police to access a person\u2019s device against his or her will.Copwatch has also developed an app that can be used to record and store interactions with the police, as well as to alert a user\u2019s contacts if that person is in a potentially dangerous situation and where.Among the presenters at the Copwatch workshop was Shaun Harris, whose niece, a 22-year-old Yamatji woman, died in police custody in Western Australia in 2014. The woman, identified by only her surname, Dhu, after death in accordance with an Aboriginal custom, was arrested on charges related to unpaid fines but died in custody from septicemia and pneumonia after she was denied medical care, according to the findings of a police investigation.Using footage captured on a closed-circuit camera from inside her cell, Ms. Dhu\u2019s family has taken her case to the Australian Human Rights Commission.\u201cThat footage,\u201d Mr. Harris said, \u201cwill be vital.\u201dThe proliferation of recordings capturing abuse of Indigenous Australians by the police, particularly in Western Australia, has led the authorities to acknowledge the scale of the issue.In a speech last month, Commissioner Chris Dawson of the Western Australia Police Force recognized the \u201csignificant role\u201d the police had played in traumatizing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\u201cToday on behalf of the Western Australian police force, I would like to say sorry to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for our participation in past wrongful actions that have caused immeasurable pain and suffering,\u201d he said.Last week, Commissioner Dawson announced that body cameras would be required for all officers in Western Australia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Urban Meyer and the New Era of College Football: Winning Isn\u2019t Everything", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn College FootballHe has shepherded Heisman Trophy winners and top draft picks, like Tim Tebow and Alex Smith, and has won relentlessly, guiding his teams at Florida and then Ohio State to three national championships since 2006. In his six seasons in Columbus, Meyer\u2019s Buckeyes have gone 73-8, giving him a higher winning percentage than Nick Saban has in 11 seasons at Alabama.Then, in a matter of hours Wednesday, he became arguably the most radioactive coach in the game. Ohio State placed Meyer, 54, on paid administrative leave while it investigates whether he knew about domestic violence allegations against a longtime assistant. The move signaled that Meyer\u2019s immaculate on-field performance \u2014 and the $7.6 million salary he is slated to receive this year after signing an extension \u2014 may not be enough to save his job.On Thursday, the university\u2019s board of trustees announced that it had formed a special independent board for the investigation, saying that the working group would direct the investigative team. The panel includes the trustees Alex Fischer, Janet Porter and Alex Shumate; Jo Ann Davidson, a former speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives; Craig Morford, a former acting United States deputy attorney general; and Carter Stewart, a former United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. Also Thursday, the university announced that ordinary media availabilities with the acting head coach, Ryan Day, and players had been canceled for the time being.That Meyer\u2019s job hangs in the balance despite superlative coaching and no known risk of N.C.A.A. sanctions is the latest example of an unmistakable shift in big-time college sports.In earlier years, teams stomached just about anything from the head coach so long as he kept the victories coming. Losing was the only sin. Not anymore.\u201cTwenty years ago, there would not have been the sensitivities that there are today,\u201d said Bill Carr, a former Florida athletic director who advises on coaching searches. \u201cIn my opinion, that has dramatically changed.\u201dRichard Southall, a professor of sport management at the University of South Carolina who specializes in sports ethics, sped up the timeline: \u201cI think we are at a different point than we were five years ago,\u201d he said.Meyer\u2019s swift downfall began when the independent journalist Brett McMurphy reported Wednesday morning on his Facebook page that Meyer\u2019s wife knew of a 2015 incident in which Meyer\u2019s longtime assistant, Zach Smith, was accused of shoving and choking his ex-wife, Courtney Smith. The article cited text messages that spoke of Meyer\u2019s having confronted Zach Smith about it. Last week, Meyer, who fired Smith after a recent trespassing charge and protection order were reported, denied knowing about it.In a statement Wednesday, Ohio State said, \u201cWe are focused on supporting our players and on getting to the truth as expeditiously as possible.\u201d Ohio State\u2019s investigation could clear Meyer, allowing him to return to the sidelines. Given the current climate, that might prove problematic.Winning is still valued in college sports \u2014 astronomical salaries indicate that it is valued more than ever. As increased revenue has leveled the playing field for less heralded colleges, eroding the advantages blue-blood programs used to enjoy, the importance of having an elite coach has grown.But times are changing. Art Briles almost single-handedly made Baylor\u2019s football program relevant, but after an investigation revealed a culture of coddling players accused of and charged with sexual assault, he was dismissed in May 2015.The Hall of Fame basketball coach Rick Pitino withstood both personal and N.C.A.A. scandals at Louisville but was forced out after last year\u2019s college basketball recruiting indictments.Hugh Freeze led Mississippi to its second 10-win season since 1971, but phone records showing he had called an escort service were enough to end his tenure in Oxford last year.If in the past winning was the only thing that mattered, these days it increasingly seems to resemble the easy part \u2014 particularly if a coach has an established track record.\u201cA guy like Urban Meyer, Mike Krzyzewski, Rick Pitino, you\u2019re never going to fire them because they have a bad year, or two or three bad years,\u201d said Bob Lattinville, an agent with Spencer Fane. \u201cThey have tenure \u2014 unless something like this happens.\u201dMeyer\u2019s problems come on the heels of other athletics scandals at Ohio State, including a lawsuit alleging that in 2014 an assistant coach had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 16-year-old diver who said there was no adequate way for her to report it, and the university\u2019s announcement last month that an investigation had uncovered more than 100 former students who said Richard H. Strauss, a former team doctor, had sexually abused them.Even before the #MeToo movement began last fall, there was a particular allergy in college sports, Southall said, to misconduct that is sexual or includes violence against women. The contract extension Meyer signed this year included language about failing to report violations of the university\u2019s sexual misconduct policy to the Title IX office.Such language is now common in contracts, Lattinville said.\u201cIt was the law since 1972, when Title IX was adopted,\u201d Lattinville said, \u201cbut as is so often the case, the social climate dictates what portions of a law get applied. In the #MeToo climate, it\u2019s all the more important.\u201dIf you put college sports fans from an earlier era in a time machine, they might wonder why people thought Meyer\u2019s job was in serious danger. They might point out that he has a 90 percent winning percentage. And a perfect 6-0 record versus Michigan!In the 1970s and \u201980s, Barry Switzer, Oklahoma\u2019s football coach, and Bob Knight, the basketball coach at Indiana, won three national titles each, as well as boatloads of games, even as they ensnared themselves in the kinds of scandals that might not have been tolerated from other university employees.Switzer lost his job only when the Sooners were hit with severe N.C.A.A. penalties. Knight held on until 2000, and only after he grabbed a student\u2019s arm soon after a player accused Knight of choking him. One year later, Knight was hired by Texas Tech.In 2002, Iowa\u2019s basketball coach, Steve Alford, stood by a player accused of raping another athlete. Alford apologized in 2013.In 2008, an investigation revealed extensive lawlessness in the Washington football team\u2019s 2000 locker room even as its coach, Rick Neuheisel, began a tenure at U.C.L.A.In 2014, Florida State\u2019s Jimbo Fisher enthusiastically defended quarterback Jameis Winston after an incomplete investigation into charges that the player had sexually assaulted a woman, one year after the pair won a national championship.As the new head coach at Texas A&M, Fisher might take a different tack if confronted by the same problem just four years later.\u201cWhat happens off the field or the court,\u201d Lattinville said, \u201cis more likely to spell your doom than losing ballgames.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I made a shortcut version of the pickled red onions in the first step. Here\u2019s how to do it: Skip the boiling water and cover the slices with rice wine vinegar, lime juice and a pinch of sugar. Let it all sit as long as possible, but at least 15 minutes. Store the onions in the fridge, where they will turn fuchsia and bring you joy every time you see and use them (in salads and sandwiches, on tacos and quesadillas, like the one below).I\u2019m offering you this quesadilla recipe for three reasons. One, it uses some of the same ingredients as Scarlett\u2019s Tuna Salad, above, but the two dishes read entirely differently, which makes them a smart weeknight pair and easy to shop for; you can also top these with the leftover picked red onions. Two, you could make extra chicken or steak from the recipes below to use in the filling, or you could omit the meat altogether and just do cheese. Three, quesadillas are fun. Serve with black beans, and be generous with the salsa. (Add more cucumber and herbs if you\u2019d like it to have more of a salady feel.)Your choice for these juicy, citrusy, summery chicken thighs: bone-in or boneless, on the grill or in the oven.

She tried unsuccessfully to reach the principal, she said, before deciding to post a photo of the exercise on Facebook. It caught the attention of other parents and a Cuyahoga Falls councilman, Adam Miller.The assignment was not fostering a \u201cculture of caring,\u201d Councilman Miller wrote. \u201cThis is building a culture of animosity, antagonism & hostility!\u201dThe teacher, who has taught math and social studies at the school for 15 years, will receive a \u201cstrongly worded letter\u201d in his personnel file indicating that he \u201cerred in judgment,\u201d Dr. Nichols said in an interview on Tuesday.The teacher did not respond to multiple requests for comment this week.Cuyahoga Falls is more than 90 percent white, according to the latest census figures.\u201cThey call it Caucasian Falls,\u201d said Andrea Hensley, whose 12-year-old daughter completed the assignment in her math class. \u201cI think it\u2019s the reason the community has to address diversity in some of these subjects, because the kids don\u2019t have the exposure unless it\u2019s sought out.\u201dHer daughter identifies as gay and wasn\u2019t upset by the exercise, she said. She said her daughter chose the gay athlete.\u201cI think our kids are confronted by these labels every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so what are we hiding from?\u201dParents said the students chose to focus only on the more innocuous labels during their discussions, rather than the hot-button issues of race and religion.Cassie Jebber, whose son is in seventh grade, said \u201cmy heart sunk\u201d when she discovered how the characters were described. But then she learned that her son had focused mainly on the characteristics that would allow each candidate to help others on the new planet.\u201cWhat they were talking about together as a class was how to build this better world,\u201d she said. But the labels were not shocking. \u201cWhen I have CNN on and our politicians are speaking, they hear much worse.\u201dHer son wanted to save the doctor, because he would be able to help people survive, Ms. Jebber said.\u201cHe didn\u2019t pick the police officer because they were really hoping in this new world there wasn\u2019t going to be a lot of crime,\u201d she added. (The police officer was described as a \u201cracist\u201d who has been \u201caccused of using excessive force.\u201d)Dr. Nichols said that when he became aware of the exercise last week, he questioned whether it was age-appropriate for seventh and eighth graders.\u201cI do think that maturity plays a role in it,\u201d he said.Ms. Blair, the director of the diversity and inclusion center, explained that, ideally, students will think deeply about their selections and how the rationale plays out in other areas of their lives. It is often uncomfortable, she added.\u201cTalking about issues of difference around our identities isn\u2019t something that we do often, but we should,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not talking and having these conversations, how can we move forward?\u201dSusan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Myth of Watergate Bipartisanship", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Republicans stuck with their president, right up to the end.Mr. Conway served as counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon. Mr. Marshall is an assistant professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern.Reporters and political commentators often express frustrated surprise at the steadfast support of President Trump from most Republicans in the House and Senate. But they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 it has happened before. Dispiriting, perhaps, but not shocking or unprecedented. In late 1972, when a Democratic congressman, Wright Patman of Texas, began to investigate connections between Mr. Nixon\u2019s aides and the Watergate burglary, the House Republican leader, Gerald Ford of Michigan (who later succeeded Mr. Nixon as president), called it a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d according to the historian Stanley I. Kutler in his book \u201cThe Wars of Watergate.\u201d There is a big difference, of course, between the Watergate era and now. Republicans now control both houses of Congress; in the 1970s the Democrats held the reins. In early 1973 Senate Democrats led the charge to form a special committee to focus on Watergate. While the Senate Watergate Committee was being created, Republican Senator Edward Gurney of Florida belittled the investigation as \u201cone of those political wing-dings that happen every political year.\u201d Ted Stevens, a Republican senator from Alaska, repeated Mr. Ford\u2019s warning that the investigation could become a \u201cpolitical witch hunt,\u201d according to Mr. Kutler.When Mr. Baker famously asked, \u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d during the Watergate hearings, he meant to protect Mr. Nixon in the mistaken belief that the president didn\u2019t know about the Watergate cover-up until many months after it occurred. The question backfired once evidence mounted that Mr. Nixon was involved in the cover-up from the start, and Mr. Baker eventually became a critic of the president.After it was revealed in July 1973 that Mr. Nixon had secretly taped conversations, Mr. Ford said he found nothing wrong with the president\u2019s practices. Republican Senator John Tower of Texas later warned Congress not to get caught up in \u201cthe hysteria of Watergate.\u201dMr. Latta and most other Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted against all articles of impeachment on July 27-30, 1974. Eleven of 17 Republicans voted against the obstruction-of-justice article, 10 of 17 opposed the abuse-of-power resolution, and 15 of 17 voted against the article based on the president\u2019s refusal to produce tapes in response to the committee\u2019s subpoenas. More Republicans abandoned Mr. Nixon on the obstruction-of-justice charge only after he complied with the Supreme Court\u2019s order on Aug. 5, releasing the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tapes that proved he had ordered a cover-up of the Watergate crimes. Still, many party members of the Judiciary Committee later filed reports arguing that Mr. Nixon was innocent of two of the three articles of impeachment sent to the full House.During Watergate, most Republicans in Congress supported Mr. Nixon until the tapes provided undeniable evidence that he had obstructed justice. It remains to be seen whether current party leaders will support Mr. Trump no matter what evidence Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation unearths about the conduct of the president and his aides. Such behavior might be unwarranted, but it won\u2019t be unprecedented.Michael Conway served as counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment inquiry of President Richard Nixon.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has soared more than 320 percent since emerging from the rubble of the financial crisis in March 2009, creating more than $18 trillion in wealth.At 3,453 days, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has reached a milestone: It is the longest bull market on record if you count a 19.9 percent decline in 1990 as the start of its rival.

The duration counts all calendar days.\u00a0|\u00a0Sources: MacroTrends; Yardeni Research; Thomson Reuters\u00a0|\u00a0By Karl RussellBut the gains haven\u2019t been spread among the masses. Stock market wealth is heavily concentrated among the richest families.As the stock market surged, prices for homes \u2014 the most important source and store of wealth for the American middle class \u2014 recovered much more slowly from the Great Recession and housing bust. Incomes, too, have only recently surpassed pre-crisis levels, despite steady economic growth in recent years.\u201cThis is the decade in which wealth inequality has increased the most in U.S. history,\u201d said Moritz Schularick, a professor of economics at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics in Germany who has written about the distribution of wealth in the United States. \u201cThe driver has been the very unequal gains in the very sharp performance of the stock market relative to the sharp drop of the housing market.\u201dThere is some debate over whether this bull market technically deserves the award for the longest on record. Bull markets are defined as a stretch when the stock market rises without suffering a 20 percent drop.At issue is a market run from October 1990 to March 2000, a 3,452-day period that was preceded by a slump of 19.92 percent. Wednesday, despite the S. & P. 500\u2019s ticking down 0.04 percent, was the current upswing\u2019s 3,453rd day.Statistical sticklers, though, don\u2019t round up, in which case that earlier boom started in December 1987 \u2014 a 4,494-day stretch that would retain the crown.In terms of staying power, the current bull market has some advantages over past sprees, when a surging stock market fused financial speculation into the fabric of American life.In the 1920s, Americans dived into the market to snap up shares of a range of companies churning out the technological marvels of the day, like automobiles and radios. In the 1980s, as the country recovered from a deep recession, Wall Street enjoyed a broad boom grounded in Reagan-era deregulation and economic growth.In the 1990s, retail investors poured their money into high-flying, and in many cases profit-free, companies developing around the emerging technology known as the internet. And in the years before the financial crisis of 2008, the stock boom was coupled with the excesses of the housing market and Wall Street.\u201cYou were in some sort of a dreamy state, and it couldn\u2019t last,\u201d Allen Sinai, chief economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics and a former chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said of the dot-com era. \u201cThe taxi drivers, the elevator operators, everybody was into the stock market and buying. It was euphoria.\u201d\u201cToday the sentiment that\u2019s out there is actually more to the opposite,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s cautious. It\u2019s careful. \u2018Recession is coming tomorrow. How long can this go on?\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s a natural question to ask. Those euphoric periods ended in spectacular stock market crashes, in 1929, 1987 and the early 2000s and during the financial crisis.But the same frothiness doesn\u2019t exist now, suggesting there is little immediate risk that the market will do a 180.Price-to-earnings ratios, a proxy of investor enthusiasm, are nowhere near the peaks seen during the dot-com boom.The share of the American public that has any money in the stock market remains mired well below the level that prevailed before the financial crisis. It\u2019s concentrated among the wealthy, with the top 10 percent owning roughly 84 percent of the value of all shares owned by households, according to research by Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the wealth structure of the American population. It was 81 percent in 2007.Even as the S. & P. 500 charges higher, retail investors continue to exit the equity markets. Between mid-March and late July, investors pulled some $40 billion out of American mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, while pumping some $80 billion into the safety of bond funds, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm.\u201cFor most of this bull market, the individual investor has largely sat out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a co-founder of Bespoke. \u201cCompared to the 1990s, when individual investors were actively looking for stock ideas, today there\u2019s a lot less of that.\u201dAs many people sit on the sidelines, the divergence between the wealthy and the rest of the country has widened. In 2016, the last year with solid data, the wealth of the median American household \u2014 which is heavily concentrated in the home itself \u2014 was 34 percent below where it was just before the Great Recession, according to research from Mr. Wolff.That\u2019s not to say the average American is in an especially sour mood. Consumers in the United States are feeling good at the moment \u2014 and for good reason. At 3.9 percent, unemployment is near an 18-year low. The economy grew at an annual pace of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest clip since 2014.And that economic strength \u2014 along with the deep cuts in corporate tax rates that President Trump signed into law in late 2017 \u2014 has translated into gushers of profits for large American companies. Second-quarter profits for companies in the S. & P. 500 are up roughly 25 percent compared with a year earlier, after a similar rise in the first quarter.The boom in earnings has helped the markets fend off various economic and geopolitical concerns.After peaking in late January, stocks plummeted by more than 10 percent in the following weeks on worries that the Federal Reserve would begin to raise interest rates at a faster cadence than previously expected, choking off growth. Then in March, the eruption of the trade war sent shares sharply lower again.More recently, the nose-dive of the Turkish lira and signs of weakness in the Chinese economy raised the prospect that problems in emerging markets could hamper global growth.But for many seasoned stock market observers, the existence of continuing worries about whether the bull market can last is a strong piece of evidence that it can.According to this line of thinking, the moment to worry is when there is broad agreement that the market can only go higher. That would suggest there is little fresh money available to drive stocks to new heights.\u201cWhen the bears give up, that\u2019s when I would start to worry,\u201d said Laszlo Birinyi, who started analyzing the stock market for the storied New York investment firm Salomon Brothers in 1976, before founding his own stock market research firm, Birinyi Associates. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the length the current bull market. It is nearly 10 years, not 10 years. The article also referred imprecisely to the share of stocks owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of households in the United States. It is 84 percent of the value of shares owned by households, not 84 percent of all outstanding shares.Advertisement"}

ICE\u2019s campaign of psychological manipulation has triggered a perpetual state of fear among undocumented immigrants in the United States, even among those who live in so-called sanctuary cities. While ICE\u2019s main intimidation tactic is raiding immigrants\u2019 homes and businesses, to me it seems their influence is showing through just as clearly in the constant acts of self-policing their targets are now compelled to undertake. ICE\u2019s menacing public statements and news of its enforcement campaigns has created widespread fear among undocumented people, pushing this already vulnerable community deeper into the margins.In the Bay Area, where I made this film, the San Francisco Rapid Response Network serves as the front line of defense on behalf of undocumented residents. The network, the first of its kind in the country, maintains a 24-hour hotline where residents can call to report a raid or suspected ICE presence in their neighborhood. From there, volunteers are dispatched to document the incident peacefully, gathering evidence to protect immigrants\u2019 rights in a form of civilian oversight. Timing is essential. The faster the network can reach an immigrant in detention, the higher the chances of getting the person out. Many times, calls come in too late. Every time the president talks of a border wall or the head of ICE makes statements about ramping up enforcement, calls to the hotline spike. Much of the network\u2019s time is diverted to combating rumors and absorbing hostility, mostly from area codes far outside California.I know firsthand how fear can erode neighborhood unity and stifle progress. I grew up in the Near Northside neighborhood of Houston, a community of documented and undocumented immigrants where my parents settled after arriving from Mexico. Most families were of mixed status, so everyone kept their head down for fear of incriminating themselves or someone they loved.The consequences of this new normal are not limited to the immigrants targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. When activities that make up the sweetness of daily life \u2014 taking your kids to school, eating at your favorite neighborhood diner, riding the train to work \u2014 are threatened, so too is the vibrant beauty of a place like San Francisco. Yet after spending many months observing the tireless work of the Rapid Response Network, I also saw how a community\u2019s response to adversity can bring neighbors closer together. Here, hundreds of volunteers from all over the city have interrupted their lives to stand by their neighbors \u2014 doing everything they can to ensure that here there is, in fact, sanctuary.

{"Headline": "Racism at American Pools Isn\u2019t New: A Look at a Long History", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe poolside confrontations keep coming.The encounters, some captured on video, have prompted widespread anger and resulted in consequences for white people involved. But they are hardly new: The United States has a long history of people of color facing harassment and racism at swimming pools.Pools are supposed to be places to relax, but ever since they exploded in popularity about a century ago, they have served as flash points for racial conflict \u2014 vulnerable spaces where prejudices have intensified and violence has often broken out.Here\u2019s a look at the resistance black Americans have faced in trying to access pools.In the 1920s and 1930s, pool construction accelerated as cities built lavish public facilities, Jeff Wiltse, a University of Montana history professor and author of \u201cContested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America,\u201d said in an interview.In many cities, white and black people historically swam together, separated by sex. But norms began to shift as pools multiplied, with men and women increasingly swimming together, eliciting racist anxieties.In 1931, Pittsburgh debuted a new facility at the popular Highland Park, featuring a sandy beach with two large pools, according to the book. But, unlike the city\u2019s other pools, men and women could swim together there.On opening day, thousands showed up, including many black residents who were asked by pool attendants to provide \u201chealth certificates\u201d proving they were disease-free. Several later complained to an official, who assured them access going forward.The opposition persisted for a few summers, spreading even to single-sex facilities, according to the book.___The next day, about 50 black swimmers showed up at a luxurious facility at Fairgrounds Park and were attacked by almost 200 white teenagers carrying baseball bats and heavy sticks, the report said.The clashes spread, and Mayor Joseph Darst ordered pools to be resegregated the next day.Mayor Darst, who was white, agreed to comply with a judge\u2019s order to integrate pools, according to \u201cContested Waters,\u201d but he also decided to resegregate them by sex.The fight was not limited to pools, either.___\u201cOur whole foreign policy and everything else could go to hell over this,\u201d he said.___Five years later, the television personality Fred Rogers weighed in, in his understated way.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want black people to come and swim in their swimming pools,\u201d Mr. Clemmons said in \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?,\u201d a 2018 documentary about Mr. Rogers. \u201cMy being on the program was a statement for Fred.\u201d___As segregationist policies unraveled, many white Americans in cities retreated to suburbs with private or community-managed pools. But prejudices persisted.From the 1970s to 1990s, cities faced with shrinking populations and rising budget deficits stopped building new pools or maintaining existing ones, Dr. Wiltse said. Public pool attendance dropped, and private pool construction increased drastically.___The club said the pool had become unsafe with so many children in it, but the camp argued racism was to blame.___\u201cI\u2019m super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport,\u201d she said then. But \u201cI would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it\u2019s not Simone, the black swimmer.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s great that we can use our platform and inspire kids who look up to us because they see themselves in us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re also not an easy fix for racism.\u201dIn an interview, Ms. Manuel said she experienced prejudice when she was 6 years old and a swimming teammate told her that he would not play with her on the playground after practice because she was black. Years passed before she told her parents.\u201cI think I was protecting them from any negativity about their raising an accomplished black swimmer,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess for me, I didn\u2019t really think I was different. It\u2019s just a very innocent age. To think that someone that age could think like that is very disturbing to me now.\u201d___The episode, captured on video, drew national attention and sparked protests and a lawsuit. The officer resigned and the city paid Dajerria and her family nearly $185,000.Karen Crouse contributed reporting, and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Green, a geneticist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a co-author of the study, published on Thursday in Science. \u201cThe answer is a clear enough \u2018no\u2019 that I\u2019m done with it.\u201d But as often happens in science, the answer to one question raises new ones. The study shows that at least twice in ancient history, humans and their relatives (known as hominins) arrived on Flores and then grew shorter. And not just humans: Other research has shown that elephants also arrived on Flores twice, and both times the species evolved into dwarves. So what mysterious power does this island have to shrink the body?When the fossils of Homo floresiensis first came to light, many researchers hoped they might still hold fragments of DNA. They were encouraged by the initial dating of the fossils \u2014 an estimated age of perhaps just 13,000 years.DNA analysis might have settled the debate over how Homo floresiensis fits into the hominin family tree. Some researchers argued that the bones simply belonged to a modern human with a growth disorder. In 2007 Herawati Sudoyo, a geneticist at the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology in Indonesia, brought samples of Homo floresiensis fossils to Dr. Green, then at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.Hard as he and his colleagues tried, they failed to get any definitive DNA from the fossils. \u201cWe could never really make sense of it,\u201d said Dr. Green. Years later, Dr. Green and his colleagues made two important discoveries. They found that humans and Neanderthals interbred; about 1 percent of the DNA of living non-Africans comes from those vanished hominins.At a 2012 scientific conference, Dr. Green and Dr. Sudoyo got to talking about Homo floresiensis and realized they might not have to look for its DNA in fossils. What if the ancestors of the people around the cave had interbred with the extinct hominins, inheriting genes for a pygmy body type? In 2013, they organized a trip to Flores to visit a village called Rampasasa near the cave. With the consent of village elders, Dr. Sudoyo and Gludhug A. Purnomo, a research assistant, took saliva samples from 32 villagers.That finding drastically narrowed the window during which modern humans might have shared Flores \u2014 and interbred \u2014 with Homo floresiensis. Enlisted by Dr. Sudoyo, Dr. Serena Tucci, now a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, and her colleagues compared the DNA of the Rampasasa villagers to that of other living people around the world. The researchers found that a very small percentage of the villagers\u2019 DNA came from Neanderthals or Denisovans. A tiny portion could not be matched to humans, Neanderthals or Denisovans. But these enigmatic pieces weren\u2019t dramatically different from human DNA, as you\u2019d expect if they had come from Homo floresiensis. Dr. Tucci concluded that the Rampasasa villagers have no Homo floresiensis ancestry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t disappointed,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they are extremely interesting for other reasons.\u201dBut at some point after they came to Flores, they became very short \u2014 as did Homo floresiensis before them. And they\u2019re not the only mammals to have shrunk. Those dwarf elephants on Flores, now extinct, were only as tall at the shoulder as a human. Judging from related species elsewhere in Southeast Asia, their ancestors were likely full sized. Humans have evolved pygmy bodies on other islands, including a few in the Philippines and in the Andaman Islands of the Indian Ocean. Small populations have evolved short stature in rain forests in Africa, South America and elsewhere.But that\u2019s not what happened on Flores. The Rampasasa villagers carry variants of many genes known to reduce height. Natural selection favored old variants rather than new mutations.\u201cThis agrees with our own work on African pygmies,\u201d said Ryan Gutenkunst, a biologist at the University of Arizona. \u201cWhen there is selection on stature, the response is driven by variants in many genes, not just a single gene.\u201d\u201cWhatever the ecological factors are for island dwarfism are, they are present in spades on this island,\u201d Dr. Green said of Flores. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so fascinating.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Identifies New Influence Operations Spanning Globe", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe activity originated in Iran and Russia, Facebook said. Unlike past influence operations on the social network, which largely targeted Americans, the fake accounts, pages and groups were this time also aimed at people in Latin America, Britain and the Middle East, the company said.Some of the activity was still focused on Americans, but the campaigns were not specifically intended to disrupt the midterm elections in the United States, said FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that worked with Facebook on investigating the fake pages and accounts. The operations \u201cextend well beyond U.S. audiences and U.S. politics,\u201d FireEye said in a preliminary report.But the aims of the latest campaigns appeared to be similar to those of past operations on the social network: to distribute false news that might cause confusion among people, and to alter people\u2019s thinking to become more partisan or pro-government on various issues.\u201cWe believe these pages, groups and accounts were part of two sets of campaigns,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call late Tuesday about the activities. \u201cOne from Iran, with ties to state-owned media. The other came from a set of people the U.S. government and others have linked to Russia.\u201dNow, those same social media influence tactics that were used in 2016 and last month appear to have been adopted by operatives in other countries as well.Renee DiResta, director of research at New Knowledge, an organization that studies disinformation campaigns, said Iran\u2019s involvement \u201creinforces that this is an ongoing information war, that our social ecosystem is vulnerable to manipulation by a variety of adversaries.\u201dIn a statement, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\u201d He added, \u201cIranians are now following the Kremlin\u2019s playbook from 2016.\u201dSenator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he planned to ask technology company executives more about the matter on Sept. 5 at a hearing in Washington to discuss social media and disinformation. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, as well as others, are expected to appear at the hearing.\u201cAddressing this threat requires technology companies, law enforcement, Congress, and the intelligence community working together,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Facebook\u2019s announcement on Tuesday was followed by one by Twitter, which said that it had also removed accounts from its social media service that had ties to Iran.YouTube said it deleted one channel \u2014 Liberty Front Press, a website linked to some of the fake Iranian accounts on Facebook \u2014 for violating its community guidelines, but did not offer more detail.Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified some of the new influence operations last month after a tip from FireEye about a network of Facebook pages called \u201cLiberty Front Press.\u201dAfter Facebook investigated those pages, it said it linked them back to Iranian state media using their website registration information and internet protocol addresses. Some of the pages were created in 2013, the company said, and they posted political content focused on the Middle East, Latin America, Britain and the United States.Other fake pages also had a far more international bent than the earlier batches uncovered by the social media company. The pages believed to have originated in Iran were written in several languages, including English, Arabic and Farsi. They carried a number of pro-Iranian themes, as well as language attacking Israel and promoting Palestinians. Some included anti-Trump language and were tied to relations between the United States and Iran, including references to the Iranian nuclear weapons deal.Newer accounts, created in 2016 and later, had additional goals, including spreading malware and stealing passwords, Facebook said. The accounts that originated in Russia focused on activity in Ukraine and Syria. They did not appear to target the United States. In Syria, the accounts promoted a pro-Russian agenda and that of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad.The company added that accounts linked to Iran had spent more than $12,000 for ads on Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram, using United States and Australian currency. The earliest ad ran in July 2012, while the most recent one ran this month. Facebook said at least some of those ads had been caught because of its new rules requiring that political ads be labeled as such. Facebook did not comment on the content of the ads, or say who they were targeting.In the conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was working with government agencies and private companies to proactively find malicious actors using the platform. He said the company had several investigations underway by a team dedicated to finding influence operations. He did not reveal the number or scope of the investigations, but said that given the amount of important elections happening worldwide, Facebook was looking at disinformation as a global problem.\u201cAuthenticity matters and people need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Louis C.K. and Men Who Think Justice Takes as Long as They Want It To", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA comedian who admitted to sexual misconduct seems to think it\u2019s time for his comeback.Contributing Opinion WriterTheir victims, however, have been disbelieved. They have had to withstand accusations that they are seeking attention. Justice has been grandly elusive. The public discourse has been more about whether the #MeToo movement has gone too far than it has been about reckoning with the alarming prevalence of sexual predation in every circumstance imaginable. \u201cShould a man pay for his misdeeds for the rest of his life?\u201d This is always the question raised when we talk about justice in the case of harassment and rape allegations against public figures. How long should a man who has faced no legal and few financial consequences for such actions pay the price? I appreciate the idea of restorative justice \u2014 that it might be possible to achieve justice through discussing the assault I experienced with the perpetrators and that I might be involved in determining an appropriate punishment for their crime. Restorative justice might afford me the agency they took from me. But I also appreciate the idea of those men spending some time in a prison cell, as problematic as the carceral system is, to think long and hard about the ways in which they violated me. I would like them to face material consequences for their actions because I have been doing so for 30 years. There is a part of me that wants them to endure what I endured. There is a part of me that is not interested in restoration. That part of me is interested in vengeance. And this is what is so difficult about justice and sexual violence \u2014 the repercussions of the crime can last a lifetime. Satisfying justice may not be possible, but we can certainly do better given that all too often, victims of sexual harassment and violence receive no justice at all. We spend so little energy thinking about justice for victims and so much energy thinking about the men who perpetrate sexual harassment and violence. We worry about what will become of them in the wake of their mistakes. We don\u2019t worry as much about those who have suffered at their hands. It is easier, for far too many people, to empathize with predators than it is to empathize with prey. I have to believe there is a path to redemption for people who have done wrong, but nine months of self-imposed exile in financial comfort is not a point along that path. It is far too soon for any of the men who have faced the marginal consequences born of the #MeToo movement to think about redemption. People love a comeback narrative, and all too often they yearn for this narrative at the expense of victims who are only beginning to reconcile with their suffering. Take Louis C.K. Not only did he expose himself to and masturbate in front of female comics; the actions of people in his employ reportedly worked to impede his victims\u2019 careers. Still, he has remained in control of the narrative. He gets to break the rules, and then he gets to establish rules of his own when he must answer for his misdeeds.How long should a man like Louis C.K. pay for what he did? At least as long as he worked to silence the women he assaulted and at least as long as he allowed them to doubt themselves and suffer in the wake of his predation and at least as long as the comedy world protected him even though there were very loud whispers about his behavior for decades. He should pay until he demonstrates some measure of understanding of what he has done wrong and the extent of the harm he has caused. He should attempt to financially compensate his victims for all the work they did not get to do because of his efforts to silence them. He should facilitate their getting the professional opportunities they should have been able to take advantage of all these years. He should finance their mental health care as long as they may need it. He should donate to nonprofit organizations that work with sexual harassment and assault victims. He should publicly admit what he did and why it was wrong without excuses and legalese and deflection. Every perpetrator of sexual harassment and violence should follow suit. We need to figure out what justice looks like in the court of public opinion, not for the sake of the offenders, but for the sake of victims. It is painful to know Louis C.K. simply strolled into a comedy club and did a set as if he hadn\u2019t admitted to masturbating in front of women, as if for sport. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Keep Up the Blanket Coverage of Trump. It Hurts Him. ", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust a little wave of disgust among Republican moderates is all that is needed to turn several key states from red to blue. Opinion ColumnistSome healthy soul searching is taking place in newsrooms across the country these days over whether the mainstream media should be covering President Trump\u2019s every tweet and rally. My answer: Absolutely! It\u2019s the right thing for us to do professionally, and, as last night\u2019s election results indicated, it\u2019s the right thing to do politically if you want to see a check on Donald Trump\u2019s power. It appears that it\u2019s the toxic lying, bullying and unpresidential behaviors that Trump exhibits most in his rallies and tweets \u2014 which we in the media so incessantly cover \u2014 that is turning off the very moderate, best-educated Republicans and suburban women that Trump will need to hold the G.O.P. majority in the House, let alone get re-elected.So bring on the coverage.America\u2019s unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, inflation for the moment is moderate, the stock market keeps setting records, and the president is coming off a crisis-defusing summit with North Korea. And yet, the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Trump having a personal approval rating of only 43 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his performance. And in a special election in Ohio held on Tuesday, the G.O.P. House candidate \u2014 whom Trump and the entire Republican establishment went to bat for \u2014 is barely ahead of his Democratic rival in a district that has not sent a Democrat to Congress in more than three decades. That does not speak well for Trump or his midterm prospects, but it does for the American people and for thinking Republicans. It turns out there is still a cohort of Republicans who have not sold their souls to Trump the way virtually every one of their elected representatives in Washington has done. It turns out that there are thinking Republicans for whom character, decency and truth-telling still matter in a president. It turns out that there are thinking Republicans who have watched Trump\u2019s twitter rants, his disturbed performance at Helsinki and the unrestrained bile that he emits at his rallies \u2014 and the blind, ecstatic response of his core base \u2014 and found them unnerving and unworthy of their support. That is what the polls and polling stations last night are telling us. Imagine how well President Trump would be doing if he weren\u2019t Donald Trump \u2014 if he weren\u2019t such a lying jerk. The dominant political fact of Trump\u2019s first 18 months in office is that despite some good economic trends in the country (and yes, his precise role in engineering them remains debatable), the president has not been able to widen his coalition beyond his core 40 percent to 45 percent. It is partly because he has not even remotely tried. But it is also because the very applause lines and abusive and divisive behaviors that appeal to his base turn off more-moderate and more-educated suburban Republicans, and do nothing to attract independents or conservative Democrats. That does not predict a cakewalk for Democrats in 2018 or 2020. They still need appealing candidates. But it does say to me that I want wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s every speech, rally, tweet and utterance, because they most reveal his character, and Trump\u2019s character is the ceiling on Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 and he seems uninterested, and more likely unable, to change that.Yes, I want every American to know that two Trump supporters were spotted at the president\u2019s last rally, in Ohio, wearing T-shirts that read, \u201cI\u2019d rather be Russian than a Democrat.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting data point. That\u2019s whom you\u2019re voting with when you vote for Trump.I want every American to hear of Trump\u2019s tweet that CNN\u2019s anchor Don Lemon, who is African-American, was \u201cthe dumbest man on television\u201d and that Lemon made LeBron James \u201clook smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201d Lemon was interviewing James about a school he had just opened in Ohio for underprivileged children. I want every Republican running for office to hear every syllable of Trump\u2019s bullying arrogance, when he warned at his Ohio rally that he destroys any G.O.P. politician who dares to defy him, saying, \u201cI only destroy their career because they said bad things about me and you fight back and they go down the tubes \u2014 and that\u2019s O.K.\u201d I want all of this heard and spread from sea to shining sea. Because though these words do rally Trump\u2019s base, they also rally Democrats and evidently embarrass Republican moderates and alienate independents.The veteran pollster Stanley Greenberg told me that he\u2019s seeing signs of this is in his recent focus groups: One was with moderate Republicans, all of whom \u201cwere put off\u2019\u2019 by Trump\u2019s behavior, and another was with \u201csecular conservative Republicans,\u2019\u2019 half of whom were put off. In addition, Greenberg said, the full Trump \u2014 insulting black sports heroes, threatening conservatives who dare cross him, praising Vladimir Putin and attacking the F.B.I. \u2014 \u201creminds evangelical conservatives of the devil\u2019s bargain they made in supporting him. Seeing him in all of his overreach and mania and self-absorption doesn\u2019t make them second-guess their choice, but it makes them uncomfortable about it.\u2019\u2019 In a close election it doesn\u2019t take many uncomfortable moderate Republicans to just stay home to make a big difference. That\u2019s all I am looking for, not a tsunami \u2014 that\u2019s not in the cards. Just a little wave of disgust among G.O.P. moderates is all that is needed to turn several key districts from red to blue. No question that the press should not allow itself to be props at Trump\u2019s rallies, and that can be dealt with by using a single pool camera that feeds all the networks, or reporters just sitting among the rally attendees, not in a special pen. But the whole country needs to see every tweet, every rally, every word and every reaction so that they can ask themselves: \u201cIs this who I want my kids to see as our president? Are these the people with whom I want to be aligned?\u201d It\u2019s too late to move Trump\u2019s core base on these questions, but I would not give up on his passive supporters. The latest polls and special elections tell us we shouldn\u2019t.I still believe that plenty of Americans of all political stripes are better than this president and that when given their next chance to say so, they will. Will there be enough? I don\u2019t know. I just know that the G.O.P. Congress and Fox News are too compromised to ever tell Trump, \u201cEnough.\u2019\u2019 But there are decent Republican moderates who, while they may never pull the lever for a Democrat, just might get too disgusted to vote. It\u2019s the best hope. So let\u2019s keep them fully informed about our president.Advertisement"}

The bill gives the Taxi and Limousine Commission that authority. It would also allow the Commission address incomes for app-based drivers, 85 percent of whom now make below minimum wage.App companies now charge passengers a flat rate \u2014 but pay drivers based on a different, usually lower rate of fare \u2014 and pocket the difference. Sometimes that fare is higher than yellow cab fares, but other times app companies subsidize fares, operating at a loss to outcompete yellow taxis, and further reducing incomes for drivers in both sectors.App drivers and those working in the traditional yellow cab industry are largely one and the same. Drivers go back and forth between the sectors as they struggle to earn a living, and our solutions must address the crisis for all drivers.Predictably, companies like Uber and Lyft have argued that the bill will actually hurt these communities by reducing the availability of for-hire cars in immigrant neighborhoods that are poorly served by traditional taxis and public transportation. It\u2019s true that app-dispatch technology may have helped to reduce race-based refusals, which have longed plagued black passengers in New York City and throughout the country. But that technology doesn\u2019t have to come with Uber\u2019s business model of worker exploitation or with the destruction of middle-class jobs for immigrants. My district in Queens is home to one of the largest contingents of for-hire and yellow cab drivers in the city. I have listened to their concerns for years, as well as their demands for action by the City Council to regulate the rapid influx of for-hire cars. As they will tell you, economic and racial justice must go hand in hand. The legislation to regulate the app-dispatch sector will help us to achieve both.

After an escalating debate about the role of psychologists in military prisons, the American Psychological Association voted on Wednesday to reject a proposed change in policy that would have allowed members to treat detainees held at sites that do not comply with international human rights laws.The proposed change would have reversed a 2015 determination by the association that prohibited such work, effectively blocking military psychologists from sites like the military detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, maintained by the United States. That decision followed revelations that in the early 2000s the association had finessed its ethics guidelines so that psychologists could aid interrogations by suggesting lines of questioning, for example, or advising when a confrontation had gone too far or not far enough.The A.P.A. still forbids psychologists from participating in interrogations. The newly rejected policy change simply would have permitted psychologists in uniform to provide therapy and counseling to detainees who asked for it.The association has little direct authority to restrict members\u2019 ability to practice. But state licensing boards can suspend or revoke a psychologist\u2019s license for a variety of reasons, including violations of the ethics code or professional policies.The current policy allows psychologists to work in detainment facilities deemed in violation of human rights standards only if they represent an independent organization, like the International Red Cross, or detainees themselves, not the military.Stephen Soldz, Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis So far, psychological help from those sources has been slow to materialize for detainees, said Col. Sally Harvey, a past president of the association\u2019s military division who had pushed for the change. The military has other health care workers on staff at detention facilities, including nurses, doctors and psychiatrists, she noted. But under current policy psychologists, who provide talk therapy and other forms of guidance, cannot do so.\u201cIf it\u2019s 2 a.m. on a Sunday and a detainee in Guant\u00e1namo wants to talk to a psychologist, he should have that access,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about their choice, in a situation where they don\u2019t have any choices.\u201d Opponents of the change saw it as a dangerous retreat on a core ethical issue for the profession. \u201cUnfortunately, the profession was tainted when some psychologists moved into interrogation,\u201d and others into torture, said Stephen Soldz, director of the social justice and human rights program at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis. \u201cThis profession is built on trust,\u201d he added. \u201cHow on earth is a detainee going to have trust when psychologists have been doing and recommending bad things?\u201dThe association\u2019s governing council of representatives voted the proposal down 105 to 57 after numerous delays and after rejecting a motion to withdraw the proposal for further discussion.After revelations about A.P.A.\u2019s alterations of ethics guidelines became headlines \u2014 adding to the news that two psychologists who were C.I.A. contractors developed methods of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d that many considered torture \u2014 the association has been on the defensive.

If they refuse, the memo said, officers should order the civilians to leave the premises. If they still fail to comply, they can be arrested for trespassing.Police officials say the memo, which also covers disruptive behavior like threats, was intended to provide clear guidance to officers about their authority in an era when smartphones have given nearly everyone the ability to record police activity and share it widely. But civil liberties advocates and city lawmakers are concerned that the recording ban violates the public\u2019s First Amendment rights. Police unions have said the guidance is not specific enough about how officers should enforce it.The ban is part of a broader policy added to the official police manual in June that acknowledges individuals\u2019 rights to record police activity on public streets, parks and private property. But police officials say department facilities have long been off-limits to recording.Ann Prunty, a longtime Manhattan prosecutor who is now the assistant police deputy commissioner of legal matters, said that although police station lobbies and waiting areas are open to the general public, they are also frequented by crime victims, undercover officers and other people who need privacy.\u201cThat space has to be a safe space for them to come and be confident that they\u2019re not going to see their images broadcast in some video the next day on YouTube or on Instagram,\u201d she said.Courts have held that the government can place reasonable restrictions on when, where and how individuals can exercise their rights under the First Amendment to record the police, said Jonathan M. Smith, the former chief of special litigation in the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division. But the justification for the recording ban is \u201cjust not credible,\u201d he said, because if the police are genuinely concerned about certain people being filmed, then officials should be protecting those people from being seen at all.\u201cThere may be individual circumstances in which you could restrict, but a rule that says you can\u2019t go into the public portion of a police facility and videotape, I think that violates the Constitution,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who is currently the executive director of the Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration has struggled to find equilibrium between civil liberties groups and the City Council, who have pushed for greater transparency about police conduct, and unions that have sought to insulate officers from public scrutiny.\u201cThey are not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks it\u2019s cute, it\u2019s not cute. Knock it off, show them respect.\u201dBut police labor union leaders fault city officials \u2014 including the mayor, the police commissioner and the City Council \u2014 for policies that they say have created a hostile work environment for officers and emboldened criminals.\u201cEveryone feels if they do something and it gets escalated, they\u2019re going to be held accountable as if they\u2019re to blame,\u201d Edward D. Mullins, the sergeants\u2019 union president, said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as bad as tolerating the behavior.\u201dThe police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, has publicly committed to a neighborhood policing strategy that views police stations as shared public spaces. When officials unveiled designs last month for a new precinct in the South Bronx with 800 square feet of community space, he said it was a model for future projects.The recording policy does not explain how the ban in police buildings applies to public events, like officer recognition ceremonies and precinct community council meetings, but Ms. Prunty said it would not apply at official events.\u201cThe memo is therefore confusing at best,\u201d he said.Mr. Mullins, the sergeants\u2019 union president, said the policy was \u201ctoo ambiguous\u201d about how officers are supposed to decide whether to make an arrest. A spokeswoman for the Police Department could not say whether anyone had been arrested under the policy, and it was unclear if the city\u2019s district attorneys would prosecute such arrests.In the Instagram video tirade, the man makes crude sexual remarks to a sergeant inside the 28th Precinct on Frederick Douglas Boulevard and West 123rd Street when the officer asks, \u201cAre you going to put me on Facebook?\u201dThe sergeant, Freddy Lopez, then moves toward the man, who is in a waiting area across a low wall, and orders him to stop recording because \u201cthe law says you can\u2019t.\u201d When the man presses for specifics, the sergeant hesitates before turning around and asking a female officer sitting at a desk for handcuffs that never materialize.The video ends with Sergeant Lopez going to a desk and picking up the phone. The police said the man was not arrested.Councilman Donovan Richards, a Queens Democrat and the chairman of the public safety committee, said the man\u2019s behavior was despicable. But he noted that the recording ban created a double standard in police stations, where civilians with cellphones are forbidden from recording encounters that police officers with department-issued smartphones and body cameras can. He said he would raise the issue this fall, when his committee considers the Right to Record Act, which would prohibit police officers from interfering with efforts to record them.Advertisement"}

My husband and I have a firm no-gun policy in our home (not even toy guns). I understand that other families may own guns legally, but I disagree with their decision from an ideological and safety standpoint. Accidents can always happen. I want to institute a policy: No playing at houses with guns. How can I ask other parents if they own guns? And how can I refuse play dates if they do? It\u2019s not personal; it\u2019s just our policy.J.But of course it\u2019s personal! You\u2019re telling other parents that the presence of a gun, no matter how securely locked away, renders their home unsafe for your child. That is squarely within your rights. But don\u2019t pretend there isn\u2019t judgment couched in your safety concerns. Unless you want a gaggle of moms and dads resenting you, we have to deal with that part of your policy too.As for asking, don\u2019t be shy: \u201cDo you have any guns in the house?\u201d You are absolutely entitled to that information. But here\u2019s where I might diverge from your plan. If the answer is yes, understand clearly where and how the guns are stored. But no matter the answer, go with your son on the first few play dates until you are confident that he is as safe at their home as he is at yours.Scissors, cleaning products, vicious older siblings, inadequate supervision: Your no-gun policy ignores so many other possible dangers, and most are far more common than gun accidents. Still, if you want to stick with firearms as your threshold, go with: \u201cI\u2019m sure the guns are stored safely. I just can\u2019t get comfortable with my son in the same house. Can your daughter come to our place instead?\u201dI\u2019m a lesbian and have been dating my girlfriend for three years. We rarely go a week without someone exclaiming: \u201cAre you two sisters? Twins?\u201d Objectively, we are of similar height and hair color, but beyond that, we really don\u2019t look alike. I find this frustrating. It doesn\u2019t happen to heterosexual couples we know. How can I make people think twice before asking this? Who wants to feel like they\u2019re dating a sibling?S.M.Actually, I get a fair number of letters from straight couples who are taken for siblings, and from siblings who are taken for lovers. (Everyone hates it!) I think people intuit the closeness, then project a story onto it. Personally, I like that you and your girlfriend are shining love for each other out into the world. But I get that you don\u2019t like the question. And you make a fair point: Speculating about strangers\u2019 relationships, and requiring them to illuminate us, is overstepping. These folks mean well, so I\u2019d probably steer clear of my dad\u2019s response to impertinent questions: \u201cWriting a book?\u201d So, how about a bit of elusiveness and sass: \u201cIdentical sisters of Sappho, actually.\u201d Then walk off briskly. Snap!My son (28) and I are not as close as I\u2019d like us to be. I attribute this to my being too critical of him over the years. I have great relationships with my daughters, who were always more mature than their older brother, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the whole problem. But as the adult, I should have seen that he needed to be handled in a more positive way. A few years ago, I backed off criticizing him, and that\u2019s helped. But I still feel distance between us. Any ideas?JIMI\u2019m moved by your commitment to fatherhood and doing better, Jim. I also trust your assessment that, like many fathers, you were possibly overcritical of your firstborn son. How about inviting him to regular dinners for two? You can start by sharing your (inevitable) missteps with him and asking for his assessment, past and present. Then see where this openness leads you. I would have been thrilled to know that my father valued our relationship so highly. I bet your son will be, too.I really hate it when people expect me to look at something on their phone in the middle of a conversation \u2014 especially if it takes more than a second or two. How do I politely refrain from staring at yet another screen while I\u2019m trying to socialize?SHAYNAWhen you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, Shayna! Many conversations now come with mandatory visual aids, some of which take an eternity to locate on phones, ruining the flow of chatter. Still, you\u2019re going to come off as quite the grump if you refuse to look at pictures of new babies, kittens or the latest Tinder date from hell.With that warning in place, try something saucy: \u201cOh, honey, put your phone away! We look at screens all day long. Paint me a picture of the wedding reception in words.\u201d Slightly odd, but mission accomplished, right?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tencent, the Chinese Internet Giant, Stumbles. Beijing Gets the Blame", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Its chat app has inspired Silicon Valley. It owns some of the biggest video game franchises in the world. And after years of growth it has become one of the largest internet companies in the world.Yet on Wednesday, Tencent stumbled, missing earnings targets and posting a drop in profit growth for the first time in more than a decade.As surprising as the slip up was the reason behind it: China\u2019s government.Bureaucratic reshuffling at the top levels of China\u2019s government made it difficult for the company to get the licensing required to make money on new games, Tencent\u2019s president, Martin Lau, explained on an earnings call. In a separate case, Chinese regulators pulled another game \u2014 Monster Hunter: World \u2014 because its content was deemed too gory.\u201cA lot of games have not been approved,\u201d said Mr. Lau, adding that the government was aware \u201cthe restructuring is now affecting the industry as a whole.\u201dThe admission was a rare acknowledgment of the outsize role China\u2019s government can play in the fortunes, and misfortunes, of its most important private companies.Excessive bureaucracy, heavy-handed censorship and overreach into day-to-day management all come as downsides to a company having Beijing in its corner. For China\u2019s largest companies, though, there is no choice. In a famed quote, the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, warned executives to strike a balance. Love the government, he advised, but don\u2019t marry it.An emblem of China\u2019s growing innovative prowess, Tencent, which owns the messaging and payments app WeChat, has nonetheless been a beneficiary of Beijing\u2019s policies. Government internet blocks have kept out would-be rivals like Facebook. Other plans that will bolster the company include a government initiative to turn WeChat into a form of digital national identification.But China has been a double-edged sword.Tencent\u2019s results helped push shares of some American tech companies, many of which look to China as a potential key growth market, lower on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index fell about 1.2 percent.\u201cOne of the prevailing assumptions, particularly around tech and tech hardware, is China equals growth,\u201d said Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management. \u201cSo when one of the leading names, the names you look for to take the pulse, comes up sick, that can shake you up a little bit.\u201dOn Thursday, Tencent\u2019s shares fell by 3 percent in Hong Kong trading. Over the past five days, they have lost more than one-tenth of their value as investors grew increasingly concerned about regulatory hurdles and rising competition. Since the middle of last week, Tencent\u2019s market value has fallen by more than $50 billion.Holding up earnings this past quarter has been Tencent\u2019s inability to make money in China off PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, or PUBG, a popular game that pits players against one another in a battle to the death on an island covered with weapons, vehicles and sniper nests. Tencent said it was working closely with regulators to get the license, which would allow it to make money on the game by, for instance, selling virtual items within the app.Mr. Lau said that the company was working diligently to get the approvals. Ultimately the problem is a matter of the timing of the signoffs, not whether they will be acceptable, Mr. Lau added. Some have objected to the violence in PUBG, which is often played by devotees on smartphones, volume up on their phone speakers, in public places like trains and parks. The game, Monster Hunter: World, was pulled entirely for its content, though Mr. Lau said the company was working to \u201cadjust the content\u201d so it could gain approval.\u201cThe regulatory headwind is definitely having a toll\u201d on Tencent\u2019s gaming revenue, said John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, noting that the company has not been able to monetize a key title like PUBG.WeChat has also faced new competition from several smaller companies that make apps that allow users to share short videos.Concerns about the competition and the increased regulatory oversight have weighed on the company\u2019s share price for months. Its stock price has fallen almost 30 percent from peaks in January.The company\u2019s second quarter net profit fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier to $2.7 billion. Its revenue in the period rose 30 percent, to $11.1 billion.Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New YorkAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Fueled Anti-Refugee Attacks in Germany, New Research Suggests", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterALTENA, Germany \u2014 When you ask locals why Dirk Denkhaus, a young firefighter trainee who had been considered neither dangerous nor political, broke into the attic of a refugee group house and tried to set it on fire, they will list the familiar issues.This small riverside town is shrinking and its economy declining, they say, leaving young people bored and disillusioned. Though most here supported the mayor\u2019s decision to accept an extra allotment of refugees, some found the influx disorienting. Fringe politics are on the rise.But they\u2019ll often mention another factor not typically associated with Germany\u2019s spate of anti-refugee violence: Facebook.Everyone here has seen Facebook rumors portraying refugees as a threat. They\u2019ve encountered racist vitriol on local pages, a jarring contrast with Altena\u2019s public spaces, where people wave warmly to refugee families.Many here suspected \u2014 and prosecutors would later argue, based on data seized from his phone \u2014 that Mr. Denkhaus had isolated himself in an online world of fear and anger that helped lead him to violence.Karsten M\u00fcller and Carlo Schwarz, researchers at the University of Warwick, scrutinized every anti-refugee attack in Germany, 3,335 in all, over a two-year span. In each, they analyzed the local community by any variable that seemed relevant. Wealth. Demographics. Support for far-right politics. Newspaper sales. Number of refugees. History of hate crime. Number of protests.One thing stuck out. Towns where Facebook use was higher than average, like Altena, reliably experienced more attacks on refugees. That held true in virtually any sort of community \u2014 big city or small town; affluent or struggling; liberal haven or far-right stronghold \u2014 suggesting that the link applies universally.Their reams of data converged on a breathtaking statistic: Wherever per-person Facebook use rose to one standard deviation above the national average, attacks on refugees increased by about 50 percent.Nationwide, the researchers estimated in an interview, this effect drove one-tenth of all anti-refugee violence.The uptick in violence did not correlate with general web use or other related factors; this was not about the internet as an open platform for mobilization or communication. It was particular to Facebook.Other experts, asked to review the findings, called them credible, rigorous \u2014 and disturbing. The study bolstered a growing body of research, they said, finding that social media scrambles users\u2019 perceptions of outsiders, of reality, even of right and wrong.Facebook declined to comment on the study, but a spokeswoman said in an email, \u201cOur approach on what is allowed on Facebook has evolved over time and continues to change as we learn from experts in the field.\u201dThe company toughened a number of restrictions on hate speech, including against refugees, during and after the study\u2019s sample period. Still, experts believe that much of the link to violence doesn\u2019t come through overt hate speech, but rather through subtler and more pervasive ways that the platform distorts users\u2019 picture of reality and social norms.We visited Altena and other German towns to retrace each step from the site\u2019s algorithm-driven newsfeed to real-world attacks that its users might not otherwise commit \u2014 and that hint at subtle but profound ways that the social network reshapes societies.When refugees first arrived, so many locals volunteered to help that Anette Wesemann, who runs Altena\u2019s refugee integration center, couldn\u2019t keep up. She\u2019d find Syrian or Afghan families attended by entourages of self-appointed life coaches and German tutors.\u201cIt was really moving,\u201d she said.But when Ms. Wesemann set up a Facebook page to organize food drives and volunteer events, it filled with anti-refugee vitriol of a sort she hadn\u2019t encountered offline.Some posts appeared to come from outsiders, joined by a handful of locals. Over time, their anger proved infectious, dominating the page.Told about research linking Facebook to anti-refugee violence, Ms. Wesemann responded, \u201cI would believe it immediately.\u201dSuch links would be indirect, researchers say, but begin with the algorithm that determines each user\u2019s newsfeed.That is how anti-refugee sentiment \u2014 which combines fear of social change with us-versus-them rallying cries, two powerful forces on the algorithm \u2014 can seem unusually common on Facebook, even in a pro-refugee town like Altena.But even if only a minority of users express vehement anti-refugee views, once they dominate the newsfeed, this can have consequences for everyone else.People instinctively conform to their community\u2019s social norms, which are normally a brake on bad behavior. This requires intuiting what the people around us believe, something we do through subconscious social cues, according to research by Betsy Paluck, a Princeton University social psychologist.Facebook scrambles that process. It isolates us from moderating voices or authority figures, siphons us into like-minded groups and, through its algorithm, promotes content that engages our base emotions.A Facebook user in Altena, for instance, might reasonably, but wrongly, conclude that their neighbors were broadly hostile to refugees.\u201cYou can get this impression that there is widespread community support for violence,\u201d said Dr. Paluck. \u201cAnd that changes your idea of whether, if you acted, you wouldn\u2019t be acting alone.\u201dIn his office, Gerhard Pauli, a grandfatherly local prosecutor, flipped through printouts of social media posts that the police had pulled from Mr. Denkhaus\u2019s cellphone.\u201cHe was very interested in Facebook,\u201d Mr. Pauli said. He paused over an image of wide-eyed, dark-skinned men, superimposed with the text, \u201cThe welfare ministry is out of money. It\u2019s back to work.\u201dMr. Denkhaus messaged near constantly with friends to share articles and memes disparaging foreigners. At first they trafficked in provocations, ironically addressing one another as \u201cmein F\u00fchrer.\u201dOver time, they appeared to lose sight of the line separating trolling from sincere hate. Heavy social media users refer to this effect as \u201cirony poisoning.\u201d\u201cHe said to his partner one day, \u2018And now we have to do something,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pauli recalled. Mr. Denkhaus and a friend doused the attic of a refugee group house with gasoline and set it on fire. No one was hurt.In court, his lawyer would argue that Mr. Denkhaus had shown no outward animus toward refugees before that night. It was only online that he\u2019d dabbled in hate.Intended as exonerating \u2014 wasn\u2019t the real world what mattered? \u2014 this defense underscored how Facebook can provide a closed environment with its own moral rules.Mr. Denkhaus had little opportunity to encounter anti-refugee hatred in the real Altena, where overwhelmingly tolerant social norms prevailed. But within his Facebook echo chamber, he could drift unchecked toward extremism.And these attacks may represent only the tip of a much larger iceberg, the University of Warwick researchers said.Each person nudged into violence, they believe, hints at a community that has become broadly more hostile to refugees. For most users, the effect will be subtler, but, by playing out more widely, perhaps more consequential.But, as in Altena, Facebook use and anti-refugee violence rates are both unusually high. Could that hint at more than a few isolated vigilantes?We sought out a particular kind of user, known to researchers as a superposter, who is thought to embody the ways that Facebook can make a community incrementally more hostile to outsiders.Rolf Wasserman, an artist whose studio overlooks Traunstein\u2019s quaint central square, is not politically influential in any traditional sense. Though conservative, he is hardly extremist. But he is furiously active on Facebook.He posts a steady stream of rumors, strident opinion columns and news reports on crimes committed by refugees. Though none crosses into hate speech or fake news, in the aggregate, they portray Germany as beset by dangerous foreigners.\u201cOn Facebook, it\u2019s possible to reach people who are not highly political, to bring information to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can build peoples\u2019 political views on Facebook.\u201dSuperposters tend to be \u201cmore opinionated, more extreme, more engaged, more everything,\u201d said Andrew Guess, a Princeton University social scientist.When more casual users open Facebook, often what they see is a world shaped by superposters like Mr. Wasserman. Their exaggerated worldviews play well on the algorithm, allowing them to collectively \u2014 and often unknowingly \u2014 dominate newsfeeds.\u201cThat\u2019s something special about Facebook,\u201d Dr. Paluck said. \u201cIf you end up getting a lot of time on the feed, you are influential. It\u2019s a difference with real life.\u201dIn the offline world, people decide collectively whom to listen to and whom to ignore. Professional gatekeepers such as editors or party leaders decide which voices to elevate. Facebook overrides those practices.Dr. Paluck, by persuading the influential students to oppose bullying, could shift social norms in an entire school, reducing bullying by about a third. Isolating students who favor bullying and elevating those who oppose it can also reduce violence. By shuffling around the students just so, a few moderating voices could be made to set norms for the whole community.Facebook\u2019s algorithm, engineered to maximize the amount of time spent on the site, does the opposite of this. It elevates a class of superposters like Mr. Wasserman who, in the aggregate, give readers an impression that social norms are more hostile to refugees and more distrustful of authority than they really are. Even if no one endorses violence, it can come to feel more justifiable.Natascha Wolff has seen this firsthand, she said at a Traunstein church lunch for local Nigerian families.Ms. Wolff, who teaches at a vocational school, has found that young people like her students often express the most anti-refugee views. They seem to draw, she said, on things they saw on Facebook \u2014 and a mistaken belief that everyone agrees.Any rumor or tidbit about foreigners, she said, \u201csure gets around fast. People feel confirmed in their viewpoint.\u201dThe ideological bubbles can be radicalizing, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s just, \u2018like, like, like.\u2019\u201dHer refugee students, she said, have had coffee or other objects thrown at them from windows \u2014 casual, light-of-day violence one only braves with the assumption that it will be tolerated.But police here aggressively pursue crimes against refugees, highlighting that some locals have a skewed perspective of their own community\u2019s social norms.A young woman who attends Ms. Wolff\u2019s vocational school, but asked to not be named so she could speak more freely, described lurid stories of refugee wrongdoing she\u2019d read on Facebook. Everyone her age uses the site to discuss refugees, she said, and everyone agrees that they are a threat.She may have been misled by Facebook\u2019s tendency to sort people into like-minded groups. Our interviews in Traunstein, along with voter records, suggest that the town is split but leans liberal.Like most Germans, she is at little risk of committing violence. But her Facebook-tinged social norms show in other ways. She supported hardline anti-immigration policies, she said. When an African classmate was deported over an error in his paperwork, she\u2019d hoped more would face similar fates.Could Facebook really distort social relations to the point of violence? The University of Warwick researchers tested their findings by examining every sustained internet outage in their study window.German internet infrastructure tends to be localized, making outages isolated but common. Sure enough, whenever internet access went down in an area with high Facebook use, attacks on refugees dropped significantly.And they dropped by the same rate at which heavy Facebook use is thought to boost violence. The drop did not occur in areas with high internet usage but average Facebook usage, suggesting it is specific to social media.This spring, internet services went down for several days or weeks, depending on the block, in the middle-class Berlin suburb of Schmargendorf.Asked how life changed, Stefania Simonutti went bug-eyed and waved her arms as if screaming.\u201cThe world got smaller, a lot changed,\u201d said Ms. Simonutti, who runs a local ice cream shop with her husband and older son. She lost touch with family in Italy, she said, but was most distressed by losing access to news, for which she trusts only social media, chiefly Facebook.\u201cMany people lie and fake things in the newspapers,\u201d she said, referring darkly to matters of war and disease. \u201cBut with the internet, I can decide for myself what to believe and what not.\u201dEsperanza Mu\u00f1oz, a cheery, freckled woman who moved here from Colombia in the 1980s, found the outage relaxing. She socialized more with neighbors and followed the news less.\u201cSocial media, it\u2019s an illusion,\u201d she said.Her daughter, a medical student named Laura Selke, said global events seemed less stressful during the outage.\u201cWhen news spreads on Facebook, it\u2019s made more provocative,\u201d she said.She hadn\u2019t realized how much anxiety social media caused her until she went for a few days without it.\u201cYou really do notice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really was very comfortable, very nice.\u201dMs. Mu\u00f1oz added that Facebook communities in her native Colombia seemed even more prone to outrage and filter bubbles.\u201cIt really was as if there was only one opinion,\u201d she said, describing her Facebook feed during recent Colombian elections. \u201cWe\u2019re only informed in one direction, and that\u2019s really not good.\u201dThis hints at what experts consider one of the most important lessons of the University of Warwick study. If Facebook can be linked to hundreds of attacks even in Germany, its effect could be far more severe in countries like Colombia with weaker institutions, weaker social media regulations and more immediate histories of political violence.\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t say these things with their own mouths,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1oz said, referring to the rancor she saw from Colombian Facebook users. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy for them to share it online.\u201dShane Thomas McMillan contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Distractor", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald Trump\u2019s \u201clook over there\u201d media strategy is a trap that keeps Democrats from focusing public attention on his bad policies.Mr. Mook managed Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.Last week, President Trump lobbed racist insults at LeBron James, he called the press an enemy of the people (again), and Rudy Giuliani gave rambling interviews chock-full of lies and tacit admissions of guilt too tantalizing to ignore. It was a typical Trump week with myriad things to cover.But you wouldn\u2019t know it from watching the news. That\u2019s because his unnecessary insults and controversies create a constellation of outrages that deflect accountability for his actions.We faced this same problem on the Hillary Clinton campaign. That's when I first experienced the Trump Trap. In campaigns, we have a saying: If your opponent is hanging himself, give him more rope. In the week after the convention, while Mrs. Clinton was touring Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio, talking about her plan to create jobs through new investments in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, we tried to get out of the way of the negative coverage of Mr. Trump and his outrageous comments about Mr. Khan. But the result was that people heard his message, not ours. So much so that after the election, some people thought Mrs. Clinton never talked about people\u2019s economic lives. But she did. It just went into the black hole of the Trump Trap. Mr. Trump will say and do things that demand a response from anyone who values decency and morality. The result is that he decides what gets attention \u2014 and he\u2019s not held accountable.So what do we do?First, Democrats have to call these distractions what they are: distractions. A speech denouncing his name-calling will result in headlines about name-calling. That, as we learned, does not help voters understand what progressives believe and who we are fighting for. We need to demand answers for the administration\u2019s assault on health care coverage, its corruption and its bilking of middle-income taxpayers. Second, the media needs to realize that the game has changed. Just because the president says or tweets something outrageous doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s news. Just like Facebook and Twitter have a responsibility to root out harassment and impostors from their platforms, the news media has an obligation to report responsibly on the president. Sometimes stupid insults are just that and should be ignored. That will mean lost revenue, but it\u2019s a price worth paying.Third, we Democrats have to pick fights that highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s malfeasance. When the president seeks to take away health insurance from seniors or people with cancer, we can\u2019t let that go unnoticed. Some Democrats seem more interested in fighting one another on health care than fighting the Republican Party \u2014 let\u2019s arm wrestle one another when we actually have a majority to pass a new law. In the meantime, let\u2019s help voters understand why a change is so badly needed.Candidates: Beware the Trump Trap. The president has promised to spend a majority of his time campaigning this fall. He will call you names. He will come at you with outrage after outrage. It will be very tempting to wear this as a badge of honor to reap the rewards of social media attention and campaign donations. You will think he is drowning in backlash. But he will really just be making the debate about anything other than his own failings or the lives of the voters you wish to represent.

{"Headline": "Pope in Ireland: Francis Meets Church Abuse Victims", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe also met with eight abuse victims.\u2022 In the first speech of his two-day visit, the pope addressed the abuse scandals and the refugee crisis, along with two decades of peace in Ireland and an issue he often avoids discussing: abortion.\u2022 Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland, speaking with the pope just a few feet away, urged Francis to take action on the \u201chistory of sorrow and shame.\u201d\u2022 The New York Times will have live coverage from Ireland throughout the pope\u2019s two-day visit.Amid criticism that he has not dealt forcefully enough with a spiraling clerical sex abuse crisis, Pope Francis met with victims of clerical and institutional abuse in Dublin on Saturday evening.The meeting, which was expected and was held in private at the Vatican Embassy, lasted an hour and half \u201cwith eight Irish survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse,\u201d according to a Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke.Two of the survivors who met with the pope said he had condemned the corruption and cover-up within the church using the word \u201ccaca,\u201d or, his translator put it, the filth one sees in a toilet.Those present included Marie Collins, who earlier in the day called the pope\u2019s absence of action on sex abuse \u201c disappointing.\u201d Others included the Rev. Patrick McCafferty; the Rev. Joe McDonald; Damian O\u2019Farrell, a Dublin lawmaker; Paul Jude Redmond; Clodagh Malone; and Bernadette Fahy. One survivor, a victim of the Rev. Tony Walsh, preferred to remain anonymous, the Vatican said.\u2014 Jason HorowitzIn the first speech of his visit, the pope acknowledged \u201cthe abuse of young people by members of the church\u201d and the church\u2019s failure to \u201caddress these repugnant crimes.\u201dHe gave no hint of the kind of new measures that victims have demanded in response to the scandals, and praised the steps taken by his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, to prevent the abuses from being repeated. Many abuse survivors have described the church\u2019s actions as inadequate.But sexual abuse was not the main focus of his speech at Dublin Castle, where he spoke, among other things, of the peace that has taken hold on the island since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 ended decades of sectarian fighting. He also addressed abortion, another source of friction between the Irish and the church.Conservative Catholics have accused Francis of failing to pay enough attention to the rights of the unborn. Unlike his predecessors, he has preferred to avoid culture-war issues like abortion and gay rights, instead emphasizing care for the poor, the marginalized and migrants.But at an event explicitly intended to spotlight the importance of families, held in the wake of the vote in May to lift a constitutional ban on abortion, Francis had little choice but to broach the subject, though he paired it with concern for refugees.\u201cCould it be that the growth of a materialistic \u2018throwaway culture\u2019 has in fact made us increasingly indifferent to the poor and to the most defenseless members of our human family, including the unborn, deprived of the very right to life?\u201d he said.\u201cPerhaps the most disturbing challenge to our consciences in these days is the massive refugee crisis, which will not go away, and whose solution calls for a wisdom, a breadth of vision and a humanitarian concern that go far beyond short-term political decisions.\u201d\u2014 Jason HorowitzMr. Varadkar addressed the scandals head-on in his own speech at Dublin Castle, joining abuse survivors in urging the pope, who sat a few feet away, to take action on the \u201chistory of sorrow and shame,\u201d rather than merely express regret and sadness.\u201cWe remember the failures of both church and state and wider society and how they created a bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering,\u201d the prime minister said, speaking to a diverse audience. \u201cIn place of Christian charity, forgiveness and compassion, far too often there was judgment, severity and cruelty, in particular, towards women and children and those on the margins.\u201dHe specifically cited the institutions \u2014 \u201cMagdalene laundries, mother and baby homes, industrial schools\u201d \u2014 where the church, with the government\u2019s blessing, housed poor people in harsh conditions, put them to work without pay and coerced women to give up their children for adoption.\u201cWounds are still open and there is much to be done to bring about justice and truth and healing for victims and survivors,\u201d he said. \u201cHoly Father, we ask that you use your office and influence to ensure this is done here in Ireland and across the world.\u201d\u2014 Jason HorowitzFor much of the last year, the most controversial aspect of Francis\u2019s papacy within the church has been his expansive view of the family, including reaching out to gay Catholics, and his potential extension of Communion to divorced and remarried Catholics. That door, which conservatives say church doctrine demands should be sealed shut, was cracked open by Francis in a footnote in Amoris laetitia, a 2016 apostolic exhortation addressing the pastoral care of families.The World Meeting of Families, which drew people from more than 100 countries to Dublin, was the purpose of Francis\u2019s visit to Ireland. On Saturday night, the pope spoke at the packed Festival of Families at Croke Park stadium, and said he had written his exhortation as a \u201ckind of road map of living joyfully the gospel of the family.\u201dStacks of the book, which traditionalists say could cause the destruction of the Catholic family, were in boxes earlier in the day at St. Mary\u2019s Pro-Cathedral, where the pope gave marriage advice to newlyweds. \u201cEven the in-laws have wisdom,\u201d he said, to laughter.The pope\u2019s speech at Croke Park avoided the subject of divorce, and stuck to safer shores. (\u201cA society that does not value grandparents is a society that has no future,\u201d he said. And, he added, citing Missy Collins, a member of the Irish Traveller ethnic group who addressed the audience earlier in the evening, \u201cHer witness reminds us that, in God\u2019s house, there is a place at the table for everyone.\u201d)He again offered his advice on achieving familial bliss. \u201cEven if the argument tempts you to sleep in another room, alone and apart, just knock on the door and say, \u2018Please can I come in?\u2019 All it takes is a look, a kiss, a soft word, and everything is back to the way it was.\u201d\u2014 Jason HorowitzMany shared videos of Francis passing by in his Popemobile.\u201cIncredible how folks find room for their faith beside so many forms evil,\u201d Mr. MacKenna added.Colm O\u2019Gorman, a clerical abuse survivor and the director of Amnesty International Ireland, called the pope\u2019s remarks on Saturday morning an \u201cextraordinary deflection.\u201d\u2014 Jacey FortinA group representing survivors of clerical sexual abuse around the world issued a list of demands to Francis on Friday, including a \u201czero tolerance\u201d church law, meaning that priests who molested children and superiors who protected abusers would be defrocked.\u201cWe need to know who these sex offenders are, just like we need to know who these bishops are, because you know who they are, and you know what they\u2019ve done,\u201d Peter Isely, a survivor from Milwaukee and a founding member of the group, said at a news conference.\u2014 Kimiko de Freytas-TamuraTony Kelly, 58, a bar manager in Dublin, watched the pope\u2019s Dublin Castle speech on television and found his apology sincere, but, he said, \u201cpeople are looking more for actions rather than words.\u201dThe Irish church had suffered the consequences of \u201cliving in the past\u201d and breaking its trust with the faithful, Mr. Kelly said.\u201cThere was a lot of negativity, a lot of cover up, and they tended to protect themselves,\u201d he said, while waiting outside St. Mary\u2019s Church, which has long been the acting cathedral of the archdiocese and where Pope Francis was to dispense advise to young couples.But Mr. Kelly said he hoped that what the pope heard in Ireland would motivate him to help protect children in other churches around the world.\u201cMaybe this country could lead the way in certain respects,\u201d he said.\u201cIt touches my heart to return to Ireland after 38 years,\u201d Francis told reporters aboard his plane, before landing in Dublin. \u201cI was here for nearly three months to practice English in 1980. And for me, this is a great memory.\u201dBefore he became Pope Francis, the Argentine priest known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio stayed at a Jesuit residence in the Milltown Park neighborhood of Dublin. Today, a photo of him as pope, grinning and wearing the Ring of the Fisherman on his raised right hand, decorates the main corridor of the residence.He did not mix much, listening to English-language tapes he had bought and taking a few one-on-one lessons, but he still made an impression, said Michael O\u2019Sullivan, a fellow Jesuit who met him then.\u201cHe had a terrific presence when he looked at you; he focused on you, listened to you. He was just very present,\u201d said Father O\u2019Sullivan, 66, now the director of the Spirituality Institute for Research and Education in Milltown Park.\u2014 Iliana Magra and Jason HorowitzThis is also a very different pope, navigating a different world.John Paul II, the first non-Italian pontiff in four and a half centuries, rode a historic wave of popularity and became a global symbol of resistance to communism during the Cold War, and in Dublin he drew what was called the largest crowd in Irish history. Vigorous and young by papal standards, at 59, he visited several countries on three continents that year, his first full year leading the church.He did not stray far from church doctrine, reiterating during his Irish trip the church\u2019s opposition to abortion, contraception and divorce.\u2014 Elisabetta PovoledoApart from a few steel barriers and clusters of police officers on the streets, it was hard to tell on this chilly Saturday morning, just before Pope Francis arrived, that anything special was happening in Dublin.A few hours later, as the pope rode through the city, standing in the back of a pickup truck, the crowds he waved to were surprisingly sparse in some areas, though more dense in others.\u201cIt\u2019s not really a thing that would be on my radar,\u201d said Eoin O\u2019Connell, 21, during his shift at an Irish memorabilia store off Grafton Street, a tourist shopping haven. Vatican flags waved outside the store, but Mr. O\u2019Connell said sales had been low, as has interest in the papal visit.Less than 200 yards away, a dozen people gathered to quietly protest the visit. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that him coming here is a tremendous disrespect to those who have suffered,\u201d said Michael Shimaokaa, 27.A street vendor reorganized his stock of umbrellas, scarves, sweaters and hats, putting Pope Francis T-shirts up front, but tourists still went for the woolen beanies and caps.\u201cHe should have gone to western Ireland, where it would have been a big deal,\u201d said Sian O\u2019Sullivan, 36, on her way to get her makeup done, \u201cbut Dublin is atheist.\u201d\u2014 Iliana MagraWhen the Vatican announced that Pope Francis would visit Ireland, anticipation grew among Catholics in Northern Ireland that Francis, unlike Pope John Paul II, would find time to cross the border. There was even Vatican gossip that Francis might meet the queen.The sectarian violence of the Troubles, which in part kept John Paul away, has all but vanished. Relations between Ireland and Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, have improved so much that people dread the possibility that a hard border will be re-established as a result of Britain\u2019s plan to exit the European Union.Even so, there is no visit to Northern Ireland on the pope\u2019s packed 36-hour schedule. As is customary on papal flights, he sent electronic greetings to the leaders of the nations over which his plane flew, including to Queen Elizabeth II.\u201cI extend cordial greetings to your majesty, the members of the royal family, and the people of the United Kingdom as I fly over British airspace on my way to Ireland. I willingly invoke upon all of you the abundant blessings of almighty God,\u201d Francis wrote, signing with his formal \u201cFranciscus PP.\u201d\u2014 Jason HorowitzSome critics of Pope Francis couldn\u2019t wait to apply for tickets for his appearances in Ireland \u2014 and then not use them.A protest called \u201cSay Nope to the Pope\u201d encouraged critics of the church to snap up free tickets and then skip the events.And then there are the many Irish who have rebelled against the church and its sway over government policy, or have just drifted away from the faith.But even some of the critics of Pope Francis and his church find the \u201cSay Nope\u201d protest in bad taste. Mr. Varadkar called it \u201cpetty and meanspirited.\u201d\u2014 Jason HorowitzBut the talk, delivered on Thursday to more than 1,200 people, passed without incident. Mr. Martin, editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine America, said he spent three hours afterward signing books and talking with people, who were largely supportive of his view.\u201cOne bishop told me, \u2018Just the fact that they invited you is a sign,\u2019 \u201d he said.\u2014 Elisabetta Povoledo\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he told Crux. \u201cThese men, or are they mice, encounter a world, certainly the Western world, which is turning against God\u2019s plan for family and marriage, and instead of countering that with an authenticity, they water down the truth and they give a message which is politically correct.\u201d\u2014 Kimiko de Freytas-TamuraThe center opened in 1969 as a soup kitchen \u201cproviding shelter and a bowl of soup,\u201d said Brother Sean Donohoe, a co-director, but last year provided 398,000 \u201cunits of service\u201d \u2014 a meal, a parcel of groceries, a shower, clothes or medical treatment. \u201cMany years ago it was just men, then women, and now we have families, especially because rents are so expensive in the capital.\u201dVolunteers at the center serve breakfast and dinner \u2014 to up to 700 people some evenings \u2014 and hand out 1,400 grocery parcels each week. So many adults arrive with children in tow that the center established a family area in its dining hall; it offers day care, and once a week, it hands out diapers.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries in which the organization Ending Clerical Abuse identified victims of clerical child sexual abuse. The group documented cases of abuse by members of religious orders that have a global presence in 172 countries; it did not document cases of abuse in 172 countries.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Society Scale?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe growth, challenges and splintering of a Facebook group about urbanism and public transportation is the story of us all.If you want to understand how group dynamics work online, look no further than Numtot.The members of the group, called Numtots, or \u201ctots\u201d for short, debate Nimbyism (Not in My Back Yard), Yimbyism (Yes in My Back Yard) and Bimbyism (in this case, Brutalism in My Back Yard), post pictures of lomgbois (train cars) and discuss transit infrastructure of various world cities. Though many of the posts that proliferate each day are memes, others are earnest, as tots seek one another\u2019s expertise on city planning and architecture or post pictures of street signs in cities around the world.The tots\u2019 political orientation has become an increasing focus, as rival groups began to bait one another, quarrel and question one another\u2019s political credentials.\u201cThe communists complain that the group is too neoliberal, and the market urbanists complain that the group is too communist,\u201d Ms. Eldred said. \u201cA lot of people will rag on the mods for being centrists. And most of us are socialists.\u201dNumtot\u2019s microcommunities have created about 100 splinter groups, which define themselves in relation to \u2014 and sometimes in opposition to \u2014 the parent group. They include:Yimby Memes for Developer Shill TeensSocial Urbanist Memes for Anarchist Communist TeensAmchad Memes for American Rail Apologist TeensTyler Walter, 25, created that last group as a subgroup for a certain kind of meme, which classifies French trains as \u201cvirgins\u201d and bulkier American trains as \u201cChads,\u201d a widely used online nickname for macho dudes.The first time he posted such a meme in Numtot, Mr. Walter said, it \u201cpissed so many people off. It pissed off Europeans.\u201d\u201cI like to poke the beehive a lot,\u201d he said.But Mr. Walter, who lives in Richmond, Va., has also created another spinoff group, one of close to 50 local Numtot spinoffs whose members often meet up in real life. He even went on a date with one of the members of the group.The moderators of Numtot progeny can have difficult relationships with the parent group. For example, the description of the group Queer Urbanism Memes and Other Things for Lonely and Forgotten Teens insists that it is not affiliated with Numtot.\u201cPlease keep any drama in Numtot out of this group so that we can keep it as safe and inclusive as possible!\u201d the group\u2019s description says.Ms. Eldred and Mr. Walter both rolled their eyes at the stated lack of affiliation, and Will Tamura, one of the group\u2019s administrators, acknowledged that the group had spun off from Numtot. But he said that it had been created so that its members could avoid the infighting that fills the original group.\u201cThe way I view it, housing crises are caused by the market,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Shea said. \u201cSo believing that the market will solve housing crises is disingenuous. I believe they believe what they\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re necessarily arguing in bad faith. But I find the position itself disingenuous.\u201d\u201cIf I start commenting, I\u2019m scared that they\u2019re going to block me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve left a couple, throwing a free market idea in here and there and they got a lot of laugh reacts. My reaction is, the Numtots think I\u2019m stupid for saying this.\u201dBut Ms. Eldred is too concerned with monitoring sudden eruptions of racism to worry too much about market urbanism. She said that the scale of the group has made it so that things \u201ccan spiral very quickly.\u201d\u201cAll it takes is one person being like, \u2018Oh not all police are bad,\u2019 and it can get very bad,\u201d she said.Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who specializes in behavior in social networks, said that the group\u2019s changes over time mimicked the history of other, more well-known platforms.\u201cWhen everything was smaller, we all loved it more,\u201d she said. Though she could not define an absolute threshold, she said that once a group gets beyond, 1,000, 2,000 or even 5,000 members, \u201cthings start getting chaotic.\u201dStill, Dr. Papacharissi was excited by Numtot, which she said hewed more closely to the civic engagement that the early internet was supposed to bring about. She said that the splinter groups, particularly the ones for local communities, which often meet up off-line, exemplified a kind of self-correcting instinct.\u201cThe best way to react to that growth is not to pack up and leave but create these microgroups within the larger organization that continue to communicate,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ideal way to reclaim communication and to retain the bonds between those microfactions are memes.\u201dMs. Eldred agreed that the group remains largely positive, though she imagines archiving it forever on a frequent basis.\u201cWe never really wanted to have the responsibility of dealing with what I call my 100,000 large adult children,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time I\u2019m sort of weirdly proud of it. People are learning from each other, and a lot of people care about these things. Transportation and urban planning is thought of as a niche or wonky kind of thing, when it really does affect everybody. This group has been sort of good at lowering the bar to entry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Settling Arguments About Hydrogen With 168 Giant Lasers", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith gentle pulses from gigantic lasers, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California transformed hydrogen into droplets of shiny liquid metal.The findings could also help settle some fractious debates over the physics of the lightest and most abundant element in the universe.Under even higher pressures, the molecules break apart into individual atoms, and the electrons in the atoms are then able to flow freely and readily conduct electricity \u2014 the definition of a metal.An experiment at the Livermore lab in the 1990s was the first to convincingly create metallic hydrogen using a gas gun to send monstrous pressure waves through samples of hydrogen. But those tests did not reveal all of the details about how the transition occurred.The Sandia scientists reported that the metallic transition occurred at about 44 million pounds per square inch, or about 3 million times the atmospheric pressure at ground level on Earth. That was considerably higher than many had expected.\u201cThere\u2019s been a kind of confusion of predictions,\u201d said Peter M. Celliers, a physicist at the Livermore lab who is the lead author of the new paper. They found that the metallic hydrogen transition occurred at less crushing pressures: only 2 million times atmospheric pressure.In addition, the scientists argued that turbulence in the larger Sandia samples masked this transition, and that the temperatures at which hydrogen becomes metal should be revised downward, where they would lie along the same curve as the new Livermore data.\u201cOverall, we think there is a picture emerging that is converging on the truth,\u201d Dr. Celliers said.David M. Ceperley, a physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and his collaborators worked on herculean computer calculations, each data point the result of about 100 hours on a supercomputer with 10,000 computer cores, to model the transition of liquid hydrogen from insulator to metal. \u201cFor us, they\u2019re great,\u201d Dr. Ceperley said. \u201cThey not only end up right on top of our calculations,\u201d but also help reconcile the disparate Harvard and Sandia findings.The Sandia scientists, however, remain confident in their data and did not agree with how the new paper reinterpreted their findings. \u201cWe have a different interpretation of what they\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Michael P. Desjarlais, a Sandia scientist who worked on that experiment. \u201cTheir temperatures are actually higher than they believe. Then their results would actually be quite consistent with ours.\u201dBoth the Sandia and Livermore experiments cannot measure temperatures directly and must infer them from computer simulations of the shock waves.The researchers at both labs are preparing to run additional experiments, compressing hydrogen instead of deuterium. The lighter hydrogen should turn metallic at lower pressures.Even as scientists get a better idea of liquid metallic hydrogen, the ultimate feat of high-pressure alchemy would be to transform hydrogen into a solid metallic form at yet higher pressures. Dr. Silvera said a series of mishaps have slowed follow-up attempts, and many scientists remain skeptical. Dr. Silvera said his laboratory is currently preparing a couple of additional diamond vises. \u201cIt will happen soon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Welcome to the World, Little Fish. In 14 Days You\u2019ll Start Making Babies.", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe African annual fish can reach sexual maturity in about two weeks, scientists found, the fastest known among vertebrates.But in small murky puddles that come after heavy rains in parts of East Africa, another killifish, called Nothobranchius furzeri, or the African annual fish, has developed its own unique adaptations to its environment. Its embryos are able to enter a state of diapause, similar to hibernation in bears, when conditions aren\u2019t right. Dr. Martin Reichard, a biologist who is studying the evolution of aging at the Czech Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Vertebrate Biology, led a team of colleagues to Mozambique to study the fish\u2019s developmental stages in the wild. There, they were able to observe embryos buried in the sand that had entered a dormant state. They also documented their maturation after rainfall.When N. furzeri receive cues from their environment, they can be flexible in sexual development. Under these circumstances, their embryos enter a stage of dormancy called embryonic diapause, a reproductive strategy that extends their gestational period and helps them survive unfavorable conditions, like a dry season.That ability comes at the expense of the fish\u2019s life span. They have an earlier onset of aging than other vertebrates. \u201cThe fish display comparable cellular deterioration and changes found in aging humans after several decades,\u201d said Dr. Reichard.With this information, the researchers found that the fish\u2019s life cycle depends on the environment in which the embryo is laid. For example, during long periods of drought, embryos will undergo three periods of dormancy to ensure their survival. What makes this fish\u2019s life cycle different from other vertebrates is a trait that is commonly found in invertebrates. The embryos have a protective shell, shielding them from severe conditions. \u201cUsually, vertebrates cope with harsh conditions during their adult stage, like bears during wintertime. However, with the embryos, it can be observed during their early developmental stages,\u201d said Dr. Reichard. For now, the research could contribute to the study of aging. Can understanding this species\u2019 adaptations to its environment benefit humans by helping identify specific genetic codes unique to longevity? Or can it help pharmaceutical developers understand how drugs affect different age groups? The answer remains undiscovered.An earlier version of this article incorrectly compared a fish embryo's protective shell. It is like a layer found around the eggs of some invertebrates, not like a shield around a plant's seed.Advertisement"}

To begin to see the light, we must also make clergy members mandated reporters of suspected abuse in every state the way teachers and doctors already are \u2014 and we need to begin to think about eliminating the confessional privilege. Weak penalties have also made reporting more of a choice than a mandate \u2014 penalties can be as little as a small fine. While one failure to report is dangerous and should be subject to more serious punishment, a systemic failure to report is far more problematic and deserves escalating penalties. The Pennsylvania grand jury report included a recommendation that all states should consider: For those institutions that repeatedly fail to report suspected abuse, the penalties should be clearer. They should also be increasingly onerous, including significant financial penalties and potential jail time for higher-ups who covered up abuse. For a truly child-centered system of justice, we cannot trust religious institutions to police themselves.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": " A Guide to Dating Women Raised in a Matriarchy", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, I have a single mom. Don\u2019t panic.Ms. Greenberg is on the editorial staff of the Opinion section. My freshman year in college I went on a date with an earnest boy from my dorm who had ears that stuck out when he grinned. He had been raised Catholic and gone to an all-boys school, and I was charmed by him. I was also generally enthusiastic about college dating, because I hadn\u2019t done much of it. We sat flirting in a booth near the back of a club called Elevate, and everything went well until he broached the subject of my childhood.That\u2019s when I first experienced the trap that has bedeviled me and men I like since, the topic that can make a night pivot from lovely to unendurable in seconds and that I have learned to deflect at all costs upon meeting prospective partners: my single mother. \u201cWhat was it like growing up without a mom?\u201d he asked gently, solemnly, steering us toward a moment of profound connection. I was stirred by his closeness in the booth and the strobe lights above. I wanted to be the type of girl who was breezy but able to be vulnerable when prompted. The problem was that I didn\u2019t grow up without a mom. I actually grew up with a single mom, which is precisely the opposite. He paused and looked at me intently, and then said, \u201cOops, I meant dad.\u201dThe truest answer would have been, \u201cIt was like living my entire life the only way I\u2019ve ever lived it.\u201d I don\u2019t know. What was it like to have lungs instead of gills?I have since learned that it is a shocking amount of trouble to tell men on first dates that I was raised by a single mom. They are always well-intentioned, flirtatious, curious, nice \u2014 and blindingly ignorant. At first I thought they just lacked imagination. But I\u2019ve come to see their responses as indicative of a more primal fear: Lots of people think that women need men, if not for their charm and likability, then at least for their ability to father children. A girl with no dad suggests maybe men aren\u2019t so necessary after all.I grew up firmly in a matriarchy. My grandmother divorced my grandfather when she was 31 and had four young daughters. She wanted more kids, so she very briefly married a man she had met at the neighborhood plant store in order to get his sperm to have a fifth child. She raised her five girls mostly by herself. My mom chose to be a single mom and also had five children: My older siblings and I have donor dads, and my two younger siblings are adopted from Guatemala. After college, I went on a first date with a tall, blond man I met at a party. He took me to a warehouse-turned-restaurant in downtown Oakland, where he ordered us many small plates.After he\u2019d provided an unsettling explanation of his job helping public utility companies raise the price of water without being sued, he asked about my dad. Feeling forced, I told him I had a single mom.\u201cSo how old is your grandmother?\u201d he asked immediately. I couldn\u2019t really figure out the connection in his mind, and also my grandmother had just died. I told him she was dead, but he forged on.\u201cI ask because I just want to know how young your mom was when she had you.\u201dSometimes, a question about my missing father can broaden into a question about the existential nature of all my family relationships. At a first date at a bar in Brooklyn, after we took whiskey shots and talked about the neighborhood, a guy asked me what my parents did for a living.\u201cMy mom is a rabbi,\u201d I said.\u201cAnd what does your dad do?\u201d\u201cI have a single mom.\u201d That was my way of saying, The End!\u201cNo dad?\u201d I said I had a donor dad.\u201cAnd do all of your siblings have the same donor dad?\u201d I said no, some were adopted. I tried to drink my beer.\u201cSo which of your siblings are real?\u201dThis counted as a strike against him and can serve as a teaching moment for all men. Never search for the realest sibling in the bunch.\u201cHave you ever met a man before?\u201d Capt. Steve Trevor asks. \u201cWhat about your father?\u201d\u201cI had no father,\u201d Wonder Woman says. \u201cMy mother sculpted me from clay.\u201dI tucked that answer away, for next time.Zoe Greenberg is on the editorial staff of the Opinion section.Advertisement"}

He takes his mediocrity quite seriously \u2014 in three years of competitive play, he has compiled a 66-64 record.There are moments when I believe, with some evidence, that I am a 35-year-old adult in full command of my emotions. Then there are the moments I play tennis.To illustrate my deficiencies, let\u2019s go back about a year ago to a lovely cool evening in the early fall. The theater for the meltdown is a tennis club in Durham, N.C.; the antagonist, my friend Sam. Imagine green clay courts swept clean, awash in supple glow from the humming lights above, pine boughs communing in quiet susurration beyond the fence. All very idyllic \u2026 provided you\u2019re not a head case.But, rotten luck, I am. In that disastrous first set against Sam, I caught myself mimicking the behaviors of Nick Kyrgios \u2014 glum and angry, dissatisfied as a foundational principle, shaking my head at the unfair world even on points I won.I had no cause to expect greatness, and no cause to erupt in its absence. I came to the sport just three years ago, and though I applied myself with the zealous devotion of a late convert, lost time and dubious natural talent make for a low ceiling. Compare my plodding game with the balletic grace on display at the U.S. Open and you\u2019d need a full forensic team to confirm it was the same sport. Yet there I was, rank amateur, behaving outside logic and propriety, petulant and moody in a match with no stakes.On the tennis court, free from the shackles of self-control, I fluctuate between emotional states with such thoughtless speed that I must be an amalgam of various demons.If you follow tennis, you understand that it would be impossible to pick a worse demon than Mr. Kyrgios, and my game fell accordingly into shambles. More humiliating than missing shots, than losing, was my attitude. I knew Sam well enough that I felt no obligation to preserve any personal dignity, so I whined, cursed and lamented the wind and the bounces and most of all myself.In the excellent book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis,\u201d W. Timothy Gallwey theorizes that every tennis player has dual personalities \u2014 there is the self who executes the shots and the self who watches. The watcher, at the end of the point, turns into the critic, and I know Mr. Gallwey is on the money because I frequently demean myself with a vigor and intensity that is somehow free of self-loathing \u2014 as if I\u2019m yelling at an entirely different person. Someone stupider, slower and less athletic than the real me; a sluggish dope who keeps ruining my perfect plans.In short, disaster was imminent. I lost the first set badly. I was doomed.And then my wife arrived \u2014 a surprise visit on the way home from work \u2014 and her presence changed everything.In desperation, I forced a personality shift. No more Kyrgios \u2014\u00a0it was time to play like my hero Rafael Nadal. If I was going to lose, I decided I would lose nobly \u2014 full effort on each point, no complaints and a short memory to preserve the purity of my quest. In front of my wife, I would become Rafa.\u201cFake it til you make it\u201d might be the world\u2019s most irksome advice, but this time it worked. I was a man transformed, my level rose, and suddenly we had a match. I won the second set in a tiebreaker, and though my wife was long gone by then \u2014 amateur tennis is never as riveting to spectators as it feels to the players \u2014 I\u2019d tasted the drug that is relentless positivity, and I rode the high to a close, exhausting victory in the 10-point match tiebreaker.The reason I remember that night so well, I think, is not the win but the way I conquered the darkness and approached my perfect competitive self \u2014 the state of being I dream of occupying permanently, the state that is mostly inaccessible even temporarily and the state that this sport has allowed me to pursue with a monomaniacal fervor. When I walked off the court that day, I promised myself that no matter how I struggled in the future, I would compete with the mind-set of Rafa. I would be optimistic, passionate and committed until the final point.I failed, of course. Instantly and comprehensively. There\u2019s a reason Rafa is special.Still, when considering the various facets of my three-year tennis obsession, what I love most are these fleeting moments when I transcend my frailties and become \u2014 pardon the embarrassing hyperbole, but this is how it feels \u2014 Buddha-like. For someone with a brain that won\u2019t shut up, it\u2019s a rare path to meditation.Be warned, though: Tennis will assault your fragile psyche.Yet for all the breaking down, tennis has inspired in me a deep and somewhat embarrassing obsession. I catalog the journey by the endless injuries, the hours spent on a tennis message board, the over 100 United States Tennis Association matches that remain seared in my memory.In this quest I am not alone. So when you witness the ethereal grace of the men and women in Flushing Meadows, know that there\u2019s a fanatic in Durham, and others like him all over the country, who, though they are slower and heavier and clumsier and probably older than the gods on TV, have nevertheless used tennis to chase nirvana.

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Escalates Feud With Canada Over Rights Criticism", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Saudi Arabia took concrete steps to disengage economically from Canada on Wednesday, escalating the feud over Canadian criticism of Saudi rights abuses and demonstrating that its expulsion of the Canadian ambassador this week was more than a symbolic protest.The kingdom announced on Wednesday that it would no longer send its citizens to Canadian hospitals and that it would withdraw resident physicians from Canadian hospitals.The measures came in response to two Twitter posts by Canada\u2019s Foreign Ministry last week calling on Saudi Arabia to immediately release imprisoned rights activists, including two who have family in Canada.The unusually strong reaction shows that Saudi Arabia, under the day-to-day leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is willing to wield its wealth to deter Western countries from criticizing how its absolute monarchy is run.Prince Mohammed, who has emerged as the kingdom\u2019s most dynamic official since his father, King Salman, assumed the throne in 2015, has made similar moves against Sweden and Germany in response to criticism.For now, both Saudi Arabia and Canada appear to be sticking to their positions.Asked Wednesday if his government would consider an apology to Saudi Arabia to smooth things over, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \u201cCanadians have always expected our government to speak strongly, firmly, clearly and politely about the need to respect human rights at home and around the world. We will continue to do that.\u201dIn Riyadh, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters that mediation in the dispute was not possible and that Canada needed to \u201cfix its big mistake.\u201d He said: \u201cThere is nothing to mediate. A mistake has been made and a mistake should be corrected.\u201dThe kingdom, he said, is considering unspecified \u201cadditional measures\u201d against Canada.Mr. Trudeau said that the foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, had a \u201clong conversation\u201d with the Saudi foreign minister on Tuesday, and that diplomatic talks between the countries would continue.The United States, which has strong diplomatic and economic ties with both countries, has taken a neutral stance on the dispute.\u201cBoth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it for them; they need to resolve it together.\u201dShe encouraged Saudi Arabia to \u201crespect due process and publicize information on some of its legal cases.\u201dSaudi Arabia has dismissed the Canadian criticism as an unjustified intervention in its internal affairs, and Saudi-owned television stations have aired content aimed at tarnishing the image of Canada.The withdrawal of Saudi students from university and college campuses across Canada appeared unlikely to cause much disruption; they account for fewer than 2 percent of international students in the country.Some campuses will be hit more than others. At the University of Regina, a small school in the middle of Canada\u2019s prairies, for instance, Saudis make up 7 percent of international students \u2014 and pay hefty international tuition fees.It is not merely a matter of revenue.\u201cThe richness of the culture these students bring, the ideas they share from so far away, I think that\u2019s the biggest loss,\u201d said Livia Castellanos, an associate vice president at the university.The Saudi students, she said, were stunned at having to leave their homes, cars, furniture and studies with less than four weeks\u2019 notice. \u201cThey have invested a lot of their life here,\u201d she said.On Wednesday, the Saudi state news agency also said the kingdom was no longer sending patients to Canadian hospitals. It was not immediately clear how many Saudi patients are in Canada, but many Saudis have surgery and other complicated treatments abroad, often paid for by their government.Saudi Arabia also moved to withdraw about 800 Saudi medical students working as residents or fellows in hospitals around Canada, including more than 200 at the University of Toronto. They have been told they have until the end of the month to leave the country, according to Dr. Salvatore Spadafora, a vice dean at the University of Toronto\u2019s faculty of medicine.\u201cWe are hopeful the situation can be resolved,\u201d he said.While the Saudi sanctions may touch individual sectors, they will not have a great impact on the overall Canadian economy, analysts say.Cam Dahl, president of Cereals Canada, said farmers were more likely to be troubled by the larger picture: the general rise in protectionism. Just last year, Italy slapped a made-in-Italy labeling on imported durum wheat, which led to exports from Canada for Italian pasta all but collapsing, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s part of a protectionist environment we are in right now and it\u2019s troubling,\u201d Mr. Dahl said.Saudi Arabia and Canada do about $4 billion a year in bilateral trade. In 2017, Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia totaled $1.1 billion, a fraction of a percent of Canada\u2019s total exports.A few countries, including Bahrain and Egypt, have stated their support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s position, but without announcing concrete steps of their own.The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the split between Canada and Saudi Arabia. It blamed international powers \u201cmeddling in the internal affairs of countries in the region\u201d for the tensions.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter at: @NYTBenAdvertisement"}

Contributing Opinion WriterThat particular chicken is an advertisement for the Shady Lawn Truck Stop\u2019s fried-chicken plate. It is wearing a chef\u2019s hat. Where its wings should be are a giant fork and a giant carving knife. The combination makes for a troubling message: chicken as both dinner and diner. It is also covered with graffiti, mostly people\u2019s names but also an exhortation to \u201cRead More.\u201d Unlike the existential conflict at the heart of the chicken\u2019s identity, that\u2019s a message I had no trouble decoding. In Birmingham, 50 miles south of this \u201cJerusalem in miniature,\u201d the cosmology goes back even further. Rising above the city is a mammoth statue of Vulcan, the Roman god of the forge. It is the world\u2019s largest cast-iron statue, but during the years when I was growing up there, its fame lay primarily in its peculiar attire: Vulcan is wearing nothing but a blacksmith\u2019s apron and knee-high sandals, and his bare buttocks moon the town of Homewood.Perhaps because that image is still fresh in mind by the time drivers on I-65 reach the water tower in Chilton County, center of the Alabama peach-growing region, it\u2019s hard not to see a connection between Birmingham\u2019s famous landmark and Chilton County\u2019s almost-as-famous water tower, which was built in the shape of an authentically cleft peach. Nearby Montgomery boasts the World\u2019s Largest Brick Made of Bricks. (Once the World\u2019s Largest Brick period, it was bested in 2007 by a slightly larger brick built in one piece.) We didn\u2019t stop to see it, but we did stop for five more giant chickens \u2014 some metal, some concrete \u2014 that were standing in front of various small-town establishments off the interstate.All across the country, on interstates the width of football fields and two-lane blue highways, stand an uncountable number of homespun reminders that American ingenuity and wit have not yet been Walmart-ized out of existence. Think of Carhenge in Alliance, Neb., a replica of Stonehenge made entirely of vintage automobiles. Think of Dog Bark Park Inn in Cottonwood, Idaho, a bed-and breakfast that doubles as the World\u2019s Largest Beagle. Think of the 13-foot-tall peanut smiling with Jimmy Carter-style teeth in Plains, Ga.; or the World\u2019s Largest Ball of Twine in Cawker City, Kan.; or Lenny, the World\u2019s Only Life-Size Chocolate Moose in Scarborough, Me. Every state has them. Virtually every road in the country is the site of at least one.They are most visible on leisurely summer road trips, when a detour to take a selfie with a chicken or to snicker at a 114-year-old statue\u2019s bare butt won\u2019t make anyone late for the cranberry relish or the Easter ham, but they are always there. Often meant to be an advertisement for some local enterprise, they are inevitably much more than the mercantile economy requires. They are also evidence that human imagination will always resist homogenization, that daring art isn\u2019t found only in galleries and museums, that wit and wile are everywhere among us. When interstate exits are marked by the instantly recognizable icons of a dozen fast-food restaurants and gas stations supplied by the same multinational oil companies, the giant roadside chickens will always remind us of who we are.Advertisement"}

He went with me to Trader Joe\u2019s, trailing behind, picking up items and putting them down. Afterward he would enthusiastically carry my bags. He started saying, \u201cI love you, and you love me too.\u201dI knew him for 13 days. For those 13 days, we were together constantly. He told me he was a real estate agent so he had time and a flexible schedule. He told me he was between apartments, staying with friends in their gorgeous Bushwick apartment, where he helped out with their new baby.He taught me about emo music. I introduced him to Gloria Estefan. We listened to everything in bed, shouting at Alexa while singing poorly and loudly.He was fast and alert, like an amphibian, popping and bobbing around me. He had a thing for that cartoon cat called Pusheen and would say, \u201cPusheen\u201d in a baby voice every chance he got. One day he brought me a stuffed animal sort of like it, and I oohed and aahed.James was kind of great, but his intensity freaked me out. When I first swiped him on Tinder, I didn\u2019t see the overgrown skater boy he turned out to be. I thought he was serious in his photos, a grown-up. In person he seemed too cool for me, too playful and young. He was cute, laughed a lot when I was funny, and complimented me. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t much like him at first. But I tried it.I always try it. That\u2019s how I am and always have been. I don\u2019t remember a lot from my childhood in Fort Wayne, Ind., but I do remember creepy things. There was a girl in the neighborhood who had a dirty face and dirty hands. Once we found her crouched on the floor of our pantry eating Ritz crackers, and my mother had to shoo her away.That image hits me in a dark place. It\u2019s so real, but did it actually happen? My childhood memory is like a murky, creepy liar. However, some things are crystal clear, like when my father would drive me to figure skating practice and I would look at my own hands in my lap and think: \u201cWho is that? How long will I be stuck in this charade? How long do I have to be trapped in me?\u201dIt seemed unendurable.Emotionally doubling let me \u2014 made me \u2014 hold hands with James and have sex with James and put up with James at all. I have always had romantic relationships because it seemed easier than not having them. It was so much more work to say, \u201cNo thanks.\u201dAlthough I was aware that humans need and desire love, sex, togetherness and family, and that they prioritize those things, I felt as if I were doing all that just to do it. In terms of love, I always accepted horrible deficits, emptiness and disconnection, and I didn\u2019t really care.When I met James, three years ago, I was 36 and nothing about my life was how I wanted it to be. My apartment had one window (it still does). I spent hours walking around Brooklyn Heights peering into people\u2019s living rooms. I was surviving as an actress, on residuals. When I was acting, I had everything; when I wasn\u2019t, I had nothing.And I set it up like that. I chose to believe that, for me, everything that was important to other people was wrapped up in success. It was as if success were a pi\u00f1ata, and when I finally smashed it all of the stuff of life would fall out, and I would consume it and become one with myself.I thought the same way about love. I figured that love, for me, would fall out of the success pi\u00f1ata whenever I was finally able to break it open. It took me years to realize that success wasn\u2019t actual or tangible or a pi\u00f1ata in any way. In fact, I had already experienced a big conventional success \u2014 being on a hit TV show \u2014 and no pi\u00f1ata containing all of life\u2019s delights had burst open for me. That\u2019s how I found myself on Tinder.And Tinder brought me James. For 13 days, James told me I was beautiful. For 13 days, he proudly held Cindy\u2019s leash and paraded her around my block as if it were his block. He was super into it, and it was his \u201cinto-it-ness\u201d that got me and started to change me. I was starting to imagine that I might like him or that liking him or any man was something from my very own life. I took him to meet my friends. There I was, getting kissed and squeezed in front of my people.Then, after those 13 long days, he said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dIt\u2019s the kind of sentence that makes the floor drop out.\u201cEverything I told you is true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true anymore.\u201dMeaning he wasn\u2019t actually working as a real estate agent. He didn\u2019t have a job, or, as it turned out, a place to live. He wasn\u2019t living with any friend or helping out with any baby. He was staying in a men\u2019s shelter somewhere out in Queens.He cried a lot, and I felt sick. I sat there waiting, vibrating in that empty moment.\u201cBut you have so many shoes,\u201d I said.And he did. He seemed to have on a different pair every time I saw him. He had style and outfits, which he kept in a locker.The feeling that followed was so strange, as if I were coming into consciousness in the middle of a home invasion. My breathing slowed and I became still. Psychologically, I started to move around him, soothing and cajoling him toward the door.I know that anyone can fall on hard times and that the world is awful, but I was suddenly scared of him and angry. It was as if he had broken into my house and my body. He had given me what I needed so I would give him what he wanted, and it made me feel worthless.In the moment, I did what I could to get him away from me. I could have screamed that he was a liar. Instead, I stood in silence, facing off with my own guilt and unease. It was ugly because I had a problem with a person who had nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201dBut it was his fault that he lied to me and used me. What happened between us was his fault. It took another 10 days for me to completely break up with him \u2014 via text, email and messenger \u2014 until he had resisted and persisted to the point that he finally earned my cruelty. And that was that. Until later that summer, when I passed a candy store with a giant stuffed Pusheen in the window. Staring into its pinprick eyes, I realized that my lying Tinder lover was the one who broke my emotional double. Because of him, I had crashed into my own self and come to see that I did want and need real love, that I did want and need good things, and that I am more than just a lifeboat for desperate men who prey on women who don\u2019t care enough about themselves.Leaning against that windowpane and remembering my time with James, I felt a tiny pi\u00f1ata burst open in my heart.Advertisement"}

Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s C.E.O., has been called a \u201cone-man bubble maker.\u201d Some founders are desperate to get access to the company\u2019s Scrooge McDuck pool of money. But others charge that the fund, which invests a minimum of $100 million per deal, is pushing companies to take on capital they may not want or need out of fear. (Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s C.E.O., once said he did a deal with the firm because he\u2019d rather have SoftBank\u2019s \u201ccapital cannon\u201d behind him, rather than pointed at him.)This week SoftBank positioned its capital cannon behind Brandless, sending $240 million to the e-commerce start-up, which sells a variety of organic and \u201cclean\u201d household consumables for $3 each. Brandless started selling products just one year ago, and is notable because it is taking on Amazon and Whole Foods, among others.But SoftBank and Brandless will be using Amazon\u2019s own playbook against it. Like Amazon, SoftBank is known for pushing executives to think bigger and bolder, trading profits for market dominance. Tina Sharkey, chief executive of Brandless, described an ambitious plan to \u201creimagine the entire stack of consumption,\u201d including \u201cwhat it means to be a brand.\u201dSoftBank knows a few things about e-commerce \u2014 its investment in Chinese internet giant Alibaba is regarded as one of the greatest deals in the history of venture investing. SoftBank\u2019s attempt to recreate that success in India, with investments in Snapdeal and Flipkart, has not been as successful. But the end result, in which SoftBank agreed to sell its stake in Flipkart to Amazon\u2019s local rival, Walmart, likely annoyed Jeff Bezos nonetheless.What else happened this week?Advertisement"}

Train More People to Perform Them", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Steinauer is an obstetrician-gynecologist and the founder of the nonprofit Medical Students for Choice.And yet the need for qualified abortion providers has never been more urgent. Roe is hanging in the balance. It\u2019s time for a national commitment to training and supporting the next generation of providers to meet the needs of patients whose rights are under threat.For these women, we need clinicians trained and ready. We will need clinicians skilled in providing abortions in border areas to serve women who are forced to travel across state lines. We will need providers who are trained in more complex second-trimester abortions, because travel and other hurdles will cause delays in care. We will need clinicians of all specialties to treat the inevitable complications that will come when women without options seek unsafe methods of ending their pregnancies. We will need clinicians in all states to employ the harm-reduction model and be a resource for women to seek help in managing their own abortions without fear of criminalization. Current and future medical and nursing students should commit to not just learning these skills themselves but also pushing for this training within their institutions so that all graduates will be prepared to address the many situations in which a woman may need abortion care.Everyone can play a part in making it easier for people to serve their communities as abortion providers. Support organizations like Medical Students for Choice that work to ensure abortion training. Contribute to local funds that provide financial assistance to women needing abortion, including support for travel to other states when necessary. Call your state legislators and tell them to eliminate obstacles that block trained clinicians from providing care and patients from getting it. Volunteer and support your local clinics to become part of the community that helps abortion providers overcome the obstacles that politicians and protesters throw their way.Our country needs to act now to have providers ready for the challenges ahead. Advances in medication abortion are vital and important, but not enough. In the darkest times for abortion access in this country in decades, women still need providers capable of providing quality, compassionate care that both protects their health and honors their autonomy. As we confront the uncertain future of Roe and fight to preserve it, we must train, inspire and come together to support the next generation of clinicians to carry out this mission.Dr. Jody Steinauer is an obstetrician-gynecologist, the director of the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, and the founder of Medical Students for Choice, a nonprofit that advocates abortion training in medical school curriculums.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hot College Gig: Online Brand Promoter", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaying college students to push products is nothing new for companies. The exuberant undergraduate wearing a Nike cap and giving out samples is as common on American campuses as football fans tailgating at homecoming.But now, like so much in the advertising world, the big action is online. As students return to campuses, they\u2019re constantly checking their Instagram, Snapchat and other social media accounts \u2014 so companies are turning to many of them to promote products right alongside photos of family, friends and the new puppy.For busy students, it is an easy, low-pressure way to make extra money or get free products. For marketers, it is a simple way to reach young people \u2014 a supplement to their other social media efforts, including hiring full-time promoters.Though there are no comprehensive data for how many college students promote brands online, interviews with university officials, marketing consultants, brand representatives and students make it clear that the social media platform is big business on campus. Many of the deals are for Instagram posts, but some brands also have students posting on other services, like Twitter and Facebook.At Virginia Tech, as many as 1,000 of the 30,000 undergrads are being paid to promote products as varied as mascara and storage bins, according to an estimate by Donna Wertalik, director of marketing for the university\u2019s Pamplin College of Business.\u201cWe see so many brands that have it,\u201d Ms. Wertalik said. \u201cA lot of start-up brands will do it. They\u2019ll look for students with credibility and influence to give them credibility and influence.\u201dCompanies outline expectations for what the sponsored posts should include, such as specific hashtags or promotions for particular items. Many also ask students to hold or attend events on campus.Isabel Senior, a student at Duke University, worked for LaCroix, the sparkling water company. Each week for six weeks, she had to post one Instagram photo, one Instagram story and one post on a platform like Facebook or Snapchat. She also gave out cans of LaCroix at campus events like five-kilometer races and university-sponsored concerts.Every Sunday, Ms. Senior had to send in a form with three photos from her weekly sampling event, along with screenshots of her posts. The company paid her in money and LaCroix products, and if she didn\u2019t complete a task, she said, it docked some of the pay.The job isn\u2019t always as simple as it may sound.\u201cI think the time commitment was what I expected,\u201d said Annabelle Schmitt, a senior at Pennsylvania State University this fall, \u201cbut how hard it was I did not expect.\u201dMs. Schmitt also hosted events like a swimsuit promotion that helped women find the best suit for their bodies, and a screening of a documentary about the singer Demi Lovato followed by a discussion about self-love.Creating the images took Ms. Schmitt at least two hours each week. She was paid with money and company products.\u201cBecause I take my branding seriously for my personal blog,\u201d she said, \u201cI try to work with photographers to get really high quality.\u201dThe payments to the so-called campus influencers appear to vary widely, from cash to merchandise, and brands say little about them.Riddle & Bloom\u2019s website says it pays out a total of $2 million to its campus representatives, but during an interview its president, Darren Ross, would not go into detail or confirm the website\u2019s numbers.She and 12 other women from colleges like the University of Alabama and Ohio State University \u2014 \u201cbig state schools with football programs,\u201d she said \u2014 spent three days at Alex and Ani headquarters there. They toured the work space and received instructions on curating their Instagram feeds.Companies use numerous methods to select campus influencers. Sometimes the students apply directly to the marketing agencies; sometimes the marketers identify the students.Students can go to the Riddle & Bloom website and apply for one of the 2,000 \u201cinternships,\u201d which last for a semester.Some students land the job through old-fashioned networking. Ms. Senior, the student at Duke, heard about Riddle & Bloom through a sorority sister, who had posted a link to the online application in their sorority group chat.And sometimes, students have no idea how they were selected.Advertisers hire Riddle & Bloom for access to its database of student applicants. The company says it has a close working relationship with university officials through the National Association for Campus Activities, a trade association, noting that they even share an office in Columbia, S.C.Representatives from the association say that they do not give out either personal or contact information about students without permission, but that they do steer campus leaders toward Riddle & Bloom.Ms. Gabriel said she hadn\u2019t considered being a brand ambassador until, out of the blue, AT&T reached out to her via direct message on Instagram. She attributed the company\u2019s interest to the down-to-earth photos she posts and the number of comments she gets.\u201cMy follower-to-like ratio is probably something that caught their eye,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Missing Paperwork Got Him Out of Jail. Then, Police Say, He Raped and Killed.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a simple clerical error, a missing bit of paperwork.But it had tragic consequences.Danueal Drayton was arrested earlier this year on charges that he choked an ex-girlfriend in Nassau County. By that time, he had a left a trail of similar crimes in his home state of Connecticut.Yet when Mr. Drayton came before a county judge for a bail hearing, no one there was aware that he had a history of violence against women \u2014 not the local prosecutor, not the public defender, not the court clerks. His out-of-state criminal history was missing from his court file, even though the Nassau County police insist they hand-delivered a copy to the court.On July 5, the judge canceled Mr. Drayton\u2019s initial bail of $2,000 and let him out of jail on his own recognizance to await trial.The case highlights a weakness in New York\u2019s system for providing courts with the criminal histories of people brought before them.Since the 1970s, a state law has required the police to distribute paper copies of defendants\u2019 criminal histories to local district attorneys and courts, which share them with the defense.Court clerks with clearances are now able to check criminal records themselves through the state\u2019s electronic portal. But because of the law, judges rely on the local police instead, said Lucian Chalfen, a spokesman for the Office of Court Administration.In Mr. Drayton\u2019s case, state officials said his comprehensive records were sent to the police, the district attorney\u2019s office and the court in Nassau County on July 1, four days before the judge\u2019s bail decision, through an electronic portal called eJustice. But the judge and the prosecutor handling the case never checked the portal, court officials and the Nassau County District Attorney\u2019s office said.New York City detectives eventually tracked Mr. Drayton to an apartment in Los Angeles, where he had fled using one of the slain nurse\u2019s credit cards, the police said. When officers came through the door, they found Mr. Drayton holding another woman captive, who told officers he had raped her, Los Angeles authorities said. Mr. Drayton is being held in Los Angeles on rape charges and New York is seeking his extradition.Mr. Drayton\u2019s case has ignited a debate in New York among court officials and law enforcement agencies about rap sheet procedures and what should be done to prevent future mistakes. The Nassau County police have not publicly accepted responsibility for the missing records, but after reviewing the case, the department updated its protocol to specify that criminal records from out of state must be shared with the court and district attorney.P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney and the president of the District Attorneys Association of New York, said the lapse was indicative of a larger problem with the criminal justice system relying on paper documents and analog processes. He argued that the onus should be on the courts to ensure they have the information judges need: \u201cThey should begin the practice of routinely pulling those records because it\u2019s the courts that determine the issue of bail,\u201d he said.Mr. Chalfen in the Office of Court Administration did not agree. He said the error in Mr. Drayton\u2019s case was an unfortunate mistake, but it did not expose a deeper problem.\u201cWe have not found that the current method of how criminal background checks are provided to the court, at arraignment, have any systemic flaws,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York State\u2019s criminal procedure law is clear as to the fact that the local police agency is responsible.\u201dHe added that, with 450,000 bail hearings a year, it would be impractical to shift that responsibility to courts in the state\u2019s smaller towns and villages, where judges and prosecutors operate with only a few staff members. Even courts in larger counties depend on other agencies for many tasks, he noted, like bringing defendants to court.Some prosecutors have taken matters into their own hands. In district attorneys\u2019 offices in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, as well as in Albany, staff regularly retrieve defendants\u2019 criminal histories from eJustice. The platform automatically searches state and national databases for convictions, warrants, orders of protection and parole or probation statuses after the police upload suspects\u2019 fingerprints.The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office reviews the records, for example, when prosecutors are deciding whether to charge someone with a more serious crime based on a prior conviction.Other prosecutors and defense lawyers have said that the problem could be minimized if the Division of Criminal Justice Services provided the criminal history reports in a single document on the online portal. Currently, eJustice generates three separate reports that typically arrive within minutes, but reports containing out-of-state and federal data can sometimes be delayed by days or weeks.Had Justice Erica L. Prager received Mr. Drayton\u2019s criminal history before she decided his bail, she would have seen a dark portrait of a violent man.Mr. Drayton had spent several years in jail for attacking women, he violated orders to stay away from them and he repeatedly skipped check-ins with his probation officers, according to records from the Connecticut Judicial Branch and news reports.Judicial records showed Mr. Drayton was charged with felony strangulation and sentenced effectively to three years in jail and three years on probation. He was released on probation in November 2014, but returned to jail the following May after he was caught holding a woman captive in her Waterbury home, the Hartford Courant reported.Mr. Drayton was arrested again while that case was pending after the same woman found him in her house, and he was eventually sentenced to three years in prison for unlawful restraint and violating a protective order, judicial records showed. He was released in April 2017.In February, New Haven police arrested Mr. Drayton again for sending threatening messages to a male friend. He pleaded guilty to harassment in March and received a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail, plus one year of probation, according to judicial records.By then, Mr. Drayton had missed three appointments with his probation officer in Connecticut and the authorities there were searching for him. But they were unaware he had been jailed in New York and only issued a warrant for his arrest on July 17, after his release without bail.That same day, the nurse Mr. Drayton met on Tinder, Samantha Stewart, 29, was found beaten and strangled to death in her bedroom in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Investigators tracked Mr. Drayton to North Hollywood, Calif., a week later, where the authorities said a fugitive task force found him holding a woman captive. The police said he kidnapped and raped her after meeting her in an Uber; they believed he intended to kill her.Mr. Drayton remains in jail in California, where he has pleaded not guilty to rape charges. He is expected to be extradited back to New York to face murder and rape charges, the police have said.The police said Mr. Drayton has claimed responsibility for several more rapes and murders in New York City, which detectives are investigating. Investigators said they believed he raped a 23-year-old woman on June 17 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, but no other victims have come forward.The ex-girlfriend who accused Mr. Drayton of choking her told Nassau County police in June that Mr. Drayton attacked her when she tried to break up with him and that he returned a few days later and slashed her tires. In a chilling Facebook message, he wrote, \u201cThis is the beginning,\u201d according to the criminal complaint against him.A judge set his bail at $2,000 bond on July 1. But Justice Prager let him go on his own recognizance at a follow-up hearing on July 5.Justice Prager declined to comment. A court transcript showed that she was never told of Mr. Drayton\u2019s past, and in fact was given the opposite information. \u201cHe has no criminal record,\u201d a public defender, Aubrey Chamberlain, told the judge, arguing against bail. \u201cHe has zero failures to appear.\u201dThe prosecutor, Karen Lipton, said nothing about the defendant\u2019s criminal record. Instead she argued that his bail should be set high because he had threatened the former girlfriend on Facebook, saying he would cut her brake lines and set her car on fire.\u201cI haven\u2019t even used Facebook,\u201d Mr. Drayton pleaded. \u201cI am not here to cause any heinous acts.\u201d\u201cEvery case is different,\u201d the judge said. \u201cEvery defendant is different. Every situation is different.\u201d She asked if the prosecution had been in touch with the victim, but Ms. Lipton could not say for sure. Then the judge asked Mr. Drayton if he would return to court.\u201cYes, I can come back to court,\u201d he said.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Justice Prager said. \u201cHe is released on his own recognizance.\u201dAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Conflict of Interest That Is Killing Recycling", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesSome of the biggest recycling operations are owned by landfill companies whose profits improve when recycling doesn\u2019t work well.David Bornstein: What\u2019s happening to recycling today?It\u2019s important to reiterate that China\u2019s recent decision to no longer purchase recyclables from the U.S. is not the cause of the U.S. recycling crisis as has been widely reported. DB: What led to this situation?Most people don\u2019t know that this problem is easily solvable. In our work, at Recycle Across America, we\u2019ve seen that the societywide standardized labeling system for recycling bins can eliminate most of the contamination. It\u2019s a simple solution \u2014 but some of the large groups that influence the recycling industry are not motivated to fix the problem. DB: Why not? When there is this type of conflict of interest at such an influential level in the recycling industry, it becomes clear why the simple issue of public confusion at the bin wasn\u2019t resolved. Because when recycling is highly contaminated and too costly to process, then the landfills generate more revenues, the virgin material industries sell more virgin materials and there is a stronger appetite for building incinerators that burn waste to create energy. As an analogy, imagine the groups responsible for promoting road safety in the U.S. also owning most of the auto body shops, hospitals and morgues. DB: What will be the effect if the recycling industry does collapse? DB: What would you like to see done? Even though recycling programs are different from one community to the next, there can be standardized labels for every type of sorting system. Speed limits are different from one road to the next, but the standardized signs allow us to change our speed accordingly wherever we are. DB: What\u2019s been your experience when the information is presented more consistently? When Bank of America donated standardized labels for all the bins at Orlando\u2019s public K-12 schools, recycling levels for the school district increased 90 percent and the district saved $369,000 in trash hauling fees in the first year alone. Despite having millions of visitors from all over the world, Yosemite National Park\u2019s contamination levels in their recycling bins have decreased to less than 8 percent since displaying the standardized labels on their bins. Some of the hotels and theme parks at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida saw a doubling or tripling of their recycling rates after implementing the standarized-label solution for their 90,000 employees.

It made me want to meet the rest of the family I didn\u2019t know.\u201dHe initiated contact through the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families and the state first got in touch with his biological mother, Michele Newman. At the time, she was living in Hilo, Hawaii, working at a families services nonprofit organization with men who had experienced or were accused of domestic violence.Ms. Newman was on her lunch break when she received the call from the state. She burst into tears. \u201cIt was immediate waterworks,\u201d she said. \u201cI called my mom. Then I went back to work and told my boss \u2018I\u2019ve got to go home for the rest of the day.\u2019\u201dWithin a few days, she and Mr. Schmidt spoke on the phone. \u201cIt was just incredible, and overwhelming to hear his voice,\u201d Ms. Newman said.\u201cWe were two strangers, meeting for the first time, who already had an emotional bond,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said.Ms. Newman told Mr. Schmidt about the day he was born, 35 years earlier, during a severe snowstorm that kept Ms. Newman from leaving the hospital for days. At the time, Ms. Newman, now 53, was a high school junior. She and Mr. Schmidt\u2019s biological father, Dave Lindgren, grew up in the small farming community of Loyal, Wis., and their families were close.But Mr. Lindgren was a few years older, and in addition to going to high school, he was working at a dairy plant. The two had dated for several months and broke up before Ms. Newman realized she was pregnant.\u201cThere was never any real bitterness between us,\u201d she said. \u201cDave was a good man with a good heart, and we were both doing things we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201dStill, the lack of bitterness \u2014 and the support of her family \u2014 didn\u2019t make Ms. Newman\u2019s high school experience any less isolating. After graduation, she left town and embarked on a peripatetic life, living in different cities in Arizona; Colorado; Wyoming; and finally Hawaii. She married twice but had no other children.\u201cI had always wondered about Martin,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cI felt so blessed that this happened in my life at 50-something years old.\u201dA couple of weeks later, Ms. Newman was still turning it all over in her head. \u201cI was thinking about who I am and where life had taken me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt had been 35 years, and I hadn\u2019t spoken to Dave since I told him I was pregnant.\u201dBut she knew he had consented to opening the adoption file, too, and that he might have spoken with Mr. Schmidt. She decided to reach out, curious to know what he was feeling. \u201cMy plan was just to send him a text,\u201d Ms. Newman said.When he got her text, Mr. Lindgren was five hours ahead, getting ready for bed at his home in Marshfield, Wis. \u201cIt was an odd area code and number, so at first I ignored it,\u201d Mr. Lindgren, 55, said. \u201cBut once I realized who it was, we texted back and forth a few times and I asked, \u2018Do you mind if I give you a call?\u2019\u201dSince they last spoke, Mr. Lindgren had married three times and had become a father many times over. \u201cI have four biological children, including Martin, and four stepchildren that are also my kids,\u201d Mr. Lindgren said. \u201cI was always meant to be a dad.\u201dHe had stayed in central Wisconsin and worked his way up to being a plant manager at Lynn Dairy. A self-proclaimed milk and cheese obsessive, he is also certified as a master cheese maker through the University of Wisconsin, specializing in Cheddar, Monterey Jack, mozzarella and provolone.On that fateful day in December, when Ms. Newman texted him, he hadn\u2019t yet heard from his firstborn. (\u201cI was spacing out the calls a bit for the emotional load,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said.)Mr. Lindgren was eager to hear about his son, but expected his conversation with Ms. Newman would be a short one. Four hours later, at 2 a.m., he got off the phone and realized there was still so much more to say.A few days later, they spoke on the phone again. And then they couldn\u2019t stop talking. He learned about the many jobs she held before she moved to Hawaii in her 40s and got her undergraduate degree and a master\u2019s in counseling psychology. He learned about her passion for advocating for victims of sexual assault and those struggling with addiction. Ms. Newman learned that Mr. Lindgren was going through a divorce, and about his children and the goings-on of his large extended family.\u201cWe had long deep discussions,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cWe were going through all these serious life topics. We became very close that way.\u201dSoon, they were talking every day, sometimes multiple times. And one day Mr. Lindgren said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Hawaii.\u2019\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think this was any romantic kind of thing,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cDave was in the middle of a divorce.\u201dSo she said she\u2019d be happy to show him around the Big Island. For his part, Mr. Lindgren knew there was an \u201cinstant connection.\u201d And though he was interested in Hawaii, he had never before had any intention of traveling there. He bought two tickets for the trip \u2014 one for him, and one for his nephew Nate, who could double as a travel partner and potential buffer.Ms. Newman picked up leis and drove to the airport to greet them. When she saw Mr. Lindgren walking down the escalator toward her, something shifted.\u201cI guess my heart was already halfway there,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the minute I saw him, I just thought to myself, \u2018Oh my god.\u2019\u201dHe felt it too. \u201cI could just tell,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it.\u201dThey gave each other a hug. And then a kiss. And from there, Mr. Lindgren said, \u201cit took over from us being 16 and 17 years old again.\u201dThe vacation was a romantic success \u2014 they ate sushi, went swimming with manta rays, toured a volcano overlook \u2014 but both Mr. Lindgren and Ms. Newman worried about what might happen next. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that hard of a time leaving anywhere,\u201d Mr. Lindgren said. \u201cI worried I might not ever see her again.\u201dEven some 4,000 miles and five hours apart, the two continued to talk every day. Separately, they were also talking with their son more and more.Mr. Schmidt was having other new conversations, too.\u201cWe quickly started hearing from my biological grandmothers,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cWe get cards, presents for the kids\u2019 birthdays, for our birthdays \u2014 that warmth has made it really simple to become part of the family.\u201dWithin a few months of the Hawaii trip, Ms. Newman decided to move back to Wisconsin for good. It wasn\u2019t just about Dave. \u201cI wanted to be closer to my mom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just started to feel Hawaii wasn\u2019t the place for me to be anymore.\u201dShe was also very eager to meet her son. She packed her belongings and flew to the mainland, meeting her mother, Kay Schaefer, in Portland, Ore. The two then embarked on a road trip back to Wisconsin, with a significant stop in Colorado.\u201cShe drove to me first,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful moment to give a hug to your birth mom.\u201dIt was during this visit that Mr. Schmidt learned of the romance unfolding between his biological parents.\u201cDave posted a picture of them in Hawaii on Facebook and I thought, \u2018There\u2019s definitely something happening here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cBut Michele\u2019s visit was when we understood she was going back to be with her mom and see if this relationship with Dave would really work.\u201dThe new relationship worried some of her family at first. Ms. Newman\u2019s sister, Teri Bruna, said that when she heard Dave and Michele were dating again, she thought it was \u201creally bizarre. I was shocked when she moved back to Wisconsin. Michele hates the cold.\u201d But, she said, \u201cDave is probably the nicest guy on the planet and he makes my sister happy.\u201dMs. Schaefer also worried. She told Mr. Lindgren at one point: \u201cYou weren\u2019t my favorite person. If you hurt her again, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dBut as the couple\u2019s love grew, their families grew close again, too. (Mr. Lindgren\u2019s mother, Edna, said of Ms. Newman\u2019s mother, Kay: \u201cShe was one of the first people I met when we bought the farm.\u201d Mr. Schmidt was the first grandchild for both of them. \u201cYou can\u2019t forget that,\u201d she said.)The couple moved in together, and on Dec. 12, 2015, exactly one year after that fateful first text message, Mr. Lindgren proposed. She protested at first. They had both been married multiple times, and she felt it was unnecessary when they knew how they felt about each other. \u201cI told him, \u2018We\u2019re old. We don\u2019t need this,\u2019\u201d she said.But he insisted. \u201cI want to marry my sweetheart,\u201d he told her.On the first Saturday in August, he did. The wedding was a casual backyard affair, hosted at the couple\u2019s home, a white house nestled between cornfields in Marshfield, Wis.The events of the day were held somewhat in reverse: First, there was a party, followed by dinner, and at sunset, a quick ceremony.About 100 guests, including Mr. Schmidt\u2019s wife, Carin, and their children, Malcolm, 3, and Willow, 1, mingled about. Strings of icicle lights were hung from the edges of white tents, and tables were set with Mason jars filled with flowers from the bride\u2019s garden. Instead of a D.J. there was a box of CDs. A sleepy yellow lab named Summer snoozed under the buffet table. Several guests had parked campers and pitched tents in the yard so they wouldn\u2019t have to drive home later.Steely gray clouds and gusty winds threatened rain all afternoon, but the weather held until right before the ceremony. A brief but intense downpour around 7:15 p.m. sent several guests out into the yard to save the huppah. Ms. Newman, who was raised Roman Catholic but converted to Judaism when she married her second husband, had fashioned it out of tall branches and a lace tablecloth from her grandmother.Ms. Newman, who wore a white lace peplum top and a peacock-blue skirt, stood before her guests and said: \u201cWith every blessing, there\u2019s some sadness. But I wouldn\u2019t change any of this at all. The day that I got the call that Martin wanted to reach out to us was the best day of my life. And it\u2019s just gotten better every day after that.\u201dThe groom, in black shorts and a white athleisure polo shirt, was even more succinct. \u201cI never thought in a million years this would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just awesome.\u201dNaturally, their son, the one who reunited the two high school sweethearts, officiated the ceremony. (Several years earlier, he was ordained, on a lark, by the Church of the Latter Day Dude. This was a delight to Ms. Newman, whose favorite movie is \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d for which the online church is named.)Standing safely under the big tent while the rain poured, Mr. Schmidt grinned and began the ceremony. \u201cFor those of you who haven\u2019t met me, I\u2019m Martin Schmidt. I\u2019m their son,\u201d he said to loud cheers. \u201cAnd related or not, this is the group of people we call family.\u201dAllison Geyer contributed from Marshfield, Wis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Gem, a Teen Wonder Plays in the Big Leagues", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Flynn McGarry arrived in New York three years ago as the chef of a pop-up restaurant, Eureka. He was 16 at the time, but he\u2019d been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother\u2019s house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he\u2019s better at choosing names now that he\u2019s 19.Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven.Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn\u2019t take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren\u2019t just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes.My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn\u2019t cross the line into outright imitation.White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package.Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit\u2019s bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered.Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint.Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry\u2019s lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July\u2019s heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn\u2019t have served starchy grilled peas if he\u2019d known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough.By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn\u2019t make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn\u2019t ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it\u2019s clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef.Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it\u2019s a bit silly.It\u2019s one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm.That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you\u2019d get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn\u2019t. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California.At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It\u2019s too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d those menus have to be the result of ideas that can\u2019t be contained any other way; they\u2019re not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swimming in Words With Oliver Sacks", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis love of language has a life of its own.When I say he loved words, I don\u2019t simply mean within the context of being a writer of numerous classic books \u2014 \u201cAwakenings,\u201d \u201cThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,\u201d \u201cMusicophilia.\u201d Even if he had never written a single one, I am sure Oliver would still have been that funny fellow who took giant dictionaries to bed for light reading (aided by a magnifying glass). He delighted in etymology, synonyms and antonyms, slang, swear words, palindromes, anatomical terms, neologisms (but objected, in principle, to contractions). He could joyfully parse the difference between homonyms and homophones, not to mention homographs, in dinner table conversation. (He also relished saying those three words \u2014 that breathy \u201cH\u201d alliteration \u2014 in his distinctive British accent.) Oliver loved words so much, he often dreamed of them, and sometimes dreamed them up. One morning, six years ago, I found a phrase he\u2019d written on the white board in the kitchen. All it said was \u201c5 a.m. Nepholopsia.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I said while making coffee. Oliver chuckled, then went on to describe an elaborate dream he\u2019d had that night in which he was stuck on an alien planet where anthropomorphic clouds turned menacing and \u201cmurderously\u201d tipped over the Land Rover he was driving \u2014 \u201ca cloud nightmare,\u201d he added, as if it were hardly his first. He had written the note upon waking at 5 a.m., so as not to forget it. (He reported his dreams to the Freudian psychoanalyst he saw twice a week.) \u201cNepholopsia,\u201d he told me, \u201ceither means \u2018seeing clouds\u2019 or \u2018being enveloped by clouds.\u2019\u201d His brow furrowed \u2014 wait a moment, now he wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cLet\u2019s look it up in the good book,\u201d and together we proceeded straight to the OED (\u201cMy Bible,\u201d as Oliver, a devout atheist, often referred to it).It was this love of words \u2014 etymophilia, if you will \u2014 and of the act of writing (which he considered a form of thinking) that moved Oliver to tell me one day shortly after I\u2019d moved to New York in the spring of 2009, \u201cYou must keep a journal!\u201d It was not a suggestion but an instruction. I followed his advice straightaway, writing that exchange down on a scrap of paper, which I still have to this day. I hadn\u2019t kept a journal since I was a teenager, but I began chronicling impressions of my life in New York and \u2014 when they were just too fantastic to resist \u2014 lines spoken by Oliver himself, a near daily occurrence. He was, simply put, chronically quotable.My New York journal grew and grew as the years passed but I never reread it \u2014 not until I decided to write a memoir about my life in New York and with Oliver. I thought reading it would jog my memory. Instead, I found something truly surprising: Parts of the book had already been written \u2014 scenes and long stretches of dialogue between Oliver and me \u2014 as if they\u2019d quietly been waiting for me to hear them again. Although Oliver did not live to see me complete that book, \u201cInsomniac City,\u201d I am sure he would not have been surprised that it had its genesis in a journal. After all, many of his own essays, articles and book ideas originated in one of his handwritten journals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At The Athletic, a Hiring Spree Becomes a Story in Itself", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Athletic, the hyperlocal sports website and app, is growing quicker than any sports media company in recent memory. This month, hardly a day passes without the announcement of a new hire. Or four.Just 10 months ago, when The Athletic celebrated its second birthday, the subscription-only website had 65 editorial employees in 10 markets. By the time the N.F.L. and college football seasons open next month, it will have more than 300 editorial employees, and sites focused on 38 markets.Backed by $28 million in venture capital, The Athletic long ago moved past simple questions like what to cover and where, to more existential ones: Can its rapid growth be sustained? Will it eventually make a profit? And why do its investors believe it will sail counter to the prevailing winds in media?Those answers are not easy to find, but the business plan at The Athletic is largely a bet that it will emerge as a Netflix-like solution to the decline of local sports coverage by newspapers decimated by budget cuts, and that it could eventually win over millions of subscribers. Its current hiring surge, then, is more a doubling down on that bet than a tangible payoff on it.Daniel Leff, the founder of Luminari Capital, which has invested in The Athletic, argued that the website is already worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the only remaining question presently is how large it will grow. \u201cThis is a company that has already achieved escape velocity,\u201d he said.Without subscription figures or internal financial reports, Leff\u2019s optimism is impossible to validate. Media companies like Netflix, Spotify and Sirius XM have tens of millions of subscribers paying monthly for their services, but few journalism companies approach those numbers. The New York Times leads newspapers with 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, and several magazines have circulations in the millions.Taylor Patterson, a spokeswoman for The Athletic, said the company has \u201cwell over\u201d 100,000 subscribers, each paying about $5 each month. Leff, the investor, said it had \u201cmany multiples\u201d of 100,000.Brian Grey, who was the chief executive of Bleacher Report when the sports media company raised $33 million in investment capital and later was acquired by Turner Broadcasting for around $200 million, wonders if the Netflix or Spotify comparisons are accurate. \u201cVideo and text are two different animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe subscription and consumer willingness to pay for content may not map completely.\u201dBut to Leff, small-bore questions about expansion or profitability are missing the forest for the trees. \u201cJust to get to 100,000 subscribers is a huge endeavor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may or may not need additional capital to do it, but if so, so what? There are a multitude of capital sources that want to put money into this company.\u201dWhen asked if The Athletic was already worth the $200 million Bleacher Report was acquired for six years ago, Leff responded: \u201cAbsolutely. We wouldn\u2019t take that.\u201dStill, The Athletic has received heavy criticism from the industry it hopes to dominate. In several markets, The Athletic has hired multiple writers away from the same newspaper, decimating the sports staffs at papers like The San Jose Mercury News and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others.\u201cYes, you can go into new markets and get sports fans,\u201d Kosner said of The Athletic\u2019s recent growth. \u201cBut it may not be as easy to continue to grow in these markets than it is to get started.\u201d He predicted the end goal for The Athletic would be acquisition by a major media company, not a long-term future as an independent company.Patterson, the spokeswoman at The Athletic, said even converting just a percentage of die-hard sports fans into subscribers \u201cwould result in a very healthy business for us.\u201d She said the company has not seriously entertained any acquisition offers.Leff also believes there is a crucial difference from other subscription companies: Though Netflix increasingly produces original shows, it and Spotify are still mostly licensing companies. Combined, they have to pay billions to stock their services, while The Athletic creates 100 percent of its content.That content may be the crux of the challenge.Most of The Athletic\u2019s writers, including many of its most recent hires, earned their following over years, or decades, at newspapers, a following they \u2014 and their new bosses \u2014 turn into Athletic subscribers. But stocking the site with newspaper veterans (there is also a very strong contingent of former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d journalists) means The Athletic often doesn\u2019t read that different from a newspaper sports section.At Netflix and Spotify, the compelling product is the video and the music. But in sports, the most compelling product isn\u2019t the writing. It is the games themselves, and Grey, the Bleacher Report veteran, wondered if that might be what The Athletic needs in order to truly scale its audience.\u201cFacebook is buying rights to live games. Twitter is buying rights to live games,\u201d Grey said. \u201cThe Athletic may need to find itself moving in that direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Investigate Whether Children Were Being Trained to Carry Out School Shootings", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProsecutors are investigating an allegation that a Georgia man and four other adults who lived with children in a squalid desert compound in New Mexico were training them to carry out school shootings, according to court documents filed on Wednesday.A foster parent of one of the 11 children told the authorities that the adults had trained the child in the use of an assault rifle in preparation for carrying out school shootings, according to court documents that prosecutors filed with New Mexico\u2019s Eighth Judicial District Court. In the documents, prosecutors requested that the judge keep Mr. Wahhaj and the other defendants in detention because they posed a threat to the children and the broader community.At court appearances on Wednesday, all five defendants pleaded not guilty, according to court documents. The judges overseeing the cases ordered that they be detained until their next hearing.Mr. Wahhaj and the other adults are being investigated in the death of the child and on suspicion of training children with weapons to further a \u201cconspiracy to commit school shootings,\u201d according to the court filings. The documents offered no other details or evidence of such training.The underground compound \u2014 built from a trailer covered in plastic \u2014 contained broken glass, hazardous wood and leaking propane, according to a criminal complaint. When the authorities raided the compound on Friday, they found Mr. Wahhaj, who was heavily armed, along with another man, and three women believed to be the children\u2019s mothers.All five adults at the compound were charged with 11 counts of child abuse, a third-degree felony. Each charge carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. Mr. Wahhaj also faces one count of custodial interference for \u201cmaliciously\u201d taking his son away from his mother for a protracted period of time, according to the criminal complaint.The other defendants were identified as Lucas Morton, 40; Jany Leveille, 35; Hujrah Wahhaj, 38; and Subhanah Wahhaj, 35. Mr. Morton was also charged with harboring a fugitive, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj.He referred to Mr. Morton as his son-in-law and Ms. Leveille as his daughter-in-law. He suggested that the children with the adults were his grandchildren.Aleksander Kostich, a state public defender, said the allegation that the defendants were training the children to carry out school shootings lacked evidence and could not currently be corroborated by other court filings pertaining to the case.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make an allegation of that nature, you needed corroboration and you need specificity,\u201d Mr. Kostich said. \u201cI always urge restraint in terms of how things are reported and opinions people form, because there\u2019s a lot to be determined.\u201dOfficials with the district attorney\u2019s office who are handling the case did not immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday afternoon.The authorities started searching for Siraj Ibn Wahhaj in December after Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj\u2019s mother told the police that his father took the child to the park and did not return, according to the Clayton County Police Department.After getting in a single-vehicle accident in Alabama days after the boy disappeared, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj told the authorities that they were on their way to New Mexico for a camping trip, along with five other children and two adults.Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe of Taos County, whose officers had been investigating the compound along with F.B.I. and Georgia detectives, said that when they raided the compound on Friday, they found a \u201cfilthy\u201d place with no indoor plumbing, no electricity and trash scattered around. The children wore rags and looked as if they had not eaten in days, Sheriff Hogrefe said.Prosecutors said in court filings that the compound, which is in a mountainous area about 10 miles south of New Mexico\u2019s border with Colorado, contained wood with nails sticking up, bottles and open trenches.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driving 2,130 Miles for a Haircut", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveTwo years earlier, she rejected the ambitious, Manhattan version of herself. After an ugly breakup, it was time to get her back.It wasn\u2019t the type of New Year\u2019s resolution that I, or the man I said it to, had anticipated. We hurled profanities and accusations onto it, but nothing could wash away the truth \u2014 we were over. And that\u2019s how I came to drive 2,130 miles for a haircut.When it comes to hair, I have long been the trusting type. For most of my life, upon entering a salon, I would hand over control to the stylist, saying, \u201cDo as you think best.\u201d They were the experts, right?This approach translated into many, many bad haircuts.And then I met Anne. A friend with similarly difficult hair had referred me to her. From the first moment, Anne seemed to know how to shape me into my best self. Maybe she could help again? Not that a new haircut is an unusual response to a breakup. But in my case, there were six states between my place in the Rocky Mountains and Anne\u2019s Manhattan salon.On the second day of the new year, I waded through the haze of grief that comes with all endings. I repacked my car with the items I had unloaded one year earlier, when \u201chappily ever after\u201d seemed a possibility. I climbed up and down, up and down, up and down the stairs that had led me home so many times. Listening to \u201cClay Pigeons\u201d on repeat, I harmonized with John Prine, vowing to \u201cGet used to bein\u2019 alone.\u201d I had been alone before, I reminded myself. I had spent most of my adult life alone. At 36, the closest I had come to marriage was a proposal from a man who couldn\u2019t commit to a dinner date. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want lasting love. I did. I do. But after decades of trying to find him, I still wasn\u2019t sure what he looked like.Maybe that\u2019s because I still wasn\u2019t sure what I looked like. There were so many possible versions of myself, I could never choose just one. And so for me, men appeared in chapters, but they never stuck around for the epilogue. With my car bloated from imprecise packing and with whiskey in my veins, I closed my eyes that night, waiting for sleep, waiting to turn the page.The next morning, Jan. 3, something urged me east, toward where I grew up, toward my family. And so I drove away from my home in southwest Colorado as the sun crept above the mountains and Prine counseled me to \u201cget along with it all.\u201dI drove past the trailhead where my last chapter had begun and saw myself standing there 14 months earlier, a woman who had shed her identity as a suit-wearing Manhattan lawyer for another, still-forming persona. Completely rejecting my former self was the only way I knew how to embrace the version of me who didn\u2019t want to drink martinis, work 70 hours a week and wear Jimmy Choos for the rest of her life. I knew that other me existed because of the sinking emptiness that had been a constant presence in my New York life.So two years ago I quit my job, moved into my car and drove west. It was a wholesale break from the world I had inhabited for more than a decade. In my new, itinerant life, I rarely showered. I washed my clothes once a month. I traded 70-hour workweeks for 40-mile trail runs. And I never cut my hair. It worked. After almost a year on the road, I had fully unearthed that buried part of myself. A part that now shone so bright with autonomy and independence that it had blinded me from seeing how the isolation of my new identity also haunted me. The days were shrinking, the nights growing longer, and I was alone. Then, I met him.Gazing out of my car\u2019s passenger window, which framed the snow-battered mountain ridge I had crested 14 months earlier, I glimpsed his tall silhouette.The man moved over rocks with a slowness I envied. When our eyes met, I saw a face that resembled my first love. A love founded on the ideals of my youth. And I was closer in this new life to the ideals of that 15-year-old girl than I had been since I had left my rural hometown almost two decades before. The youth of his face pulled me in.That day I followed him along the ridge, through a meandering valley and up a rock-scattered slope. When we reached the summit, I looked at his face against the looming peaks as he reached out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you,\u201d he said.\u201cGreat to meet you too.\u201d I placed my hand in his. Was it possible to collide with love like this?Now, as the mountains melted in my side mirror, I coaxed my car along the curves and wondered whether I would have fallen in love with any man who had been standing on that ridge at that moment. But I think it was more than just the longing bred from loneliness and isolation. It was the partnership I\u2019d found in the wholesale rejection of my past life. With him at my side, I hid in a town with fewer people than had resided in my Manhattan high-rise.I derided Manhattan as consumptive, overambitious and soulless. I declared that money was of no importance to me. I grieved for those who were less enlightened. And a year slipped away. But inhabiting the extremes demands self-discipline that borders on self-delusion. Near year\u2019s end, the voice of the woman I thought I had left behind began to stir. I fed her a martini. I let her watch \u201cSex and the City.\u201d I dug a sequined dress out of storage. But every time she emerged, I would try to shove her back into the past, where I thought she belonged.It had been her, I reasoned, who pushed me onto a path molded by others\u2019 expectations \u2014 a path that muffled the creative, the imaginative and the simple in me. But we can only suppress aspects of self for so long. Sooner or later, there will be a rebellion.My New York self never would have fallen in love with the man on that ridge. And he never would have fallen in love with her. It wasn\u2019t fair to either of us to be in a relationship with only half of me. The day I drove away, the sky was so blue that it didn\u2019t seem real. Two hours later, I came to a stop before flashing red lights and a clattering bell. I looked down at the golden tangle of ringlets cascading over my right shoulder. I missed my bob. I missed the woman with that bob.I closed my eyes and drifted back to New York City. I saw myself on gum-flecked sidewalks among skyscrapers, sliding my hands into the pockets of my crimson coat, my right finger poking through the familiar hole in the silk lining. My nose scrunched as the charred air mixed with stale remnants of the city\u2019s inhabitants, and horns and sirens blared around me. If I could have caught the noise\u2019s current, it would have carried me from West 48th Street to East Houston Street. The grunge, the grind and the grit were still in me and always would be.I opened my eyes. As the train thundered by, I reached for my phone. I knew who could help bring back that rejected part of myself: Anne. I hadn\u2019t seen her since I was last in New York, two years earlier. But it was easy to recall the trust I had enjoyed with her and the hours I had spent warmed by cups of tea and conversation at the salon. I scrolled to her website. She had an opening at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. Booked. I had three and a half days to get to East 11th Street and Avenue B.I had spent the better part of my time away feeling afraid to go back to Manhattan, but by the time a roadside plaque informed me that I was leaving Colorado, I was no longer afraid of the person I had been there. Instead, I was afraid that if I kept suppressing that person, I would land back in the same place I had been when I moved into my car and fled. I would just be standing at the other end of the spectrum. I wasn\u2019t driving 2,130 miles for a haircut. I was going to retrieve the woman I had left in New York and bring her back with me. I didn\u2019t know how the change would unfold or what it would look like, but I hoped I could somehow meet myself in the middle. In the meantime, I was going to listen to some Sinatra.Allison Snyder is a writer in southwest Colorado.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Thing in Hong Kong\u2019s Public Schools: White Students", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For generations, Hong Kong\u2019s prestigious international schools exclusively educated the children of wealthy Western expatriates. Today, placement in those schools is increasingly competitive and enrollment fees can exceed $1 million, making them some of the most expensive private schools in the world.Recent changes to the city\u2019s demography \u2014 prompted by Chinese politics and global markets \u2014 have driven up tuitions and resulted in a dramatic shift in the complexion of the city\u2019s schools: An increasing number of ethnic Chinese students are now enrolled in international schools, and many more white students are occupying desks in Cantonese-language public schools.\u201cPrivate schools here are bloody expensive you know, and we have twins,\u201d said James Runciman, a Briton, shop owner and father of two 6-year-olds who are set to begin second grade in September. \u201cWe just can\u2019t afford to send our kids to these schools,\u201d he said of the private international schools, which replicate the curriculums of Western countries, including the United States, Britain, Canada and France.As students return to school next month, there will be more white students in public schools than at any time in the city\u2019s history, a telling indicator of how Hong Kong is both shaking off its colonial past and losing its draw as a magnet for the West\u2019s wealthiest workers.Last year 818 white students were enrolled in the city\u2019s public schools, according to the Hong Kong Education Bureau, which labels all Caucasian students \u201cwhite\u201d regardless of nationality or self-identification.That number represents a small fraction of the overall public school population, but is indicative of a 44 percent increase from 2013, when only 556 white children attended public schools.Robert Adamson, a professor of curriculum reform at the Education University of Hong Kong, said white students were increasingly attending public schools because they had been priced out of the city\u2019s international schools by a newly rich immigrant constituency: mainland Chinese.\u201cInternational schools are in high demand from a new market \u2014 mainland China \u2014 and fees have increased considerably in recent years,\u201d Professor Adamson said. \u201cThus, some traditional students are struggling to gain access and therefore look to local schools instead.\u201dHong Kong, which reverted to Chinese control from Britain in 1997, has long been considered Asia\u2019s pre-eminent financial hub. For decades, the world\u2019s largest banks sent Western employees to the city on lucrative expatriate contracts that included money for housing and school tuition. But China\u2019s meteoric rise to become the world\u2019s second largest economy has meant an influx of mainland bankers to Hong Kong. Today, Mandarin is more likely to be heard spoken on a bank\u2019s trading floor in Hong Kong than English.Still, after a decline in expatriate whites following the 1997 handover, the city has seen an increase in its white population in the last decade. As China has opened its economy, many foreigners have come to Hong Kong looking to open \u2014 and work for \u2014 businesses eager to gain access to China\u2019s enormous markets and its inexpensive goods and services.From 2006 to 2016, the number of white residents increased by 60 percent, to 58,209 from 36,384. The majority of those whites were from English-speaking countries, including Britain, the United States and Australia. But as of 2006, 16 percent of whites in the city did not speak English at home, according to a government report that cited German-, Italian- and French-speaking residents. The government tracks the number of \u201cwhites\u201d as an \u201cethnic minority\u201d in the city, but its statistics do not break that down by nationality.Since the 2008 financial crisis, Western firms have been less willing to offer employees gold-plated relocation packages. And white workers in the city are no longer just bankers, but also small-business owners, middle managers at tech start-ups and baristas in coffee shops.\u201cMany low and middle-management people are not given the same packages when asked to move here,\u201d said Jacqueline Cohen, an American who moderates a parents group on Facebook for expatriates with children in public schools.But as expatriate packages have declined, prices at international schools have increased. Tuition at international schools can exceed $42,000 a year, excluding so-called debentures, which can exceed $1 million at the most prestigious and expensive schools.Debentures are lump-sum loans that incoming students are required to pay to the school on top of regular fees. Large debentures often come with the promise of admission at some selective schools. The loans, used for capital projects at the school\u2019s discretion, are sometimes reimbursed at graduation, but can also be bought and sold on a secondhand market. Some debentures, however, depreciate and are never returned.Increasingly, many of the students at international schools are Hong Kong locals or the children of mainland Chinese parents. Foreign students once made up 100 percent of those schools\u2019 populations. In 2017, however, foreigners accounted for less than 75 percent of students at primary international schools. Local students accounted for 21.6 percent of the student body, and \u201cnonlocal Chinese,\u201d a Hong Kong government designation for mainlanders, made up about 4 percent, according to the Education Bureau.Hong Kong prides itself on being a diverse, international city but it is also largely segregated \u2014 not by law but by custom.For many white parents, however, a Chinese-language education is an added reason to send their children to public schools and a chance for them to better integrate in the city.\u201cWe consciously put our children into Cantonese schools,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, whose children are 11 and 12. \u201cThey need to know the language to be a full member of Hong Kong.\u201dKatherine Ferreira, Mr. Runciman\u2019s wife and the mother of twins, Vicente and Florencia, 6, also said learning Cantonese was an important factor in deciding to enroll her children in public schools.\u201cThis is a different continent, so I saw it as a good chance to learn a new language,\u201d said Ms. Ferreira, who is from Chile. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to learn a language, now\u2019s the moment.\u201dPrimary public school students are required to use English and Cantonese in their regular classes and learn Mandarin too. High schools are typically designated either as English-language or Cantonese-language schools, with the other language and Mandarin being taught as electives.Aiken Bridges, 13, said he is the only non-Chinese student at the English-language secondary school to which he will return in September. \u201cMy friends usually speak to me in English,\u201d he said, adding that he was still nervous when speaking Cantonese outside class.The vast majority of immigrant students enrolled in the city\u2019s public schools are Asian, which the government\u2019s ethnicity statistics do break down by country of origin. Last year there were 6,267 Pakistani students in public schools \u2014 the single largest immigrant bloc \u2014 nearly eight times the number of white students.Unlike whites, non-Chinese Asian immigrants have attended the city\u2019s public schools for decades. Some South Asian families complain of systemic racism, arguing that the schools fail to teach their children Cantonese, the predominant Chinese language spoken in the city, which is necessary for public sector employment.(In addition to \u201cwhite\u201d and the nine most common Asian countries from which students trace their heritage, the Education Bureau also has demographic categories for \u201cother Asian\u201d and \u201cothers.\u201d)Hong Kong\u2019s students often rank among the world\u2019s top performers in math, reading and science, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That reputation, however, comes at a cost. Many students say the schools are high-pressure environments in which rote learning is stressed over critical thinking.Some experts attribute a rise in teenage suicide to the stress and rigor of school.About 35 students killed themselves in 2017, according to Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, a nonprofit anti-suicide organization, a 50 percent increase over 2016. More than 93 percent of high school students reported that school led to anxiety, according to the group.Western parents are often shocked by the long hours spent at school and the mountains of homework students in Hong Kong are expected to complete. In many cases, expatriate parents who send their children to public elementary schools use the money they have saved to pay for a private or international high school once classes get harder.\u201cI chose my children\u2019s mental and physical health over their results when they got to primary two,\u201d said Ms. Cohen, the American who moderates the \u201cCantonese School Parents Group\u201d on Facebook. \u201cAfter school and their homework tutorial, they will have the time for relaxation and a balanced life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then he rewrote it.Playing the kitchen tyrant, regularly berating young cooks for mistakes nobody else would notice, Mr. Robuchon embodied the old order. At the time, this boot-camp style of running a kitchen was state of the art. But it had already come to seem counterproductive, disrespectful and unprofessional long before his death.In retrospect, the internal forces that he gave vent to when he screamed at his cooks must have also tormented Mr. Robuchon. For most of his career he was restless, unsatisfied. At 51, he tried to retire; of course, it didn\u2019t last. In 2003 he returned, and this time he seemed determined not to give the Michelin inspectors what they wanted. There were no tablecloths, no chandeliers, no elaborately carved and upholstered chairs that might have come from a garage sale at Versailles. Food was cooked behind the counter by chefs dressed in the same black tunics the servers wore. Sometimes the chefs even placed the dish in front of the diner. The French daily Le Figaro summed up the general reaction when it proclaimed, \u201cC\u2019est une revolution!\u201d If you think the Figaro was overreacting, it\u2019s because the revolution succeeded.

{"Headline": "Life Is Short. That\u2019s the Point. ", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEASOur mortality is not something to be overcome. It is integral to our humanity.Contributing Opinion WriterConsider this fact of modern life: Nearly all of the technological products that we buy and use are designed with planned obsolescence in mind. They are built specifically to fail after a relatively short period \u2014 one year, two, maybe five. If you doubt that, think about how often you have to replace your smartphone. Gadgets are designed to die.The irony, however, is that the same Silicon Valley culture that produces these gadgets seems to be obsessed with living forever.  Today\u2019s \u201clife extension\u201d movement includes venture capitalists like the tech billionaire Peter Thiel pouring money into anti-aging and life extension start-ups. (While the rumor that Mr. Thiel receives regular blood transfusions from 18-year olds turned out to be false, there is, of course, an actual company \u2014 Ambrosia Plasma \u2014 that provides young plasma infusions for $8,000 a liter.) And Google launched the biotech company Calico to increase its \u201cunderstanding of the biology that controls lifespan,\u201d and bolstered that goal by conducting research on the long-living naked mole rat, a species that shows little to no signs of aging. In recent years, the lure of disrupting death has become a hot industry. Paul Bennett, a partner at the design consultancy IDEO, was among the first to tap into it. A profile in The California Sunday Magazine in 2015 described an epiphany he had: \u201c \u2018Oh,\u2019 he told himself. \u2018You need to redesign death.\u2019 \u201d Since then, an entire new market has flourished. Death as a conduit for innovation. Death as a participatory exhibition. Death as the organizing principle for networking dinners. Death as an app. There are now people who refer to themselves as \u201clongevity entrepreneurs,\u201d who see death not as a problem but rather as something to be eliminated. Instead of pursuing a good death, why die at all? Beneath the surface of this quest for eternal life seems to be an unwillingness on the part of its proponents to imagine the world without themselves in it.In a very fundamental way, this tendency is inhuman. In her new book, \u201cNatural Causes: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer,\u201d Barbara Ehrenreich writes: \u201cYou can think of death bitterly or with resignation, as a tragic interruption of your life, and take every possible measure to postpone it. Or, more realistically, you can think of life as an interruption of an eternity of personal nonexistence, and seize it as a brief opportunity to observe and interact with the living, ever-surprising world around us.\u201dI was taken by Ms. Ehrenreich\u2019s formulation, this notion that our experience of life, though unique to us, is just part of a broader continuum. Our time here is but a blip, and when we leave, the great world continues to spin. As such, the appreciation of our own lives has much to do with the ever-increasing awareness of its relative brevity. It is this \u2014 an awareness and acceptance of our own mortality \u2014 that makes us human. And it is the impetus, I\u2019d argue, for living our lives to the fullest.There was a brief period in my own life \u2014 less than two years \u2014 in which I got married, lost my mother to cancer, had a miscarriage, bought a house and gave birth to a child. Experiencing all this in so short a time span made me feel almost too human. That barrage of ends and beginnings left me intensely aware of the fragility of life as well as enthralled by the glorious intensity of it: I lost and simultaneously gained so much. Today this awareness of the temporal nature of it all leaves me determined to seize, observe and interact with the days that remain. It is the knowledge of how quickly, sometimes tragically, things can change or disappear that fuels my urgency to be in the present.As a teenager I remember lamenting how horrible and unfair life was, only to have my parents respond that one couldn\u2019t appreciate the good without experiencing the bad. Back then, hearing that was annoying; as an adult, it remains annoying, but it is also completely true.It is rare for us to give much thought to the challenges we would face if there were no end to our time on earth. Would the condition of our bodies affect the condition of our minds? Would everyone live forever, or just those with the means to afford it? Could you opt out of eternal life? Would inequality dissolve, or would it become even more of an intractable problem? Would we still gain the empathy, wisdom and insight that can come with age?

Most of the anti-vaccine tweets repeated well-known but long-discredited rumors, such as those that vaccines cause autism or contain dangerous amounts of mercury. Others accused pharmaceutical companies of caring only about profits, not children.Pro-vaccine tweets from the same accounts argued that vaccines saved lives. Some said they should be mandatory. Some were insulting, such as \u201cYou can\u2019t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I\u2019m for #vaccination.\u201dBut the Russians sometimes misread their audience, Dr. Broniatowski said, sending tweets that \u201cdidn\u2019t quite make sense, given the way Americans usually argue about vaccines.\u201dSome, for example, suggested that God opposed vaccination. \"I don\u2019t believe in #vaccines I believe in God\u2019s will,\u201d one read.Other tweets promoted class hostility, saying the elite get \u201cclean vaccines\u201d while normal people did not. More than 250 tweets had the unusual hashtag #VaccinateUS. Anti-vaccination activists tend to use tags like #Vaxxed, #b1less or #CDCWhistleblower, Dr. Broniatowski said, while pro-vaccine groups use #vaccineswork, for example.

In an interview, Mr. Stamos, 39, said he planned to join Stanford University in September as an adjunct professor and will also become part of a faculty working group called Information Warfare where he will examine the role of security and technology in society.In an internal Facebook post from January written by Mr. Stamos, which was obtained by The Times, he said the company\u2019s security team was being reorganized and would no longer operate as a stand-alone entity. Instead, he wrote, Facebook\u2019s security workers would be more closely aligned with the product and engineering teams and focus either on protecting the company\u2019s corporate infrastructure or its users.\u201cThe safety and security challenges we face today are dispersed across many surfaces, and addressing them requires the focus of many teams across the company,\u201d Mr. Stamos wrote in the post.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement on Wednesday that Facebook would continue to collaborate with Mr. Stamos in his new job at Stanford.\u201cAlex has played an important role in how we approach security challenges and helped us build relationships with partners so we can better address the threats we face,\u201d she said.Amy Zegart, the co-director of Stanford\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation, said in a statement that Mr. Stamos had been working with the Stanford cyberpolicy program for several years and had piloted a \u201chack lab\u201d class this past spring.Mr. Stamos said in the interview that his last day at Facebook would be Aug. 17.

{"Headline": "What Is QAnon: Explaining the Internet Conspiracy Theory That Showed Up at a Trump Rally", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDo you remember Pizzagate? It\u2019s a little like that: a web of baseless conspiracy theories. And its supporters were highly visible at an event for the president in Florida.Those watching President Trump\u2019s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn\u2019t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined \u2014 and baseless \u2014 conspiracy theories.They were all self-described \u201cfollowers of Q,\u201d an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people \u2014 the exact number is hard to know \u2014 eager to consume his \u201cbread crumbs,\u201d or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories.Here is the short version: Q claims to be a government insider exposing an entrenched, international bureaucracy that is secretly plotting all sorts of nefarious schemes against the Trump administration and its supporters. The character uses lingo that implies that he or she has a military or intelligence background. It\u2019s a stew of various, but connecting, conspiracy theories that generally hold Mr. Trump as a conquistador battling a cabal of anti-American saboteurs who have taken over government, industry, media and various other institutions of public life in a plan to \u2026 well, the overarching goals of the nefarious actors are not clear.A growing group of people (more on the scale and scope of that community below) are coalescing around a collection of theories and half-thoughts that they believe reveal an untold story of current world events. To decode what they believe is actually happening, followers of Q sift through the president\u2019s tweets, government data sets or news articles. Ben Decker, a research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, described followers of the QAnon narrative as \u201can interactive conspiracy community.\u201dQ\u2019s followers ascribe secret coordination and hidden motives to an endless parade of politicians, journalists, and leaders of industry and other institutions. Often, their theories are wildly at odds with reality.The shared rush to interpret clues from a \u201cdrop\u201d of information from Q resembles something close to what video gamers call an MMO, or massive multiplayer online game. The paranoid worldview has crossed over from the internet into the real world several times in recent months. On more than one occasion, people believed to be followers of QAnon have shown up \u2014 sometimes with weapons \u2014 in places that the character told them were somehow connected to anti-Trump conspiracies. \u201cThe biggest danger is you are one mentally unstable person away from the next massive incident that defines whatever happens next,\u201d Mr. Decker said. \u201cThe next Pizzagate, which for better or worse did define the political conversation for a while.\u201dThe report had actually been released the day before, but Q\u2019s followers believed there was a secret, second report that contained far more damning information about the F.B.I. There is no indication that such a report exists. The man was arrested after a standoff with the police.Most recently, a suspicious and possibly armed man showed up at the law offices of Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the adult film performer known as Stormy Daniels, after Q posted a link to Mr. Avenatti\u2019s website and a picture of the office building. The man did not enter the premises.In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said he had received a large number of threatening emails and social media posts in recent months, \u201cbut this one we have significant reason to believe posed a significant threat.\u201d He said local law enforcement was investigating the incident. \u201cI do think it is dangerous, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said. \u201cAnd I think it is incumbent upon the president to quash this nonsense as opposed to feeding it.\u201dMr. Decker said the prominence of QAnon T-shirts and signs at Mr. Trump\u2019s televised rally in Tampa, and the elevation of that imagery via cable news coverage of the rally, were troubling. \u201cIn a sense, the internet won,\u201d he said.But perhaps the greatest signal of the sustained, dedicated audience for this discussion can be found in the seismic traffic to websites and apps set up to collect and curate preferred 4chan posts about Q.

{"Headline": "Lyme Disease Is Spreading Fast. Why Isn\u2019t There a Vaccine?", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Lyme has become so common, why isn\u2019t there a vaccine for it? Well, here\u2019s something you may not know: There used to be one, but it was taken off the market more than 15 years ago. And there\u2019s only one new vaccine candidate in the pipeline.\u201cClearly, the problem is getting worse,\u201d said Dr. Paul Mead, a top scientist at the C.D.C. \u201cFor years, we have been advocating that people use repellents, do tick checks, spray their yards. That remains good to do, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201dLyme disease is usually handled with a short course of antibiotics. But without treatment, infections can spread to the heart and nervous system and cause serious problems. Additionally, some patients experience symptoms even after taking antibiotics, what the C.D.C. refers to as \u201cpost-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.\u201d\u201cChronic Lyme\u201d is also a term you may have heard. It is sometimes used to describe persistent symptoms of infection, even in people who have not received a diagnosis of Lyme. The C.D.C. and many other experts don\u2019t support the use of the term because of that confusion.Studies never showed a direct link between LYMErix and any chronic side effect or serious complication. But patients\u2019 claims about it, and resulting media coverage, were sufficient to make doctors and patients wary.Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic, has written that public concern, induced by anti-vaccine groups and class action lawsuits, resulted in LYMErix being withdrawn from the market.\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between what\u2019s claimed and what\u2019s proven,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that has never existed before,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a vaccine that works, you know it works, you know the disease is prevalent, but there\u2019s no vaccine on the market, except for dogs.\u201dDr. Mead of the C.D.C. said that the issues with LYMErix were complicated, but that subsequent studies did not bear out the safety concerns that were raised at the time. In addition, Lyme disease was a lot less common 20 years ago, so the need wasn\u2019t as great.Some experts thought Lyme could be controlled if people were vigilant about checking themselves. But the rise in cases shows that\u2019s insufficient.\u201cWe need more options on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why we certainly strongly support the development of a safe and effective vaccine.\u201dValneva\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Lingelbach, said that the developers at his company had taken the concerns surrounding LYMErix into consideration, and that out of an abundance of caution, they had engineered the new vaccine so that it would not create an autoimmune reaction.\u201cIt is a very different vaccine than LYMErix,\u201d he said. The vaccine is being tested now, and the company hopes to seek licensing in about five years.Meanwhile, Dr. Erol Fikrig, the chief of infectious diseases at Yale Medical School and one of the developers of LYMErix, is trying to target the tick itself. He\u2019s in the early stages of research on a vaccine that could prevent ticks from transmitting Lyme and other diseases.\u201cI believe it\u2019s promising,\u201d he said. \u201cBut time will tell.\u201dDr. Phillip J. Baker, the executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, a nonprofit group run by volunteers, predicted that opposition from Lyme groups that are suspicious of the medical establishment would hinder any vaccine\u2019s prospects.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there about Lyme,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re making some progress, but we\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201dPatricia V. Smith, the president of another advocacy group, the Lyme Disease Association, is among those who are skeptical about the new vaccine.\u201cI would like to see safe and effective vaccines developed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut those are the key words.\u201dMs. Smith added that Valneva hadn\u2019t been proactive enough about reaching out to patients\u2019 groups to share its findings.The company said in response that it planned to increase outreach efforts as the vaccine got closer to hitting the market.\u201cIt is part of our ongoing mission to become more proactively engaged with advocacy groups,\u201d Valneva said. \u201cWe encourage patients and advocacy groups to reach out to us, and we will be working to do the same to establish a dialogue with the patient community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kremlin Sources Go Quiet, Leaving C.I.A. in the Dark About Putin\u2019s Plans for Midterms", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut two years later, the vital Kremlin informants have largely gone silent, leaving the C.I.A. and other spy agencies in the dark about precisely what Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions are for November\u2019s midterm elections, according to American officials familiar with the intelligence.Technology companies and political campaigns in recent weeks have detected a plethora of political interference efforts originating overseas, including hacks of Republican think tanks and fake liberal grass-roots organizations created on Facebook. Senior intelligence officials, including Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, have warned that Russians are intent on subverting American democratic institutions.But American intelligence agencies have not been able to say precisely what are Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions: He could be trying to tilt the midterm elections, simply sow chaos or generally undermine trust in the democratic process.The officials, seeking to protect methods of collection from Russia, would not provide details about lost sources, but acknowledged the degradation in the information collected from Russia. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal classified information. A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment.To determine what the Russian government is up to, the United States employs multiple forms of intelligence, including intercepted communications and penetrated computer networks.The United States continues to intercept Russian communication, and the flow of that intelligence remains strong, said current and former officials. And Russian informants could still meet their C.I.A. handlers outside Russia, further from Moscow\u2019s counterintelligence apparatus.But people inside or close to the Kremlin remain critical to divining whether there is a strategy behind seemingly scattershot efforts to undermine American institutions.Spies and informants overseas also give American intelligence agencies early warning about influence campaigns, interference operations or other attempts to compromise the United States. That information, in turn, can improve the ability of domestic agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I., to quickly identify and attempt to stop those efforts.Because clandestine meetings can take months to set up and complete, a lengthy lag can pass before the C.I.A. realizes a key source has gone silent, according to former officials. It is rare for the agency to discover immediately that informants have eroded or are running scared. Only after several missed meetings might C.I.A. officers and analysts conclude that a source has decided it is too dangerous to pass information.Mr. Brennan described the broad outlines of the intelligence in his congressional testimony, and his disclosures backed up the accounts of the information provided by the current and former officials. \u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election. And they were very aggressive,\u201d Mr. Brennan told lawmakers.This year, Mr. Coats issued a series of warnings saying the Russian government, and Mr. Putin in particular, is intent on undermining American democratic systems.At an appearance this month at the White House, Mr. Coats said intelligence agencies \u201ccontinue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try and weaken and divide the United States.\u201d He added that those efforts \u201ccover issues relevant to the elections.\u201dBut officials said there has been no concrete intelligence pointing to Mr. Putin ordering his own intelligence units to wade into the election to push for a certain outcome, beyond a broad chaos campaign to undermine faith in American democracy. Intelligence agencies do not believe Mr. Putin has changed his strategy; instead, officials believe they simply do not have the same level of access to information from the Kremlin\u2019s inner circle.Intelligence collection appears to have suffered after Russia expelled officials from American diplomatic outposts there in retaliation for the United States removing 60 Russian officials this year, said John Sipher, a 28-year veteran of the C.I.A. who served in Moscow in the 1990s and later ran the agency\u2019s Russia program.The C.I.A.\u2019s Moscow presence, according to former officers, was always small, at least in light of the importance of the target, the difficulty of spycraft and the amount of counterintelligence the Russians dedicated to thwarting American spies.\u201cThe Russians kicked out a whole bunch of our people,\u201d Mr. Sipher said. \u201cOur station in Moscow is probably really small now and they are under incredible surveillance.\u201dFormer C.I.A. officials said Mr. Putin has made plain to his counterintelligence forces his antipathy, and desire to eliminate, to so-called traitors who provide information to the West. In public comments in 2010, Mr. Putin made menacing comments about former agents who worked for Western intelligence, although he publicly disavowed assassination.\u201cThe Russians are very focused and upset,\u201d Mr. Sipher said. \u201cThey have shown they are willing to kill sources.\u201dInformants close to Putin are very rare, according to current and former officials. The United States, in recent years, has had only a few, and at times been reliant on only one or two for the most important insights on Mr. Putin, according to former officials. If those people go silent for their own protection, it can make it very hard for the agency to look inside Moscow.The United States still should have a clear view of Mr. Putin\u2019s strategies and intention to interfere in the elections, said Michael Carpenter, a Russia expert and former Obama administration official. He pointed to fake social media accounts created as part of Russian intelligence operations that have drummed up support for white nationalists and the Black Lives Matter movement, and have supported far right, far left and pro-Russian candidates in the United States and in Europe.\u201cClearly Russia is playing both sides of controversial issues precisely to sow chaos. But that said it is not just chaos, there are certain candidates Russia prefers to see in office,\u201d said Mr. Carpenter, now at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. \u201cThe Russians are trying to support anti-establishment and pro-Russian candidates, not just in the U.S. but everywhere.\u201dStill, there is little doubt about the crucial nature of informants, said Seth G. Jones, who leads the transnational threats project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy research organization.\u201cIt is essential to have sources coming from inside the government. It was during the Cold War and it is today,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThere are multiple ways to collect intelligence against your adversary, in this case the Russian government. But sources can provide you things you might not otherwise get, like documents, intelligence assessments.\u201dSources can provide photographs of Russian documents and intelligence that are hard to intercept electronically, and that can help the United States figure out what Russia is targeting, not just with its election meddling but with its attempts to infiltrate financial systems, the power grid and other critical infrastructure, Mr. Jones said.The full reasons the sources have gone silent are not known. But current and former officials also said the exposure of sources inside the United States has also complicated matters.Current American officials said there is no direct evidence that the exposure of Mr. Halper has been cited by overseas informants as a source of concern.But the officials said that some allies have cited the exposure of the informant and other intelligence leaks in curbing some of the intelligence they share. And former spies believe that, long-term, the exposure will hurt overseas collection.\u201cPublicizing sources is really bad for the business,\u201d Mr. Sipher said. \u201cThe only thing we can offer people is that we will do anything in our power to protect them. And anything that wears away at that trust, hurts.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly reported when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke publicly against former intelligence agents he viewed as traitors. It was in 2010, not shortly before the assassination attempt on a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei V. Skripal. The article also mischaracterized Mr. Putin\u2019s public comments. They were menacing but not direct threats.Adam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Obesity rates in the United States continue to worsen. So, too, does economic inequality. Are these trends related? The obesity epidemic affects every region of the country and every demographic group. But rates have increased the fastest among low-income Americans and racial minorities, exacerbating pre-existing health disparities.Weight-related complications like hypertension, fatty liver, orthopedic problems, sleep apnea and Type 2 diabetes are bad enough when they strike in middle age. But they have become relatively commonplace at pediatricians\u2019 practices across the country. In adults, obesity substantially increases the risk for some of the most feared illnesses, like heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s. At all ages, obesity is associated with social isolation, depression and other major mental health problems. Beyond the toll of human suffering, obesity and diet-related diseases impose massive and rapidly growing economic costs.These long-term fiscal pressures lead political parties to fight ever more ferociously over shrinking resources. Simply put, the more the government must spend on health care and the more tax revenues it loses, the less there is for discretionary spending (such as education, highways, the environment and defense) and safety net services.There are, of course, many causes of political conflict today. But our ability to negotiate differences within a large, diverse society will inevitably be undermined by rising economic pressures on families, communities and government and growing disparities in health and well-being.With the couple hundred billion dollars of savings that could be achieved by rolling back obesity, Republicans could have tax cuts, Democrats could have increased social spending and the common ground for compromise would grow.Right now the government is doing the opposite. Farm policies have made low-nutritional commodities exceptionally cheap, providing the food industry with enormous incentive to market processed foods comprised mainly of refined grains and added sugars. In contrast, vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, nuts and high-quality proteins are much more expensive and, in \u201cfood deserts,\u201d often unavailable. Processed foods are heavily advertised, even in educational materials directed at young children. And as cheap calories have flooded the environment, opportunities to burn off those calories at school, in recreation and through physically active modes of transportation have declined.Second, adequately fund obesity research into innovative approaches for prevention and treatment, beyond the conventional focus on eating less and moving more. These policies would help us reverse the obesity epidemic, improve the health and financial well-being of millions, decrease inequality, halt the decline in life expectancy \u2014 and even promote a modicum of political comity.

Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Barry Berke is a co-chairman of the litigation department at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel. Norman Eisen is the chairman of CREW.With Tuesday\u2019s convictions in the criminal trial of President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has struck another blow in his investigation: five guilty pleas, 32 indicted individuals, 187 charges revealing startling evidence of Russia\u2019s 2016 attack on our democracy, and now the conviction of one of the top operators in the Trump campaign orbit. Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction on eight separate counts means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction cannot be diminished by arguing, as Mr. Trump and his coterie are fond of doing, that the misconduct was unrelated to the Trump campaign or Russian \u201ccollusion.\u201d On the contrary, the trial evidence included Mr. Manafort\u2019s close ties to pro-Russia forces and his desperate financial straits as he \u201cvolunteered\u201d his time for the next president. The trial revealed how willing Mr. Manafort was to corruptly leverage his position of influence over Mr. Trump during the campaign for his own personal benefit. He offered briefings to a pro-Russia Ukrainian oligarch and dangled a position in the Trump administration in front of a banker who provided him a loan for which he would not otherwise have qualified.Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction should also send chills down the spines of other potential defendants, possibly including the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and his informal adviser Roger Stone. As far as we know, they have been excluded from the hundreds of witnesses the special counsel has interviewed. That fact, and the public evidence about their conduct, signals that they may be facing Mr. Mueller\u2019s scrutiny.Notably, Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement does not provide him with any protection from additional charges that could be brought by the special counsel. Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction (together with mounting pressure on him from the Department of Justice investigation of his own alleged misdeeds) will only increase the pressure on Mr. Cohen to cooperate with Mr. Mueller's investigation to reduce his sentence. The conviction is also bad news for the president because it increases the pressure on Mr. Manafort to cooperate with investigators. He has a second trial coming shortly in Washington, D.C., which could add even more time to what will likely be a substantial sentence \u2014 and Mr. Mueller reportedly has much more evidence to present to jurors in that trial than he did in the trial that just concluded.A pardon for Mr. Manafort could also end up inflicting more harm on the Trump presidency than any of the other allegedly obstructive acts Mr. Trump has so far undertaken. The Constitution and the laws of our country do not allow Mr. Trump to dangle the possibility of, or explicitly offer, pardons with corrupt intent.

For most Americans, it is downright mediocre, and it has deteriorated somewhat since President Trump took office, despite the healthy G.D.P. and unemployment statistics.

It shows the trends in average inflation-adjusted hourly pay, arguably the best measure of economic well-being for most people. As you can see, hourly wages are suffering through a Trump slump.That slump isn\u2019t entirely Trump\u2019s fault, by any means. But he deserves some blame for it. Worst of all, he is doing virtually nothing improve the situation, instead enacting policies that will ultimately hurt workers\u2019 ability to earn a decent paycheck.As a result of the growth, nominal wages \u2014 that is, the numbers people see in their paychecks, before taking inflation into account \u2014 are growing. You can see the pickup in the gentle upward slope of the chart\u2019s solid gray line. Over the past year, the average hourly nominal wage has risen 2.7 percent.Second, nominal wages by themselves can\u2019t buy a higher standard of living. Prices matter, too. When the prices of good and services are rising faster than nominal wages, people end up with less buying power. And that is exactly what\u2019s happening now.My best guess is that real wages will do modestly better over the next year, barring another oil spike or an unexpected recession. But there is no reason to think that most Americans are on the cusp of truly healthy pay increases.Right now, Trump is presiding over precisely the wage growth that he deserves: zero.Advertisement"}

Now California is poised to rein it back in.Over two decades, Silicon Valley built a political machine that fended off virtually every effort to regulate how tech companies collect and use data. And when an Oakland real estate developer named Alastair Mactaggart decided to fund a privacy ballot initiative in California, he learned just how powerful that machine was.Mr. Mactaggart\u2019s initiative proposed giving Californians more rights over their own data, with the power to demand that big companies stop selling and trading the information they collected about browsing habits and location.\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart would say.His opponents turned out to be not just Big Tech and cable companies, who thought his proposal went too far, but some of California\u2019s leading privacy watchdogs and consumer groups, who said his proposal didn\u2019t go far enough.But Mr. Mactaggart\u2019s ballot initiative forced historic compromise in Sacramento, driving lawmakers, activists and Silicon Valley\u2019s giants to agree to tough new rules about privacy. Other states are likely to follow. And California\u2019s law, which goes into effect in 2020, is now pushing Washington to look at privacy regulation anew.\u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Some stout to go with your In-N-Out?A new brew from Seven Stills features some familiar branding: red palm trees on a white background with a large yellow arrow.

{"Headline": "A Broken Relationship and Accusations of Emotional Abuse: The Case of Keith Ellison", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 When Keith Ellison became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006, it made him an instant national star: a charismatic young black leader who was now a symbol of the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment to diversity and equal rights.Back home in Minneapolis, Mr. Ellison was revered in a close-knit circle of progressive activists. He began a romantic relationship with one of them, an environmental organizer named Karen Monahan, who later moved in with him in 2015.Ms. Monahan posted happy photos on social media of the two of them hiking, traveling and even attending a party at the White House with President Barack Obama and the first lady.Behind the scenes, though, their relationship was rocky. Ms. Monahan often accused Mr. Ellison of cheating on her, leading to blowout arguments, according to more than a dozen people who knew the couple.Now, as Mr. Ellison runs for attorney general in Minnesota, Ms. Monahan has accused her former boyfriend of emotional abuse and says he once shouted profanities at her, while trying to drag her off a bed.Mr. Ellison denies abusing Ms. Monahan and said in a statement after the allegations emerged that he cares \u201cdeeply for her well-being.\u201d Democratic Party leaders in Minnesota have asked a lawyer to look into Ms. Monahan\u2019s allegations, but continue to support Mr. Ellison\u2019s bid to become attorney general.The questions around Mr. Ellison come eight months after Senator Al Franken, another popular progressive leader in Minnesota, resigned amid allegations that he made unwanted sexual advances. Now, Mr. Ellison, a high-profile leader on the left, is fighting for his reputation and facing a tough campaign with an opponent using the abuse allegations against him.Ms. Monahan\u2019s accusations represent a potentially new chapter in the #MeToo movement in which the allegations against a public figure are not primarily about sexual violence or harassment, but emotional abuse. But the allegations against Mr. Ellison, who declined a request for an interview through a spokesman, are turning into a test among many liberals for where to draw the line between a messy relationship and an emotionally abusive one, and some say they aren\u2019t sure where it is.\u201cI want to make sure that women are believed,\u201d said Betsy Hodges, a former mayor of Minneapolis who identifies as a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and who used to see Mr. Ellison, 55, and Ms. Monahan, 44, together at political events. \u201cI also want to make sure that we follow a process when we evaluate. A bad breakup is not the same thing as abuse.\u201dMs. Monahan\u2019s accusation about the altercation on the bed has drawn the most attention. Yet the core of her allegations against Mr. Ellison regard what she calls \u201cnarcissist abuse,\u201d a term that is not officially recognized in psychiatry but that is gaining popularity online as a way to describe suffering experienced by partners of self-centered people.\u201cNarcissist abuse is very difficult to understand,\u201d said Ms. Monahan in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the gaslighting, it\u2019s the habitual lying, it\u2019s the making it seem like it was my fault for even asking why something happened.\u201d\u201cIt was crazy-making,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hair was falling out, I was anemic \u2014 narcissist abuse is horrid.\u201dBorn in Iran, Ms. Monahan said she was adopted by a working-class family in Texas. As a child, she said, she experienced sexual abuse. She gave birth to a son when she was a teenager. Ms. Monahan said her experience with adversity inspired her to become an activist.Around 2006, when she worked at a small organization called the Environmental Justice Advocates of Minnesota, she met Mr. Ellison, a married state legislator. His office was just down the hall from hers, and they became friends.In 2010, Mr. Ellison and his wife, Kim Ellison, separated and eventually divorced. Ms. Ellison said in an interview that they remain close and that she has never seen him behave abusively. In 2015, Ms. Monahan moved in with Mr. Ellison and his teenage daughter, Amirah.\u201cMany people \u2014 including, probably, many people reading these words \u2014 believe Karen,\u201d Amirah wrote. \u201cThat reality both gives me hope for the beautiful momentum that the #metoo movement has built, and a profound anger at the injustice of these false accusations. But Karen Monahan is exploiting a movement.\u201dMs. Monahan said Amirah\u2019s account was untrue.In the summer of 2016, about a year after Ms. Monahan moved in, Mr. Ellison began to tell his friends that the relationship wasn\u2019t working out. That August, Mr. Ellison attended a conference on transgender issues and then met with a female friend to talk to her about legal papers she had received from her ex-husband. Ms. Monahan accused him of cheating, recalled Shay Berkowitz, a friend of Mr. Ellison\u2019s who has volunteered for his campaigns.\u201cThey didn\u2019t bring out the best in each other,\u201d she said, adding that the relationship ended at that time, but Ms. Monahan remained in his house until she could get her own place.It was after that fight that Ms. Monahan alleges that she was lying down on a bed and listening to a podcast episode when Mr. Ellison asked her to take out the trash. When she did not respond verbally, he grew angry, she said.In a profanity-laced tirade, she said he asked her to leave and called her a bad guest.\u201cHe kept trying to pull me and pull me and pull me off\u201d the bed, she said. \u201cAnd I just laid dead. Because I was scared.\u201dMr. Ellison left to catch a flight, she said, but warned her to be gone when he returned.Ms. Monahan claimed to have a cellphone video of the incident, but has so far declined to make it available to reporters. She told CNN that she misplaced it, but wrote on Facebook that she would not provide it because victims should not be forced to prove their claims. Shortly after she made the allegation, Ms. Monahan called the police and alleged that her computer had been hacked and \u201cthat email conversations between her and Ellison have been randomly deleted off of her laptop,\u201d according to the police report.Ms. Monahan said that after the alleged incident, she borrowed money to pay the deposit on her own place, but did not consider the relationship to be over until January 2017, when she discovered text messages on Mr. Ellison\u2019s phone to two other women.She sent him screenshots of the messages, and accused him of \u201csoul-rape,\u201d according to text messages she posted later on social media. She told him she might write a memoir about their relationship. He warned her not to violate his privacy.Around this time, Mr. Ellison appeared on the verge of gaining a powerful new role as chairman of the Democratic National Committee.With the party reeling in the aftermath of the 2016 election, progressives like Mr. Ellison and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont argued that Democrats needed new leaders who would craft a more populist pitch to win back voters.Mr. Ellison, who had the support of leaders like Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, seemed on track to win. But D.N.C. members ultimately chose former Labor Secretary Tom Perez.The loss was personally devastating for Mr. Ellison, said Kim Bettie, a high school sweetheart who had just rekindled a romance with the congressman.\u201cHe said he was going to a dark place and did not want to take me there,\u201d recalled Ms. Bettie, who said Mr. Ellison abruptly broke up with her after losing the D.N.C. election.She said she had never seen Mr. Ellison be abusive, although she was hurt by his sudden change of heart. After Ms. Monahan went public with her abuse allegations, Ms. Bettie thanked her publicly on Facebook for trying to warn other women about him.Mr. Ellison\u2019s current girlfriend, Monica Hurtado, said she had only seen him treat women with respect.\u201cKaren is suffering. She is a victim \u2014 not of Keith, but of others during her childhood,\u201d Ms. Hurtado said. \u201cKeith has been very clear in saying that nobody is out of the circle of compassion and that includes Karen.\u201dAbout a year after the breakup, Ms. Monahan sent an email to Ms. Hurtado, accusing her of stealing Mr. Ellison\u2019s affections.\u201cYour desires, and how you acted on those desires, in this whole situation had nothing to do with Keith\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d Ms. Monahan wrote. \u201cYou thought of your needs, what you wanted, your desires, and it didn\u2019t matter who you hurt.\u201d\u201cToday is world narcissist abuse day,\u201d she wrote on Twitter in June, tagging Mr. Ellison\u2019s account. \u201cPlease raise awareness about this destructive form of abuse.\u201dShe continued to call on Mr. Ellison for assistance in text messages seen by The New York Times. In May, she contacted him when she ran out of gas on the highway. And in June, she sought a meeting with him to discuss the case of a pregnant woman, who she said had unjustly been sent to prison.Ms. Monahan\u2019s supporters point out that Mr. Ellison faced a similar accusation in 2006, when another young environmental activist alleged that she had an affair with Mr. Ellison while he was married. That woman, Amy Alexander, said he came to her house, shoved her and broke a screen door as he left. Mr. Ellison has denied having a romantic relationship with Ms. Alexander, and won a restraining order against her in court. A judge warned her not to repeat her claims. Attempts to contact Ms. Alexander were not successful.Supporters of Mr. Ellison say Ms. Alexander\u2019s allegations, which came out in a Republican newspaper three weeks before he was elected to Congress, were politically motivated. They also say the timing of Ms. Monahan\u2019s allegations \u2014 just days before the Democratic primary \u2014 suggests a desire to harm him politically. Even those who say they believe Ms. Monahan have publicly urged her to release the video.Despite the allegations, Mr. Ellison won his primary. Now he faces Doug Wardlow, a Republican who has already made an issue out of the allegations.Melody Hoffmann, a feminist activist who has voted for Mr. Ellison in the past, said she refused to cast a ballot for him this time. She acknowledged that men who have been accused of rape and workplace harassment might have been \u201clumped together\u201d with those who had bad dates or relationships that just went sour.\u201cUnfortunately, this wave of women being believed is so new, we haven\u2019t figured out how to nuance it,\u201d she said. But if that was the cost of the public reckoning about the abuse of women, she said, it was worth it.Doris Burke and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Summer Movie Scorecard: Some Crazy Rich Hits and Shocking Misses", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat else happened during this bold, bloody season, and who was left standing at the end? Here are some winners, losers and survivors as Hollywood\u2019s summer wraps up.Box-office watchers were agog when \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d (made for $30 million) put up second-weekend numbers that were virtually the same as its $26 million opening weekend. That sort of hold is unicorn-rare in Hollywood, and taken in concert with the record-breaking business posted by \u201cBlack Panther\u201d earlier this year, it ought to serve as ample proof that there is a financial upside to reflecting the world as it actually looks.Another lesson that I hope Hollywood will learn from the success of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d is that audiences are starved for a good romantic comedy. The genre that minted stars like Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock has fallen into disrepair: As studios began squeezing midbudget movies out of summer slates stocked with expensive superhero movies and dirt-cheap horror entries, the rom-com was first to go.No one expected \u201cSolo,\u201d an origin story for the iconic space smuggler once played by Harrison Ford, to perform this badly, and the film\u2019s foreign take was similarly weak: Though the 2016 stand-alone \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d made $523 million overseas without any recognizable leads, \u201cSolo\u201d sputtered out at $179 million. It\u2019s clear that Lucasfilm must reconsider planned spinoffs for characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Boba Fett. If Han Solo can\u2019t pull in audiences, who can?Smaller distributors like to counterprogram in the summer by pushing out acclaimed indies and documentaries, then hoping for the best. Usually, that sector is in great shape if even one documentary becomes a hit; this summer, there were three.First, \u201cRBG\u201d told the story of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to great success, grossing nearly $14 million, an enormous personal best for its distributor, Magnolia Pictures. In June, the Fred Rogers documentary \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?\u201d became an even bigger success. It has drawn $22 million so far, the best a nonconcert or non-nature documentary has fared in more than five years. Yet the Rogers movie didn\u2019t cannibalize the market: Just weeks after it was released, Neon put out the twisty \u201cThree Identical Strangers,\u201d which has also passed the all-important $10 million mark at the box office.Given these results, will real people become summer-movie stalwarts just like superheroes? While it\u2019s certainly a boom time for documentaries, I\u2019d point out that the three that broke through were not unlike the sort of viral videos that flourish on social media: \u201cThree Identical Strangers\u201d feels like a \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it\u201d Buzzfeed post come to life, while the trailers for \u201cRBG\u201d and \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?\u201d play very much like those feel-good montages that can rack up millions of shares on Facebook. Documentaries may be big business right now, but only if the films feel like something you could click on.Not even the summer films themselves could offer the darkly comic twists and turns of MoviePass. The disruptive company made headlines last summer for offering a $9.95 monthly plan letting subscribers see one movie a day, the sort of eyebrow-raising bargain that had people wondering how MoviePass could turn a profit.Indeed, as moviegoers began signing up in huge numbers, MoviePass amended the plan nearly a dozen times, struggling to make the company financially feasible instead of a money-bleeding operation. Certain theaters or films would fail to show up on the MoviePass app, depending on who the company was warring with at the time, and blockbusters were increasingly locked out altogether or tagged with a surge fee. This month, MoviePass announced a deal that\u2019s decidedly more limited: Subscribers can now see just three movies per month, and those picks still come with tremendous caveats.Yet if there\u2019s something MoviePass was successful at, it\u2019s demonstrating that people still want to go out and see a movie, even in the age of streaming. They simply want different options other than a single, high-priced ticket, and already, companies like AMC and Sinemia are rushing to fill the gap with new plans. In an era when consumers pony up a monthly fee to access all that Spotify, Netflix or Hulu can provide, why shouldn\u2019t theatrical moviegoing offer a similar subscription model?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riz Ahmed Acts His Way Out of Every Cultural Pigeonhole", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "From HBO to \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to Shakespeare, he has discovered how to excel beyond tidy genres.He arrived a few minutes late, speed-walking toward me in apologetic haste and grabbing my hand with enthusiasm. He was dressed in a gray kurta-inspired top, black slacks and a perfectly disheveled royal blue jacket with the sleeves rolled to midforearm \u2014 an ensemble that, along with the suede baseball cap pulled low over his eyes, gave him the look of a very well-read semiretired pro skateboarder. Onscreen his presence can be almost comically malleable \u2014 he can come across as pliant or stalwart, frank or cagey \u2014 but in person there is a distinct and direct energy to him, a keenness bubbling under the surface.It comes out not only in how he talks but also in what he talks about. Tribalism, for example, which we explored at length over breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong instinct,\u201d he told me from across the table at a crowded Fort Greene restaurant. \u201cAnd that can be a really healthy instinct. The organization of marginalized groups relies on tribalism, to some extent. If you\u2019re trying to move uphill against injustice, I can understand that. But when you\u2019re already at the top of the mountain, tribalism is just a way of [expletive] on people and excluding them from power.\u201dOr the Mughal Empire, with which he has found himself low-key obsessed of late, and on which he just might, if you\u2019re open to it, deliver a full-throated disquisition. \u201cUnder the Mughals, you have this multicultural empire, which is basically Muslims, Hindu majority, and there\u2019s a certain pragmatism that comes from ... \u201d \u2014 here he stopped, midthesis, to re-form his thoughts \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a mongrel empire, it\u2019s a multicultural empire, and they intermarry between Hindus and Muslims. It\u2019s like a pragmatism emerges when you have to abandon the idea of purity or a monolith, where it\u2019s like, we just present things as they are. Then you start getting realistic depictions as opposed to idealized depictions. ... \u201dOn an intellectual flight like this, Ahmed seems self-assured, fueled by his knowledge and his quest for more of it. There are other moments when he feels, still, completely powerless. Like when it emerges that people are calling him a Renaissance man \u2014 which, of course, he hates. But why? He does, in fact, excel at a lot of different things. He has become a go-to actor for unique secondary characters in Hollywood spectacles, like the \u201cStar Wars\u201d film \u201cRogue One,\u201d the Jason Bourne film \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and the forthcoming Marvel film \u201cVenom.\u201d He has won an Emmy for his devastating lead role as an American Muslim railroaded by the criminal-justice system in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d in which he mesmerized audiences with his evolution from delicate na\u00efvet\u00e9 to delicate violence without ever seeming to change the expression on his face. Hollywood appears to be fully buying in: In addition to \u201cVenom,\u201d Ahmed stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the macabre western comedy \u201cThe Sisters Brothers,\u201d opening this month; he is in preproduction for the title role in a \u201cHamlet\u201d adaptation that will appear on Netflix; and he has created and sold the sweeping multigenerational immigrant-epic series \u201cEnglistan\u201d to the BBC, with preproduction set to begin soon.As if that weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s also one half of the critically acclaimed, if niche, rap duo Swet Shop Boys and a solo artist whose 2006 song \u201cPost 9/11 Blues,\u201d released in the wake of the 7/7 attacks in London, was banned by some English radio stations for being too controversial. He is an Oxford graduate, a classically trained actor and maybe the only person I\u2019ve ever seen recite a poem on an American late-night show to thunderous applause. The poem, called \u201cSour Times,\u201d was delivered two nights after Heather Heyer was killed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., and it sparked a miniwar on the Facebook page for \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d over whether Fallon was divisive for introducing politics into his show.This is another thing Ahmed takes issue with: being called political. \u201cA lot of mainstream movies, they\u2019re steeped in their perspective,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery story, every decision, who you prioritize, what your perspective is. That\u2019s what your politics is.\u201d He wonders too why some artists have their work labeled political while others don\u2019t. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to express yourself authentically, doing that becomes somehow perceived as a struggle, as picking a fight. When really I\u2019m just going from A to B. It\u2019s like Ferris Bueller\u2019s going from A to B.\u201dI ask him what that means.\u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s just lawless out here, man!\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just a white dude skipping class and being lawless.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him, \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d And then I repeat the sentence, word for word, because it\u2019s not true: I don\u2019t actually see what he\u2019s saying. It will be at least 24 hours before I see what he\u2019s saying.At Merchant Taylors\u2019 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the face of \u2014 well, wait. Ahmed pauses here, breaking the flow of our interview, his voice dropping half an octave: He\u2019s conscious of the fact that he\u2019s told these stories before, and he doesn\u2019t want to bore me, or come across like ... you know. Not at all, I remind him, but he pauses before going on \u2014 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the formerly white face of private education. There he witnessed and experienced racism from students and teachers. \u201cThe teacher would be talking about evolution and would just wander over and stand next to the one black kid in class, gesturing to him.\u201d It made an impression. He also found himself immersed in the stuffy, old-white-man literature that would, against his better judgment, affect him forever. Literature like the now corny World War I poems he had to study, about \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land,\u201d the empty, apocalyptic, unclaimed space between enemy trenches where no humans belonged. Verses like:That kind of stuff, likewise, stuck with him.He also had inspirational teachers who encouraged his talent and curiosity and, I\u2019m guessing, insatiable energy. Teachers like Mr. Roseblade, whom Ahmed describes as seeming, even at the time, like something out of an inspirational high school movie: \u201cHe was this Jewish guy from the north, this English teacher who spoke Punjabi. He just took a lot of those kids under his wing and made us realize, like: \u2018Look, you\u2019ve got to get these credits. You\u2019ve got to go and join the debating society. Otherwise, you ain\u2019t gonna be able to get into a good university. Because you\u2019re not on the rugby team, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019\u2009\u201dLast year, many years removed from Mr. Roseblade\u2019s class, Ahmed found himself standing before the House of Commons, having been selected to deliver the second annual Channel 4 lecture on diversity in media. In his speech, clear and eloquent, he delivered a warning. Either let English people like him participate fully in English society, or they might just go do it with ISIS. \u201cIn the mind of the ISIS recruit, he\u2019s a version of James Bond, right?\u201d Ahmed asked the assembled members. \u201cHave you seen some of those ISIS propaganda videos? They are cut like action movies. Where is the counternarrative? Where are we telling these kids that they can be heroes in our stories, that they are valued?\u201d In watching the footage, something struck me about it: Ahmed was using the word \u201cwe\u201d to describe the country that colonized his ancestors.\u201c\u2009\u2018We\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 changes and shifts constantly,\u201d he conceded when I asked him about it. \u201cThat was my biggest experience going to Merchant Taylors\u2019. Extreme code switching. The most confusing conversation is to have to talk about the colonization of our continents.\u201d We laughed a little at the ridiculousness of sentences like \u201cwe colonized us,\u201d or \u201cwe took us into slavery.\u201d But then his face turned serious. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are. We are the inheritors of the scars of Empire, but also the spoils of Empire. And that kind of inside/outside state is totally ingrained in us. Which is why, at a time like now, where everybody\u2019s being asked to pick a side, everything is binary, it\u2019s a confusing time to be us.\u201dWe were sharing food, which he had all but insisted on. I had been a tad unsure about it, not certain that it was entirely professional to be digging into a subject\u2019s meal minutes after we met. But he seemed hampered by no such considerations. \u201cGet in there, bro,\u201d he said, gesturing to his plate in between discussions of whether or not people of color can be gentrifiers (his black female optician did not think so) and whether or not N.W.A. was, by any definition, \u201cconscious rap\u201d (an argument can be made, perhaps). I felt aware of a duality. On one hand, I was a professional reporter, trying my best to look as if I belonged where I was, doing what I was doing: sharp questions, clear thinking, research prepared. On the other hand, I was a black American man hanging out with a British-Pakistani man in a white cafe in what used to be a black neighborhood, chopping it up at a high level. On the third hand, I was a writer for a national magazine sharing a platform with an international film star while we talked about all the serpentine machinations of oppression and how they\u2019ve woven and buried themselves in the very flesh of our lives. To dig haphazardly into his plate of quinoa or not?Instead, we were interrupted by something else. Beside us on the road there appeared a battered black jeep, on monster tires, with huge steer horns glued to either side of the hood. And a shark\u2019s fin coming from the roof. And radioactivity stickers. And what seemed like a thousand headlights. And a personalized license plate that read \u201cMOVE AWAY.\u201d And while I was thinking, \u201cLOL, New York, amirite? Back to my interview,\u201d Ahmed was saying, \u201cPete\u201d \u2014 our driver\u2019s name, which he had clearly made a point of remembering \u2014 \u201cpull up next to him, and let\u2019s see exactly who this is. Let\u2019s have a little chat quickly.\u201d Pete obliged.We pulled up, only to find the vehicle was being driven by an Orthodox Jew.\u201cWhoa!\u201d we said, all three of us, at precisely the same time. None of us saw that coming.Now Ahmed had to talk to him.Man: \u201cI chase them.\u201dMore was revealed. The man was French. He\u2019d been in the States for five years, along with his brother. They were children\u2019s entertainers, performers and low-key stuntmen and were in the process of making a kids\u2019 DVD that was based, somehow, on this Zombie Proof jeep. (Their act is called \u201cThe Twins From France,\u201d and they are available for bar mitzvahs.)After the light turned green and we\u2019d gone our separate ways, Ahmed was glowing, bouncing and rocking in the back seat. \u201cNone of you expected that!\u201d he was yelling. \u201cNone of you expected it!\u201d He seemed to consider the incongruousness of the whole scene something of a personal victory.And he was right: I was not expecting it. I was quietly thinking about how sure I\u2019d been that, if we pulled up alongside that truck, I\u2019d see, somewhere on its body or its driver, a Confederate flag.As we crawled through Midtown traffic, the conversation turned to music, a topic by which Riz Ahmed is perpetually enchanted, and as he schooled me on the history of the U.K. garage and jungle scenes, I watched him transform from a political thinker to an excited dorm-room music bro. He made me listen to the track he claims was most seminal to his entire worldview: \u201cOriginal Nuttah,\u201d by Shy FX featuring UK Apachi. It is a song better heard than described. Suffice it to say that in the early 1990s, British-Jamaicans started singing reggae melodies and rocking the mic over absurdly sped-up beats, and the results were as manic as they were marvelous. Except UK Apachi was not Jamaican. His father was Iraqi, and his mother was Indian and South African. Abdul Wahab was a British Muslim who grew up getting called \u201cPaki\u201d and eventually aligned himself with whatever his conception was of Native Americans to create a persona doing British-Jamaican music. And it was fire.Dunham took an interest in the actor after seeing his performances in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d and in \u201cFour Lions,\u201d a dark comedy about a group of men trying, ineptly, to commit an act of terrorism; she calls it \u201cas iconic and cozy a comedy as \u2018Wedding Crashers.\u2019\u2009\u201d Ahmed, she says, takes his work seriously: \u201cHe\u2019s such an academic.\u201d She remembers how, in preparation for his time on \u201cGirls,\u201d he researched surfing, scouted the Montauk area and used an American accent through all five days of shooting. \u201cThen at the end we wrapped, and he was, like, \u2018Alroight, bruv, see you lata, bruv,\u2019 back into his rude-boy deal. And people felt, like, betrayed \u2014 like, \u2018We partied with him, we danced with him, we went out for lobster with him, he spoke in an American accent the whole time!\u2019\u2009\u201d She also tells me about the time she fell ill, and he left a dinner with \u2014 she thinks \u2014 like, Salman Rushdie, just to sit by her hospital bed and talk until she fell asleep. \u201cHe\u2019s a very tenderhearted person,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to forget, because he has the bravado of someone in the hip-hop world and the intensity of someone who\u2019s an activist.\u201dWe had come to the Met because, in addition to being a rapper and an actor and a budding producer, Ahmed has also been spending his Sundays in one-on-one study sessions with Navina Haidar, a curator in the Met\u2019s department of Islamic art. She led us upstairs, past various security doors and card scanners and cloistered offices into a small, cool conference room. The walls were lined with reproductions of Islamic art from eras spanning the last thousand years. While we waited to begin, Ahmed stepped out for a moment, and Haidar confided in me about why she agreed to spend her Sundays talking art with this particular movie star. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, a moral core. And he\u2019s intellectually very active and quite creative, and curious and very dedicated to what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Ahmed returned, but she didn\u2019t stop; instead, she just turned her praise to him. \u201cIt\u2019s been very impressive to see how you have been really dedicated to wanting to learn about this, and to have these tutorials, and really explore the subject in depth. That commitment, I think, is really inspiring for me as a curator.\u201d Ahmed kept his eyes down, scanning the page in front of him, while she lavished him with praise, and then, when she was done, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a G.\u201dSometime around 1600, in the Ottoman court of what is now Turkey, a book was created. Perhaps it is better described as an album. In fact, it is often called the Bellini Album, after the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, who served as a point of cultural connection between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and whose portrait of Mehmet II hangs in the National Gallery in London. (He also created an image of \u201cthe East\u201d for \u201cthe West\u201d and as such was, in a sense, ground zero for Orientalism.) The complete origins of the Bellini Album are not entirely known. Experts suggest it cannot be attributed to Bellini himself but speculate it was so named because of the European art scattered throughout, some of which was once rumored to be Bellini\u2019s work.The album is, in essence, a scrapbook, each page featuring a form or piece of art, from sources all over the Ottoman Empire and beyond \u2014 Persian calligraphy, an ink-and-watercolor goose attributed to China, collages of devotional scenes attributed to Italy and the Netherlands. On one page, you find a painting of a person falling into a well; on another, a peacock whose tail is actually calligraphy, and whose calligraphy is actually a poem. There is even a page on which the disembodied head of Jesus appears on what may be the Veil of Veronica. Each page is itself a meditation on adornment, with the image in the center hemmed by borders of intricate flowers and the detailed marbling of lapis lazuli and rose. All of it without an owner, all of it a mashup of something prior. If visual symbology were music, then the Bellini Album would be a mixtape.What made that transition particularly tough for Ahmed was that, in the \u201990s, it seemed to him that British South Asians were enjoying a kind of aspirational freedom. The economy was good. It was O.K. to live well. The South Asian sketch-comedy show \u201cGoodness Gracious Me\u201d was enjoying huge success. South Asian culture was rippling into U.K. music, as well, in genres like bhangra and jungle and with pop acts like Cornershop. There was something of a multicultural moment for British South Asians. Growing up, Ahmed believed that the flag of Britain should and would obviously include him.But he soon found himself at Oxford University, just after 9/11 \u2014 a brown kid surrounded by the acolytes of seemingly ancient white wealth, who sometimes did have a way of talking to him as if he were a shopkeeper. Rather than retreating into Oxford, he decided to make Oxford come to him. He started organizing parties that celebrated his music and cultural touchstones, parties where he would get on the mic over drum \u2019n\u2019 bass records. Soon enough, the event he co-founded, \u201cHit and Run,\u201d moved to Manchester and became one of the city\u2019s leading underground music events. Ahmed also performed as a vocalist with a 12-member jazz/electro/drum \u2019n\u2019 bass ensemble called \u201cConfidential Collective.\u201dHe invited me back to the apartment he was subletting in Fort Greene, in a spacious brownstone with hardwood floors and sunny high ceilings. There was at least one other roommate floating around. It seemed strange to think that Riz Ahmed had just found a room sublet on Craigslist, or whatever, but that seemed to be the case. He wanted me to hear music \u2014 not the music he was making, necessarily, but the music he was thinking about, that was inspiring him.He also looked for connections between the two of us, adroitly comparing and contrasting the black American experience and the British-Pakistani one. The quest for him, it seemed, was to prove that although people have a hard time seeing certain things as connected, reality has a much more expansive view. \u201cHis thing\u201d is to make everything his thing. Or perhaps that\u2019s not quite right: He is not out to co-opt the world to him. Rather, he is looking to elbow out a space for himself in the world, to prove that it should exist.I asked him what kind of art he liked the most in the Islamic collection. It was not the meticulously crafted objects, carved by hand, floral patterns seeming to move as fluids, and it wasn\u2019t the deeply attentive nature drawings, each barb of the feather\u2019s vane painted with microscopic care, sometimes by a brush made, according to legend, with a single hair. These he found beautiful. But they were not his favorites; the miniatures were. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my own weird way of looking at things,\u201d he told me at the museum, \u201cbut what I really appreciate about lots of miniatures and lots of things like this is, you get a God\u2019s-eye view. You get the schematic.\u201d Details are nice. But for him the best way to see anything is to see everything.In an odd way it made me reflect on \u201cCashmere,\u201d the first LP from Ahmed\u2019s Swet Shop Boys project. (His opposite number in that duo, Himanshu Suri, is from Queens, and sounds like it; Ahmed is from London, and sounds like it; and yet somehow they also sound like they\u2019re from South Asia, only by way of Jamaica, and also by way of a sweat-filled Brixton rave in 1999, and finally by way of a musty bedroom, a lone red lamp, a laptop and a severe lack of sleep.) On this album, Ahmed wrote a song, \u201cHalf Moghul Half Mowgli,\u201d the title perhaps a reference to the British-Indian singer Susheela Raman\u2019s 2003 fusion track \u201cHalf Shiva Half Shakti.\u201d In it, he delivers three verses mostly about not quite fitting in anywhere \u2014 or, depending on how you look at it, fitting in just a little everywhere.The first two are straightforward evocations of his past: \u201cMy only heroes were black rappers/So to me, Tupac was a true Paki.\u201d On the third, though, he does something different. He addresses himself from four different perspectives, four different ways he is interpreted and received, attacked and praised. First there\u2019s the grateful South Asian fan (\u201cOur young ones need someone like you to look up to\u201d). Then he embodies the voice of someone calling him a \u201cterrorist Paki\u201d and a weak rapper. Then comes a young rap fan, saluting him in a mix of Asian and Caribbean argots (\u201cSalaam, wagwan bruv\u201d) and says \u201cbecause of you I went to uni\u201d \u2014 and, last, a disgruntled elder who warns him that he\u2019s going to hell \u201cfor the sex and the swearing\u201d and should obey the Quran. All of this in one dizzying verse, each voice rushing in to replace the last.The first time I heard this, it struck me so deeply that I paused the song and sat quietly. The verse was simple: It was just four different ways people look at you. But the reason it unraveled something so deeply inside of me was that it also represented four different ways you can look at yourself. All completely opposite one another, and completely isolated, and yet completely validated by the world you live in. And when there are so many versions of self, maybe the only way to maintain safety is to develop a view that can see, literally, everything.A few weeks later, we met in Boston. Ahmed was running late, having spent all day on the set of the forthcoming film \u201cThe Sound of Metal.\u201d In it, he plays a rock drummer who is losing his hearing. He had been learning sign language, practicing drumming and, as he does, just generally molding himself into the role \u2014 or rather, accessing the part of him that already was the role.Ahmed is still doing independent films, because he loves the genre, loves the work. But he is also hoping for bigger and bigger opportunities. He has talked about playing James Bond, if for no other reason than the sense of arrival such a casting would represent \u2014 an acceptance of the fact that Riz Ahmed, in all his contradictory glory, is in no way a contradiction. He is a human and a Brit and capable of being seen as a hero.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Eating in a Heat Wave", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood Wednesday morning.It will be mercilessly hot again today.The mercury may reach a mere 90, but with the humidity, it could feel as stifling as 98. (Thunderstorms may roll in, mainly after 2 p.m., but they won\u2019t cool us off.)Can hot weather affect your appetite?Yes. Extreme weather of any kind can change appetite, said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cWhile it\u2019s difficult to generalize, many people, myself included, don\u2019t feel as hungry in hot weather,\u201d she said. The reason? Overeating generates a lot of heat. \u201cIf you eat a large amount of concentrated calories, you\u2019re going to generate heat from metabolizing them,\u201d Ms. Nestle said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s hot outside, you don\u2019t want to be generating extra heat in the body.\u201dDoes hot weather change the types of foods we eat?Probably not. What are the best foods to eat in hot weather?Fruits and vegetables. \u201cHydration is key during hot weather,\u201d said Ms. Akabas. \u201cFruits and vegetables provide lots of water and are loaded with potassium.\u201dIs spicy food helpful?It depends on where you eat it. It\u2019s true that spicy foods make some people sweat, which can help cool you down, Ms. Nestle said. But outside in really hot and humid weather, like today\u2019s, she said, \u201cIt just makes things worse because you\u2019re sweating, but the sweat is not evaporating.\u201d So, if you\u2019re in an air-conditioned restaurant then go for the extra-hot guac, but if you\u2019re having lunch outside or in the sun, that extra-spicy pad thai may make you more uncomfortable.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Our city is getting a new park.Later today, Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce that the city has secured financing for an extension of the Hudson Park and Boulevard at Hudson Yards in Midtown West.The three-acre park will run over the Amtrak rail cut from 36th Street to 39th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues.While the current park serves as a popular lunch spot for the area\u2019s commercial workers, the extension will create a space that\u2019s greener and more lush, according to a spokesman for City Hall.Groundbreaking is set to begin in late 2020, and the park isn\u2019t scheduled to be open until the winter of 2023.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "$1.7 Billion Federal Job Training Program Is \u2018Failing the Students\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMcKINNEY, Tex. \u2014 The North Texas Job Corps Center squats behind a chain-link fence here in a suburb north of Dallas, accessible only through a gate manned 24 hours a day by guards hired to keep out intruders \u2014 and to keep in the center\u2019s 436 students.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like prison,\u201d said Donnell Strange, 17, who joined the electrical apprenticeship program about six months ago after struggling in school back home in Mansfield, near Dallas.\u201cJob Corps doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Teresa Sanders, a former teacher at the North Texas center who quit in frustration in 2015 after a rash of violent episodes inside the center, but who keeps in touch with dozens of former students through a Facebook page. \u201cThe adults are making money, the politicians are getting photo ops. But we are all failing the students.\u201dThe labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, who oversees Job Corps, is the latest in a succession of federal officials, starting in the Reagan administration, who have vowed to overhaul the program. Job Corps, Mr. Acosta said in an email, \u201crequires fundamental reform.\u201d\u201cIt is not enough to make changes at the margins,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need large-scale changes.\u201dJob Corps \u2014 from which two million students have graduated since it was started \u2014 boasts some inspiring success stories among the 50,000 students who enroll every year. Two-thirds of them high school dropouts, the students train for more than 100 trades, including welding, automotive repair, plumbing, electrical work and the hospital and hospitality industries.But at a cost to taxpayers of $15,000 to $45,000 per student, it was a ripe target for President Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts. This year, he unsuccessfully tried to cut funding for the program, which principally serves black and Hispanic youths, despite his pledge that job training and reducing minority unemployment were his top priorities.Its budget, protected by lawmakers in both parties, is safe for now. Yet almost everybody involved in the program \u2014 including students and the labor secretary \u2014 questions whether the target population of inner-city and rural youths is well served by a 50-year-old work force model based on housing students in fenced-in former military bases and shuttered hospitals, often miles from the jobs they need.Jeff Smith, a University of Wisconsin professor who studies job programs, said a major quandary is that worthwhile training programs for the poor seldom yield stunningly positive results. \u201cWork force development is very hard, and the results you see aren\u2019t always great,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these populations were easily employable, they would already have jobs.\u201dThe inspector general\u2019s report in April, studying the program\u2019s outcomes, found that the training offered no discernible long-term benefit for graduates when compared with the non-college-educated population in general.Although the program\u2019s most successful participants have been able to earn $40,000 or more in their chosen trades, the Labor Department found that after five years, Job Corps participants on average earned $12,486 a year, barely above the poverty threshold, according to the limited payroll data investigators were able to obtain.The report also found the most serious problems with post-graduation placement services. The program could not account for 94 percent of $50 million spent nationally each year on transition counseling for graduates.Its relatively remote location, a 40-minute commute north of Dallas, makes it hard to compete with more agile, nonresidential job training programs in the city like CitySquare, a local community development organization that runs jobs programs and a food pantry. When students complained that they were missing out on job offers, the group\u2019s leaders scaled back a 12-week construction trades course to six weeks.\u201cWe aren\u2019t tied down, so we can move quickly,\u201d said Jarie Bradley, who runs CitySquare.One vocational instructor at North Texas, all too aware of the program\u2019s shortcomings, has tried to focus on the barest basics of being a wage-earning employee: Show up on time, do not cuss out the boss and refrain from drinking or getting high during work hours.But for the two or three students he feels are work-ready, he offers different advice: Drop out of the Job Corps the minute someone offers you a decent job paying around $12 per hour. The teacher wanted his name withheld because his approach conflicted with that of the management company.Students, teachers and administrators at North Texas cited the legal requirement that the centers house the students they serve as the single biggest obstacle to meaningful reform. The dormitories have housed students who brought with them grudges from their neighborhoods in Dallas, sometimes stoked by gang affiliations.But officials at the National Job Corps Association, funded by the operators, argue that the dormitory model is the program\u2019s greatest virtue, plucking young people from dangerous neighborhoods and giving them vital life skills.\u201cThis is the toughest population to deal with, these at-risk kids, and most of them wouldn\u2019t make it without Job Corps. They would be a drag on society,\u201d said Jim Lindenmayer, the association\u2019s chairman.Mr. Lindenmayer conceded that many centers were not responsive enough to local employment conditions, but laid much of the blame on \u201ca ton of regulations\u201d put out by the Labor Department that squelch innovation.The situation has improved under the management of a new operator, Horizons Youth Services, which runs several of Job Corps\u2019 highest-performing centers. But students in McKinney are still grasping for their elusive share of the prosperity around them, which they see etched in the Dallas skyline by dozens of construction cranes.The biggest hurdle Mr. Acosta faces is Congress, which jealously controls the most arcane details of Job Corps to keep the Labor Department from shuttering it or cutting the head count at centers in lawmakers\u2019 districts.Few federal programs have ever enjoyed such broad bipartisan political support. Progressives see it as an enduring commitment to the poor rooted in a golden age of liberalism. Conservative lawmakers support Job Corps because it encourages low-income young people to work hard.The website for the trade association of Job Corps contractors is plastered with pictures of smiling politicians from both parties. The centerpiece is a snapshot of Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, hugging a Job Corps student in Morganfield \u2014 one of seven centers in his home state.During the Obama administration, budget officials floated the idea of shuttering a handful of the lowest-performing centers, according to former aides. The idea ran into immediate resistance from members of Congress in both parties.The Labor Department had even less success carrying out another main recommendation: widening the pool of contractors running the centers beyond the six large management companies that run 63 of them.Mr. Acosta said he wanted to break that impasse by using new performance measures to force companies to focus on moving students into jobs. Reimbursements have historically been pegged to benchmarks like graduation rates and certificate programs, which are important but do not necessarily lead to employment.Mr. Acosta, two officials familiar with his plans said, is considering turning 10 to 12 of the 123 existing centers into pilot projects \u2014 the most sweeping changes he can make without congressional approval. He has reached out to governors in several states to gauge interest in converting existing centers into pre-apprenticeship academies based on the National Guard\u2019s YouthChallenge program, a 17-month program for high-school-age youths.He is considering increasing department partnerships with community colleges based, in part, on a successful collaboration between the Ottumwa, Iowa, center and local educational institutions.But he has not ruled out trying to close centers, and is looking into the possibility of separating younger students from older ones, who are in need of quick-turnaround jobs training.All of these moves are aimed at jolting the system out of its doldrums. Mr. Acosta\u2019s larger goal, aides said, is to supplant some for-profit companies that run the centers with more innovative operators.Mr. Lindenmayer said his association was supportive of the changes. But former federal officials who tried to overhaul the system are skeptical of the prospects for reform.\u201cYou have a program with a rich and complicated history that\u2019s one of the biggest leftovers from the war on poverty, and it is enormously complicated to make any significant changes,\u201d said Eric M.

One tidbit: He bumped up the price tag, which he\u2019d calculated at $419 a share, to $420 because it was more auspicious. (He added, \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear.\u201d But his use of Ambien and, occasionally, recreational drugs worries his board.)For his part, Mr. Musk has no regrets: \u201cWhy would I?\u201dGoogle\u2019s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, said at a staff meeting yesterday that the company isn\u2019t close to unveiling that search product.

He remains in jail at least until Sept. 11, when he will have a hearing on a bail request that was filed this week.Human rights organizations, as well as journalism and photography groups, have loudly protested his imprisonment.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Says Tesla May Go Private, and Its Stock Soars", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has become one of the world\u2019s most prominent chief executives, and a billionaire several times over, by boldly making big bets on ideas that few others thought possible.Through it all, he has shown a maverick \u2014 some would say arrogant \u2014 management style. On Tuesday, he may have outdone himself.In a terse and cryptic Twitter post, he declared that he was ready to take Tesla private. The stock market that made his company worth over $60 billion wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFunding secured.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock was already up sharply on a report that Saudi Arabia was taking a sizable stake in the company. But investors were left to puzzle out the implications of Mr. Musk\u2019s proposition, its relationship to the Saudi report, and even the authenticity of the tweet. And so, starting at 12:48 p.m., the market that Mr. Musk threatened to forsake went into a frenzy.At 2:08 p.m., with shares up more than 7 percent for the day, trading was halted pending news \u2014 news that finally came shortly before 3:30.\u201cI fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Musk said that no final decision had yet been made about taking the company private, and that any such proposal would have to be approved by shareholders.He outlined a plan under which shareholders could be bought out for $420 a share \u2014 a 20 percent premium over the stock price after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call last week \u2014 or they could remain as private shareholders.\u201cThis has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI own about 20 percent of the company now and don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is complete.\u201dTesla trading resumed 15 minutes before the end of the trading session, and the shares added to their gains, closing at $379.57, up 11 percent.Mr. Musk did not elaborate on any sources of financing to take Tesla private. The announcement followed a report that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had acquired a stake in the company.A person briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the Saudi fund had taken a stake of less than 5 percent.The Financial Times reported that the shares had been acquired for the fund in the secondary market with the help of JPMorgan Chase. The bank declined to comment.If the transaction got done at $420 per share, Tesla would be valued at just over $70 billion, making it the biggest deal in which a company is taken private.Although Tesla has become the most valuable American car company, it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. And its chief executive, a 47-year-old native of South Africa, has come under increasing pressure as he has scrambled to increase production of the Model 3, a midsize sedan that he is counting on to drive up revenue and enable the company to become profitable.Still, this is not the way multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts are typically announced. Companies would normally line up banks, private equity firms or other deep-pocketed investors to agree in advance to provide money to finance the purchase of shares.Officials representing a number of large banks and investment funds said on Tuesday that they had not talked with Tesla about financing a buyout, although it is possible the company had secured funding from other sources.Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Tuesday \u2014 mentioning the specific price of a possible buyout and declaring that Tesla had already arranged funding \u2014 were virtually guaranteed to send the shares flying. Still, while it was unusual for a chief executive to make a market-moving announcement on Twitter, there is nothing improper about it on its face.But the S.E.C. has also advised that intentional releases of market-moving information on social media platforms or websites must be accompanied by a simultaneous release to the broader public. The delay between Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet and Tesla\u2019s corporate announcement could be of interest to the S.E.C., said Michael Liftik, a former deputy chief of staff at the commission who is now a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\u201cSimultaneously really means simultaneously,\u201d he said. And he said a tweet would be held to the same standard of factuality as a news release.Others pointed out that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet could have opened his company up to legal exposure from investors with financial incentives to sue.\u201cWhat they have to show is there was a material misstatement, in these loose statements, by Mr. Musk,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance. Mr. Coffee said the statement \u201cfunding secured\u201d could be a legal gray area where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys see an opportunity to make a case.\u201cThat\u2019s a very broad statement about what is still an extraordinarily amorphous transaction,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.The S.E.C. had no comment, and Tesla would not comment beyond what was in Mr. Musk\u2019s statement to employees.Being a public company and reporting earnings every three months \u201cputs enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\u201d he said. Having its stock traded publicly also means that Tesla can attract short-sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla \u2014 whom he described as \u201cpeople who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dTesla has attracted more so-called short-sellers than any other publicly traded company, in part because many investors doubt the company can achieve the lofty targets that Mr. Musk has set.Tesla\u2019s short-sellers on Tuesday racked up about $1.5 billion in losses, according to S3 Analytics, a technology and research firm. That brings their losses so far this year to $3 billion.Going private \u201cwould definitely benefit Elon Musk and the way he\u2019d like to run the company,\u201d said Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t like the intrusion he gets as a public company.\u201dHe has also objected to analysts\u2019 conclusions that the company may have to raise additional capital from investors later this year as it continues to post losses and use up hundreds of millions of dollars in cash each quarter.Mr. Levy, the analyst, said that even if Tesla went private, it would probably still need to borrow to pursue its plans for new models and new factories. \u201cThe question is whether they will have the same investor support,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a private company with a lot of debt, the risk goes up.\u201dHe characterized Mr. Musk\u2019s management style as \u201cunique.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of unexpected surprises,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the ambitions of SpaceX, a company run by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. It plans to send astronauts into space next year; it has not yet done so.Michael J. de la Merced, Peter Eavis and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

She is nearly 83, she has had enough, and she is ready to die. More specifically, she is ready to have me help her die. I can see her point.An unsentimental, practical person, she has for many years been preparing for the moment when death would become more alluring than life.

Gradually, the illness took hold, the inevitable became less abstract and the jokes stopped. Mom had vivid dreams of death so awful that she could not bring herself to describe them. She became too weak to leave her bed, more of her independence seeping out each day like air from a balloon. Her world closed in. Lung cancer is a frightening illness.

{"Headline": "In Alex Jones Lawsuit, Lawyers Spar Over an Online Broadcast on Sandy Hook", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 In the more than five years since a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has used his Infowars media operation to spread false theories that the massacre was a hoax staged by the government in an effort to tighten restrictions over firearms.That is not in dispute.But in a courtroom hearing here, lawyers for the parents of a child killed at Sandy Hook, in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 where 20 first graders and six adults were shot and killed in December 2012 \u2014 and lawyers for Mr. Jones argued on Wednesday over whether he was maligning the family or the mainstream news media in an April 2017 broadcast titled, \u201cSandy Hook Vampires Exposed.\u201dThe families of nine Sandy Hook victims \u2014 including that of Noah Pozner, who was 6 when he was killed \u2014 have filed cases against Mr. Jones, whose operation is based in Austin.The hearing Wednesday was the first in three defamation cases to reach a courtroom. Among the thornier questions it raises: Does speaking publicly about the killing of a child turn the child\u2019s parents into public figures, making it more difficult to win their case?The broadcast is central to the case brought by Noah\u2019s parents, Veronique De La Rosa and Leonard Pozner, because it aired within Texas\u2019 one-year statute of limitations for defamation cases, and because it features, their lawyer said, a crucial, false theme spread by Mr. Jones: that the shooting was staged, and the parents were lying about it. Followers of Mr. Jones who believe those false claims have stalked and harassed the Pozner family, forcing them to live in hiding.Mr. Jones is seeking to have the case dismissed under the Texas Citizens Participation Act, which protects citizens\u2019 right to free speech against plaintiffs who aim to silence them through costly litigation. Lawyers for both sides continued to file documents hours before the hearing began.Judge Scott Jenkins of the District Court of Travis County, who had not had access to the latest filings before the hearing, instructed both sides to reach an agreement that the record was complete. Once it is, he will have 30 days to dismiss the case or allow it to go forward.In his remarks, Mr. Jones\u2019s lawyer, Mark Enoch, said that he was unfamiliar with Mr. Jones and his Infowars programming before he was hired to represent him. But, Mr. Enoch said, his client\u2019s bizarre, incendiary claims were exactly the type of \u201cfringe speech\u201d that the First Amendment seeks to protect.\u201cThis is not about Sandy Hook,\u201d Mr. Enoch said, adding that Mr. Jones was \u201csorry\u201d for the Pozner family\u2019s loss and \u201cacknowledges\u201d the death of their child.In April 2017, according to court documents, Mr. Jones aired a clip of Ms. De La Rosa\u2019s interview with Anderson Cooper of CNN after the shooting. Mr. Jones notes that when Mr. Cooper turns his head, \u201chis nose disappears repeatedly because the green screen isn\u2019t set right,\u201d implying that the interview was not filmed near the scene of the shooting, but was staged in a studio.Mr. Enoch played a half-hour montage of news and movie clips, which Mr. Jones said suggested examples of lies by CNN, the federal government and politicians. Displaying a narrow series of quotes from the hourslong original broadcast on poster board, Mr. Enoch said those remarks by Mr. Jones did not defame Ms. De La Rosa.Instead, he said, Mr. Jones was criticizing lies by the mainstream news media, the \u201cvampires\u201d who were part of the Sandy Hook plot \u2014 accusations that were Mr. Jones\u2019s opinion, not fact, and therefore largely protected under the First Amendment.Mr. Enoch also argued that Mr. Pozner and Ms. De La Rosa became public figures when they spoke out in favor of a ban on assault-style weapons like the rifle used to kill their son. To win a defamation case, public figures must prove actual malice, meaning that Mr. Jones knew that the statements were untrue and broadcast them anyway or that he demonstrated reckless disregard as to their accuracy.The lawyer for Mr. Pozner and Ms. De La Rosa, Mark Bankston, argued that the excerpts from the April 2017 broadcast chosen by Mr. Enoch did not include multiple \u201cmonstrous\u201d false statements that Mr. Jones presented as fact, like the false claim that the parents were actors in a government plot.Mr. Bankston said Mr. Jones\u2019s remarks about Ms. De La Rosa\u2019s CNN interview fit into a pattern. Over five years, according to court filings, Mr. Jones repeatedly used the segment as a basis for false claims that the shooting was staged.Judge Jenkins noted that \u201cit\u2019s a very interesting question of law\u201d as to whether one can be an \u201cinvoluntary\u201d public figure by dint of suffering a tragedy and publicly speaking about it.Defending oneself against false claims, Mr. Bankston said, does not \u201ctransform you into a public figure.\u201dIn remarks near the end of the hearing, Mr. Enoch denounced negative news coverage of Mr. Jones\u2019s filing seeking more than $100,000 in court costs from the family, should he win dismissal of the case. Instead, he said, Mr. Jones would accept \u201ca dollar.\u201dThe hearing comes as Mr. Jones faces increased scrutiny of the Infowars material he posts on social media. Last week, YouTube removed four of his videos. Facebook also removed his personal page for 30 days.Spotify has been criticized in recent days for hosting the podcast, with some users threatening to cancel their subscriptions if the company did not drop the show.Ben Sisario contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Electric Scooters in New York City? They Just Might Work", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe scooters could be a real help to people trying to get around the city \u2014\u00a0if the mayor gets much more serious about protecting riders.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.So the question for New Yorkers is this: Can the city\u2019s traffic-clogged streets support yet another mode of transportation? Of course they can \u2014\u00a0if, for the safety of everyone, city officials and companies can agree on much-needed changes: more protected bike lanes, better transportation data and enforcement, wider sidewalks, access for low-income users and sensible restrictions. In fact, most of these improvements are already needed. The subway isn\u2019t going to be fixed any time soon \u2014 state lawmakers continue to refuse to pass congestion pricing, the surest way to fund the necessary repairs to get trains running reliably. Even if that weren\u2019t the case, many people live and work in parts of the city that are far from existing train lines, and it\u2019s there that electric bikes and scooters can truly fill a mass transit gap. Used properly, these vehicles are an efficient, affordable option to get such people that last couple of miles between their destination and a subway or ferry stop.But, to be useful, these vehicles also need to get people to their destinations in one piece. Which is why Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration needs to commit to expanding and improving the city\u2019s network of protected bike lanes.So far, scooters \u2014\u00a0or, really, their riders \u2014\u00a0have not universally won over cities where they\u2019ve landed. Yes, both scooters and e-bikes are useful to people who cannot get on a regular bicycle for health or fitness reasons, or who prefer not to arrive at work drenched in sweat. But in certain places, pedestrians have been imperiled by users riding scooters on sidewalks. And that dangerous tendency is only where the complaints begin. First up, the city must ensure that New York doesn\u2019t meet the fate of virtually every city where these vehicles have arrived \u2014 finding\u00a0thousands of scooters haphazardly dumped onto sidewalks one day. Will Bird and others agree to an initial pilot program? Perhaps concentrating first on neighborhoods outside Manhattan that are transit deserts? New York needs more bike lanes that are behind parked cars and other barriers, which shield bikers and scooter riders from traffic and make it harder for cars, vans and trucks to park in them. Bird has pledged to help pay for such improvements through what it calls its Save Our Sidewalks initiative, promising city governments $1 a day per vehicle on their streets. It\u2019s an offer New York shouldn\u2019t refuse, and other scooter and bike rental firms should pony up funds, too. But Mr. de Blasio could help today if he just insisted that city employees not park in bike lanes, and he directed the police to crack down on the misuse of these lanes. Wider sidewalks for pedestrians also would help keep bike lanes unobstructed.There always will be New Yorkers who complain about cyclists \u2014 and, perhaps soon, scooters \u2014 blaming them for ills both real and imagined. But bikes and similar vehicles take up far less public space and are much more environmentally sustainable than cars. If the city is serious about wanting safe, reliable ways for people in all areas of New York to get around, the path ahead is clear.Advertisement"}

Peak-season corn, now in abundance at the farmers\u2019 market and showcased in every grocery store, is at the heart of this easy summer pasta inspired by Mexican street corn.The sauce comes together as the pasta cooks, allowing you to get dinner on the table in about a half-hour. It works beautifully as a main and equally well as a side paired with grilled flank steaks or Italian sausages. It could also play the role of pasta salad if you wanted to serve it at room temperature. It\u2019s hot out there. You choose.Jalape\u00f1o, saut\u00e9ed in an ample amount of butter, provides a subtle, but pleasant kick \u2014 a nice counter to the corn\u2019s sweetness. Readily available feta cheese stands in for traditional queso fresco, which is tossed in near the end of cooking with some of the starchy, salty pasta water. As the feta is stirred in, it starts to melt, creating a silken sauce, while still maintaining some of its crumbly texture.As for the pasta, orecchiette, which translates to \u201clittle ears\u201d in Italian, is worth seeking out not only for the wordplay (\u201cear\u201d of corn), but because it nicely catches the kernels in its shallow cup, making for the perfect bite. If you can\u2019t find it, campanelle or farfalle would work well in its place.Basil is stirred into the pasta right before serving and also showered on top. Herbs are plentiful right now, so use them without restraint; a combination of mint, chives or Italian parsley would also work well.However you choose to serve this dish, the freshest, ripest figs for dessert would be a lovely accompaniment. Choose ones that you can tear apart with your hands. It\u2019s summertime after all, and the living should be easy. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters in Russia Accuse Government of Entrapping Young Critics", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Hundreds of demonstrators walked through downtown Moscow on Wednesday to protest against a growing number of arrests of young Russians on extremism charges for material shared or stored on social media sites.Braving a torrential summer downpour, the demonstrators joined what was called the March of the Mothers. They expressed concern that they could not protect their teenage children against what many consider to be an extensive online entrapment campaign by the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and other security agencies.\u201cFreedom!\u201d protesters chanted repeatedly when they reached the front of the Supreme Court after marching, mostly silently, down the middle of the Boulevard Ring in central Moscow.Aleksei A. Makarov, a bearded, 33-year-old schoolteacher, said entrapping teenagers was reminiscent of the Soviet tactics of the early 1950s, when his own grandmother was arrested at age 17 on accusations of participating in an illegal political group.\u201cThere is an overall course to increase repression, to repress any civic and political activity in the country,\u201d said Mr. Makarov, who was carrying a small stuffed rhinoceros. Many demonstrators carried stuffed animals, especially unicorns, to symbolize that their march was about protecting children.In what has become an increasingly popular tactic given the Moscow city government\u2019s refusal to issue demonstration permits, the event was a \u201cprotest stroll.\u201dParticipants walked in scattered ranks and avoided banners and mostly refrained from chanting to thwart attempts by the police to accuse them of participating in an illegal demonstration. In this case, the police hovered in the background and did not attempt to disrupt the protest.The immediate cause of the demonstration was the arrest in March of two Moscow girls, Anna Pavlikova, 18, and Maria Dubovik, 19, on extremism charges in what has become known as the \u201cNew Greatness\u201d case. Some people are incensed that they are being held without bail while in poor health.According to prosecutors, the girls were part of a small cell that was plotting to overthrow the government. Eight men were also arrested.Last fall, they let an older man join their chat room, and he gradually steered the group into politics, renting an office, buying a printer and drafting an anti-government manifesto. The older man then gave 10 pages of testimony against members of the \u201cNew Greatness\u201d group, but he has never been thoroughly identified in court documents.Defense lawyers and the families think the mysterious witness was an agent of the FSB, the successor agency of the K.G.B.In the hours before the march, officials appealed to the court to move the girls to house arrest, according to Russian news reports, but many marchers dismissed the move as a ploy to get them to stay at home.\u201cIt is an unconscionable case against children, and that is why people are reacting,\u201d Yulia Pavlikova, Anna\u2019s mother, told reporters at the march. \u201cI really hope that they heard us, they saw us and some kind of action has begun. Children should not be in prison, especially when they are not guilty.\u201dMs. Pavlikova and Ms. Dubovik\u2019s mother had earlier made a tape appealing to President Vladimir V. Putin to intercede in the case, wondering aloud if the security services really had nothing better to do than to arrest adolescents.Asked Tuesday about the spread of extremism cases, Dmitri S. Peskov, the spokesman for Mr. Putin, said that some such cases fell \u201cbeyond the bonds of reason.\u201dThose caught up in such cases tend to be dismissive of such remarks from the Kremlin. They noted that both the human rights ombudswoman appointed by Parliament, Tatyana Moskalkova, and the chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Commission, Mikhail Fedotov, had called for the two girls to be let out of jail while awaiting trial and nothing happened.Hundreds of cases based on social media posts have popped up around the country. The number of extremism cases rose to 1,521 last year from 656 in 2010, according to statistics from the prosecutor general\u2019s office.The Russian government first promulgated an anti-extremism law in 2003, as it was fighting a violent Islamist insurgency, especially in the North Caucasus region of the country. Criminalizing online content was added in 2014.The move against teenagers started in earnest in 2017 after young people turned out in significant numbers for the anti-government protests organized by the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, according to lawyers, human rights activists and others.\u201cThe government is fighting dissent \u2014 criticism of the state or of the church is impossible,\u201d said Aleksei Bushmakov, a defense lawyer involved in several provincial cases. \u201cSince young people are concerned about the future of the country, about their own future, they are expressing their displeasure on the internet.\u201dOnce anyone is arrested on such charges, their names are added to a national register of extremists and terrorists, effectively ruining their lives. They often cannot hold jobs, get loans or access bank accounts freely. There is no set punishment; in several high-profile cases the prosecutors are asking for sentences of six years in prison.In one case being defended by Mr. Bushmakov in the Altai Republic in southern Siberia, for example, a student was arrested in connection with pictures on her page on Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, some of which were not even shared. One picture showed participants in a religious procession walking along a road full of potholes and puddles with a caption that said, \u201cTwo of Russia\u2019s biggest problems.\u201dAnother teenager was arrested on charges of insulting the feelings of Russian Orthodox believers, which comes under the extremism law, for a meme from the HBO program \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d that echoed language commonly used about Jesus.\u201cThey want to frighten the young, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Yulia N. Nesterova, 54, a mother of two children at the Moscow march.Follow Neil MacFarquhar and Ivan Nechepurenko on Twitter: @NeilMacFarquhar @INechepurenkoLincoln Pigman and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Employees Protest Secret Work on Censored Search Engine for China", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, employees wrote that the project and Google\u2019s apparent willingness to abide by China\u2019s censorship requirements \u201craise urgent moral and ethical issues.\u201d They added, \u201cCurrently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.\u201dThe letter is circulating on Google\u2019s internal communication systems and is signed by about 1,400 employees, according to three people familiar with the document, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The internal activism presents another obstacle for Google\u2019s potential return to China eight years after the company publicly withdrew from the country in protest of censorship and government hacking. China has the world\u2019s largest internet audience but has frustrated American tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including Facebook and Instagram.\u201cWe urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we\u2019re building,\u201d the letter said.The letter also called on Google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company\u2019s products, to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects. The document referred to the situation as a code yellow, a process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams.Google declined to comment on the letter. It has said in the past that it will not comment on Dragonfly or \u201cspeculation about future plans.\u201dLate on Thursday, employees pressed Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and other management about Dragonfly at a weekly staff meeting. As of late Wednesday, one of the top questions on an internal software system called Dory, which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting, asked whether Google had lost its ethical compass, said people who had reviewed the questions. Other questions on Dory asked directly about the Dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the Chinese government, such as air pollution data.\u201cIf we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in the staff meeting, audio of which was obtained by The Times. \u201cThat said, we are not close to launching a search product in China.\u201dMr. Pichai and Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, stopped answering questions about Dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on Twitter.This week\u2019s staff meeting was the first opportunity for Google\u2019s work force to ask executives about Dragonfly, because the meeting was not held last week. The absence of a gathering \u2014 the result of a regularly scheduled break in the summer, according to a company spokesman, Rob Shilkin \u2014 led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over Google\u2019s government work.Google has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies, inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate.In those principles, Google publicly committed to use A.I. only in \u201csocially beneficial\u201d ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law. Some employees have raised concerns that helping China suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles.In 2010, Google said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company\u2019s corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack, combined with government censorship, propelled Google to pull its search engine from the country.Hundreds of employees at the tech company urged their leadership to be more transparent about its ethics and its use of artificial intelligence.Google\u2019s work on Dragonfly is not a guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to China. The government would have to approve its return and it has kept American technology firms like Facebook at arm\u2019s length, opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths.\u201cYou can never satisfy a censor, particularly the ones in China,\u201d said Charles Mok, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory\u2019s democratic camp.Google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in China, Mr. Mok said, but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted a censored search product in China.\u201cThen the Chinese government can say, \u2018Google is O.K. with it, too,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

An array of tracking scripts were embedded in the site, designed to install snippets of computer code into the browsers of anyone clicking on it, to report their visits or track their movements as they traveled around the web.The trackers were detected last winter during a study by Douglas Levin, a Washington-based expert on educational technology. Asked about them in April, the district expressed surprise and said it would have them removed. But Mr. Levin found 22 trackers when he checked back last month.Trackers are as common on public school websites these days as microbes on a restroom door, to judge by Mr. Levin\u2019s examination of 159 public school websites from among the nation\u2019s largest and most tech-savvy districts. At least some form of ad tracking or online surveillance technology was embedded in all but one of them, he found.Their use is an \u201cindustry-accepted practice,\u201d said Lisa Wolf, the public information officer for Pinellas County Schools, echoing comments by school officials elsewhere.Most trackers are used to help websites work better, by counting page visits or catching problems with broken links. Some are used for promotions, as in Pinellas County, where Ms. Wolf said the trackers spotted in April had been left behind after a school-choice campaign, and others were later added to boost enrollment at a technical college.But some trackers are also designed to recognize visitors by the I.P. address of their device and to embed cookies in their browsers for the advertising practice known as behavioral targeting. And knowingly or otherwise, many school sites are hosting software from third-party companies whose primary business is buying and selling data for the detailed dossiers of personal information on finances, lifestyle and buying habits that advertisers prize. Those third parties may invite still other trackers onto the site, without the school\u2019s knowledge or control.\u201cThere\u2019s a continuum of data collectors, data sharers and data users within this large ecosystem,\u201d said N. Cameron Russell, the center\u2019s executive director, describing it as a \u201chuge invisible world\u201d of shifting business entities of which the public is mostly unaware.

Ms. Wolf said she did not know how it got there. \u201cIt is the district\u2019s expectation that our partners do not sell or misuse web visitor information,\u201d she said.\u201cSince 2013, we\u2019ve had 125 new student privacy laws passed by 39 state legislatures and the District of Columbia,\u201d Ms. Vance said. \u201dWe have almost no funding and almost no training required by most of that legislation.\u201dGoogle and Facebook prohibit collecting or sharing information from children under 13. But Mr. Levin said the integration of free social media into many school websites had still provided a subtle entry point for commercial activity in what parents might assume was a commerce-free zone.Allison Prystupa, president of the Massapequa Council of PTAs, sees Facebook as an essential tool, along with Twitter, Instagram, email and the phone apps Group Me and Remind.Younger parents today \u201cwant that instant information, whatever way they\u2019re going to get it,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t think twice about who\u2019s tracking them.\u201dBut her daughter Jillian, 20, who is studying to be a history teacher at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., said the congressional testimony of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, in April was eye-opening.\u201cI don\u2019t think we realized how much information we were giving out, or where else it could be used,\u201d Jillian Prystupa said. She accepts ad tracking as a \u201cbusiness move,\u201d she said, but the buying and selling of her information is a different story.\u201cI think that if a social media site or a website is going to do that, it has to be in bold letters up front before you sign up for it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to know that whatever you\u2019re giving them can be used by them in whatever way, and then you can make your own decisions.\u201dThis is the third of four new Learning sections being published this year.

{"Headline": "E.P.A. Staff Objected to Agency\u2019s New Rules on Asbestos Use, Internal Emails Show", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe clash over the proposal exposes the tensions within the E.P.A. over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back environmental rules and rewrite other regulations that industries have long fought.Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral and known carcinogen, was once common in insulation and fireproofing materials, but today most developed countries ban it. The United States still allows limited use in products including gaskets, roofing materials and sealants.The proposed new rule would create a new process for regulating uses of asbestos, something the E.P.A. is obliged to do under a 2016 amendment to a toxic substances law.The E.P.A. says it is toughening oversight. However, the way its new rule is written has spawned a spirited debate over whether it will actually make it easier for asbestos to come back into more widespread use. Consumer groups say the agency should be looking for ways to prohibit asbestos entirely.\u201cThe new approach raises significant concerns about the potential health impacts,\u201d wrote Sharon Cooperstein, an E.P.A. policy analyst, in one of the emails. She, along with a veteran E.P.A. scientist and a longtime agency attorney, said the proposal as designed left open the possibility that businesses could start using asbestos in some cases without getting the government\u2019s assessment, putting the public at risk.The asbestos plan, which was introduced with little fanfare in June, stems from the E.P.A.\u2019s responsibility to regulate chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act and fulfill an Obama-era amendment that requires the agency to regularly re-evaluate the harmfulness of toxic materials. Asbestos is the most prominent of the current batch of substances the E.P.A. is deciding how best to regulate in the future.The United States tried to ban asbestos use in the 1970s, but that effort was overturned by the federal courts in 1991. However the ruling did retain a ban on new uses of asbestos. Because of that (and the potential legal liability), use of asbestos declined in the United States.Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts is leading an effort among Democratic state attorneys to fight the asbestos plan, calling it a threat to human health. Exposure to asbestos has been linked to lung cancer, mesothelioma and other ailments.\u201cIn recent years, tens of thousands have died from mesothelioma and other diseases caused by exposure to asbestos and other dangerous chemicals,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Trump administration\u2019s erosion of federal chemical safety rules continues, it will endanger our communities and the health of all Americans.\u201dThe United States no longer mines or manufactures asbestos. Until recently, Brazil had been the source of about 95 percent of all asbestos used in America, according to the E.P.A., but last year that country banned its manufacture and sale. Since then, Russia has stepped in as a supplier.Uralasbest did not respond to a request for comment.The new E.P.A. proposal is called a \u201csignificant new-use rule\u201d that sets out the guidelines for what types of asbestos uses the federal government considers risky enough to evaluate and perhaps restrict or ban.The internal E.P.A. emails indicate that, this year, top E.P.A. officials sought a last-minute change in the language of the rule.\u201cUpper management asked us to take a different approach,\u201d wrote Robert T. Courtnage, an associate chief in E.P.A.\u2019s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, in an April 25 email sent to 13 members of an agency group working on the then-forthcoming proposal. Specifically: Rather than call for all new uses of asbestos to come before the E.P.A. for a risk review, the rule would include just 15 specific uses that would trigger a federal assessment.The list of 15 included a number of specific and relatively common uses for asbestos, including as separators in fuel cells and batteries and as a component in vinyl-asbestos floor tile and high-grade electrical paper.Mr. Courtnage in his email did not identify who had sought the change. He and other E.P.A. officials who wrote the emails did not respond to requests for comment.Critics of the rule argue that limiting the review to 15 uses means other potential uses would avoid examination.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.\u201cThis is presuming there\u2019s nothing under the sun you could ever do with asbestos other than these 15 things,\u201d said Betsy Southerland, former director of the E.P.A.\u2019s office of science and technology, in an interview. Ms. Southerland resigned from E.P.A. last year over the Trump administration\u2019s leadership of the agency and is working on opposing the asbestos rule and others for the Environmental Protection Network, a group of agency alumni.Narrowing the list to 15 potential uses took E.P.A. scientists and lawyers by surprise, the emails indicate. Three staff members argued in the emails that the agency could not anticipate all future uses of asbestos, and therefore risked letting some uses take place without being weighed for safety risks.Under the E.P.A.\u2019s approach, if the agency \u201cfailed to correctly anticipate some other new use, then it seems to me that the manufacture of such a product would not be subject to\u201d the new-use rule, wrote Susan Fairchild, an environmental scientist who has worked at the agency since 1991.\u201cAsbestos is an extremely dangerous substance with no safe exposure amount,\u201d Mark Seltzer, an attorney who has been with E.P.A. more than a decade, noted in another emailA spokesman for the E.P.A., James Hewitt, said the emails indicated staff and other members of the working group on asbestos \u201cdid not fully understand the proposal being developed.\u201dIn a telephone interview this week, Nancy B. Beck, the E.P.A.\u2019s deputy assistant administrator in the agency\u2019s chemical safety office, said the rules would to restrict and perhaps even ban some uses of asbestos where no means of doing so currently exist. \u201cObviously someone out there thinks we are increasing exposure to asbestos when we are doing the opposite,\u201d she said.The American Chemistry Council has not weighed in directly on the proposed asbestos rule.Ms. Beck said that, since there is no ban on asbestos, no regulatory process currently exists to stop a company that chooses to put it in something like flooring or roofing materials. But under the rule, some of those ways of employing asbestos \u2014 which had over the decades become less common \u2014 would now be considered a significant new use. That will force companies to notify the E.P.A. and face an evaluate the risks.\u201cIf you want to put asbestos in flooring materials you have to come to us first and we have to do a thorough risk evaluation and approve it,\u201d she said. \u201cOr we simply prohibit it.\u201dAsked why the rule specified 15 uses instead of applying to all prospective uses, Ms. Beck said the agency was confident it had included all foreseeable uses of asbestos. \u201cWe think we have identified all of the potential possible uses that are out there and could come back into manufacturing,\u201d Ms. Beck said. \u201cThe universe is covered.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We\u2019ve also added taps.\u201dMaple Day was certainly cause for celebration, but the activity continues year-round.At the rate they\u2019re going, Ms. Thomas said, New York\u2019s maple producers hope to catch up with Vermont.

{"Headline": "A Blended Family: Her Mother Was Neanderthal, Her Father Something Else Entirely", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterGenetic analysis of bones discovered in a Siberian cave hints that the prehistoric world may have been filled with \u201chybrid\u201d humans.The 90,000-year-old bone fragment came from a female whose mother was Neanderthal, according to an analysis of DNA discovered inside it. But her father was not: He belonged to another branch of ancient humanity known as the Denisovans.Scientists have been recovering genomes from ancient human fossils for just over a decade. Now, with the discovery of a Neanderthal-Denisovan hybrid, the world as it was tens of thousands of years ago is coming into remarkable new focus: home to a marvelous range of human diversity.Scientists can\u2019t yet say what Denisovans looked like or how they behaved, but it\u2019s clear they were separated from Neanderthals and modern humans by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.Until now, scientists had indirect clues that Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans interbred, at least a few times. But the new study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, offers clear evidence. \u201cThey managed to catch it in the act \u2014 it\u2019s an amazing discovery,\u201d said Sharon Browning, a statistical geneticist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the new study.What makes the discovery all the more remarkable is that scientists didn\u2019t have to look all that long to find a hybrid. Until today, scientists had discovered only four Denisovans; the fifth turned out to be a first-generation hybrid. The discovery in 2010 of the first Denisovan fossil (called Denisova 3) spurred Russian researchers to carry out a more systematic exploration of the cave floor. It is littered with bone fragments, deposited in sedimentary layers. Denisovans appeared later, and from the fossils alone it was hard for scientists to know if Denisovans and Neanderthals had ever come into contact. But their DNA hinted at one union, at least: Denisova 3\u2019s genome, researchers discovered, contained traces of Neanderthal DNA.The newly discovered hybrid came to the attention of Dr. Paabo\u2019s team in 2014, when Russian collaborators sent his team 2,000 badly damaged bone fragments from the cave.\u201cYou can\u2019t even tell if they\u2019re human or animal,\u201d Dr. Paabo said in an interview. He and his colleagues extracted collagen from the bones and compared the protein to that of living species. Only one fragment had collagen that resembled our own.That fragment came from an arm or leg bone \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to say which. The bone is thick, which means that it belonged to someone at least 13 years old.Viviane Slon, then a graduate student at the institute, led a search for DNA in the fragment. She began by hunting for a special set of genes found in the fuel-generating factories of the cell, called mitochondria. Mitochondria carry a set of genes distinct from those of the cell\u2019s nucleus; these genes, unlike those in the nucleus, are inherited solely from the mother. The researchers called that individual Denisova 11, and they began searching the bone for nuclear DNA. Fragment by fragment, they began reconstructing the entire genome. Strangely, only some of the fragments of nuclear DNA matched Neanderthal genes. There was just as much Denisovan DNA in the bone.\u201cI was wondering, \u2018What did I do wrong?\u2019\u201d recalled Dr. Slon, now a postdoctoral researcher at the institute.In each pair of chromosomes, one came from a Neanderthal, the other from a Denisovan. This individual, she and her colleagues concluded, was a hybrid. \u201cIt was a good proof that this was real,\u201d she said.An examination of the X chromosome showed that Denisova 11 was female. As for which parent was which, the mitochondrial DNA held the answer: Since these genes are only passed down from mothers, Denisova 11\u2019s mother was Neanderthal. Her Denisovan father\u2019s kin were local, it turned out. His DNA most closely resembles the genetic material from Denisova 3\u2019s pinky, discovered at the cave in 2010. She lived in the cave a few thousand years after Denisova 11, the hybrid human.Her Neanderthal mother, however, was closely related to Neanderthals who lived thousands of miles to the west in what is now Croatia, 20,000 years after Denisova 11 died. She was only distantly related to the Neanderthals who lived in the cave 120,000 years ago. \u201cIt seems like Neanderthals were moving around quite a bit,\u201d said Dr. Browning. Dr. Paabo said it\u2019s not possible to figure out why the Neanderthals traveled, or when, until more genomes are discovered.Despite interbreeding, Neanderthals and Denisovans never merged into a single genetic population. For hundreds of thousands of years, they remained distinct.It\u2019s possible they simply didn\u2019t have much opportunity to mate because they lived in small groups spread out across a vast landscape, Dr. Paabo suggested. \u201cThey didn\u2019t meet that often, but when they met they seemed to not have prejudices against each other and mixed freely,\u201d he said.It\u2019s also possible that hybrids suffered from reproductive disorders, having fewer children than humans without mixed DNA. Our own DNA provides evidence that those early modern humans interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans. People with non-African ancestry have fragments of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes, and Denisovan DNA is present in East Asians, Aboriginal Australians and other populations. Dr. Paabo wonders if it\u2019s a coincidence that these branches of humanity vanished from the fossil record shortly after modern humans showed up in their territories. Neanderthals disappear from the fossil record 40,000 years ago. Evidence from the Siberian cave indicates that Denisovans were gone by then, too. \u201cMaybe Neanderthals and Denisovans were absorbed into the modern human populations,\u201d said Dr. Paabo. \u201cThat could be a big part of the story.\u201d Advertisement"}

It gave workers a larger commuter stipend, as well as a reason to avoid the office altogether: \u201cfur-ternity leave,\u201d or the ability to work from home for a week to welcome new dogs or cats.\u201cThis is kind of a no-brainer,\u201d said Allison McMenimen, a vice president at the company, Nina Hale, who helped devise the new policy. \u201cThe idea of offering benefits that just help keep employees at the office, that\u2019s over.\u201dIn recent decades, many companies in the United States have overhauled their perks in an effort to retain employees and entice new recruits. Tech giants like Facebook and Google have gone further, providing gourmet meals in cafeterias, gyms at work and day cares on site.Connor McCarthy, a senior account manager at Nina Hale, was the latest employee there to seek permission to work from home with a new pet.In May, Mr. McCarthy was finalizing the adoption of a goldendoodle puppy named Bentley. Mr. McCarthy, 26, said he had read a lot about the pitfalls of helping a dog adjust to a new environment.\u201cIt can be a stressful situation going from its original home to a new home,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Worried about Bentley, then just 2 months old, being home alone, Mr. McCarthy sent a request to his boss and Ms. McMenimen: Could he work from home the first week to help Bentley get used to his new surroundings, including a kennel, and learn to go to the bathroom outside?He received a response almost immediately. Absolutely, they said.That first week, Mr. McCarthy worked from his apartment in Richfield, a Minneapolis suburb, with Bentley by his side. Bentley also spent some hours of the day in a kennel, getting used to a closed environment. About every hour, he took a trip outside to go to the bathroom.Even with his owner watching closely, Bentley had a few accidents in the house. But Mr. McCarthy noted that Bentley \u2014 a mix between a golden retriever and a poodle, which are thought to be two of the smartest breeds \u2014 was a quick learner.\u201cIt was really, really nice to be there while I\u2019m working to transition him,\u201d said Mr. McCarthy, who was working from home on Monday, with Bentley at his feet.In a workplace of 85 employees, a handful of people at Nina Hale in recent years had requested the ability to work from home after getting a new cat or dog, Ms. McMenimen said. She said the company began considering making it a formal benefit in May, after the request from Mr. McCarthy. The policy was officially unveiled in July.\u201cFor a lot of people, their pets are their children,\u201d said Ms. McMenimen, who is also considering getting a pet. \u201cOur employees are at all different stages of their lives.\u201dNearly three months after Mr. McCarthy got his dog, Bentley is potty-trained and socializes well with others at the dog park in his apartment complex. \u201cThat first week is crucial,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Nossos sonhos de nos transformarmos em um dos pa\u00edses mais pr\u00f3speros e democr\u00e1ticos do mundo pareciam amea\u00e7ados. A ideia de que um dia nossos cidad\u00e3os poderiam desfrutar dos padr\u00f5es de vida confort\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bde nossos colegas na Europa ou em outras democracias ocidentais parecia estar desaparecendo. Menos de duas d\u00e9cadas ap\u00f3s o fim da ditadura, algumas feridas daquele per\u00edodo ainda estavam cruas.O Partido dos Trabalhadores ofereceu esperan\u00e7a, uma alternativa que poderia mudar essas tend\u00eancias. Por essa raz\u00e3o, mais que qualquer outra, vencemos nas urnas em 2002. Tornei-me o primeiro l\u00edder trabalhista a ser eleito presidente do Brasil. Inicialmente, o mercado financeiro se abalou; mas o crescimento econ\u00f4mico que seguiu tranquilizou o mercado. Nos anos seguintes, os governos do Partido dos Trabalhadores que chefiei reduziram a pobreza em mais da metade em apenas oito anos. Nos meus dois mandatos, o sal\u00e1rio m\u00ednimo aumentou 50%. Nosso programa Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, que auxiliou fam\u00edlias pobres ao mesmo tempo em que garantiu que as crian\u00e7as recebessem educa\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade, ganhou renome internacional. N\u00f3s provamos que combater a pobreza era uma boa pol\u00edtica econ\u00f4mica.Ent\u00e3o este progresso foi interrompido. N\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s das urnas, embora o Brasil tenha elei\u00e7\u00f5es livres e justas. Em vez disso, a presidente Dilma Rousseff sofreu impeachment e foi destitu\u00edda do cargo por uma a\u00e7\u00e3o que at\u00e9 mesmo seus oponentes admitiram n\u00e3o ser uma ofensa imput\u00e1vel. Depois, eu fui mandado para a pris\u00e3o, por um julgamento question\u00e1vel de acusa\u00e7\u00f5es de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o e lavagem de dinheiro.Meu encarceramento foi a \u00faltima fase de um golpe em c\u00e2mera lenta destinado a marginalizar permanentemente as for\u00e7as progressistas no Brasil. Pretende-se impedir que o Partido dos Trabalhadores seja novamente eleito para a presid\u00eancia. Com todas as pesquisas mostrando que eu venceria facilmente as elei\u00e7\u00f5es de outubro, a extrema direita do Brasil est\u00e1 tentando me tirar da disputa. Minha condena\u00e7\u00e3o e pris\u00e3o s\u00e3o baseadas somente no testemunho de uma pessoa, cuja pr\u00f3pria senten\u00e7a foi reduzida em troca do que ele disse contra mim. Em outras palavras, era do seu interesse pessoal dizer \u00e0s autoridades o que elas queriam ouvir.As for\u00e7as de direita que tomaram o poder no Brasil n\u00e3o perderam tempo na implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de sua agenda. A administra\u00e7\u00e3o profundamente impopular do presidente Michel Temer aprovou uma emenda constitucional que estabelece um limite de 20 anos para os gastos p\u00fablicos e promulgou v\u00e1rias mudan\u00e7as nas leis trabalhistas que facilitar\u00e3o a terceiriza\u00e7\u00e3o e enfraquecer\u00e3o os direitos de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o dos trabalhadores, e at\u00e9 mesmo seu direito a uma jornada de oito horas de trabalho. O governo Temer tamb\u00e9m tentou fazer cortes na Previd\u00eancia.Os conservadores do Brasil est\u00e3o trabalhando muito para reverter o progresso dos governos do Partido dos Trabalhadores, e eles est\u00e3o determinados a nos impedir de voltar ao cargo no futuro pr\u00f3ximo. Seu aliado nesse esfor\u00e7o \u00e9 o juiz S\u00e9rgio Moro e sua equipe de promotores, que recorreram a grava\u00e7\u00f5es e vazamentos de conversas telef\u00f4nicas particulares que tive com minha fam\u00edlia e com meu advogado, incluindo um grampo ilegal. Eles criaram um show para a m\u00eddia quando me levaram para depor \u00e0 for\u00e7a, me acusando de ser o \u201cmentor\u201d de um vasto esquema de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o. Esses detalhes aterradores raramente s\u00e3o relatados na grande m\u00eddia.Moro tem sido celebrado pela m\u00eddia de direita do Brasil. Ele se tornou intoc\u00e1vel. Mas a verdadeira quest\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 o Sr. Moro; s\u00e3o aqueles que o elevaram a esse status de intoc\u00e1vel: elites de direita, neoliberais, que sempre se opuseram \u00e0 nossa luta por maior justi\u00e7a social e igualdade no Brasil.Eu n\u00e3o acredito que a maioria dos brasileiros aprove essa agenda elitista. \u00c9 por isso que, embora eu possa estar na cadeia hoje, eu estou concorrendo \u00e0 presid\u00eancia. E por isso que as pesquisas mostram que se as elei\u00e7\u00f5es fossem realizadas hoje, eu venceria. Milh\u00f5es de brasileiros entendem que minha pris\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem nada a ver com corrup\u00e7\u00e3o, e eles entendem que eu estou onde estou apenas por raz\u00f5es pol\u00edticas.Eu n\u00e3o me preocupo comigo mesmo. J\u00e1 estive preso antes, sob a ditadura militar do Brasil, por nada mais do que defender os direitos dos trabalhadores. Essa ditadura caiu. As pessoas que est\u00e3o abusando de seu poder hoje tamb\u00e9m cair\u00e3o.Eu n\u00e3o pe\u00e7o para estar acima da lei, mas um julgamento deve ser justo e imparcial. Essas for\u00e7as de direita me condenaram, me prenderam, ignoraram a esmagadora evid\u00eancia de minha inoc\u00eancia e me negaram Habeas Corpus apenas para tentar me impedir de concorrer \u00e0 presid\u00eancia. Eu pe\u00e7o respeito pela democracia. Se eles querem me derrotar de verdade, fa\u00e7am nas elei\u00e7\u00f5es. Segundo a Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira, o poder vem do povo, que elege seus representantes. Ent\u00e3o, deixe o povo brasileiro decidir.

{"Headline": "Transgender Girl, 12, Is Violently Threatened After Facebook Post by Classmate\u2019s Parent", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 12-year-old transgender student in a small Oklahoma town near the Texas border was targeted in an inflammatory social media post by the parents of a classmate, leading to violent threats and driving officials to close the school for two days.It all started on Facebook. Jamie Crenshaw, whose children attend public schools in the town, Achille, complained in a private Facebook group for students\u2019 parents that the transgender girl, Maddie, was using a bathroom for girls.Maddie usually uses one of the faculty restrooms. But on Aug. 8, her first day in seventh grade, she used the girls\u2019 bathroom because she was in a new building and didn\u2019t yet know where the faculty bathrooms were, said her mother, Brandy Rose, who asked that her daughter\u2019s last name not be identified.Maddie said that she was now afraid to sleep alone at night \u2014 but that even though she\u2019s scared, she wants to stay in public school.\u201cI\u2019m going to keep my head held up high and stay strong and go to school,\u201d she said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cAnd won\u2019t let those bullies drag me down.\u201dBurney Crenshaw, Ms. Crenshaw\u2019s husband, shared a screenshot of her post on his Facebook page, which is also no longer visible online, generating hundreds of additional comments, Ms. Rose said.\u201cYou would expect children to bully other children,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are adults bullying a child and threatening a child and they\u2019re claiming to be doing it in the name of God.\u201dShe added, \u201cHow in the world is that Christlike?\u201dOne man, whose profile picture showed a family, wrote: \u201cLet Parker whip his ass until he quits coming to school.\u201d People reacted to the post 16 times with the like button and the laughing emoji.A website that aims to stop hate crimes documented several other posts and published the personal information of individual posters. One man called for castration with \u201ca good sharp knife.\u201d Another suggested telling other children to beat the girl up in the bathroom so \u201cit won\u2019t want to come back!\u201dIt was unclear how many of the offensive comments were from Achille residents. Most of them appeared to be from people who live outside the county, said Sheriff Johnny Christian of the Bryan County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which is investigating the episode.\u201cSo far I\u2019ve seen a lot of support for Maddie,\u201d Sheriff Christian said of the community, but he added that a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of the reaction had been negative. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking this very serious.\u201dMs. Rose obtained an order of protection against Mr. Crenshaw after she said he blocked her in the road on Friday morning and \u201cverbally assaulted\u201d her about Maddie, shortly after they dropped their children off at school. Earlier this year, she said, Mr. Crenshaw confronted Ms. Rose\u2019s husband at a father-daughter dance that he had attended with Maddie.At Sheriff Christian\u2019s suggestion, Achille Public Schools shut down on Monday and Tuesday as a preventive measure to protect children in the event of big protests. Small demonstrations both supporting and opposing transgender rights were held on Tuesday, and the schools reopened on Wednesday.\u201cWhat we decided is that we need to be more educated,\u201d Mr. Beene said. \u201cNot so much for anything that we did as a staff but for what we didn\u2019t do.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the basics here \u2014 did Jesus want to protect children?\u201d Mr. Beene said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201dIn Oklahoma, \u201call transgender people are invisible to the law,\u201d said Paula S. Schonauer, a retired police officer and longtime activist on behalf of transgender people in the state. Transgender students depend on the individual policies of school districts to address their needs.Lisa DelCol, a board member for the Oklahoma City chapter of Pflag, a group for the families of L.G.B.T. people, wrote a letter to the Achille school district urging it to publicly denounce the violent Facebook comments.Fear of others, she said, is part of what drives such vitriol. \u201cThere\u2019s such an us versus them mentality in this nation,\u201d Ms. DelCol, who is the mother of a transgender teenager, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cI will tell you as a parent, this is terrifying.\u201d\u201cWords really matter,\u201d she added. \u201cThey\u2019re powerful and we can use them for good or we can use them to tear each other down.\u201dMs. Crenshaw\u2019s original post set off commenters in part because she accused Maddie of \u201clooking over the stalls in the girls bathroom\u201d \u2014 referring to the period of time before the school arranged for Maddie to use the faculty restrooms.

She hadn\u2019t intended to be publicly open about being transgender, Ms. Rose said. Then, last week, Maddie was pushed into the national spotlight.\u201cShe has no choice now,\u201d she added.Members of Maddie\u2019s church have been checking in on her since the threatening messages were posted online, Ms. Rose said.Out of everyone in their family, Maddie is the most religious, she said, and \u201cprays for people she doesn\u2019t even know.\u201d\u201cWe call her our prayer warrior,\u201d Ms. Rose said. \u201cAll these people are saying she needs Jesus.

{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India\u2019s big outsourcing companies.India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said.\u201cIt requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. Aghi said. \u201cThese companies are creating jobs.\u201dAjay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules.\u201cOur framework will be fair to all stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Millions of Frequent Flier Miles Are Donated to Reunite Families Separated at Border", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the morning of Aug. 6, a law professor at the University of Michigan wrote a tweet about a family that had been separated by immigration authorities after crossing into the United States.Then the professor, Beth Wilensky, went for a run. Then she ate some lunch.\u201cI came back and checked my Twitter feed and said, \u2018Oh my goodness,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wilensky recalled. Her post was blowing up, on its way to getting tens of thousands of retweets.Ms. Wilensky said she was seized by a desire to do something. She joined online communities of people who felt the same \u2014 citizens busy with day jobs and families of their own, now bound by Twitter threads, Reddit groups and Facebook pages.But faced with the daunting and sometimes inscrutable bureaucracy of immigration policy and enforcement, many people wondered how best they could help.The tweet appeared to strike a chord.Michigan Support Circle coalesced about six weeks ago to support migrant families affected by the administration\u2019s policy, said Rosalie Lochner, a founder of the group.\u201cI think a lot of people across both sides of the aisle believe that families need to be protected, and that the trauma of separating these families is something that, as citizens, we are responsible for,\u201d she said. After seeing the tweet, people from across the country reached out to the group on social media, asking how they could help.Andy Freedman, a founder of that nonprofit, quickly noticed that something was up on Monday. There were more visitors to the website. A few more inquiries. A small spike in donations. He wondered if the extra attention was the result of some new campaign or a smart social media post.It was, it turned out, the tweet from Ms. Wilensky, a stranger in Michigan. On that Monday alone, Mr. Freedman said, his organization received pledges of over one million miles. That number has now ballooned to more than 28 million.It is a time-consuming and \u201cdorky\u201d hobby, said Seth Stanton, a founding member of Miles4Migrants, which coalesced after one member of the Reddit group, Nick Ruiz, shared a story about using his air miles to help reunite a Pakistani family.But this week, flush with more than 28 million newly donated frequent flier miles, the organization is thinking about how to tackle the logistics of reuniting families in the United States.The group\u2019s overall mission is not really about American politics, and that won\u2019t change now, Mr. Freedman said. \u201cWe\u2019re about reuniting families,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we do that is fairly simple. We help them with a flight.\u201dSo far, Miles4Migrants has booked two flights for migrants within the United States. Mr. Stanton said that while the logistics and the bureaucracy are daunting, they hope to do more and are looking for partner organizations, including airlines, to help them do it, as well as cash to cover the fees and taxes associated with flights.Michigan Support Circle is working with Miles4Migrants to arrange flights as needed, but it, too, is in need of more than just miles, Ms. Lochner said. The organization helps families in whatever way it can, for example by donating home goods or facilitating medical care.But Ms. Lochner said the extra attention has been encouraging. \u201cI\u2019m so impressed by how much people want to be involved, and how willing people are to help in whatever way they can,\u201d she said.Ms. Wilensky still wonders why her post was so effective and why the idea of frequent flier miles donations held such appeal for thousands and thousands of strangers.\u201cI think a lot of people out there, like my husband and I, have watched all of this unfold \u2014 this family separation policy \u2014 with a sense of absolute horror,\u201d she said. \u201cI think a lot of people felt like we did, which is, \u2018Oh my gosh, here\u2019s something real and concrete that might help to fix this problem, even if it\u2019s just for one family.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

At 3 years old, he was told he was on the autism spectrum. \u201cI wanted to better understand how he sees the world and get a better sense of who he is as a person transitioning from youth into adulthood,\u201d she said. Ms. Lefevre, 25, started shooting her brother, now 18, more than four years ago. When she started sharing photos of Liam with her peers or editors, she would often face stereotypical notions of what mental health conditions \u201clook like.\u201d  \u201cA common response was: \u2018It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s anything wrong with him,\u2019\u201d Ms. Lefevre said. \u201cI just really wanted to emphasize that mental health isn\u2019t about how someone looks. It\u2019s a state of mind.\u201d Photographing a state of mind would prove difficult. How can one visualize a disorder associated with impaired communication, social skills and repetitive behaviors? After giving it some thought, Ms. Lefevre asked Liam to write down an observation or memory alongside each photo to explain how he felt in the moment. \u201cI really wanted to bring that element into it because people who are marginalized or underrepresented within the media, far too often they don\u2019t have the opportunity to speak for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir voices are silenced.\u201d By allowing Liam to share his thoughts, the photo essay captures the complexity of the autism spectrum disorder. Liam\u2019s disability affects some of his intellectual capabilities. But it doesn\u2019t define his personality. \u201cIn a lot of ways, he\u2019s just like any other teenager,\u201d Ms. Lefevre said. \u201cHe likes to push buttons sometimes. He can be a bit cheeky.\u201d (In a photo of himself visiting his grandmother, Liam wrote, \u201cWhenever my mom gives me a hard time I tell her she is just like her mother.\u201d) A seemingly trivial image of Liam passing through a subway turnstile hints at the type of struggles he faces. While Ms. Lefevre took the train to and from school by herself at age 13, her brother isn\u2019t allowed to commute on his own yet. In a detail shot, Liam is trying to solve a math problem in which a quarter is subtracted from a dollar. His answer: 85 cents. The photo isn\u2019t merely about a single homework assignment. It conveys the idea that, though Liam is an adult, he doesn\u2019t understand the value of a dollar and often needs supervision when handling money. The project has helped Ms. Lefevre better understand her brother, and it has also allowed him to reflect on his own questions and insecurities. When Ms. Lefevre posted some of the images on social media, Liam was a bit hesitant about having his life laid bare. He once sent his sister a text message saying, \u201cI can be a little ashamed sometimes that I have autism.\u201d Those worries led to long, constructive conversations. Ms. Lefevre told Liam that adding his insight could enlighten others and show that his condition is just one aspect of his identity. After all, she faced her own misgivings. \u201cWhen it\u2019s family, it\u2019s personal,\u201d Ms. Lefevre said. But as the project progressed, she sat down with her relatives and explained her creative process. \u201cI\u2019ve made my intentions very clear that photography is something that really helps me understand the world.\u201dNow Liam and his parents are more at ease with the work, and Erin herself feels more confident in sharing it after having Liam contribute. He\u2019s no longer just a subject; he\u2019s also a collaborator. Ms. Lefevre hopes other families who have relatives with special needs can \u201csee pieces of themselves\u201d in the images. And regardless of which direction her career takes, she says she is determined to document her brother\u2019s story for as long as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a project that I think can go on for essentially his entire life.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Our Blind Spots Often Hide the Truth About America ", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResponding to readers, the author of a recent Op-Ed about \u201cTrump Country\u201d says that we must remain vigilant against easy, reductive frameworks and labels. Ms. Smarsh is the author of the forthcoming \u201cHeartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.\u201d The speed with which this happened was both startling and disturbing. Our friendly conversation was wiped out in a matter of seconds by her swift application of labels \u2014 her own self-identification, and to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Not everyone is so open-minded. The weaponization of terms such as \u201cfeminist,\u201d \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201csocialist\u201d \u2014 and thus the vilification of those who claim those labels \u2014 has long been a successful pillar of strategies to preserve power. Labels always oversimplify, but at their worst they dehumanize: \u201cillegals\u201d or any racial epithet. You are right to be disturbed by the negative charge with which your acquaintance said \u201cthat socialist.\u201d Diminishing a perceived opponent or an inconvenient fact through name-calling \u2014 say, \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 is a hallmark of the current Republican administration, but dangerous labels work in all directions. Envisioning a \u201cred state\u201d as a field of \u201cdeplorables\u201d leads some self-righteous liberals to say those states \u201cget what they deserve\u201d \u2014 as though everyone suffering for lack of Medicaid expansion voted for their conservative state officials, as though everyone even gets to vote. In most states, the losing political party receives 30 to 40 percent of the vote. Those millions of people, along with the disenfranchised, are no more represented by their state administrations than liberals nationally are represented by our current president. Calling their home \u201cTrump country\u201d is thus a childish misnomer. Labels even err when self-ascribed. Into my early 20s, I inaccurately called myself \u201cconservative\u201d with little understanding of what that meant. One of the most destructive assumptions we make in political discourse is that people\u2019s parties and votes align with their beliefs. In fact, a better indicator of political behavior is one\u2019s place, culture and social group \u2014 things we\u2019re born into, by no virtue or fault of our own.Productive dialogue requires that we set aside our assumptions about other people and places and refuse to reduce them to labels \u2014 even ones that they themselves embrace. We must remain vigilant against easy, reductive frameworks, perhaps especially those that appeal to our own biases. I am certain, however, that some of the white students in my hometown who loved their individual brown peers harbored racist views about those minorities as a group. Similarly, my father\u2019s positive working relationship and friendships with laborers of color does not preclude him from racist thoughts or actions. While we work toward systemic justice and integration, we can strive at the individual level to break free from our proverbial bubbles. My humble attempt at this involves attending public events, celebrations and church services in communities outside my own, and following and reading people of color, whose wisdom for answering your question likely exceeds mine.Q: Are white racial grievances deciding factors for higher-earning Trump supporters as well, just more easily hidden in their votes for a tax cut?However, your response is misplaced here. You seem to be responding, as did a number of commenters, as though I wrote a piece about \u201cTrump voters\u201d \u2014 a group that has, by my estimation, enjoyed too much attention. I wrote instead about people like my white, working-class family who are presumed, based on their place and identity, to be Trump supporters but are, in fact, something else \u2014 apathetic or disenfranchised nonvoters, Democrats, newly minted democratic socialists, independents and even moderate Republicans. As I wrote, \u201cI am far less interested in calls for empathy toward struggling white Americans who spout or abide hatred than I am in tapping into the political power of those who don\u2019t.\u201d Yet from another comment recommended more than 1,300 times: \u201cTo the author: If your father and good people like him hate unfair power, corporations and bosses that exploit workers, then wouldn\u2019t supporting Trump be against their own interests?\u201d To which I answer, yes, it would. That\u2019s why the people I wrote about don\u2019t do that.Q: Does the term \u201celite\u201d get misused and applied too broadly, just as \u201cworking class\u201d often is?However, objections to valid class critiques \u2014 feeling outraged when working-class people express their grievances toward wealth without pausing to point out all the virtuous people who possess it \u2014 often strike me as the class equivalent of whites accusing people of color of reverse racism, or men accusing feminists of misandry. The prevailing narratives of our media and culture operate in service to those male, white or financially comfortable people who claim equal offense. So we must listen with particular concern to the protests of those for whom inaccurate portrayals represent not just distasteful generalizations but economic and even mortal danger. If articulating that injustice comes with an edge of anger, well, try being on the losing end of a narrative every day of your life and see how patient it makes your language.My piece uses the term in question once: \u201cElite pundits regularly misuse \u2018working class\u2019 as shorthand for right-wing white guys wearing tool belts.\u201d Here I am describing political commentators who hold the immense privilege of being called upon for their opinions in national media. That is, by definition, an elite platform, and its rarefied stature is relevant to my discussion of classist narratives. I\u2019m not generalizing but rather specifying a real power structure in our country. My piece names disparate information sources among the electorate as one of the most overlooked influences on political ideologies, party identification and voting habits. I have spent much of my career developing strategies to counteract that civic media crisis. It\u2019s one reason that I still live in my home state of Kansas rather than a major media center \u2014 a sense of responsibility to live in the place I write. Coastal media is often criticized for inadequate \u201cparachute journalism\u201d into Middle America, but it shouldn\u2019t be New York\u2019s job to understand Nebraska. Nebraska understands Nebraska. I am sure that state is teeming with qualified journalists who still have local contacts and understandings, who were laid off in the last 15 years, and who would gladly report for duty if someone paid them to do so. Until then, as you say, people there and in so many places are left with wildly biased and polarized social media \u201csilos,\u201d national outlets that rarely mention their home, and \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky \u2014 cash-strapped local outlets for their information. For those in rural America, I know firsthand, the resulting sense of not just isolation but misrepresentation and even invisibility is profound. That\u2019s shifted some in the last few years, but now when they\u2019re written about, it\u2019s all Trump or opioids or economic despair. There\u2019s a lot more to those communities. There\u2019s joy, heroic community problem-solving and even some Democrats. To remain unseen and unheard in national conversation is an invalidation. It\u2019s no surprise that some might be suspicious of \u201cthe media\u201d and vulnerable to messaging that journalists aren\u2019t trustworthy. As for my dad, he believes his best news source is folks on the ground \u2014 his fellow construction workers on job sites, locals in line at gas stations and, as he traverses the Midwest and South for the next job, cashiers he chats up at the grocery store. He makes a point of asking them what\u2019s going on in their communities and what they think about current events, and he shares his information in kind. Even with a daughter for a journalist, he most prizes stories straight from the mouths of those who live them. So do I. As he put it when I asked him, \u201cI get my news from the people I talk to, not Sean Hannity.\u201d I am a queer theologian, a single mother of two who works three jobs and, like most New Yorkers, struggles every month to pay the exorbitant rent. I am nearly desperate for a movement to take hold along the lines Ms. Smarsh describes: Those of us who struggle refusing to be duped by the powerful and wealthy forces that pit us against one another for their own gain, seeing one another as we really are, as we really struggle, as we really hope and dream for a better life, for all of us. For that reason, I\u2019ll tamp down my visceral reaction to the unfortunate word \u201celite.\u201d Ms. Smarsh, thank you for this eloquent piece. We have more in common than even you may know, and I hope we can keep building that mutual understanding. Q: What would you say to those who feel hidden behind a label?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dozens at Facebook Unite to Challenge Its \u2018Intolerant\u2019 Liberal Culture", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The post went up quietly on Facebook\u2019s internal message board last week. Titled \u201cWe Have a Problem With Political Diversity,\u201d it quickly took off inside the social network.\u201cWe are a political monoculture that\u2019s intolerant of different views,\u201d Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, wrote in the post, which was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cWe claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack \u2014 often in mobs \u2014 anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.\u201dSince the post went up, more than 100 Facebook employees have joined Mr. Amerige to form an online group called FB\u2019ers for Political Diversity, according to two people who viewed the group\u2019s page and who were not authorized to speak publicly. The aim of the initiative, according to Mr. Amerige\u2019s memo, is to create a space for ideological diversity within the company.The new group has upset other Facebook employees, who said its online posts were offensive to minorities. One engineer, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said several people had lodged complaints with their managers about FB\u2019ers for Political Diversity and were told that it had not broken any company rules.Another employee said the group appeared to be constructive and inclusive of different political viewpoints. Mr. Amerige did not respond to requests for comment.The activity is a rare sign of organized dissent within Facebook over the company\u2019s largely liberal workplace culture. While the new group is just a sliver of Facebook\u2019s work force of more than 25,000, the company\u2019s workers have in the past appeared less inclined than their peers at other tech companies to challenge leadership, and most have been loyalists to its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.Within Facebook, several employees said, people have argued over the decisions to ban certain accounts while allowing others. At staff meetings, they said, some workers have repeatedly asked for more guidance on what content the company disallows, and why. Others have said Facebook, out of fear of being seen as biased, has let too many right-wing groups flourish on the site.The dispute over employees\u2019 political ideology arose a week before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing about social media manipulation in elections. A team helping Ms. Sandberg get ready for the hearing next Wednesday has warned her that some Republican lawmakers may raise questions about Facebook and biases, according to two people involved in the preparations.Those companies \u201cbetter be careful because you can\u2019t do that to people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.\u201dA senior Facebook engineer wrote an internal message about what he described as the company\u2019s \u201cmonoculture.\u201dFacebook has long been viewed as a predominantly liberal company. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have donated to Democratic politicians, for example, and have supported issues such as immigration reform.Mr. Amerige, who started working at Facebook in 2012, said on his personal website that he followed philosophical principles laid out by the philosopher and writer Ayn Rand. He posted the 527-word memo about political diversity at Facebook on Aug. 20.On issues like diversity and immigration, he wrote, \u201cyou can either keep quiet or sacrifice your reputation and career.\u201dMr. Amerige proposed that Facebook employees debate their political ideas in the new group \u2014 one of tens of thousands of internal groups that cover a range of topics \u2014 adding that this debate would better equip the company to host a variety of viewpoints on its platform.\u201cWe are entrusted by a great part of the world to be impartial and transparent carriers of people\u2019s stories, ideas and commentary,\u201d Mr. Amerige wrote. \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t think we can do this. The president doesn\u2019t think we can do this. And like them or not, we deserve that criticism.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Break the Impasse on North Korea", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLittle steps, not big talk, could bring progress on denuclearization.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The summit meeting itself helped set up this impasse. Its concluding communiqu\u00e9 committed the two leaders to \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d without even defining \u201cdenuclearization,\u201d let alone explicitly agreeing on the sequence of actions to be taken. While such actions are a good beginning, they shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. Most are reversible and pale in comparison to the fact that the North continues to produce plutonium and enriched uranium, the fissile material needed for nuclear weapons, as well as to build ballistic missiles. The Americans have given up even less: Mr. Trump met with Mr. Kim in Singapore, agreed to the communiqu\u00e9 (however flawed) and suspended military exercises with South Korea. So where does that leave things? The administration\u2019s demand that North Korea take major steps toward denuclearization before the United States does anything to reciprocate is a recipe for failure. What\u2019s needed is a step-by-step process in which both sides take mutually reinforcing actions that begin to build confidence and a more stable security environment. But an interim declaration of peace is not the same as a peace treaty, which would presumably go into effect only when North Korea had denuclearized. The United States would always have the right to respond militarily if warranted. The administration doesn\u2019t have endless time to think this over. While the United States is narrowly focused on denuclearization and sanctions, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea seems set on an ambitious agenda, including pressing hard for the peace declaration and connecting the two Koreas and the wider region with a railway network. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have called for a radically different, peaceful relationship between their countries. That ambition carries big risks and potentially big gains for both leaders. To achieve their objectives, they will have to show more political will, courage and creativity than they have so far.Advertisement"}

His earliest remembered taste of it was in his grandmother\u2019s asopao, a Puerto Rican dish that is not quite stew, not quite soup. It\u2019s made of rice simmered in chicken broth and white wine, with collapsed tomatoes, sofrito and olives leaching their brine.This is food that warms you, changes you from within. Mr. Johnson, known as JJ, called it simply soupy rice, and drank it by the cup. But after his grandmother died, the only rice that appeared on the table was \u201cthis Uncle Ben\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he said \u2014 bland and mushy. \u201cIt was never right.\u201dIn Ghana, the men were served jollof rice, hot and smoky. \u201cI\u2019m sweating, but it\u2019s really good,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He wanted to know: \u201cWhy is their rice better than ours?\u201dThe menu, with dishes cooked to order, is built around five pedigreed strains of rice. They include Nostrale, first planted in Italy in the 15th century, delicately earthy; Mountain Violet, a purple-husked, glutinous variety from the largely inaccessible Cordillera mountains in northern Luzon, the Philippines; and sweet Carolina Gold, grown in the South Carolina Lowcountry since before the American Revolution.Carolina Gold might be paired with a gently fried chicken thigh and a swath of tamarind barbecue sauce. Mountain Violet might arrive half gooey, half crispy from a quick press against the flattop. One certainty: There will be soupy rice.There, he has returned to the elevated African-diaspora cooking that was his signature at the Cecil, this time with a few smoke-drum backyard favorites thrown in. \u201cWhen my mom came to the Cecil, she said, \u2018There\u2019s nothing for me,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018Mom, there\u2019s poussin.

Over the past year, at lunches with various Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I have been told at least four times that magic mushrooms will help me become a better reporter (maybe) and three times that Ecstasy will make me a nicer person (doubt it). I have also been offered several chances to microdose on LSD (pass!) and now that it is legal in California, weed, weed and more weed in every conceivable delivery method (yum, gummy bears!).He had me until vomiting. Thanks, but no thanks. Now Burning Man, the annual gathering in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, is about to begin.

{"Headline": "Inside Twitter\u2019s Struggle Over What Gets Banned", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With his arms folded, Jack Dorsey paced back and forth in a conference room at Twitter\u2019s headquarters on Friday afternoon.In a rare look inside one of the social media company\u2019s policy meetings, the Twitter chief executive gathered with 18 colleagues, including the safety team, to debate ways to make the social media service safer for its users. The discussion quickly turned to how to rid the site of \u201cdehumanizing\u201d speech, even if it did not violate Twitter\u2019s rules, which forbid direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but do not prohibit deception or misinformation.Twitter asked that members of its safety team not be identified, for fear of them becoming targeted by internet trolls. \u201cPlease bear with me,\u201d said one team member at the meeting. \u201cThis is incredibly complex.\u201dFor about an hour, the group tried to get a handle on what constituted dehumanizing speech. At one point, Mr. Dorsey wondered if there was a technology solution. There was no agreement on an answer.The discussion capped a difficult week for Twitter. For the past five days, the company has been embroiled in internal conversations about how to evolve and explain its policies for what can and cannot be posted on its site. The debates were urgent, fueled by criticism against Twitter for its lack of action against the posts from the far-right conspiracy site Infowars and its creator, Alex Jones.On Friday, to provide more transparency about its decision making, Twitter invited two New York Times reporters to attend the policy meeting. During the one-hour gathering, a picture emerged of a 12-year-old company still struggling to keep up with the complicated demands of being an open and neutral communications platform that brings together world leaders, celebrities, journalists, political activists and conspiracy theorists.Even settling on a definition of dehumanizing speech was not easy. By the meeting\u2019s end, Mr. Dorsey and his executives had agreed to draft a policy about dehumanizing speech and open it to the public for their comments.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Dorsey, 41, said he was \u201cO.K. with people not agreeing\u201d with his decision to keep Mr. Jones\u2019s account live.\u201cI don\u2019t see this as an end point, I see this as maintaining integrity with what we put out there and not doing random one-off interpretations,\u201d he said.But Mr. Dorsey also said that while Twitter\u2019s longtime guiding principle has been free expression, the company is now discussing \u201cthat safety should come first.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation we need to have.\u201d He said he was thinking deeply about human rights law and listening to audiobooks on speech and expression.Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow of digital policy at the Council of Foreign Relations, said Mr. Dorsey had mishandled the Infowars situation but added that dealing with matters of free speech on social media is highly complex.\u201cThere is no due process, no transparency, no case law, and no expertise on these very complicated legal and social questions behind these decisions,\u201d she said.Just a week ago, debates around dehumanizing speech were not the main topic of conversation at Twitter. At a staff meeting at the time at the company\u2019s headquarters, Twitter employees were buoyant as they watched a break dancing executive on stage, a cameo by Mr. Dorsey\u2019s mother, and attended an after-hours dance party.Then late on Sunday, Apple yanked most of the content from Mr. Jones and Infowars off its iTunes store, quickly followed by deletions at Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify. At Twitter, executives met on Monday morning to debate their own response. They ultimately decided that Mr. Jones had not committed enough infractions to result in a permanent ban from the site.Mr. Dorsey discussed that decision on Tuesday in an internal post on Periscope, the live-streaming video platform owned by Twitter, according to an employee who watched the stream and who was not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Dorsey finally posted about Twitter\u2019s decision to keep up the posts of Infowars and Mr. Jones. In his tweets, the chief executive suggested that other social media companies had caved to political pressure by removing Mr. Jones\u2019s content. He also said the task of fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019s sensational claims should fall to journalists on the platform rather than Twitter\u2019s own moderators, prompting confusion.Internally, Mr. Dorsey, aiming for transparency, encouraged employees to post publicly about their opinions regarding Mr. Jones. Several hours later, Mr. Dorsey appeared on a radio show with the conservative media personality Sean Hannity and tried to refute claims that the site is biased against conservatives.In Friday\u2019s meeting at Twitter, the 18 attendees, all standing around a wooden conference room table, debated topics including whether tweets that disparaged immigrants could be considered dehumanizing. One executive insisted that it was important for Twitter to enable debate about immigration policy.\u201cImmigration is a really valid political debate in many countries around the world and I think we want to make sure we protect the ability of people to say things like, \u2018Immigration has affected my community. My local factory employs different people now; I can\u2019t get a job.\u2019\u201d said Nick Pickles, a policy strategist.Any new rules also had to allow victims of rape to openly discuss their experience online, said Ms. Harvey. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make people feel less comfortable,\u201d she said.Mr. Dorsey stroked his beard and nodded.In the interview afterward, Mr. Dorsey said he was contemplating broader changes, including \u201csystemic\u201d solutions that aren\u2019t a \u201cone-off.\u201d But those conversations, he said, have not been \u201cexplicit.\u201d Twitter is early in the process, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk more,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "11 Children Found in \u2018Filthy\u2019 New Mexico Compound, Sheriff Says", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, the authorities have been searching for Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a boy from a small Georgia city whose fourth birthday was Monday. The search led them to a filthy compound in New Mexico, where law enforcement officers made a startling discovery over the weekend: 11 malnourished children living without fresh water or plumbing.After the authorities obtained a search warrant and raided the compound in Amalia, N.M., on Friday, one of the men, Siraj Wahhaj, believed to be Abdul-Ghani\u2019s father, was jailed on a warrant for his arrest on an abduction charge in connection with the young boy\u2019s disappearance from Georgia. The five adults, including the three mothers, were charged on Sunday with child abuse, the sheriff\u2019s statement said.Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj was reported missing in Jonesboro, Ga., in December. That month the Clayton County Police Department in Georgia identified Siraj Wahhaj as the boy\u2019s father. A spokesman for the Taos County sheriff would not confirm their relationship.Siraj Wahhaj, 39, was heavily armed in the compound, which was ringed with stacks of tires, and would not initially cooperate with officers\u2019 instructions, the sheriff\u2019s office said. In the compound, the authorities found an AR-15 rifle, five loaded magazines, four loaded pistols and more rounds of ammunition.Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said the children and adults exited the compound in Amalia, a mountainous area about six miles from New Mexico\u2019s northern border with Colorado, looking like \u201cthird world country refugees\u201d without food or fresh water. They wore no shoes and \u201cbasically dirty rags for clothing,\u201d he said.\u201cThe only food we saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,\u201d he added.The authorities are continuing to search for Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, the 4-year-old. They believe he was at the compound a few weeks ago.Their search began last December, when the boy\u2019s mother told the authorities that he had gone to the park with his father about 10 days earlier and that they had not returned, according to the Clayton County Police Department.His mother told the police that Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj had developmental and cognitive delays, suffers from seizures and was unable to walk because of a brain condition.Days after the child disappeared, Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj and his father were involved in a single-vehicle accident on a highway in Alabama, the police said in December. The pair were in the company of five other children and two adults, the police said.The group told the Alabama police they were on their way to New Mexico for a camping trip.In court documents filed Monday in New Mexico, the authorities said Siraj Wahhaj informed the boy\u2019s mother that he wanted to perform an exorcism on him because he believed the child was possessed by the devil, according to The Associated Press.Sheriff Hogrefe in New Mexico said he sought a search warrant for the compound last week after a detective obtained a message from someone the authorities believed was inside. The message, sent to a third party, said, in part, \u201cWe are starving and need food and water,\u201d he said.At that point, the sheriff said, the investigators believed the occupants of the compound were armed.After the raid, one of the two men found in the compound, Lucas Morton, was charged with harboring a fugitive. The women were initially detained for questioning and then released, until they were arrested and charged with child abuse on Sunday.The women, who were being held in jail, were identified as Jany Leveille, 35; Hujrah Wahhaj, 38; and Subhannah Wahhaj, 35. It was unclear whether the women were related.Each count of child abuse is a third-degree felony that could carry up to three years in prison.A spokesman for Taos County Sheriff\u2019s Office declined to answer any questions about the case on Monday but said the authorities would hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon to provide an update.

The mayor\u2019s office also doesn\u2019t expect to see a significant increase in fares.Uber, however, argues that the cap will mean fewer cars for passengers who want them, especially in the boroughs outside Manhattan. \u201cWe\u2019re worried the impact will be felt the most in areas not well served by mass transit and where taxis refuse to travel,\u201d said Jason Post, director of public affairs for Uber. Mr. Post said prices for Uber riders would not rise immediately, but could go up in the future.What does it mean for drivers?What\u2019s next?After a year, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission will be allowed to regulate the number of for-hire vehicles on the road. Presently, up to 40 percent of ride-sharing vehicles are unoccupied at any given time, according to a study commissioned by the T.L.C. Those empty cars add to the street congestion and increase competition among drivers. The city is considering establishing an occupancy rate that is healthier for the city, said a spokesman for the mayor\u2019s office. If successful, the law could become a model for other cities or states that want to regulate the industry.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Finally, a day of beautiful (but balmy) weather.Same vibe tomorrow.Congratulations, boys!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A \u2018Landmark\u2019 Restaurant Returns: A Preview of the Four Seasons", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust three blocks from the original, the new Four Seasons nods to the past while forging its own identity.\u201cSome people have already come in to pick their tables,\u201d said Julian Niccolini, a partner. \u201cWe get emails every day. People I can\u2019t remember ever seeing before come up to me in stores, on the street, to ask about the opening.\u201dWhat they will find at the new entrance, in an office tower on East 49th Street, is the discreet brass wall plaque engraved with the four-tree logo that was displayed near the old restaurant\u2019s door. Also echoing the original restaurant are a dining room and a bar connected by a long corridor. A few Four Seasons classics, like the roast farmhouse duck, are on the menu, and the same managing partners, Mr. Niccolini and Alex von Bidder, are in charge. But just about everything else is different. Built from scratch, with a $30 million price tag, the new Four Seasons inhabits a two-story space. A simple sleek, dark foyer leads to the dramatic, square Bar Room, seating 50, that captures some of the soaring grandeur of the old Four Seasons. In the center is a bar, 16-feet square and sunken, suggesting the famous pool in the previous dining room. The Dining Room has 33 tables, somewhat fewer than the old Pool Room. \u201cPreviously we had 160 seats, now we have about 110,\u201d Mr. von Bidder said. \u201cOver all, the new restaurant is significantly smaller, 20,000 square feet compared with 30,000 in the old place.\u201d The smaller space, Mr. Niccolini noted, means reservations, which can be made starting Wednesday for lunch and dinner, are likely to be more difficult to come by.\u201cThe Four Seasons was a landmark American restaurant, even though all the food was not necessarily American,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of the first seasonal restaurants.\u201d His chef de cuisine, Brandon Lajes, 26, and a New Yorker, is also a veteran of Le Bernardin. Mr. von Bidder and Mr. Niccolini hope to attract a new audience and to appeal to customers who haven\u2019t been in their restaurant for a long time. Wine lovers will find a deep collection of reds and whites from California, especially from the venerable estates that have anchored the restaurant\u2019s wine list, like Dominus, Silver Oak and Phelps, with vintages going back to the 1970s. There will also be a good selection of Burgundies, Bordeaux and Italian wines. The Four Seasons 2.0 also has an upstairs with a spacious private dining room, and another intimate room they call the Treehouse, in plush blue, for Champagne and small receptions. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated Bill Yosses's role at the Four Seasons restaurant.

He was 36.Lyle turned professional in 2004 and first appeared on the PGA Tour in 2007. In 2008, he won two events on the Web.com Tour, a feeder for the PGA Tour. In all, he played in more than 120 P.G.A. tournaments.\u201cJarrod was a true inspiration in the way he faced cancer with a persistently positive attitude, and he carried himself with incredible grace, dignity and courage through the recurrences of this relentless disease,\u201d Jay Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, said in a statement.Lyle was born on Aug. 21, 1981, in Shepparton, Australia, about two hours north of Melbourne. Though he started caddying for his father at age 7, he called himself a late bloomer compared with other professional golfers.He learned he had acute myeloid leukemia when he was 17. The cancer returned in 2012, when he was 30.Lyle returned to competition in late 2013 and tried to resume a full schedule the next year. But after 10 starts and three made cuts, he returned to Australia, citing mental, physical and emotional exhaustion.His third leukemia diagnosis came last summer. His wife had documented his treatment in recent months, writing about his pride at taking his first steps in a hospital hallway after weeks without walking, the smile on his face after a visit from his daughter, and a carefully arranged visit outside. She also noted the complications that arose as his health declined.The golf community had been monitoring his condition and offering support. Last week, at the World Golf Championships in Akron, Ohio, players wore yellow ribbons on their caps and visors in Lyle\u2019s honor.Besides his wife, Lyle\u2019s survivors include his two daughters, Lusi, 6, and Jemma, 2. In her statement, Ms. Lyle said her husband had spent his final days in Torquay, the seaside town near Melbourne where he had lived.She added that Lyle had asked her to pass along this message: \u201cMy time was short, but if I\u2019ve helped people think and act on behalf of those families who suffer through cancer, hopefully it wasn\u2019t wasted.\u201dKaren Crouse contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Developments With Manafort and Cohen Explained", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur investigative reporter who spent 16 days covering the Paul Manafort trial, Sharon LaFraniere, answers our readers\u2019 questions on Manafort\u2019s conviction and Cohen\u2019s guilty plea.How should we make sense of this? Sharon LaFraniere, a New York Times investigative reporter who covered the Manafort trial for 16 days, discussed the two criminal cases on Facebook Live with our audience. Here are nine questions sent in by viewers, along with her answers. Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.In Michael Cohen\u2019s case, his plea agreement did not include an agreement to cooperate with ongoing investigations and that\u2019s sort of an outstanding question: Why didn\u2019t it?In Mr. Manafort\u2019s case, he faces a second trial coming up in September on seven additional counts, so it\u2019s not over for Mr. Manafort by any means.In the Manafort case, no, that case was purely financial fraud charges. It had nothing to do with whether Russia interfered or tried to influence the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential race.In the Cohen case, that\u2019s an open question. In court, Michael Cohen implicated the president in payments to two women who had alleged that they had affairs with him, so in those counts he pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws. I don\u2019t think that the prosecutors will because they didn\u2019t get everything they wanted but they got a lot of what they wanted and they have another case coming up in Washington, D.C. where they are likely to have a more favorable jury pool.On the 10 counts that the jury deadlocked on in the Manafort trial, the prosecutors do have the option of seeking to retry those charges, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely that they will do that. There were bench conferences that we were extremely curious about. One bench conference convened after the defense attorneys asked Mr. Gates, \u201cDid the prosecutors try to question you about the Trump campaign?\u201d and the bench conference on that question was sealed by the judge after the prosecutors said it could jeopardize an ongoing investigation. The judge said he is not going to unseal that for the foreseeable future. The other bench conferences are less interesting and will be unsealed.It would have political ramifications for sure because Mr. Manafort was convicted of, among other things, evading taxes on more than $15 million in income over a period of five years and the two bank fraud charges on which he was convicted carry a maximum sentence of up to 30 years. So these are not crimes that could be dismissed as politically charged, they were straight out fraud charges.He\u2019s been charged with federal crimes \u2014 both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen were charged with federal crimes \u2014 so I don\u2019t think so. I think the answer to that is no.The bank fraud charges were complicated, probably four of them didn\u2019t result in a conviction because it seemed like the bank itself in that case was a co-conspirator. Manafort might have submitted inaccurate information, but the bank definitely seemed to want to give the loan. In fact it seemed almost like quid pro quo between Manafort and the bank chairman, who was hoping for a job. Maybe Secretary of the Army or even Secretary of the Treasury in the Trump administration. So the argument was that if the bank is willing to give the loan, where\u2019s the fraud?The others were conspiracy charges that involved basically requiring the jury to believe Mr. Gates\u2019 testimony. Gates testified that he stole from Mr. Manafort hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also testified he might\u2019ve stolen from President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee when he was executive director of it and that he has committed crimes that could land him in prison for 100 years. And yet more than two dozen charges were dismissed against him as part of his plea agreement, so it\u2019s possible that the jury just wasn\u2019t going to convict on anything that they thought depended upon Rick Gates\u2019 testimony.For Paul Manafort, the judge said basically that he wanted to hear back from the prosecution about whether they intended to retry him on the 10 counts on which the jury could not reach a consensus.For Michael Cohen, no sentencing date has been set as far as I know. It\u2019s worth noting that both men face significant prison time. I think Mr. Manafort probably is looking at anywhere from six to 12 years in prison and Mr. Cohen is looking at possibly a minimum of four years in prison, so very stiff consequences for both of them.Not that I know of, honestly. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really confronted that question in the same way as we are now.Advertisement"}

Plus a president whose administration is setting records for boggy behavior. \u2019Tis the season.People, what do you think originally inspired Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d if he was elected? Do you think he repressed the whole matter of his tax returns? The hush money payments to Stormy and Company? He did say during his campaign that the swamp was the \u201centire corrupt Washington establishment,\u201d so maybe he presumed that slimy things occurring in New York or Florida didn\u2019t count.Ah, well, let\u2019s look ahead. Autumn is coming, temperatures will be falling and the Democrats will be running on a neo-Drainage platform.\u201cThe swamp has never been more foul or more fetid than under this president,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, when he and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a press conference on the steps of the Capitol to unveil a good-government agenda called \u201cA Better Deal for Our Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s part of the overall Democratic election theme \u201cA Better Deal.\u201dO.K., the last one was an old quiz show. On the reform front, Better Deal has a lot of pieces, like making it easier for people to register to vote, increasing the political power of small donors and stronger ethics guidelines. Who could possibly be against any of that? Well, somebody must, since they\u2019ve never become law. Actually, while Republicans have in recent years been the big brake on reform, anything that affects elections makes elected officials nervous. So it\u2019s important to show a lot of enthusiasm when these ideas come up. Even if the words \u201ccampaign finance reform\u201d cause your eyes to glaze over, look excited. This is our moment.Anyhow, Warren\u2019s basic idea is to unravel some of the ties between the federal government and the corporate world that government is supposed to regulate. So you couldn\u2019t just leave your seat in Congress and go to work for a big financial or lobbying firm.There\u2019s a lot of subsurface hostility to this in Congress. The members, who get around $174,000 a year (plus benefits), frequently convince themselves they\u2019re making a great financial sacrifice that will pay off later when they return to the private sector. Some can\u2019t even wait that long, like Representative Duncan Hunter of California. \u2026The Trump era makes our normal problems with political ethics explode like spectacular, sleazy fireworks. It\u2019s not unusual for public servants to recycle themselves into lucrative jobs in lobbying or business. But this administration has been distinguished by the number of people who can\u2019t even wait until they leave the government to start getting payback. Hunter\u2019s district is, as you can probably tell, very conservative. It\u2019s also very safe \u2014 he inherited the seat from his father. Pre-scandal, there weren\u2019t a lot of Democrats standing in line to get a chance to run against him, and his opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, is a relative political newcomer. Cross your fingers and see if voters in a red district will be willing to take a stand against corruption and elect a Palestinian Mexican-American millennial to represent them in Washington.Hey, stranger things have happened. For instance, Hunter\u2019s apparently paid back the $600 he used for the rabbit\u2019s plane flight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black Girl Sent Home From School Over Hair Extensions", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn 11-year-old black student at a private Roman Catholic school near New Orleans was asked to leave class on Monday because administrators said her braided hair extensions violated school rules, according to a lawyer for the girl\u2019s family.A viral video showed the sixth grader, Faith Fennidy, crying as she packed up her belongings and left Christ the King Parish School in Terrytown, La.The video, which prompted outrage online on Tuesday, followed closely behind a similar episode in Florida last week in which a black 6-year-old was sent home on his first day of school because he had dreadlocks. Black children have historically faced punishment by school officials over their hairstyles, including twin sisters in Boston who were forced to serve detention last year for wearing their hair in braids.In the most recent case, the Fennidy family lawyer, Inem O\u2019Boyle, said school officials this month told Faith on the first day of school that her hairstyle did not align with school policy. After Faith changed her hair, spending a \u201cconsiderable amount of money in the process,\u201d officials told her again on Monday that her hair did not comply with school rules, Ms. O\u2019Boyle said.\u201cThey told her not to come back,\u201d she said, adding that Faith had worn braids for the last two years at Christ the King.Faith\u2019s mother, Montrelle Fennidy, said her daughter was devastated. She declined to say more, referring questions to their lawyer. Ms. O\u2019Boyle said the family was not aware of the school\u2019s policy, instituted ahead of the new school year, before Faith attended the first day of classes.Ms. Fennidy can be heard saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her hair? Her hair is fine.\u201d Faith later walked out of the school wearing her backpack and got into a car with her parents.It says hairstyles that are \u201cfaddish and deemed inappropriate by the administration\u201d are not permitted. If students violate the policy, they may be sent home or asked to modify their hairstyle within a specific time period decided by the school\u2019s administration.Failure to follow those directions will result in \u201csevere consequences,\u201d including suspension, until the requirements are met, according to the handbook. The school, which requires that students wear uniforms, prohibits dyed hair, makeup, facial hair and long fingernails.School administrators did not respond to emails on Tuesday, and calls to the school\u2019s phone number did not go through.RaeNell Billiot Houston, the superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of New Orleans, said in a statement on Tuesday that the student was not suspended or expelled. Her parents were offered the opportunity to comply with the hair policy, Dr. Houston said, but they chose to withdraw her from the school.Betsie Gambel, a spokeswoman for Dr. Houston, said none of the documentation required for expulsion or suspension had been prepared.But Ms. O\u2019Boyle reiterated that school officials told Faith to \u201cnot come back.\u201d Faith still pays tuition, she said, and intends to continue her education at that school, where all of her friends are enrolled. Ms. O\u2019Boyle declined to comment in response to a question about a potential lawsuit arising from the case.Dr. Houston said in the statement that the new policy was communicated to parents during the summer and again before the first day of school, and that it applied to all students.\u201cThe school leadership worked with families as needed to ensure compliance,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cWe remain committed to being a welcoming school community that celebrates our unity and diversity.\u201dThe boy, C. J. Stanley, was excited to start first grade when he arrived with his backpack at A Book\u2019s Christian Academy in Apopka, Fla., in his crisp school uniform, said his father, Clinton Stanley Sr. His parents had hoped the small school would give him a better education than the local public schools could.But school officials told the family that his dreadlocks violated rules listed in the school handbook, he said, although Mr. Stanley denied ever receiving a copy before the family\u2019s arrival that morning.In the video, which Mr. Stanley recorded, a school official can be heard telling him that even braiding his son\u2019s hair up will not suffice. \u201cIt has to be above the ears,\u201d she says, as the boy looks at the camera, his eyes wide. \u201cI have to unenroll him,\u201d the official continued. \u201cThat\u2019s all we got.\u201dIn a phone interview, Mr. Stanley said he withdrew his son and had found a temporary school as the family looked for a private school that would allow C. J. to wear his hair in dreadlocks and \u201clet him be himself.\u201d But the pain of the ordeal continues to weigh on both father and son.\u201cIt hurts to look him in the eye,\u201d Mr. Stanley said. \u201cC.

PARIS \u2014 In June, I got an email from a Frenchwoman I know. I\u2019ll call her H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cI am now embarked on a fascinating trip as I will no longer be around at the end of the summer. I am serene and ready. I would be happy to share some thoughts on death if you could come and see me. Pick a nice day, we\u2019ll chat in the garden.\u201dH\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a teacher in her 70s whom I\u2019d met a few years earlier when she invited me to speak to her class. She became a friendly informant on French culture, with a distinctly Parisian way of sounding familiar, then suddenly saying something altogether foreign. She once complained that when she invites Americans to dinner, they phone ahead with their food preferences. She couldn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t supposed to intervene to help her overweight American students slim down.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has now surprised me again with the way she plans to, as the French say, \u201cdisappear.\u201d (I knew that she had cancer, but I hadn\u2019t realized that it was terminal or that she had imminent plans to die.) On the M\u00e9tro to her house, I remind myself that we\u2019re not close. She has summoned me as a journalist. I won\u2019t get too involved. Over lunch (I\u2019ve made no food requests), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne describes the complicated logistics of dying in Paris. They\u2019re a lot like living in Paris. She was terrified of dying in August, when Parisians are on vacation, so \u201cat my burial there would be one dog and three people.\u201d She was relieved when a funeral planner promised that he\u2019d refrigerate her until September. She has drawn up a guest list for her memorial service \u2014 called a c\u00e9r\u00e9monie d\u2019adieu \u2014 and selected an \u201celegant\u201d crepe de Chine dress to wear for it. She had hoped to be cremated afterward and then sprinkled into the Seine, but \u201cwith this stupid and authoritarian state, you don\u2019t have the right to do what you want with your ashes.\u201d\u201cIt must be frightening to think of not being there,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, it\u2019s unbearable! Otherwise they\u2019re going to have to get a boat and take me out to sea.\u201dI realize H\u00e9l\u00e8ne thought I meant the burial plot. I gently clarify that she must be afraid of not being alive. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she replies. \u201cI\u2019m impatient to go. I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s enough. It does not interest me to watch my body fall apart.\u201d I\u2019m struck by the paradox: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is eager to die, but she\u2019s intensely alive and curious about her experience. And even now, she has a very French way of keeping track of precisely what she does and doesn\u2019t like. Instead of a bucket list, she delights in small daily moments, like being carried by a handsome fireman after she recently injured herself at home. (\u201cI said to him, \u2018Come back and have a glass of wine here!\u2019\u201d) She also takes pleasure in editing her life, including clearing her drawers of all but \u201cimportant\u201d possessions. At first, some colleagues came to visit out of \u201cmorbid curiosity.\u201d Now she sees only beloved friends and former students, and several boyfriends from her youth. \u201cWe know it\u2019s the last time, so we tell each other things, there\u2019s no reason to hide anything.\u201d When discussing death with them, \u201cI put people at ease, there\u2019s no taboo.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is enjoying her palliative care. With her doctors and nurses, too, \u201cwe really have profound conversations. Because they\u2019re in life and death all the time.\u201d (One issue she doesn\u2019t need to ponder is money: France\u2019s national insurance covers all her medical expenses, including the physical therapist and hospice nurse who visit her at home several times a week. She accepted an at-home hospital bed but refused the state-financed housekeeper and facials.) H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s insights are modest: Don\u2019t confuse your own joys and preferences with anyone else\u2019s. Observe your own mind and experiences carefully and arrange your life \u2014 and your death \u2014 accordingly. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s to try to find a truth that is really yours, nothing but yours. And not to act out of conformism.\u201d By doing this, she has reached the pinnacle of female Frenchness: She\u2019s une femme libre \u2014 a free woman.Over dessert, my journalistic reserve cracks. I realize that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne isn\u2019t just a friendly informant; she\u2019s a friend. And there is no one else like her. I don\u2019t want her to disappear. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re still alive in September?\u201d I ask, hopefully. \u201cPlease don\u2019t wish that for me,\u201d she replies.

Elsewhere, even in highly trafficked places, the options can be sparse, neither satisfying to the locals nor attractive to visitors.Mediterranean food will get a new home at Benno, an intimate dining room in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad. The chef Jonathan Benno, who ran Lincoln Ristorante in Lincoln Center, has already opened a restaurant and a bakery in the hotel; his new flagship will focus on the cooking of Northern Italy and Southern France, while touching on neighboring regions like Morocco and Spain.La Cave, an elegant hideaway lounge for a glass of wine with hors d\u2019oeuvres and desserts will open downstairs at Bistro Pierre Lapin in the West Village.

{"Headline": "Facing Losses, Cond\u00e9 Nast Plans to Put 3 Magazines Up for Sale", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "Anna Wintour is staying, but the once-flush company behind Vogue and The New Yorker lost roughly $120 million last year.Supported byCond\u00e9 Nast, the company behind Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, became one of the most successful magazine publishers by charming readers and advertisers alike with a formula built on old-world glamour and all-American pizazz. But now, even after having taken measures to cut spending and make itself more digitally savvy, the company is expected to adopt a more radical strategy to ensure that it does not fade away.Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., the chief executive of Cond\u00e9 Nast, plans to address senior staff members on Aug. 8. The meeting will come in the wake of an extended visit from Boston Consulting Group, which recently concluded a monthslong examination.It does not promise to be a cheerful gathering. According to more than a dozen current and former Cond\u00e9 Nast executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal matters, the measures instituted at the company over the last decade \u2014 closing Details and the print versions of Self and Teen Vogue; laying off some 80 employees last year; combining the photo and research departments of different magazines \u2014 have not been enough to stem the bleeding.The company lost more than $120 million last year and plans to put three of its 14 magazines \u2014 Brides, Golf Digest and W \u2014 up for sale, three executives said. The marquee titles, including Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, are safe.In a cost-saving measure, the company will also soon begin the process of leasing at least six of its 23 floors at 1 World Trade Center, the Lower Manhattan tower that has been its headquarters since 2015. The New Yorker and Vanity Fair will be among the magazines that will eventually be moved to make room for new tenants.While the company\u2019s troubles are not so severe as those hitting other media organizations in recent days \u2014 the Tronc-owned Daily News lost half its newsroom last month \u2014 they are unsettling to veterans at a company where top editors once had roomy offices designed to their own specifications, the everyday use of chauffeured cars and, for a favored few, no-interest loans to ease the purchases of Manhattan brownstones and even second homes.Some longtime Cond\u00e9 Nast employees are wondering how much of the company\u2019s decline can be attributed to the diminished state of print media and how much is the result of self-inflicted wounds.Contributing to low morale at 1 World Trade was a sense that the company\u2019s leadership was in flux, which resulted partly from a recent spate of articles and items speculating on the future of Ms. Wintour, the editor of Vogue since 1988 and the company\u2019s artistic director. The gossip had it that she was looking to make an exit from Vogue after publishing her next September issue, with Beyonc\u00e9 on the cover.Mr. Sauerberg tried to stifle the chatter on Tuesday, when he released a statement that Ms. Wintour \u201chas agreed to work with me indefinitely in her role as editor in chief, Vogue, and artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast.\u201dIt will take more than corporate stability, however, to reverse the company\u2019s slide.The $120 million loss in 2017 came about because of a sharp decline in ad revenue generated by the print magazines. Gains in the digital arena have helped offset the loss, but not enough to make the company profitable. Cond\u00e9 Nast reached its decision to entertain offers for Brides, Golf Digest and W partly on the recommendation of Boston Consulting Group, the three executives said.Cond\u00e9 Nast declined to comment for this article.John Wagner, who oversees ad spending with publishers at the media agency PHD, questioned the company\u2019s strategy, saying that Cond\u00e9 Nast can be \u201cquick to close things, versus trying to find a solution.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them continue to invest \u2014 keep the brands alive, even if you have to change their rate base or publishing frequency.\u201dExpense budgets, already less than what they were in the days of leisurely lunches, are getting tighter. One publication recently informed its contract writers that their fees had been cut, according to two people at the company.The $120 million loss \u2014 for a publisher once accustomed to hundreds of millions in annual profits \u2014 has put pressure on Mr. Sauerberg, who joined Cond\u00e9 Nast as an executive vice president in 2005 and rose to the top position in 2016.Cond\u00e9 Nast is a subsidiary of a Newhouse company, Advance Publications, which is controlled by Donald Newhouse, 89, and his son, Steven O. Newhouse, 61. Jonathan Newhouse, 65, a cousin of Si, is the chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, home to British Vogue and dozens of other international editions. That arm is something of a corporate oasis, given that Europeans, unlike Americans, have yet to give up the magazine habit.While many of the roughly 30 newspapers in the Newhouse chain have endured layoffs and other cost-saving measures, the Newhouses\u2019 fortunes have not suffered, thanks to the family\u2019s $10.4 billion sale of its cable businesses to Charter Communications in 2016. A provision in the deal gives Advance an additional annual payment of $150 million, cushioning the parent company from any recent losses.Cond\u00e9 Nast has gone through fits and starts as it has sought to revise its corporate identity for the digital age. Dawn Ostroff, the head of Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment, left for Spotify last month with little warning. The company also lost another top lieutenant last month with the exit of Josh Stinchcomb, who oversaw 23 Stories, the company\u2019s in-house advertising unit.The business Ms. Ostroff oversaw, which got its start in 2011, is focused on the development of digital video, film and television projects. It is very much on the rise and will significantly narrow the company\u2019s losses this year, two executives said. Mr. Sauerberg highlighted the division earlier this summer in a companywide email. \u201cWe crossed an important milestone,\u201d he said. \u201cOur web and video businesses have grown so significantly, their revenue surpassed print for the first time in the company\u2019s history.\u201dEach month the company produces an average of 417 videos that play on YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and its own websites. Some tackle subjects not often associated with Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d a documentary series focused on college athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds, stands out from the rest. Produced by Cond\u00e9 Nast, it appears on Netflix.The main obstacle, though, has been the loss in print readers and advertising dollars. Circulation continued to fall through May of this year. And as iPhone-entranced pedestrians drifted past newsstands, the company lost more than 20 percent of its ad pages last year, according to figures from the research firm Kantar Media.Starkly designed, with a heavy white border, it featured the actress Melissa McCarthy under the theme, \u201c#the money issue,\u201d hashtag and all. The verdict? A few editors were not impressed, according to several people familiar with the matter. It looked like a facsimile of a magazine, one said.But that same cover elicited a different reaction from younger staff members, who are at a great remove from the company\u2019s mythos.\u201cAwesome!\u201d a young editor said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alex Jones of Infowars Destroyed Evidence Related to Sandy Hook Suits, Motion Says", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers for the families of two Sandy Hook shooting victims are accusing the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars media business of intentionally destroying evidence relevant to the defamation cases against him, according to a motion filed on Friday in a Texas court.Mr. Jones said on his broadcast last week that he had told his staff to delete material after CNN cited Infowars content that violated Twitter\u2019s policies, according to the motion filed on Friday.At least some of the deleted content was considered evidence in the Sandy Hook cases, and Mr. Jones had been informed in writing in April that he was obligated by law to preserve all relevant material, according to the court filing in District Court in Travis County in Austin.\u201cAs pressure mounted from pending defamation lawsuits and growing public indignation, Mr. Jones chose to destroy evidence of his actual malice and defamatory conduct,\u201d the motion filed on Friday said. \u201cInfowars deleted critical evidence at the precise moment plaintiff and his experts were attempting to marshal that evidence.\u201dThe suit said that it was not known how much content had been deleted, but that it included written social media materials and videos. The motion was filed on behalf of Neil Heslin, father of Jesse Lewis, a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook, by Mark Bankston, Kyle Farrar and William Ogden of Farrar & Ball in Houston.Over the five years since the shooting, families of the Sandy Hook victims have been stalked, threatened and subjected to online abuse by Mr. Jones\u2019s followers, after he spread false claims about the mass shooting, calling it \u201csynthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured,\u201d according to court documents.Mr. Jones peddles diet supplements, survivalist gear and gun-related paraphernalia on radio broadcasts and videos that spread outlandish claims like the government is trying to infringe on Americans\u2019 rights, destroy their health or control their minds.Friday\u2019s motion is the latest legal salvo in three separate defamation lawsuits filed by Sandy Hook families, which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages and pose an existential threat to Mr. Jones\u2019s business. Should the court find that Mr. Jones and Infowars willfully destroyed evidence, he, and possibly his lawyer, could be assessed thousands of dollars in fines and be subject to punitive action. Most important, the material that was destroyed could be presumed by the court as supporting Mr. Heslin\u2019s claims against Mr. Jones, bolstering his case.Besides the two cases in Texas, the families of seven more Sandy Hook victims and an emergency medical worker subjected to harassment filed a separate defamation suit against Mr. Jones and his associates in May in Connecticut. The families in the larger case are represented by Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, a Bridgeport, Conn., firm that also represents Sandy Hook families in a lawsuit against Remington, the maker of the AR-15-style weapon used in the shooting.A ruling on Friday\u2019s motion alleging destruction of evidence is expected before the Aug. 30 hearing.\u201cWe had a big serious meeting about that, actually,\u201d Mr. Dew replied. \u201cBut then I think in the end we made the decision to leave the stuff up there, because then we could go back and use it as our defense later and say, \u2018Look, this is what we really said.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

TOWN AND COUNTRY, Mo. \u2014 Troy Merritt was on an operating table last week as doctors removed a foot-long blood clot from his arm and chest. On Thursday, Merritt walked off the 18th green of Bellerive at one over par for the first round of the P.G.A. Championship. He had not seen the course until he teed off at 8:51 a.m., working only on the range and putting green in advance.\u201cYesterday I hit balls for the first time. I hit almost 50 balls, and it was throbbing,\u201d Merritt, 32, said of his left arm. \u201cIt was manageable, but it was going to be painful.\u201d\u201cIt reminds you that there are people in worse situations than yourself,\u201d said Merritt, whose clot had required emergency surgery barely two weeks after he won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky. \u201cJust seeing that, thinking about that, made me want to tee it up even more.\u201d\u201cI was scripted to wear dark blue today,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cThat definitely immediately changed last night.\u201dAt the World Golf Championships event in Akron, Ohio, last week, yellow ribbons appeared on players\u2019 caps when Lyle\u2019s wife, Briony, announced on Facebook that Jarrod was ending his medical treatment. Many of the ribbons reappeared here on Thursday. More are expected to arrive in a shipment from Australia that got stuck in customs.The American Pat Perez, who finished the first round three strokes off the lead, was one of the players wearing a leftover yellow ribbon. So was Ian Poulter of England, who had breakfast with Perez before Thursday\u2019s round. The pair struggled for words, Perez said.\u201cYou just don\u2019t even know what to say. It\u2019s so horrible,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cFor me, getting ready to have a daughter and start a family, I can\u2019t even imagine it.\u201d\u201cI heard so many times, \u2018He was such a great guy,\u2019 \u201d Perez continued. \u201cI wish now I\u2019d gotten to know him a little better. I thought about him all day.\u201dAs Merritt recovers from surgery, he must inject himself in the stomach with a blood thinner twice a day, and he said he took ibuprofen on Thursday. He managed a 71 with two birdies, and on almost any other day, his performance would have been the talk of the concourse. But Lyle\u2019s death loomed over every moment here.\u201cWhen you lose someone, it puts things in perspective,\u201d Perez said. \u201cPeople come out and get in pissing matches out here, or you put a couple in the water. You lose a guy and all of a sudden those things aren\u2019t really important anymore.\u201dLyle\u2019s colleagues were quick to say he preferred the brighter side of things, even in the darkest moments.\u201cJarrod wouldn\u2019t want us out here feeling sorry for him or feeling bad,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cHe\u2019d probably come out here and kick us in the butt and tell us to man up and go have some fun.\u201dThat\u2019s exactly what Merritt did.Karen Crouse contributed to this report.Advertisement"}

But the facade was damaged and the kitchen lost some of its roof, leaving a hole over the pastry department, said the executive chef, David Kinch.Some of the fermented products that Manresa\u2019s cooks prepare for as long as two months were lost. And most of Mr. Kinch\u2019s antique Japanese glassware, used for service at the restaurant, was destroyed.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to lament and moan about anything,\u201d Mr. Kinch said, \u201cit\u2019s that.\u201dAn investigation of this summer\u2019s fire by the Santa Clara County Fire Department has concluded that it was accidental. A spokeswoman for the department said Thursday that the fire began when some dish towels, soaked with sunflower seed oil, were left outside the building. In the heat, the temperature inside the pile of towels rose and ignited spontaneously.After the fire, Mr. Kinch said, even parts of the restaurant that appeared unaffected had to be replaced to get rid of the stubborn smell of smoke.He noted that the restaurant\u2019s insurer has compensated management and salaried employees for the duration of the closing, but did not cover what workers might have made in tips. (Manresa charges $275 a person for its tasting menu.) Over the summer, many on the staff worked in other fine-dining restaurants in the Bay Area, and almost all will return to their jobs in September, Mr. Kinch said.\u201cEveryone is on call after Labor Day weekend for touching up, painting, dusting, cleaning chairs, that kind of thing,\u201d he added. A new carpet will be rolled in, along with new lights and sconces, though maybe not until a few weeks after the opening.Mr. Kinch spent August developing new dishes at his home kitchen in Santa Cruz. What he considers the restaurant\u2019s signature dish \u2014 an extravagant miscellany of fruits, vegetables and flowers that changes with the seasons \u2014 will turn to various late-blooming tomato varieties and late-summer fruits such as plums and melon.He described another new dish as a corn custard, made without dairy and thickened with cornstarch, with a wobbly texture close to that of panna cotta. He plans to serve it with caviar and a roasted chicken jelly, made by steeping chicken with porcini mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and kombu, among other ingredients.\u201cIt\u2019s a crystal-clear umami bomb,\u201d said Mr. Kinch, who estimated that when the restaurant reopens, at least half the menu will be new.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a new dish of tomatoes, plums and melons.

I like it.Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 There are things I miss about being fertile. A waistline. Hair thick enough to hide my pink scalp and skin fitted enough to prove I have bones. Ovulation \u2014 those heady days each month when every cell was vibrating, when just the brush of my husband\u2019s arm against mine could make unloading the dishwasher feel like foreplay. I truly miss ovulation.I also miss sleeping. I remember sleep with such fondness. I fell asleep once leaning against the warm knees of the boy sitting behind me at a high-school football game. Back when I was fertile, I could close my eyes at night and wake up eight hours later, sometimes nine, feeling perfectly happy. Behold the bright new day! See how it reaches toward the horizon in all its hopeful promise!Now my internal thermostat is broken. I wake up to throw off the covers and lie there, wondering if my beleaguered country can survive the cataclysm that has befallen it, if the Earth itself can survive the convulsion it is undergoing. Feeling old and tired and very worried \u2014 that\u2019s not a recipe for hope.\u201cMaybe we need to travel more,\u201d my husband said.\u201cMaybe we need a puppy,\u201d I said. All that energy, all that untrammeled wiggling, cuddling, licking love \u2014 a puppy is the very personification of hope. But when I filled out the adoption application for a local animal-rescue organization, their website kicked it back with a note that read, \u201cValidation errors occurred.\u201d The \u201cerror,\u201d it turns out, was my age. Under the field where I had typed \u201c56,\u201d the website had noted (in bright red letters, lest I miss the note), \u201cThis number is too large.\u201dThis number is indeed too large for some things, but I\u2019m grateful to have reached it. I\u2019ve buried too many friends who were younger than I, and I feel more keenly than ever the bounty of this beautiful, temporary life. The pyrotechnics of youth may be gone, but I have learned that there\u2019s no aphrodisiac like long love, like the feeling of knowing and being known, of belonging to a beloved\u2019s body as fully as you belong to your own. And it\u2019s easier now to shrug off failure. It\u2019s easier to shrug off most other things, too: missed opportunities, the unwarranted anger of others, fear of looking like a fool. A person who is not afraid of looking like a fool gets to do a lot more dancing. Why did I ever worry about whether my party dress was enough like everyone else\u2019s party dress to be appropriate without being too much like everyone else\u2019s party dress to be derivative? When bangs were in fashion, why did I ever cut my own bangs with the sewing shears?The night I learned I was too old to adopt a rescue puppy, I woke in the dark and headed to a nearby lake at sunrise. A host of rough-winged swallows were scooping gnats from the air above the water. Three great blue herons and two little green herons all stood still as sentries on the shore. A raccoon hauled itself onto the bank, shedding a shower of water drops that gleamed like diamonds. A pair of fledgling barred owls demanded to be fed while their sharp-eyed parents watched the ground, waiting for some small creature to trundle through the underbrush. Nearby, a chipmunk was crouching motionless under a fallen tree. And when I got home, there was an email waiting for me from the animal rescue organization: It said I am not too old to adopt a puppy at all.Advertisement"}

Often, he applied those methods to native and foraged Australian ingredients. In March, Mr. Jo opened Shik, overseeing the beverage program and the kitchen as the chef.To accompany all that good booze are lovely saline-sweet, soy-marinated mussels, which come with air-thin rice crackers and a kick of ginger. The tiny Australian clams known as pipis are used in a version of haemul jjim, swimming in an intense broth made of dried anchovy, dried pollock, shiitake, konbu and a ginger chile paste. Fistfuls of bean sprouts and water parsley provide texture and freshness. (Pipis are sometimes available in fermented form as an off-menu banchan item, and you should ask for them.)The heart of the menu is made up of ssam and banchan, but this is not banchan as you\u2019ve seen it before. The seasonal kimchi plate might have persimmon and liquorish leaf kimchi, or a version made from fennel and river mint. There are various versions of jangajji, the pickled vegetable banchan, including a thinly sliced pumpkin that is almost jerky-like in texture, and thick with soy-enhanced umami.Mr. Jo often nods to Korean food\u2019s history as a subsistence cuisine. A nightly namul plate (a traditional dish of blanched, seasoned greens) offers various creative uses of scraps and weeds, like wild radish leaves and mountain marigold that add an intensely vegetal dynamic to the meal.This is food that has taken great thought and an intense amount of research, and then been put through a filter of creative, modern Australian sensibilities. It is utterly fascinating, and delicious to boot. And yet, if it continues in its current state, it will not survive. Because very few people are eating here.The reaction from local critics has been overwhelmingly positive, but also quite casual. The takeaway seems to be: \u201cHere\u2019s a cool new place to eat.\u201d Not: \u201cHot diggety, this is a massive advancement for Korean food in Australia!\u201d That casual enthusiasm has not translated to an influx of customers.Mr. Jo\u2019s approach is almost certainly contributing to the lag in business, starting with his location. Many Melbourne restaurants are down alleys, but Niagara Lane is dark and desolate, Shik has no sign, and the practically hidden front door has a large red arrow that appears to point you elsewhere. It would be entirely possible to walk past Shik and not notice the business at all.This invisibility probably seemed chic in theory, and could be fun if the restaurant were filled with in-the-know guests. That enchanting speakeasy quality loses its shine if not enough people take the time to seek it out.And some of the food will be challenging to many Australian palates. The pigskin terrine has a subtle porky flavor and an intensely chewy texture, like a cool slippery piece of pork rubber topped with delicious garlic chives coated in a tangy soy, sesame and garlic sauce. Much of the banchan is unapologetically funky or bitter or viscous. These are all things that might be appreciated by an audience well versed in the incredible variety of Korean food, but that variety is not readily available here.I hope that I\u2019m wrong. This restaurant would be exciting anywhere, even in cities where Korean food is wide-ranging and abundant. It is traditional and modern, Korean and Australian, challenging and comforting. It is confoundingly different. Most true evolutions are.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Advertisement"}

My dad got behind the wheel anyway.Dr. Hobbs is a professor of American history.I always knew that the lazy days of summer were coming to an end when my family piled into our 1979 black Cadillac Eldorado with red leather interior and began a two-day journey from Morristown, N.J., to Hilton Head Island, S.C.In the late 1970s, my father saw advertisements that touted the natural beauty of Hilton Head and he wanted to experience it. My parents decided our family would have a vacation \u2014 time for family bonding and memory making \u2014 just like other families. So, two weeks before Labor Day, my father hoisted a four-bike rack onto the top of the car and tucked our wooden tennis rackets into the dwindling pockets of space in the trunk. My father later remembered that he was not anxious as we drove through Virginia, but once we crossed the North Carolina state line, he took a deep breath, shook his head and sighed, \u201cWell, we\u2019re in the South now.\u201d He had lived through segregation in the North; once while riding his bike along 43rd Street in Chicago, he cycled across State Street and was chased back by a group of white boys. Still, the South seemed more dangerous, more violent, more unpredictable.A Southerner by birth, my father had moved to Chicago from Augusta, Ga., in 1939 with his mother when he was 3, taking part in the massive exodus of African-Americans from the South. When he went back to Georgia to visit his relatives during the summers, he was forced to follow Jim Crow rules for how a black boy ought to behave. Boarding a city bus in Atlanta, my father took the first available seat, in the front. His grandmother grabbed him and pulled him toward the back. Uninitiated in the South\u2019s racial customs and shaken by the bus driver\u2019s menacing look, my father turned to his grandmother and asked over and over, \u201cWhy, why, why?\u201d My great-grandmother was unflappable and strong-willed, and she left my father\u2019s questions unanswered because it was better not to offer an explanation of laws that were inexplicable anyway.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors.

The joys of \u201cjust going\u201d that the Beat Generation novelist Jack Kerouac waxed lyrical about in the 1957 classic \u201cOn the Road\u201d were very rarely available to black travelers, regardless of income level. African-Americans were largely left out of the car culture that flowered in the post-World War II period.Jim Crow was temperamental and capricious: Behavior that was acceptable in one town might not be in another town a few miles down the road. White service station operators generally would allow black motorists to purchase gasoline but they might refuse to sell the driver a Coca-Cola or to open the bathroom, which could cause great humiliation, especially in front of one\u2019s children.In Mississippi, laws prohibited black motorists from passing white drivers on country roads, where their cars might kick up dust onto white-owned vehicles.

Never mind that the editor of the magazine said she could not pay me. She offered me a place to sleep and claimed she would set me up with students who would pay to learn English. Best of all, she said I would have tons of time to write. I bought a ticket and went.As I tugged my suitcase out of the train station, I spotted a tall Caucasian woman, white hair piled atop her head, my new boss. Waiting in a black Mercedes was an older Japanese man. We got into the car and she introduced him to me as her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Years before, she said, they had been lovers.\u201cBefore she became fat,\u201d he said as he drove, and she hit him, hard, his body shuddering before he straightened and laughed low in his throat.I shifted uncomfortably in the back seat.He was in his 60s, she in her 50s. I would stay with her until I had saved enough money to pay for my own place. I had a return ticket and a tourist visa.That first night, I slept on the floor on a futon next to a tottering kerosene heater. I shivered all night and wanted badly to go home, but I was stubborn and had asked my parents for money too many times in my 24 years. To return early from my big adventure would be a pathetic failure.A week later, the boyfriend took me to a noodle counter for lunch. After he taught me how to slurp, we went to a real estate office. No one spoke English. Without my having said one word or looked at one apartment, I saw him hand over an envelope of cash and the agent slid over a key.He brought me to my new home: a tiny place with two rooms and a bathroom.\u201cFirst month rent is gift,\u201d he said. \u201cNext month, you pay.\u201dI was stupefied with gratitude and assured him I would have plenty of money soon. During the day, I read submissions for the magazine and managed to find a few students. I would go to their homes and they would feed me, filling my backpack with apples and pillowy mochi cakes. I spoke English but had no idea how to teach it, so we role-played. I would be the waitress, the bank teller.Back in my apartment, I would write on an old computer my boss had lent me. I had an electric heater I would drag around, keeping it so close that it almost burned my ankles. My money was dwindling fast. I had embellished every call home to make it sound as if I was doing fine. Asking my parents for money would reveal I was a liar.When it stopped being cold, the weather turned wet and my clothes and shoes grew a spindly layer of mold.It was during the rainy season that the boyfriend started coming to my door, showing up at night with a bottle of whiskey and bar snacks.I let him in.We would talk about American novels and Marilyn Monroe. He had no children but sometimes showed me photos of his dog. One evening, very late, he put a 10,000-yen note on the low table between us. \u201cYou need money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I need you.\u201dHe scooted closer. I could smell him, a mix of kerosene, damp wool and whiskey. \u201cOne kiss,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not so much for you. And money, this is not so much for me. But we need what the other has.\u201d Ten thousand yen was at that time roughly 85 dollars. My monthly rent was 24,000 yen. He had been so kind in finding this apartment, taking me to dinner, bringing me triangles of warm rice wrapped in seaweed. I thought he wanted to practice English. I thought he liked talking about books. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said. But he had seen how I hesitated, how I looked at the money, how I wanted it, and he knew that I would.I was still on that side of the sensual equation when a kiss was just a kiss. A kiss did not have to lead to anything; it was an act in itself. Kissing was separate from sex, separate from lust, similar to the way you applied lip gloss at your locker, knowing a boy would be watching. It was what girls did to flex new muscles their younger selves never knew existed. Not to say it meant nothing, but it didn\u2019t mean much. It would be a simple exchange then, 10,000 yen for a kiss. My youth for his money.We did this for a few months, often enough to pay the difference between what I had saved and what was due.I never took my clothes off, never touched him with my hands. He would come to my door and sometimes I would ignore his knocking, and other times I would drink his whiskey and let him slide his money to me. We would kiss. He would put his mouth on my mouth, just like that, no understanding of or attempt at romance, just a swoop and grab and his face would be against mine and his tongue, unschooled and thick, prodding my own.Sometimes I would feel guilty about the money. Other times I felt like I was suffocating and I couldn\u2019t bear his animal tongue and saliva, his sweat, his excitement, and I would shove him off, wipe my mouth with my fist, go into the tiny bathroom and loudly, cruelly, rinse my mouth. Sometimes when I began to pull away, he wouldn\u2019t release me, and I would feel fear.He was not much taller than me, but he was a man, and this was his country, and I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen if suddenly he were no longer satisfied with the poor offerings of my lips. But he always let go. Occasionally he begged me to have sex, claiming he would pay any price, or my rent for a year. He said he needed my energy. That I was his fountain of youth. I wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201cThen I will stop giving you money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you are poor enough, you will have sex with me.\u201dBut I had that ticket home. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this country first,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll never sleep with you.\u201dI was shy and ordinary, neither a knockout nor unattractive. I was old enough, though, to know that youth bestows its own beauty. Youth has power.My youth, my power, had never felt so real as it did those nights, his hands shaking as he reached for his wallet, as he found the correct bills and slid them to me. I would never touch the yen until he left. After I watched his Mercedes slink off into the night, I would run to pick up the money and count it, amazed such a small thing, a kiss I had given away for free for so long, could have such value. When I had enough students, I no longer needed to open my door to his late-night knock. Not long after that, I returned home to America and graduate school. For years, usually around the holidays, the boyfriend and I exchanged emails. And, until now, I never spoke a word of this to anyone.Twenty years later, I remain unsure about the right and wrong of it. The entire experience of Japan seems removed from my life, some precarious, incoherent dream. Now, when I think of those blurry nights, pride and shame are tangled in my brain. Pride in my resilience, in the way I was able to draw a line and not cross it, in the realization of a power I never knew I had. Shame at the depths I had to fall to figure out these things about myself. And relief, perhaps most of all, that I had my ticket home; I always had the luxury of escape.I still feel an uncomfortable sense of gratitude, for his having understood I was desperate and offering me such a transaction, for his teaching me that there are times when it\u2019s possible to play both predator and prey, for his decision to neither take too much from me nor give too little. For his showing me there are concessions you make that you never dreamed you would. And that, try as you might, you will never forget them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Beach for Manhattan", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "OpinionIt\u2019s not as far-fetched as you think.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Imagine this: a beach on Manhattan, a place to swim and escape the summer heat in the very heart of New York City. If you think that would mean slipping a hazmat suit over your bikini, bear with us; putting a beach on Manhattan Island isn\u2019t as preposterous as you might think. Sure, there are a few practical hurdles.Before we get too carried away, please don\u2019t just jump in: City officials warn that fierce currents run through many parts of the Hudson and East Rivers, making it too dangerous for most swimmers to venture in on their own. The strong currents mean that a public beach would most likely need to feature a protected swimming area similar to those in Copenhagen and Paris.Yet neither of those hurdles is insurmountable. A beach in Manhattan can be a part of that vision, drawing New York still closer to the waters it nearly abandoned to blight a generation ago but now happily embraces.The biggest hurdle of all may be a lack of imagination from Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose administration seems wholly uninterested.\u201cThis is a fun idea that would cost millions of dollars we believe would be better allocated to initiatives aimed at lifting New Yorkers out of poverty and building a stronger and more resilient city in the face of climate change,\u201d a mayoral spokeswoman, Natalie Grybauskas, said in a statement. Helpfully, city officials also sent a long list of things they would have to do to make the idea work. It included hiring more lifeguards, studying the river bottom, and possibly pumping sand, among other things. They also claimed that having a beach on the river would give people the dangerous idea that the river is safe to swim in at other sites along the waterfront. \u201cNo\u201d is the easiest word in the bureaucratic lexicon. Some of the city\u2019s most spectacular beaches are in southern Queens, leaving residents in Upper Manhattan and Harlem to travel over an hour to reach those shores. Some New Yorkers already swim unsupervised near Fort Washington Park underneath the George Washington Bridge, and elsewhere off Manhattan\u2019s shoreline. The City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, rightfully noted that people living in poverty enjoy a beach as much as everybody else \u2014 and are less likely to be able to afford a summer vacation outside the city. \u201cWhen I was growing up, we didn\u2019t have much money, but we would go to the beach all summer long,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI love the idea.\u201dFortunately, forward-thinking New Yorkers are pushing the city onward.Like Mr. Johnson, Borough President Gale Brewer of Manhattan is also enthusiastic about bringing a beach to the island. \u201cWhen we\u2019re investing millions in waterfront parks, esplanades and resiliency projects, we ought to be making it possible to go right up to the water\u2019s edge and even jump in and swim!\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMaybe for environmental reasons it can\u2019t happen tomorrow, but in a city that\u2019s stood 394 years, a decade or so of work to get there shouldn\u2019t worry us.\u201dPlenty of things are unimaginable, until you build them.

Running, an assistant professor in food and nutrition science at Purdue University in Indiana, and the study\u2019s lead researcher. But, \u201cthis is something you might actually be able to change about yourself biologically.\u201dOver the course of six weeks, the researchers had 64 study participants drink three eight-ounce glasses of almond or cow\u2019s milk with cocoa a day on alternate weeks, each time rating the drink\u2019s flavor. While chocolate milk might not sound like a bitter thing to swallow, it contained only four percent added sugar \u2014 a fraction of the added sugar in most chocolatey drinks found at the grocery store. As the participants\u2019 bitterness ratings decreased, the researchers saw changes in their saliva \u201creasonably quickly,\u201d Dr. Running said. But those changes did not last; a person would need to continue eating bitter foods to maintain their tolerance, she added. She and her colleagues think that by binding to the bitter compounds, the salivary proteins may not only make the food taste better, but may also prevent your body from absorbing them fully \u2014 whether this is protective or diminishes the foods\u2019 nutritional value, however, is unknown.\u201cThis is a novel mechanism for adapting to a mildly aversive-tasting substance,\u201d he said. But, he added, just because proteins bind to the bitter compounds in chocolate, for example, that does not necessarily mean the same will occur for cruciferous vegetables.While taste is often thought of as a psychological experience, Dr. Glendinning said, it is important to remember that our ability to develop tolerance for specific foods involves physical changes in both the mouth and brain. In that sense, he added, \u201call adaptations are probably biological.\u201d Dr. Running\u2019s study was exciting, he said, because it revealed a new tolerance mechanism.The researchers hope to try future studies with something even less tasty to drink. Eventually, Dr. Running said, the idea would be to study of whether the effect crosses over to other foods: could regular doses of cocoa, for example, \u201cmake a really bitter terrible-tasting tea taste better? Could we use less sugar in cranberry juice?\u201d Advertisement"}

At a time when the giraffe population is plummeting in the wild, the sale of products made with giraffe skin and bone is booming. They are issuing the report now \u201cto ramp up the pressure and show the public the true nature of the giraffe trade in the U.S., and show the administration that the public loves giraffes and really wants their government to take action to protect this animal,\u201d said Adam Peyman, manager of wildlife programs and operations for the Humane Society International. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford any additional pressure amidst what experts have dubbed the silent extinction,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are products that most people wouldn\u2019t be interested in, but I think it\u2019s important to raise awareness among the public to the fact that these things are sold across the country.\u201dThe trophy hunters, Mr. Peyman said, often take the head and part of the neck of the giraffe for their own use, leaving the rest of the animal to be sold off by the outfitter who arranged the hunt. The Safari Club International, which promotes hunters\u2019 rights and wildlife conservation, said in a statement that \u201cdespite the rhetoric in the media, legal regulated hunting is one of the most effective means of conservation.\u201d The statement also referenced the same 2016 IUCN study to argue that giraffe populations are healthier in nations like Angola where there is legal hunting; and have declined precipitously in Kenya where hunting is illegal. There is little solid data on the number of sales of giraffe parts in the United States, but the Humane Society obtained U.S. Fish and Wildlife data showing that there were nearly 40,000 giraffe products legally imported to the United States from 2006 to 2015. An investigator with the society\u2019s United States organization went undercover to 21 locations to track giraffe sales and talk to sellers. The investigator found a taxidermied body of a juvenile giraffe, selling for $7,500, according to the Humane Society, and a pillow made with an animal head, intact down to its eyelashes.On bible covers selling for $400 and equally expensive boots, the hair is removed from the hide \u2014 so it\u2019s not even evident that the source is a giraffe.Advertisement"}

(That\u2019s more than 17 hours a day.)And that doesn\u2019t count those of us who take work home.With that in mind, we spoke to Anat Lechner, a business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, about mental health in the workplace and how to avoid hitting a breaking point.What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point?The signs are usually emotional. \u201cYou can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don\u2019t work as hard,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it\u2019s important to understand what messy work means, she added. \u201cPeople who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.\u201dWhat are the best ways to personally prevent a breaking point?Avoidance and engagement. \u201cAvoid being on the grid 24-7,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. \u201cCarve out for yourself the three or four hours that you need every day to get off the grid and relax and teach the rest of the world, as well as yourself, that not all hours are email hours.\u201d And engage more effectively. \u201cLearn to collaborate better. When you learn the skill of collaboration, or working together, the work naturally gets distributed more effectively,\u201d she said.How can I help a struggling colleague?Talk, listen and lend a hand.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Keep your umbrella at the ready.Showers are very likely this morning, with bouts of heavy rain, and we may see thunderstorms.The day will gradually get drier and we may see a fair bit of sun before it hits the horizon.And the gig economy, as it\u2019s known, can come with its own pressures: a lack of financial security, access to health care or a comfortable place to work that doesn\u2019t make you buy a $4 coffee.But soon, New York freelancers will get a boost.At 10 a.m. today, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment will announce the creation of a \u201cFreelancers Hub\u201d at the Made in NY Media Center in Dumbo, Brooklyn.Think of the hub as a free WeWork with areas for networking, legal clinics for workers and workshops in marketing, accounting and filing your taxes.It\u2019s the first effort by an American city to create a hub for freelancers who work in the gig economy, according to the Office of Media and Entertainment.The new center, operated by the Freelancers Union, is geared toward freelancers in media and entertainment.It\u2019s slated to open in early October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Those Who Can Do, Can\u2019t Teach", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvice for college students: The best experts sometimes make the worst educators.Dr. Grant is an organizational psychologist.If you want to be great at something, learn from the best. What could be better than studying physics under Albert Einstein?A lot, it turns out. Three years after publishing his first landmark paper on relativity, Einstein taught his debut course at the University of Bern. He wasn\u2019t able to attract much interest in the esoteric subject of thermodynamics: Just three students signed up, and they were all friends of his. The next semester he had to cancel the class after only one student enrolled. A few years later, when Einstein pursued a position at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, the president raised concerns about his lackluster teaching skills. Einstein eventually got the job after a friend vouched for him, but the friend admitted, \u201cHe is not a fine talker.\u201d As his biographer Walter Isaacson summarized, \u201cEinstein was never an inspired teacher, and his lectures tended to be regarded as disorganized.\u201dAlthough it\u2019s often said that those who can\u2019t do teach, the reality is that the best doers are often the worst teachers. I\u2019ve come to believe that if you want to learn something new, there are three factors that you should keep in mind when choosing a teacher \u2014 whether it\u2019s a professor or mentor or soccer coach.First, pay attention to how long it has been since a teacher studied the material. Elite universities love to boast about how most of their classes are taught by top faculty. Yet most of my great teachers were graduate students. Because they had just learned the material themselves, they had an easier time remembering what it was like to be a beginner. Instead of studying under people who have learned the most, it can be wise to study under people who have learned the most recently.Second, consider how difficult it was for the educator to master the material. We often gravitate toward prodigies like Einstein because their expertise seems so effortless. That\u2019s a mistake. We should be learning from overachievers: the people who accomplish the most with the least natural talent and opportunity.In high school and college, I competed as a springboard diver, and I once asked an Olympian if he had a trick for learning to do three and a half somersaults. His answer: Go up in a ball and spin fast. He was so naturally talented that he never had to learn the mechanics. He simply did it. The most useful explanation I got was from my coach, Eric Best, who had spent seven years trying to get that dive right and was able to walk me through the physics with stunning clarity. The physical limitations that prevented him from becoming an Olympic-caliber diver himself led him to gain the knowledge to become an Olympic-caliber coach. This is why I recommend creating separate tenure tracks for teachers and researchers. Instead of just learning from researchers who spend their days dividing cells in a lab or churning out code in front of a computer, you can take classes with people who study the most effective methods for teaching cell division and JavaScript.Here\u2019s another flaw in that \u201cThose who can\u2019t do, teach\u201d canard: Teachers often turn into great doers. In education, we often assume that a successful career qualifies someone to teach. It\u2019s why business schools love to hire former executives as professors. But we\u2019re doing it backward: We should be sending teachers out to run businesses. Of course, there\u2019s probably a selection bias in the data: Maybe only the competent professors landed executive jobs. But this reinforces my point that doing and teaching are distinct skills. Being good at one doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re bad at the other.Being a great physicist doesn\u2019t make you a great physics teacher. You don\u2019t want to take your first physics class with Einstein. You want to learn from his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who has spent years figuring out how to explain what it would be like to chase a beam of light. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Accuses Google of Burying Conservative News in Search Results", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration.Mr. Trump added that \u201cthey are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\u201dLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201dIn a statement, Google said that its search service was \u201cnot used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d and be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201dInterfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.\u201cThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. \u201cThat being said, I think it\u2019d be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.\u201dWhat sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a \u201cneutral platform,\u201d they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people. \u201cWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word \u201cTrump\u201d were articles from \u201cleft-leaning sites.\u201dThe piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm \u2014 including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page \u2014 and that formula is constantly being updated.\u201cEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users\u2019 queries,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201dEven longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.\u201cThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.\u201dLong before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAlthough it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls \u201cmore authoritative\u201d news sources.The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jones\u2019s account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher.Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online.

Read the latest here.A body believed to be that of Mollie Tibbetts, a 20-year-old student at the University of Iowa who vanished a month ago after going for a jog, was found on Tuesday morning, investigators announced, and a 24-year-old immigrant was charged with first-degree murder.The authorities said the man was in the country illegally, but his lawyer disputed that claim on Wednesday.President Trump, who has repeatedly linked crime to illegal immigration, alluded to the case at a rally Tuesday evening in West Virginia.\u201cYou heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly from Mexico, and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt should\u2019ve never happened. Illegally in our country. We\u2019ve had a huge impact, but the laws are so bad, the immigration laws are such a disgrace.\u201dThe body was found in a field southeast of Brooklyn, Iowa. Ms. Tibbetts was last seen nearby on July 18, Rick Rahn, a special agent of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, said at a news conference.\u201cThe identity has not been confirmed, however, we believe it to be the body of Mollie Tibbetts,\u201d Mr. Rahn said. The authorities did not say what the specific cause of death was; an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday.The man charged in the killing is Cristhian Bahena Rivera, who lives in rural Poweshiek County, where the killing happened. He had lived in the area for four to seven years, Mr. Rahn said. Mr. Rivera\u2019s Facebook page indicated he was from Mexico.Investigators acquired security video during a neighborhood canvass, and a vehicle seen in the video was traced back to Mr. Rivera, Mr. Rahn said during the news conference in Iowa.In the security video, Ms. Tibbetts is seen running near Boundary and Middle Streets, and a dark-colored Chevy Malibu also appears, driving back and forth numerous times, according to an affidavit of probable cause filed Tuesday.Mr. Rivera was questioned by law enforcement officers on Monday, and he admitted to pursuing a woman running in the area with his car, according to the affidavit. He told the authorities that he parked his car, got out and ran behind and beside her. Mr. Rivera said she then grabbed her phone and said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna call the police,\u201d and he panicked, the affidavit said.He told the authorities that he \u201cblocked\u201d his memory of what happened next, which he said happens when he gets upset, but recalled that he came to an intersection in his car and turned back around to an entrance of a cornfield, according to the affidavit.Mr. Rivera said that he noticed there was an ear piece from a pair of headphones in his lap, and that is when he realized he had put the woman in the trunk of his car, according to the affidavit. He told the authorities that he then took her out of the trunk, noticing she had blood on the side of her head, before he put her over his shoulder and left her about 20 meters into the cornfield. He described placing corn leaves on her and leaving her face up, the affidavit said.He later led the authorities to the body.Based on the clothing found, and a tentative identification by the medical examiner, the authorities believe the body is that of Ms. Tibbetts.\u201cHe tells us that he had seen her before,\u201d Mr. Rahn said, but declined to elaborate on whether Mr. Rivera and Ms. Tibbetts knew each other.Ms. Tibbetts was last seen on the evening of July 18 while running in her hometown, Brooklyn, a small town between Des Moines and Cedar Rapids. Her family reported her missing the next day.\u201cShe regularly jogged around Brooklyn,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say her route was pretty sporadic.\u201dWhen he saw her on July 18 he thought nothing of it until he heard she went missing, he said. Then he called the police.\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching to know that I can have my daughter out here and I go inside for a minute and she\u2019s gone,\u201d Mr. Riley said. \u201cYou just do not expect it from a town like this.\u201dAhead of his remarks in Des Moines that day, Mr. Pence said, \u201cI just want Mollie\u2019s family to know: You\u2019re on the hearts of every American, and we will continue to work and we will continue to pray for Mollie\u2019s safe return.\u201dGabe Cohn and Andrew Chow contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "On a Ramshackle Compound in New Mexico, a Dead Boy and a Mystery", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMALIA, N.M. \u2014 Anyone trying to drop out of sight could do a lot worse than the hills surrounding this remote outpost in northern New Mexico, dotted with off-the-grid dwellings. But the sheriff\u2019s office knew something was terribly wrong at one such compound when they received the message.\u201cWe\u2019re starving,\u201d read the desperate plea, which found its way to the authorities.Executing a search warrant, officers were stunned by what they found last week: 11 children and five adults subsisting in squalor in a decrepit trailer half buried in the high desert. They were well supplied with guns and ammunition and had barricaded themselves behind adobe walls and piles of tires, but were meagerly provisioned with food; the kitchen cabinet guarded some russet potatoes, a bag of pasta and Folgers coffee.The search of the compound also turned up the decomposing body of a young boy, thought to be that of Abdul Ghani-Wahhaj, 3. His mother had reported that he was abducted last year by his father, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, 40, one of the men arrested at the compound. Prosecutors said in a court filing that Mr. Wahhaj was training one of the other children in the use of an assault rifle \u201cin preparation for future school shootings,\u201d as reported by the child\u2019s foster parent.The glimpse inside the trash-strewn compound has shaken people around this sparsely populated stretch of the mountainous Southwest, focusing scrutiny on Mr. Wahhaj\u2019s ties to a prominent mosque in New York, on little-understood Islamic healing practices and the ease with which renegades can hide out in New Mexico\u2019s backlands.Mr. Wahhaj\u2019s father, Siraj Wahhaj, is the imam at Masjid at-Taqwa, a mosque in Brooklyn. The elder Mr. Wahhaj said on Thursday that the dead child found at the compound was his grandson, who had a condition that provoked seizures and prevented him from walking. Authorities here said that the remains had not yet been identified.\u201cSomething happened and we\u2019re going to find out what happened,\u201d said the elder Mr. Wahhaj, who was leaving the mosque in Brooklyn on Thursday on his way to New Mexico. \u201cI want the truth to come out, whatever the truth is.\u201dPieces of the puzzling tragedy are starting to fall into place.Hakima Ramzi, the mother of the missing toddler, told authorities that her estranged husband, the younger Mr. Wahhaj, had abducted the boy late last year after saying he was taking the boy to a park in Jonesboro, Ga. Ms. Ramzi said Mr. Wahhaj had taken the boy with the aim of performing an Islamic alternative healing ritual known as ruqya, a form of prayerful meditation which is sometimes thought to mend damage from witchcraft.Mr. Wahhaj then had a brush with the police in December when the Ford Explorer he was in rolled over on Interstate 65 in Alabama. J.W. Earnhardt, the state trooper at the scene, said he was told that Mr. Wahhaj and others in the vehicle, including two other adults and five children, were on their way to New Mexico to go camping. He told them that he was traveling with his wife, and that they had recently moved to Tuskegee, Ala.Mr. Wahhaj was heavily armed, with two rifles and three handguns. He had a Kimber 9-mm pistol in a holster on his hip. A Glock .380 and a Smith and Wesson .38 special were in their factory cases, the officer wrote in the report, and were thrown from the vehicle during the crash.Mr. Wahhaj also had a bulletproof vest, several AR-style magazines and a bag that contained ammunition, according to the report.\u201cMr. Wahhaj repeatedly stated that he owned the firearms legally, and was in possession of a valid Georgia concealed-carry permit,\u201d the police report from the accident said. \u201cThere were several Qurans on the ground that had been thrown from the vehicle during the crash and a few other books that were written in Arabic.\u201dAfter arriving at Shelby Baptist Hospital, the trooper spoke to a female adult passenger injured in the wreck: Jany Leveille, who gave him a different story than Mr. Wahhaj had.She told the trooper that \u201cthey had not moved to Tuskegee, that they had only stayed there overnight,\u201d Mr. Earnhardt wrote. \u201cMs. Leveille also stated that she and Mr. Wahhaj were not legally married, contradicting Mr. Wahhaj. She then stated that they were traveling from Georgia to New Mexico to see Mr. Wahhaj\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s land.\u201d\u201cThe stories Mr. Wahhaj and Ms. Leveille told were different and both were vague and did not provide much detail,\u201d according to the report.After the rollover, they made their way to a plot of land outside Amalia, N.M., a ranching village near the Colorado border with about 200 people. Hispanic settlers founded the remote settlement in the 1840s; to this day, residents still irrigate their fields with water from a tributary of the Rio Grande.The remote compound lies at the end of a bumpy dirt road past the cemetery in Amalia. Aside from a couple of television news trucks, the site was empty on Thursday. Filthy clothes were strewn around the trailer, next to empty boxes of Remington rifle cartridges, operating instructions for Bushmaster rifles, notebooks scribbled in English and Arabic, a bilingual English-Arabic Quran and a third-grade home-schooling textbook.On the ground outside were battered pairs of children\u2019s shoes, broken bicycles, a basketball net and empty wine bottles. Columns of old tires were placed around the trailer, seemingly as barricades. A knife protruded from a bag containing empty boxes of ammunition.Neighbors said they were unaware of the activities at the remote site.\u201cYou see a little bit of drugs, a few break-ins, but nothing ever like this,\u201d said Lawrence Montoya, 77, a retired New Mexico state police officer who raises horses at a ranch near the compound. \u201cWe don\u2019t see much law enforcement around here. This is a place where people end up who might not want to be found.\u201dThe younger Mr. Wahhaj had already come under the attention of federal law enforcement authorities. In 2005, Mr. Wahhaj was part of an unsuccessful federal lawsuit in which he claimed that he was detained, harassed, fingerprinted and photographed by Customs and Border Protection agents at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York when he was traveling to and returning from Morocco.Mr. Wahhaj, who represented himself in the case, wrote in one of the filings, \u201cPlaintiff Wahhaj contends that the only reason for the \u2018suspicion\u2019 is because he is the son of a famous Muslim imam.\u201dThe elder Mr. Wahhaj has for decades been the imam of Masjid at-Taqwa, which several people connected to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center either attended or visited around the time of the attack. During the investigation of the bombing, the elder Mr. Wahhaj was named on a list of several dozen potential conspirators in the plot, though he was never charged in the case and the list was later criticized for being overly broad, some former terrorism prosecutors said.In Brooklyn, a spokesman for the mosque, Ali Abdul-Karim Judan, said in a video posted on Facebook Thursday that the news media and the authorities were engaging in \u201cpropaganda\u201d by wrongfully injecting mentions of international terrorism and school violence into what amounted to \u201ca domestic situation\u201d in New Mexico.\u201cThey\u2019re not bringing up accurate events \u2014 they\u2019re bringing up false narratives,\u201d Mr. Judan said. \u201cLook how this case has turned from a domestic situation, and now they\u2019re trying to create an atmosphere where his son is involved with an extremist radical group.\u201dThe authorities in New Mexico have offered few details about the alleged weapons training other than to say, in court papers filed this week, that a foster parent of one of the 11 children at the compound told them that the adults there had trained their child in the use of an assault rifle as part of a \u201cconspiracy to commit school shootings.\u201d At a court appearance on Wednesday, all five defendants pleaded not guilty to child abuse charges.In his Facebook video, Mr. Judan dismissed the weapons training allegation as \u201chearsay,\u201d noting that Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was legally licensed to carry firearms in \u201c36 states.\u201d\u201cAll you hear in the media is that they were heavily armed,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cEverybody\u2019s armed in New Mexico. New Mexico is an open-carry state.\u201dTaos police raided the compound last Friday, after receiving the plea for help, but local and federal authorities were warned months ago that Mr. Wahhaj and his son were at the site. A local couple, Jason and Tanyalyn Badger, told the sheriff\u2019s office in April that they had seen a boy in January and February who they thought was Abdul Ghani-Wahhaj, who had been widely reported as missing. The F.B.I. then conducted aerial surveillance and unsuccessfully tried to identify people at the compound through photographs.\u201cThere was no credible evidence at the time to what they were saying,\u201d said Steve Fuhlendorf, a spokesman for Taos County, regarding the tip from the Badgers. \u201cIt would not have been legal to enter the compound without more evidence.\u201dThe breakthrough came last week, when Imam Wahhaj said his daughter Subhana reached a friend in Atlanta, who then called the imam and relayed the message saying they were running short on food. Imam Wahhaj said he contacted the authorities, setting in motion the raid on the compound. Subhana Wahhaj, his daughter, was among the adults taken into custody by the authorities.In a video interview posted on Facebook on Thursday afternoon, Imam Wahhaj said that last year his son had taken his grandson from his mother and that the Wahhaj family had gone to the police. In recent months, he said, the family learned that the younger Mr. Wahhaj and his grandson were seen in New Mexico.Imam Wahhaj added that his son had cut off all relations with him, his mother and many of his friends. When he learned this week that the remains of a boy were found at the compound, Imam Wahhaj said he was devastated.\u201cYou can imagine how we feel right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe learned of the tragic death of our grandson. \u201cAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of the accident involving the Ford Explorer Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was riding in. It was on Interstate 65 in Alabama, not Georgia.Simon Romero reported from Amalia, N.M., and Alan Feuer and Serge Kovaleski reported from New York.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Details \u2018Excruciating\u2019 Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was at home in Los Angeles, struggling to maintain his composure. \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dIn an hourlong interview with The New York Times, he choked up multiple times, noting that he nearly missed his brother\u2019s wedding this summer and spent his birthday holed up in Tesla\u2019s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.Asked if the exhaustion was taking a toll on his physical health, Mr. Musk answered: \u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually. I\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dFor two decades, Mr. Musk has been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most brash and ambitious entrepreneurs, helping to found several influential technology companies. He has often carried himself with bravado, dismissing critics and relishing the spotlight that has come with his success and fortune. But in the interview, he demonstrated an extraordinary level of self-reflection and vulnerability, acknowledging that his myriad executive responsibilities are taking a steep personal toll.In the interview, Mr. Musk provided a detailed timeline of the events leading up to the Twitter postings on Aug. 7 in which he said he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. He asserted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for such a deal \u2014 a transaction likely to be worth well over $10 billion.That morning, Mr. Musk woke up at home with his girlfriend, the musician known as Grimes, and had an early workout. Then he got in a Tesla Model S and drove himself to the airport. En route, Mr. Musk typed his fateful message.Mr. Musk has said he saw the tweet as an attempt at transparency. He acknowledged Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it.Tesla\u2019s shares soared. Investors, analysts and journalists puzzled over the tweet \u2014 published in the middle of the day\u2019s official market trading, an unusual time to release major news \u2014 including the price Mr. Musk cited. He said in the interview that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 \u2014 a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dMr. Musk reached the airport and flew on a private plane to Nevada, where he spent the day visiting a Tesla battery plant known as the Gigafactory, including time meeting with managers and working on an assembly line. That evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he held Tesla meetings late into the night.What Mr. Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured\u201d has become an important question. Those two words helped propel Tesla\u2019s shares higher.But that funding, it turned out, was far from secure.Mr. Musk has said he was referring to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government investment fund. Mr. Musk had extensive talks with representatives of the $250 billion fund about possibly financing a transaction to take Tesla private \u2014 maybe even in a manner that would have resulted in the Saudis\u2019 owning most of the company. One of those sessions took place on July 31 at the Tesla factory in the Bay Area, according to a person familiar with the meeting. But the Saudi fund had not committed to provide any cash, two people briefed on the discussions said.Another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX, Mr. Musk\u2019s rocket company, would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet kicked off a chain reaction.An hour and 20 minutes after the tweet, with Tesla\u2019s shares up 7 percent, the Nasdaq stock exchange halted trading, and Tesla published a letter to employees from Mr. Musk explaining the rationale for possibly taking the company private. When the shares resumed trading, they continued their climb, ending the day with an 11 percent gain.The next day, investigators in the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Tesla for explanations. Ordinarily, such material information about a public company\u2019s plans is laid out in detail after extensive internal preparation and issued through official channels. Board members, blindsided by the chief executive\u2019s market-moving statement, were angry that they had not been briefed, two people familiar with the matter said. They scrambled to cobble together a public statement trying to defuse a mounting uproar over the seemingly haphazard communication.Mr. Musk said in the interview that board members had not complained to him about his tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t recall getting any communications from the board at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely did not get calls from irate directors.\u201dBut shortly after the Times published its interview with Mr. Musk, he added through a Tesla spokeswoman that Antonio Gracias, Tesla\u2019s lead independent director, had indeed contacted him to discuss the Aug. 7 Twitter post, and that he had agreed not to tweet again about the possible privatization deal unless he had discussed it with the board.In the interview, Mr. Musk added that he did not regret his Twitter post \u2014 \u201cWhy would I?\u201d \u2014 and said he had no plans to stop using the social media platform. Some board members, however, have recently told Mr. Musk that he should lay off Twitter and focus on making cars and launching rockets, according to people familiar with the matter.The S.E.C. investigation appears to be intensifying rapidly. Just days after the agency\u2019s request for information, Tesla\u2019s board and Mr. Musk received S.E.C. subpoenas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Board members and Mr. Musk are preparing to meet with S.E.C. officials as soon as next week, the person said.In the interview on Thursday, Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears.He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently \u2014 echoing the reason he cited in a recent public apology to an analyst whom he had berated. In the interview, Mr. Musk said he had not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMr. Musk stopped talking, seemingly overcome by emotion.He turned 47 on June 28, and he said he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday at work. \u201cAll night \u2014 no friends, nothing,\u201d he said, struggling to get the words out.Two days later, he was scheduled to be the best man at the wedding of his brother, Kimbal, in Catalonia. Mr. Musk said he flew directly there from the factory, arriving just two hours before the ceremony. Immediately afterward, he got back on the plane and returned straight to Tesla headquarters, where work on the mass-market Model 3 has been all consuming.Mr. Musk paused again.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dHe blamed short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet that Tesla\u2019s shares will lose value \u2014 for much of his stress. He said he was bracing for \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dReferring to the short-sellers, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb guys, but they\u2019re not supersmart. They\u2019re O.K. They\u2019re smartish.\u201dTo help sleep when he is not working, Mr. Musk said he sometimes takes Ambien. \u201cIt is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,\u201d he said.But this has worried some board members, who have noted that sometimes the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar with the board\u2019s thinking. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has on occasion used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Tesla executives have been trying for years to recruit a chief operating officer or other No. 2 executive to assume some of Mr. Musk\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities, according to people familiar with the matter. A couple of years ago, Mr. Musk said, the company approached Sheryl Sandberg, who is Facebook\u2019s second-highest executive, about the job.Mr. Musk said that \u201cto the best of my knowledge,\u201d there is \u201cno active search right now.\u201d But people familiar with the matter said a search is underway, and one person said it had intensified in the wake of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets.In response to questions for this article, Tesla provided a statement that it attributed to its board, excluding Elon Musk. \u201cThere have been many false and irresponsible rumors in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe would like to make clear that Elon\u2019s commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. Over the past 15 years, Elon\u2019s leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process.\u201dMr. Musk said he had no plans to relinquish his dual roles as chairman and chief executive.But, he added, \u201cif you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Prosperity Has Increased but Happiness Has Not ", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur well-being is local and relative \u2014 if you live in a struggling area and your status is slipping, even if you are relatively comfortable, you are probably at least a bit miserable. Mr. Rauch is the author of \u201cThe Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50.\u201dThat slap-down was an iconic formulation of a premise of the Thatcher-Reagan conservative revolution: Poverty is a social problem, but inequality, as such, is not. Governments should aim to increase the incomes and opportunities of all, especially the poor, but to worry about the gap between the rich and the rest is \u201cthe politics of envy.\u201d Morally speaking, Mrs. Thatcher and Ronald Reagan should have been right. As long as I am better off, why should I begrudge your doing better still? Yet something was amiss with this consensus \u2014 something that goes far to explain why Reagan-Thatcher conservatism has caved in under pressure from the populisms of President Trump on the right and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the left.Second, all happiness is relative. Although moral philosophers may wish Homo sapiens were wired more rationally, we humans are walking, talking status meters, constantly judging our worth and social standing by comparing ourselves with others today and with our own prior selves.In a poor country with low inequality, rising national income should make people happier, and of course reducing poverty is a good in and of itself. But in a wealthy, unequal country like today\u2019s America, gains in national income can decouple from well-being. \u201cEach person would become happier because he was richer, but less happy because other people were richer,\u201d Mr. Layard writes. \u201cThe two effects would cancel each other out, because relative income would be unchanged.\u201d In light of what happiness economists have had to say, the interesting question is not why the Reagan-Thatcher consensus finally failed but why it prevailed for two generations. Partly, I think, because its call to transcend envy is morally appealing, and partly because, in the 1980s and 1990s, pro-growth policies and free-market economics seemed to have turned around a troubled economy. But partly also because there was no viable alternative. Mainstream liberalism worried about inequality but offered only policies that much of the public viewed as discredited or unfair.Now the Reagan-Thatcherist alternative has crumbled, too. In 2008, the economic meltdown made the system look rigged and ignited a populist backlash. In 2016, the backlash coalesced behind the populisms of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders, each of whom had a compelling story to tell those suffering from real or perceived loss of status: We will de-rig the system with radical solutions like trade wars and socialized medicine. Those may be (as I believe) wrong answers to the problem of inequality, but they are answers, and their appeal is evident.Today it is free-market conservatism that is voiceless. After insisting for two generations that inequality does not matter, the heirs of Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher \u2014 people like the House speaker, Paul Ryan \u2014 have neither a coherent program to reduce inequality nor a philosophical rationale to seek one. Like it or not, inequality in today\u2019s America drives politics toward rage and polarization, and toward destabilizing and dangerous populisms of both left and right. Trumpism and Sandersism have something to say about inequality, but mainstream conservatism does not, and it will be no match for them until it does.Advertisement"}

Through a fuzzy speaker I listened as his new family eulogized a person who woke up every day with a smile on his face. His stepson wept as he declared that he considered my father, Alan Abrahamson, his real father. That was in January, when authorities believed my father had been murdered during his morning walk to meet a friend for a cup of coffee. A man and his two dogs had discovered a lifeless body in a Florida field. A single shot to the chest, and no sign of a weapon. The death made sense to no one, including the Palm Beach Gardens police department. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen here,\u201d a detective told me. Six weeks later, I received a phone call. The police had determined that the bullet wound was self-inflicted.

But it didn\u2019t include answers to the questions that haunt me when I\u2019m pumping gas or packing my 3-year-old\u2019s lunch. Did he go to sleep the night before he died? What was his last thought before pulling the trigger? Was he crying? Did he die thinking I didn\u2019t love him? The last time I saw my dad was nearly two years before he took his life. We met for dinner in New York City, where my husband, Dave, and I were living at the time. Our daughter, Nora, was 9 months old. We sat in a booth and Nora chewed on saltine crackers. When the server took our order, my dad said he would just have a cup of lentil soup. He patted his gut. \u201cI\u2019ve got to slim down for Ben\u2019s wedding,\u201d he told me. Ben was the stepson. I was relieved that it would be a quick meal because our conversations were strained. But part of me was sad, too.\u201cAre you happy?\u201d he asked me. I told him I was. I loved being a mom. I loved Dave. Living in a 550-square-foot studio not so much, but we were looking to leave Manhattan. I returned the question.\u201cOh, very much so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe drink every night. It\u2019s one big party!\u201d He began to gush about his golf cart and swimming pool. The police report showed that three days after our dinner, he typed \u201cundetectable suicide methods\u201d into his phone. This was not the first such search.From what little my dad said about his childhood, it seemed lonely. He was largely raised by a live-in housekeeper.My father never hit me. He rarely yelled. But he was withdrawn and distant. He went to work, then came home for food and stared at the television. I thought it was us, I thought we were not enough for him. And now I think he must have been depressed. That is how depressed people behave. But my dad cried at college drop-off. He didn\u2019t mean for me to see. I called out one final goodbye from the porch of my dorm, and when he turned around there were tears in his eyes. He wiped them away quickly. It was the first and last time I would ever see him cry.The summer I turned 21, he visited me in Santa Cruz, Calif., where I was living with friends and taking classes. He was trying to make up for lost time but it was too late. It felt awkward. We were overly polite, and ran out of things to talk about. On the last day of his trip, we went to a sunset happy hour. \u201cThis is the best part of fatherhood,\u201d he said, raising his glass. \u201cBeing able to have a beer with your kid.\u201dThe comment stung. It stayed with me. \u201cI don\u2019t need another drinking buddy,\u201d I wanted to say. \u201cI need a dad.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how to be one. He himself had never been parented. It wasn\u2019t his fault. Deep down I always understood that.He and my mother separated the following summer after 28 years of marriage. That was 2003. I chose my mom. I didn\u2019t have to take sides, but I did. I flooded his email with hateful letters, blaming him for everything wrong in my life. \u201cYou were a terrible father,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI will never forgive you. I won\u2019t go to your funeral.\u201d My anger began to lessen when I got married in 2014. I once read that a good relationship can heal old emotional wounds, and for me that proved true. We began to text and there were even occasional visits \u2014 like that time we met for lentil soup \u2014 but things were never great. I never met his family. During his murder investigation, I was interviewed as a person of interest. On Thanksgiving, his last one on earth, he sent me a message asking if I wanted to talk. \u201cIf so, I\u2019ll call,\u201d he wrote. I never replied. Another read: \u201cHave so much I want to talk about. Maybe one day if you are ready.\u201d I ignored that too. I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with it; there was just too much to unpack. Another day. People have asked me, \u201cWas it harder when you thought he was murdered?\u201d And my answer is no. The suicide is harder. It is so much harder. I thought he died in his prime, a happy guy on his way to meet a friend for a coffee. And my dad knew that. He knew a homicide would be easier for us. He knew we would blame ourselves for missing the signs. He knew I would blame myself, the estranged daughter who had not called him on his birthday in 15 years, who told him she was getting married but then said, \u201cIt\u2019s best that you don\u2019t come.\u201d My father was tormented by something. By what, we don\u2019t know. Detectives were unable to find a motive. But he spent nine years obsessively searching for ways to end his life. My dad told us so much about himself in his method. He tried to protect us all. That is how he said goodbye.If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). Advertisement"}

Trucks swept down the road by waist-high waters. Firefighters trapped during a rescue.These scenes played out across New York and New Jersey over the last three days as a series of flash floods hit the region.\u201cIf you look at the lives who have been disrupted, in some cases from their homes, perhaps permanently, it\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep seeing this happen.\u201dIn New York, Broome County was among the hardest hit. Speaking at a news conference there in Vestal, N.Y., Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he had seen \u201csignificant issues across the state, issues in areas that normally don\u2019t flood.\u201d Mr. Cuomo declared states of emergency in numerous upstate counties, including Monroe, Delaware, Seneca, Yates and Ontario, until Aug. 21. Social media postings provided an intimate view of the destruction. In Wayne, N.J., residents stood back as cars and trucks were swept down the road by rushing waters. On Tuesday, the Weather Service issued flood warnings to the counties of Essex, Passaic and Morris, while a flood advisory was sent to residents in the counties of Hunterdon and Warren. Five Monmouth County beaches were closed, along with area bridges and roads, following strong downpours on Monday. Though some roads were reopened on Tuesday, Thomas A. Arnone, a Monmouth County official, urged residents to drive with caution. \u201cThe county will continue working on all impacted areas as long as necessary and apprise residents of any changes in the coming days,\u201d Mr. Arnone said. Michael Laferrera, a police officer in the borough of Bogota, N.J., rescued a stranded bridal party on Saturday. The bride and groom and two members of their wedding party were heading to their reception when rising waters stopped their car. The bride, Sabrina Torens of Dover, N.J., was wearing her wedding dress as Mr. Laferrera helped her through the sunroof. \u201cI was a little shocked because we do rescues from time to time, but never a bride and groom,\u201d said Mr. Laferrera. \u201cThey were a little panicked. We were able to calm them down first, and then once they got to dry land they were just so happy and relieved.\u201d Soon after the rescue, the bride and groom were off to their honeymoon, Mr. Laferrera said. In a Facebook post, Chief Daniel Maye said the newlyweds\u2019 car had \u201cwater coming up to the middle of the car doors.\u201d \u201cThe street was dry,\u201d Mr. Cuomo recounted. \u201cFire department went in. Two hours later, there was rushing water waist-deep that was rushing so fast that, frankly, it was dangerous to walk through because you couldn\u2019t even keep balance. That\u2019s how fast a situation can become really dangerous.\u201d Everyone was rescued by the evening, said Michael Huff, captain of the Lodi fire department.Mr. Cuomo said he understood that some people didn\u2019t want to leave their homes, but urged residents to follow evacuation instructions. \u201cYour home can be the most dangerous place,\u201d he said. \u201cResidents should not return to their homes without an escort for safety reasons,\u201d the police department posted on Facebook. John G. Ducey, the mayor, added that \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be moving back anytime quickly.\u201d \u201cThis is the exact opposite of anywhere that flooded during Sandy,\u201d Mr. Ducey said. \u201cThis is the northwest portion of town. It never flooded before. I never even got a complaint about water in the road.\u201dSome in New Jersey blamed the scale of the flooding on climate change \u2014 and politics. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said that changes to waterway protections had left the state more vulnerable. \u201cWe continue to see more and more flood events across our state, affecting homes and communities and putting our waterways at risk,\u201d Mr. Tittel said. \u201cMore development creates more impervious surfaces and destroys floodplains and wetlands,\u201d he added. \u201cThis all contributes to increased flooding and storm water runoff, further putting communities at risk.\u201dGovernor Murphy toured Little Falls and Woodland Park on Monday, after a flood wreaked havoc there on Sunday. According to Mr. Murphy, 400 homes were affected. Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peloton\u2019s New Infusion Made It a $4 Billion Company in 6 Years", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Peloton\u2019s first two years in business, venture capital investors didn\u2019t get it. The company\u2019s founders struggled to convince them that blending stationary bikes and streaming live video classes would work. It had to cobble together money from a network of more than 200 angel investors to get off the ground.But six years and a quarter of a million bikes later, the company is the toast of Silicon Valley. On Friday, Peloton announced it had raised $550 million in financing from prominent investors led by TCV, a firm known for investing in Facebook, Netflix and LinkedIn. Peloton has now raised $1 billion and is valued at $4 billion.The combination of hardware and software that initially turned off investors is now viewed as an advantage. After Peloton sells customers a bike for $1,995, the company charges a $39 monthly subscription for the live video classes. Jay Hoag, general partner of TCV, compared the business model to Apple\u2019s iPhone and App Store. And he said Peloton\u2019s repeat revenue from subscriptions reminded him of Netflix, where he\u2019s a board director, and of Spotify, a TCV portfolio company.\u201cThey have a similar-sized opportunity to reshape fitness,\u201d he said.Peloton is on track to bring in $700 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in February, said Jessica Kleiman, vice president of global communications for Peloton. It plans to go public in 2019.Peloton\u2019s slug of capital comes during an influx of so-called mega-rounds of funding of $100 million or more. In July, 55 companies raised mega-rounds, the highest amount in the last decade, according to data site Crunchbase.Peloton\u2019s new influx of money will partly be used to fend off new competitors. Investors, seeing Peloton\u2019s fast rise, are fearful of missing out again on an exercise start-up.Flywheel, NordicTrack and a brand called Echelon all offer stationary bikes with video classes. A start-up called FightCamp is pitching itself as \u201cthe Peloton of boxing.\u201d And Mirror, a company making home fitness devices that stream yoga and Pilates fitness routines, has raised $13 million even though its product has not yet gone on sale.The money going to Peloton will also be used to expand Peloton\u2019s offerings. Fitness is a faddish industry, as anyone who owns a dusty set of Tae Bo tapes can attest, and indoor cycling is not immune. In May SoulCycle, a boutique indoor cycling company, withdrew its plans to go public, citing \u201cmarket conditions.\u201dThe company has plans to expand outside the United States as well, including in Canada and Britain, starting in the fall.The company has not yet shipped bikes overseas because it hasn\u2019t had music licenses in other countries. That hasn\u2019t stopped some enthusiasts from getting their hands on them. Last year, according to Mr. Lynch, a duchess in Sweden sent the company a photo of a bike being delivered to a countryside chateau.\u201cWe had this tsunami of demand from Europe and Canada from consumers asking if they could get the bike,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Grapples With a Maturing Adversary in Election Meddling", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThey covered their tracks, using software to camouflage their internet traffic. They created Facebook pages for anti-Trump culture warriors, Hispanic activists and fans of alternative medicine. And they organized protests in coordination with real-world political groups.The people behind an influence campaign ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which Facebook disclosed on Tuesday, copied enough of the tactics used by Russians in the 2016 races to raise suspicion that Russia was at it again. But the new efforts also revealed signs of a maturing adversary, adapting and evolving to better disguise itself, while also better imitating real activists.The coordinated activity \u2014 a collection of memes, photos and posts on issues like feminist empowerment, indigenous rights and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 show the enormity of the challenge ahead of Facebook, as it tries to weed out impersonators. As the forces behind the accounts become harder to detect, the company is left to separate the ordinary rants and raves of legitimate users from coordinated, possibly state-backed attempts to sway public opinion.Facebook said it had shut down 32 accounts that were collectively followed by 290,000 users. Many of the accounts had few followers, and the overall scope of the operation was smaller than the 2016 Russian campaign. The announcement from the company reinforced concerns in Washington that the federal government and social media companies would not be able to keep foreign actors out of this year\u2019s election.Facebook said it found enough evidence to shut down the accounts, pull the pages and remove the events they organized. But it did not immediately say who was behind the campaign, or where it was based, even as some lawmakers immediately pointed the finger at Russia.In some ways, there were similarities with the earlier Russian efforts, including those by the Internet Research Agency, the troll farm that meddled in the 2016 election. Pages posted on Facebook were often written in broken English, for example.But there were significant differences, too. According to Facebook, the recently revealed operation used virtual private networks to obscure its location. It also used internet-based telephone services, and routed Facebook ad purchases through third parties.The new operation focused on issues like feminist empowerment, anti-racist activism and liberal outrage over the actions of I.C.E., according to information released by Facebook on Tuesday, and additional data it shared with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Specific groups were targeted with narrow messages that would appeal to them, such as a wellness-focused page that posted a graphic about the dangers of genetically modified food.The recent operation also appears to have been more focused on creating offline chaos, by setting up and promoting Facebook events, such as a counterprotest to a planned white nationalist rally that was co-hosted by one of the suspicious pages, which also had real groups behind it. The event attracted interest from more than 3,000 users.\u201cThey\u2019re better integrated into groups and events,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, the director of the Digital Forensics Initiative at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. The new group\u2019s goal, Mr. Albright said, appeared to be \u201cpushing real-life events and connecting the online and offline together in some type of activism that results in conflict.\u201dOne of the biggest suspicious accounts disclosed by Facebook was \u201cResisters,\u201d a page that appeared to be run by feminist activists. The page\u2019s description stated its mission: \u201cOnline and offline feminist activism against fascism. Widespread public education and direct action, amplifying the voices from targeted communities.\u201dThe Resisters page, created in March 2017, accumulated thousands of followers with a mix of posts about gender equality and other progressive ideals. Its most popular post was about an anti-rape device invented in South Africa, with the caption, \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201dMany of the campaign\u2019s posts were similar in tone to ones found in 2016, when the I.R.A. used issues like the Black Lives Matter movement to inflame racial tension.A page called \u201cAztlan Warriors\u201d was set up in March 2017, a day before the Resisters page. Its description read \u201cWe empower our gente,\u201d using the Spanish word for \u201cpeople.\u201d With a mixture of memes and photos, the page promoted the mistreatment of Native Americans and indigenous Hispanic people by white people. A typical post, made on June 28, showed a protester carrying a sign that read \u201cIn 1492 Native Americans Discovered Columbus Lost at Sea.\u201dAnother page created by the group, \u201cAncestral Wisdom,\u201d posted an image of a dark-skinned girl with the caption, \u201cBlack girls don\u2019t have to be mixed to be beautiful.\u201dMany of these posts were stolen from other websites and accounts. But they showed that influence campaigns have become increasingly adept at mimicking the tenor of social media activists of all stripes, and turning online outrage into real-world action.None of this is rocket science, exactly. Any Facebook user could tell you that outrage performs better than calm equanimity on social media, and that heated discussions of issues like women\u2019s rights and the persecution of indigenous people are pervasive on the American left. And experts have suggested that trolls may be trying to build a large and hyper-engaged audience, with the intent of weaponizing the account for more strategic purposes later on.The people behind the Facebook campaign may have tested more advanced techniques. Several of the pages that were taken down contained links to a Facebook Messenger account, suggesting that the influence operators may have used messages to connect with individual followers.A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on whether pages connected with the campaign used Facebook Messenger, citing the company\u2019s continuing investigation.A side effect of the disinformation campaigns is that they make social media as a whole seem inherently untrustworthy, and give fodder to those who want to cast doubt on the legitimacy of authentic movements. Already, some partisans have adopted the tactic of sowing doubt about internet-based movements by painting their opponents as Russian trolls or agents of a foreign-influence campaign.This type of suspicion appears likely to grow, as influence campaigns get harder and harder to distinguish from authentic activity.Facebook\u2019s rules do not forbid people from suggesting, as the new influence campaign did on its network of pages, that electromagnetic radiation from cellphones causes life-threatening illness, or that I.C.E. should be abolished. The campaign\u2019s sin, in Facebook\u2019s eyes, was conducting \u201cinauthentic activity\u201d using fake accounts. Artificially stoked outrage is permissible, as long as you use your real name.\u201cWe should not assume that increased complexity in attributing actors means that we\u2019re not going to be able to stop this activity,\u201d Mr. Stamos said.Mr. Posner of N.Y.U., said that the disclosure of the new information operation should prompt all social media companies to take the threat of information warfare more seriously. He said the company should build teams of Russian-speaking analysts who are familiar with the methods employed by these groups, and specifically focus on threats originating from I.R.A.-type campaigns.\u201cThey\u2019re looking for ways to divide our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not limiting themselves to siding with one political candidate or another. It\u2019s a much deeper and more pernicious kind of activity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How College Basketball\u2019s Rule Changes Could Backfire", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Einhorn is a former graduate student organizer. Mr. Friedman is a sports journalist. Most notably, the new rules permit players to hire N.C.A.A.-certified agents before declaring for the draft. These agents will help players gauge their prospects; they will also be permitted to pay for certain expenses incurred during the recruitment process. But in practice, only a small minority of players will benefit from this rule change, because there are a finite number of credible agents and only so many resources to be spent on college prospects. These rule changes will create a de facto caste system \u2014 one that could inspire college basketball players to organize and advance their own interests, including receiving payment for their labor.It\u2019s understandable that players who are used to being the most talented people on the court would believe themselves singularly capable of beating the odds. While some may be motivated in part by school spirit, love of the game or the opportunity to get an education, this imagined future provides a primary incentive for them to perform. If these athletes believe playing basketball in college is a pathway to a professional career, then it\u2019s easy for them to think of it as something similar to an unpaid internship and accept working without pay. But the new caste system will shatter this collective delusion. It will force players who fail to secure representation, or realize they cannot secure it, to confront the reality of their situation: They are working a grueling job in exchange for nothing other than a free education with no hope of advancement. (A college degree is nice, but it\u2019s not the same as a paycheck. Besides, the rigors of N.C.A.A. competition mean that players often shortchange their education to devote their time and energy to athletics.)The more that college basketball players realize there is no promise of a high-paying career, the more difficult it will become for them to see their work on the court as anything other than a job that creates billions of dollars of value for universities \u2014 one that affords them no monetary compensation in return and greatly compromises their ability to get an education.This new awareness may very well pave the way for the kind of collective action \u2014 whether it\u2019s forming a union and striking or banding together for a class-action lawsuit \u2014 that will be necessary to force the N.C.A.A. to finally start paying all athletes. When 80 percent of college basketball players are reminded of the reality that they have no professional future, they may begin to see themselves as the unpaid workers they are and to engage in the kind of collective action that would allow them \u2014 not the N.C.A.A. \u2014 to determine what\u2019s in their best interest.Jesse Einhorn is a writer and former graduate student organizer.

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur.

{"Headline": "Why the Government Wants to Know Your Citizenship Status", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe civil rights lawyer Vanita Gupta answers vital questions about the citizenship question on the census, including what you can do to stop it.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The new documents give us evidence in black and white of something that many of us already suspected to be the case: The rationale that the Justice Department needs to go door-to-door to find out who is a citizen in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act is obviously a ruse. The documents show that, contrary to what administration officials have claimed, the decision to add a citizenship status question to the 2020 census was made in the early days of the Trump administration, and it was made without any thought whatsoever to the consequences for the success and accuracy of the census, for scientific accuracy or for the Census Bureau\u2019s own judgment.This isn\u2019t the first time that nativists have sought to have a citizenship question included in the census. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s always been a fringe agenda, and now that fringe is in political power. And this question is just the beachhead. It goes hand in hand with efforts to purge voters and restrict voting rights; with moves to strip citizenship from American citizens; and with schemes to revoke birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. But the mandate of the decennial census is one thing alone: to count every single person in this country. It isn\u2019t to be used as a fishing expedition to get random information on people. Also, we know that in this administration, a citizenship question is not benign. We know who the hardest to count communities are: communities of color, rural communities, urban low-income households, immigrants, children under 5. Even before the citizenship question was added, there were tremendous levels of fear among immigrant communities in particular around reporting personal data to the government. Consider what happened to the Dreamers, who were told by the Obama administration to trust the federal government and register in order to get some level of stability in their status. Then the Trump administration yanked that away from them, and their status is now in limbo. Remember also that a lot of immigrant families are mixed status \u2014 there are undocumented family members living in the same homes as legal immigrants and U.S. citizens \u2014 so the repercussions of this fear are significant. The Census Bureau encountered unprecedented fear about confidentiality of responses in September 2017 pretests, even without being asked about citizenship. The concern, which is understandable, is that their data will be used against them for enforcement purposes or otherwise.First, the census count serves as the basis for states to redraw their district lines every decade. Under the Constitution, those districts must be equally sized. The Supreme Court has been extremely demanding about the degree of precision in measuring equality. That was clearly right. The Constitution requires lawmakers to represent every single person in their district, not just certain people or fractions of people. We fought a civil war over this concept! And once you go down the slippery slope of limiting representation to citizens, you have to ask: Where is the line? Are we talking about all citizens or only those who are eligible voters? Because that would exclude children. Or what about only citizens who actually turn out to vote? If I then don\u2019t vote, does that mean my legislator won\u2019t represent me?Still, there are people who were upset with the court\u2019s decision in the Evenwel case and are trying to find ways around it. So the effort to challenge the Evenwel decision is quite alive and well, and it\u2019s playing itself out in state legislatures right now. My sense is these efforts are seeking to use various tactics to achieve the same end, which is to weaponize the census to redefine American democracy for a narrow set of people. They\u2019re trying to fundamentally change what this country is, and aspires to be, by creating different classes of people \u2014 including\u00a0people who may actually be here legally but who are rendered invisible for political representation purposes, as well as for the purposes of being part of the community and sharing in police, health care, hospitals, schools and the like.And the data that would come from the citizenship question are a precursor to that push, a necessary ingredient for states that want to make their noncitizens invisible. We\u2019ve had a lot of people ask if they should boycott the census. First of all, filling out the census is required by law. But more to the point, it would play into Steve Bannon\u2019s greatest dream, which would be to have a systematic undercount of vulnerable communities, particularly communities of color, that would result in reduced political representation and reduced availability of basic services.The bottom line is, this census is happening, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting so hard to undo this question.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Kashmir, Blood and Grief in an Intimate War: \u2018These Bodies Are Our Assets\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQASBAYAR, Kashmir \u2014 It was 9:30 p.m. when Sameer Tiger came to the door, a rifle slung over his shoulder.Most of the village of Qasbayar, a tucked-away hamlet surrounded by apple orchards and framed by Kashmir\u2019s mountain peaks, was getting ready for sleep. A few yellowish lights burned in windows, but otherwise the village was dark.\u201cIs Bashir home?\u201d Sameer Tiger asked. \u201cCan we talk to him?\u201dBashir Ahmad\u2019s family didn\u2019t know what to do. Mr. Ahmad wasn\u2019t a fighter; he was a 55-year-old pharmacist. And Sameer Tiger was a bit of mystery. He had grown up a skinny kid just down the road and used to lift weights with Mr. Ahmad\u2019s sons at the neighborhood gym; they\u2019d spot each other with the barbells, all friends.But Sameer Tiger had disappeared for a while and then resurfaced as a bushy-haired militant, a member of an outlawed Kashmiri separatist group that had killed many people, the vast majority of them fellow Kashmiris.Kashmir\u2019s war, a territorial dispute between India and neighboring Pakistan, has smoldered for decades. Now it is collapsing into itself. The violence is becoming smaller, more intimate and harder to escape.Years ago, Pakistan pushed thousands of militants across the border as a proxy army to wreak havoc in the Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir. Now, the resistance inside the Indian areas is overwhelmingly homegrown.The conflict today is probably driven less by geopolitics than by internal Indian politics, which have increasingly taken an anti-Muslim direction. Most of the fighters are young men like Sameer Tiger from quiet brick-walled villages like Qasbayar, who draw support from a population deeply resentful of India\u2019s governing party and years of occupation.Anyone even remotely associated with politics is in danger. That included Mr. Ahmad, who, when he wasn\u2019t sitting behind the counter of the village pharmacy, was known to host events for a local Kashmiri political party.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sameer Tiger said, standing at Mr. Ahmad\u2019s door, seeming to sense the family\u2019s anxiety.He looked Mr. Ahmad\u2019s son right in the eye.\u201cWe don\u2019t mean any harm,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father is like our father.\u201dMr. Ahmad rushed home from work and invited Sameer Tiger in for tea. They sat on the living room carpet talking quietly, then Mr. Ahmad nodded goodbye to his wife and son and left with the visitor.He didn\u2019t have much choice. Sameer Tiger was armed, and insistent, and had arrived with three others who were waiting in the road. The group moved slowly down the unlit lane.At a bend in the road, in front of a shuttered shop, Sameer Tiger and Mr. Ahmad started arguing, a witness said. Four gun blasts rang out. Mr. Ahmad screamed. The few remaining lights in the neighborhood were suddenly extinguished.India, which has controlled most of the Kashmir Valley for the past 70 years, is predominantly Hindu. The valley itself is predominantly Muslim, as is Pakistan. But as the days pass, the conflict has become less of a religiously driven proxy war.The rebellion, says Imran Khan, Pakistan\u2019s presumed new leader, is now \u201cindigenous.\u201d Mr. Khan, who clearly has a Pakistani perspective on the conflict, says he is determined to negotiate an end to it. His persuasive election victory last month \u2014 and the fact that India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, made a friendly phone call to congratulate him \u2014 suggests a breakthrough is possible.But India still loves to blame Pakistan for all its Kashmir problems, and Pakistan, according to Western intelligence agents, continues to send some money and weapons to militants in Kashmir. Many Indian politicians seem in denial that their own politics and policies might be a factor.India\u2019s swerve to the right in recent years, with the rise of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has deeply alienated its Muslim minority. Many top members of the ruling party have a very questionable record when it comes to treating Muslims fairly. This has emboldened Hindu supremacists across India, and in recent years, Hindu lynch mobs have targeted and killed Muslims, often based on false rumors. Many of the culprits are lightly punished, if at all, leaving India\u2019s Muslims feeling exposed.In the Indian-administered parts of Kashmir, where there was already a history of bitter conflict, the new politics have spurred more people to turn against the government. Some pick up guns, others rocks, but the root emotion is the same: Many Kashmiris now hate India.\u201cThis is what\u2019s different,\u2019\u2019 said Siddiq Wahid, a Kashmiri historian who earned his Ph.D from Harvard. \u201cBefore, in the 1990s, many Kashmiris felt we can negotiate this, we can talk.\u2019\u2019\u201cBut nobody wants to be part of India now,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery Kashmiri is resisting today, in different ways.\u2019\u2019The latest are children and grandmothers. At almost every recent security operation, as Indian officers closed in on houses where militants were believed to be hiding, they have had to reckon with seething crowds of residents of all ages acting as human shields.Walk through Kashmiri villages, where little apples are ripening on the trees and the air tastes clean and crisp, and ask people what they want. The most common response is independence. Some say they want to join Pakistan. None say anything good about India, at least not in public.But while protests against Indian rule have grown in number and size, the armed militancy has become surprisingly small, partly because Pakistan is not providing as much support as it used to. Security officials say there are only around 250 armed militants operating in the Kashmir Valley, down from thousands two decades ago. Most of them are poorly trained and militarily lost. But still, the Indians can\u2019t stomp them out.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d said Mohammad Aslam, a seemingly forthright police commander in southern Kashmir. \u201cFor every militant we kill, more are joining.\u201dBack then, he wasn\u2019t widely known as Sameer Tiger. To most, he was still Sameer Bhat, a 17-year-old high school dropout who had worked in a local bakery. The Indian security forces give all the known militants a grade: A through C, with A being the most wanted. Sameer Tiger was a C.The first place the police searched was Drabgam, his village. The shops are small, tucked into old brick buildings. The jobs are few. Like much of southern Kashmir, Drabgam hangs on the apple business. After the last of the apples have been picked in October and until the new crop is tended in the spring, there is little to do.Sameer Tiger\u2019s house is one of the more modest: one and a half stories of crudely finished brick, a couple of naked electrical bulbs dangling in the living room, some wet shawls flapping on a line outside. His father is a laborer and farmer who tends just a few acres of orchards. His mother, Gulshan, is chatty and welcoming. They live on a dirt road.\u201cSameer loves these,\u201d she said, pressing a handful of coconut candies into my palm and tugging me into their bare living room. The candies were exceptionally sweet and left a milky taste on the tongue.Sameer Tiger\u2019s parents said their son was a reluctant militant. One afternoon in early 2016, he was accused of throwing rocks at police officers. Sameer Tiger was working in the bakery at the time, his parents said, and they insisted he was innocent.But the police didn\u2019t listen and dragged him into a truck by his hair, they said. He spent a few days in jail. After he was let out, he disappeared.Soon his face popped up on separatist websites, his piercing eyes staring at the camera, his bushy hair now down to his shoulders, a Kalashnikov in his hands.\u201cWhen we saw that,\u201d said Maqbool, his father, \u201cwe said goodbye.\u201dTheir attacks tend to be quixotic and they usually die in a hail of automatic weapon fire. Their assassinations and killings are not militarily significant, more acts of protest against Indian rule. Of the approximately 250 known militants, police officials said, only 50 or so came from Pakistan, and most of the rest, the locals, have never left the valley.Sameer Tiger\u2019s parents said he changed his last name from Bhat to Tiger in honor of a brawny uncle with that nickname who was known for his immense strength.When I asked about the killing of Bashir Ahmad, his father looked down at the carpet. For the first time, he seemed embarrassed about his son.\u201cBashir was a good man,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cSameer wasn\u2019t there to kill him. It was an accident.\u201dIt might have been. On this point, Sameer Tiger\u2019s family and a survivor of the shooting seem to agree.The party used to sympathize with separatism, but to win control of the state parliament, it joined hands with the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party three years ago. Many Kashmiris accused it of selling out to Indian rule.In June, the alliance suddenly broke apart, leaving a vacuum in the State Assembly. India\u2019s central government took over running the state. Kashmiris are now terrified that the government will escalate military operations; the sense of hopelessness is rising.According to Mr. Altaf, as they walked through the unlit lanes of Qasbayar with the militants, Sameer Tiger urged him and Mr. Ahmad to renounce their party affiliation. When Mr. Ahmad started arguing, Sameer Tiger ordered both men to lie facedown and close their eyes.Mr. Altaf was shot once in the back of his right knee and not critically hurt. He thinks the intent was to send a message.But Mr. Ahmad was shot three times in his legs, the bullets moving upward toward his waist, Mr. Altaf said. His cousin, a lifelong friend, bled to death on the spot. Maybe the Kalashnikov jumped in Sameer Tiger\u2019s hands. Maybe he squeezed a split second too long.Mr. Altaf can\u2019t stop thinking about it. The betrayal haunts him.His cousin\u2019s death seems so pointless. He wonders if Sameer Tiger didn\u2019t set out that night to kill. Maybe, Mr. Altaf thinks, he just didn\u2019t know how to use his gun.These days, the Kashmiri militants don\u2019t have many opportunities to practice shooting, police officials said. It is not like the 1990s, when thousands of young Kashmiri men slipped across the border to training camps on the Pakistani side. The Indians have sealed much of the contested frontier, which runs about 450 miles.Kashmiris speak of a psychological tension that divides communities, individual families and sometimes even the same person. On one hand, people want to support a functioning society \u2014 to have their children go to school, get jobs, see some economic development \u2014 and Indian control represents that. On the other, they feel real sympathy for a cause, Kashmiri independence, that they consider just.\u201cLet\u2019s be realistic: India\u2019s never going to give up this land,\u201d said one young Kashmiri who asked that his identity not be revealed because he could be labeled a collaborator.He sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d\u201cInformation is coming in all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know their friends, their girlfriends, which houses they\u2019re using.\u201cThe trick,\u201d he said, \u201cis laying the cordon.\u201dOfficer Tak is another example of how this war is shrinking. He grew up in Qasbayar, a couple of miles from Sameer Tiger. Mr. Ahmad was his mother\u2019s brother. This winter he found himself, as the commanding officer of a tactical police unit in southern Kashmir, hunting the man who killed his uncle.Sameer Tiger was emerging as a militant\u2019s militant. He was increasingly active \u2014 and not just on social media.He attacked police stations, he recruited new fighters and he supplied pistols to young men to carry out assassinations, Officer Tak said. The police often discovered where he was hiding, and set up their security cordons, but he was slippery.\u201cWe almost had him,\u201d Officer Tak said in February. \u201cBut he escaped, dressed like a girl.\u201dOfficer Tak seemed dispirited by all the support for Sameer Tiger, and the fact that many Kashmiris consider police officers like himself to be traitors. Unlike soldiers in the Indian Army, which is recruited from across the country, police officers in the region come from within the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and dozens have been killed.Many Kashmiris see them as collaborators and call them \u201cModi\u2019s dogs,\u201d a reference to India\u2019s prime minister, who rose to power as part of the Hindu right-wing movement.Officer Tak said that Kashmiris had so little faith in the security services that when a police officer or soldier killed a civilian, people didn\u2019t even bother demanding justice.\u201cAnywhere else, they\u2019d ask for an investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, they just take the body and go away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s total alienation.\u201dThe hunt for him intensified but more civilians were rallying to the defense of militants, often barricading the roads as the police closed in and pelting officers with rocks.\u201cIt\u2019s getting very hard to do operations,\u201d Officer Tak grumbled.A few days later, on April 30, the army got a tip that Sameer Tiger was hiding in a house in the center of Drabgam. Though he was now a highly wanted militant, upgraded to an A rating, it seemed he had never strayed far from home.This time, the Indian Army didn\u2019t arrive en masse. They used mud-smeared dump trucks packed with soldiers wearing traditional pheran cloaks, guns hidden. The villagers thought they were laborers. The soldiers quietly surrounded the house and called for backup.The soldiers sent in two rounds of emissaries, including village elders, to persuade Sameer Tiger to surrender. He replied with a burst of bullets, hitting Major Shukla in the shoulder.The sound of gunfire served as an alarm, setting off an eruption. The village mobilized. Boys, girls, men and women scampered out of their houses and rushed into the road with stones in their hands. Mosque loudspeakers blared: \u201cSameer Tiger is trapped! Go help him!\u201d The whole town, quite openly, was rallying to an outlaw\u2019s side.As additional army trucks rumbled in, packed with troops, more civilians rushed forward, trying to insert themselves between the troops and Sameer Tiger. One young man was shot dead; the crowd kept coming.But the cordon had been well laid, growing to nearly 300 soldiers and police officers. The civilians, however determined, couldn\u2019t break it.Several police commanders said security officers then moved in, firing a rocket at the house. Flames burst out. Sameer Tiger scampered onto a rooftop. The soldiers opened up with automatic weapons from four directions. He was hit several times.On a Tuesday morning, May 1, Sameer Tiger\u2019s lifeless body, riddled with holes and soaked in blood, was hoisted onto a makeshift wooden platform in the yard of one of Drabgam\u2019s mosques. Thousands poured in from across the valley. For hours they chanted his name: \u201cTiger! Tiger! Sameer Tiger!\u201dBoys scrambled up trees and scurried across tin roofs, the light metal popping beneath their gym shoes, to find any vantage point. Others fought through the nearly impenetrable crowd to the funeral pyre, just to gently stroke Sameer Tiger\u2019s beard or to kiss his pale face goodbye. Many vowed to join the militants.One woman who identified herself as a separatist leader looked out at the sea of mourners and gravely smiled.\u201cWe are winning,\u201d she said. \u201cThese bodies are our assets.\u201dA few hundred yards away, on the rooftop where Sameer Tiger had been cornered, a team of boys wearing religious skullcaps scrubbed a rust-colored splotch. A crowd pressed in to watch.\u201cYoung ones, tell me: What does the spilling of this blood mean?\u201d one man shouted.The boys worked fast, heads down, sweat trickling off their temples. They used wet rags to mop up the splotch. They squeezed the blood-water mixture into a copper urn, to be saved. An imam watching closely told them to capture every last drop of blood.Hari Kumar and Sameer Yasir contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kofi Annan\u2019s Tragic Idealism", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe believed in the vision of the United Nations but understood that it might never achieve it.Mr. Traub is a columnist for foreignpolicy.com.At the end of the trip, flying back to New York, Mr. Annan told me he felt he had moved the needle by telling President Bashir that he could regain the world\u2019s good graces by ending the violence. I asked him if he really thought that Mr. Bashir gave a damn about the world\u2019s good graces. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t have any troops.\u201d He didn\u2019t only mean that the United Nations has no army to enforce its mandate, but that, because the Security Council was divided on this as on almost every other morally urgent issue in the world, he had no mandate.That was Kofi Annan, in all that he could and could not be. He was a moral witness with a unique capacity to force the world\u2019s attention on the unspeakable, in part by going to places like Darfur in the company of reporters like me. The pull of Mr. Annan\u2019s moral charisma ensured a large and global journalistic entourage. At the same time, Mr. Annan was a consummate diplomat and unfailing gentleman who perpetually disappointed the wish for melodramatic confrontation with evil; he smoked cigars with Saddam Hussein after reaching a deal with him to restore nuclear inspectors in 1998 \u2014 not because he felt comfortable in the man\u2019s presence, but because Mr. Hussein wanted to smoke cigars. And, finally, Mr. Annan was a shuttlecock batted back and forth by the great powers, too widely admired to be disposed of and too dangerous to be allowed to operate with impunity.The American diplomat Richard Holbrooke used to say that, for all the myriad things the United Nations does, it will be judged in the world\u2019s capitals by the great issues of war and peace debated in the Security Council. It is right, therefore, that its failure to act effectively in the face of genocidal violence in Rwanda and Bosnia will be laid in part at Mr. Annan\u2019s doorstep, for at the time he served as head of peacekeeping, the job he held before becoming secretary general. Mr. Annan had so fully internalized the United Nations\u2019 precepts, both its respect for the sovereignty of each member and the obligation to remain neutral between contending parties, that he could not break free of them when a supreme crisis demanded he do so. Mr. Annan recognized this failure, but he had a way of operating at a remove from himself. In the course of many discussions with him while I was writing a book about the United Nations during Mr. Annan\u2019s tenure titled \u201cThe Best Intentions,\u201d I never came to feel that his sense of guilt was personal. Yet he had a compensating sense of institutional responsibility: Mr. Annan\u2019s profound belief in the United Nations \u2014 and his certainty that the world would be a better place the stronger it was \u2014 led him to respond to these calamities with searing reports on the body\u2019s failures, and with serious reforms during his time as secretary general. In the aftermath of yet more genocidal violence, in Kosovo, Mr. Annan called on the United Nations to embrace the norm known as \u201cthe responsibility to protect,\u201d which dictates that states have an obligation to prevent atrocities both at home and abroad \u2014 and that the Security Council would adjudicate those decisions. The General Assembly adopted R2P, as it is known, in 2005. The world\u2019s failure to act in Syria reminds us that norms mean nothing without the political will to enforce them.The secretary general, indeed, has no troops; the United Nations can matter only if the great powers wish it to matter. And right now, they don\u2019t. The United States treats the United Nations \u2014 and virtually all multilateral bodies \u2014 with contempt, while Russia uses its place on the Security Council to block action against allies like Syria. China\u2019s global aspirations have led it to partly fill that vacuum, but China regards the United Nations as a club of states, not a force to protect individuals, including from their own government. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s vision of a world governed by international law backed by a concert of powerful states has all but dissolved; the world seems to be reverting to the kind of unstable great-power order that obtained in the period before World War I. Surely the greatest tribute to Kofi Annan\u2019s legacy would be to act in such a way as to make the United Nations the kind of force that he, and so many of us, wish that it were. Maybe that day will come \u2014 but not any time soon. James Traub, a columnist for foreignpolicy.com, is writing a book on the history and prospects of liberalismAdvertisement"}

Navalny, was sentenced to 30 days in jail on Monday for a protest that happened seven months ago \u2014 a move that he maintained was intended to prevent him from organizing nationwide protests against plans to raise the retirement age in Russia.\u201cUsually, they try to detain me on the eve of the protest, but this time it was a whole two weeks in advance,\u201d he wrote as he awaited the latest in a long string of rulings sentencing him to short jail terms. It is his fifth such administrative arrest since the start of 2017.The Kremlin has tried to distance Mr. Putin from that decision, and modifications are expected. Still, Mr. Navalny has been an effective organizer of nationwide demonstrations, and the government typically fears any protest that could gain momentum.In the protest last January, Muscovites took to the streets to voice their opposition to a fourth presidential term for Mr. Putin, who went on to handily win a March vote in which he faced no significant competition.The protest was part of a daylong \u201cvoters\u2019 strike\u201d held across the country. In videos uploaded to his YouTube channel, Mr. Navalny urged Russians to rise up against Mr. Putin and his allies. \u201cThey\u2019ve already spent 18 years in power, and now they want another six years,\u201d Mr. Navalny said. \u201cOnly you and I can stop them.\u201dHowever, on Monday he disputed the premise of the charge against him, saying that because he had not submitted the formal request to hold the protest in Moscow, he could not be legally considered its organizer.Mr. Navalny\u2019s lawyer, Ivan Y.

{"Headline": "Europe Worries as Facebook Fights Manipulation Worldwide", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The picture was just like many of the other Facebook posts criticizing Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union: a fake commemorative stamp showing a person preparing to shoot himself in the foot.Facebook has spent the past two years trying to block foreign propaganda in the United States. But its disclosure of hundreds of fake accounts and pages, including the one tied to the Iranian-backed group, revealed that the foreign manipulation of elections through Facebook extends across the globe. Tactics used by Russia-linked groups ahead of the 2016 presidential election are being applied in Britain, the Middle East and Latin America.Europe, where Facebook has more users than in the United States, is particularly worried. The company\u2019s announcement exacerbated concerns that the region will be a regular target of foreign propaganda efforts \u2014 including ahead of next year\u2019s European Parliament elections, which will help set the policy direction in Brussels for the next five years.The discovery immediately added momentum in Europe to pass new laws to clamp down on social media platforms, including rules to remove terrorist content and to restrict how voters are targeted with political messages online. Vera Jourova, a European commissioner who has been involved in writing new election regulations for the entire region, said, \u201cWe need to do more to protect our elections and tackle the online challenges to elections head on.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Jourova promised election rules would be introduced in the next few months, ahead of the European Parliament elections in May.\u201cFacebook can be used for evil, that\u2019s a fact,\u201d said Claude Moraes, a British member of the European Parliament who leads a panel that has been investigating Facebook\u2019s role in elections. \u201cFacebook can be used to manipulate elections, that\u2019s a fact.\u201dRussia has long viewed the European Union as an adversary, and influencing the parliamentary campaigns is a way to diminish its clout, said Mr. Moraes, who organized a recent series of hearings that featured testimony from Facebook executives.\u201cI have no doubt that Facebook will be a critical component\u201d of Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine the European Union, he said.Facebook said on Tuesday it had removed the 652 fake accounts, pages and groups. The posts from those accounts played up emotional political issues, including immigration, the conflict between Israel and Palestine, and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union.Facebook shared only a limited number of examples of suspended posts, many of which were the kinds of internet memes that are common in newsfeeds on the platform, using humor to play on controversial political topics.But unlike those targeted at Americans, the posts made public on Tuesday have a more international bent, including some written in Arabic and Farsi. And in identifying Iran for the first time, Facebook acknowledged that countries other than Russia, which the company said was also behind some of the newly uncovered accounts, are now trying to manipulate its platform to intensify political divisions abroad.\u201cThe real concern here is this new evidence suggests that other regimes are learning from what Russia achieved,\u201d said Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University studying the use of social media to spread misinformation. \u201cThe Iranian government saw what impact Russia had with its communications campaign and they are sinking resources into this as well.\u201dOver all, the posts show an attempt to exacerbate divisions that already exist. One featured a cartoon supporting Boris Johnson, a former member of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s cabinet, to replace her as prime minister, while another backed Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party. (A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn declined to comment.)While the reaction in Britain was immediate and vocal, officials in the Middle East and Latin America, where similar propaganda efforts were made, were initially silent.In the Middle East, Facebook is a key source of news and is frequently used as a platform for political discussions, but citizens are also more accustomed to navigating state-backed propaganda, potentially muting the impact of information campaigns in the region.Facebook\u2019s announcement made few waves in Israel or the Palestinian territories, where the social media system is already filled with nationalistic and political messaging. Some even downplayed the significance of the company\u2019s moves, describing it as possibly part of an in-house public relations exercise.\u201cFacebook removes suspicious accounts all the time,\u201d said Gabi Siboni, director of the cyber security program at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. He said Facebook was playing a \u201cgame of cat and mouse.\u201d As the company changes its policies, or adjusts its algorithm, outside groups adapt.Many of the posts deleted by Facebook supported pro-Iran causes, or attacked Israel and promoted the Palestinian territories. Others included language critical of President Trump.David Balson, a former official at Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the country\u2019s equivalent of the National Security Agency, said Facebook\u2019s global platform made it an enticing place for government-backed groups to influence public debate. In effect, it offered a cheap and fast way to spread a message.\u201cIn the Cold War, you needed to set up radio stations or print newspapers,\u201d said Mr. Balson, who is now director of intelligence at Ripjar, a data analytics company. \u201cNow all you need is a laptop and a credit card.\u201dHe said Facebook had to find more sustainable solutions to fighting misinformation than suspending accounts, and argued that many groups would continue their work, but under new names. Each new disclosure, Mr. Balson said, made him wonder what other campaigns were being waged on the social network.\u201cIt\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s out there,\u201d he said.Reporting was contributed by Irit Pazner Garshowitz from Jerusalem, Isabel Kershner from Tel Aviv, and Margaret Coker from Dubai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBarbara Rae-Venter\u2019s genealogical sleuthing acumen has inspired others to help law enforcement with unsolved cases, as well as an ethics and privacy debate.\u201cI was worried about my safety, which is why it\u2019s taken me so long to come out of the closet,\u201d said Barbara Rae-Venter.Last week, the 70-year-old former attorney, who lives in California, decided she was ready, allowing Paul Holes, a retired investigator at the Contra Costa District Attorney\u2019s Office to name her in a tweet:The response to the role she played in identifying Joseph DeAngelo, a former police officer, now charged with killing 13 women and men across California in the 1970s and 1980s, has moved her. \u201cI am a retired patent attorney,\u201d said Ms. Rae-Venter, who lives on California\u2019s central coast. \u201cNone of this is a planned event.\u201d \u201cI thought it would really nice if I could help him but had no idea how,\u201d said Ms. Rae-Venter. She found that the website DNAAdoption.org offered a class on how to use DNA matches, family trees and public records to find one\u2019s biological parents. Although she insists that she still considers genetic genealogy a hobby, she\u2019s now talking to various law enforcement agencies about 50 cases involving homicide and unidentified victims.In 2015, Ms. Rae-Venter assisted a detective who was trying to figure out the identity of a woman named Lisa who had been kidnapped as a baby. It took 20,000 hours and the assistance of more than 100 volunteers. But ultimately Ms. Rae-Venter used her techniques find the woman\u2019s birth name, Dawn, and connected her with her grandfather, who was her closest living relative interested in a connection. Ms. Rae-Venter was able to narrow Lisa's likely father down to a grouping of brothers. All had been married at the time of her birth and those that could be located refused DNA testing. Still Lisa had gone from knowing nothing about who she was to holding a family tree containing thousands of people. Ms. Rae-Venter was not the only genealogist approached by law enforcement. At genealogy conferences, a debate about whether or not to cooperate was raging. It\u2019s not possible for law enforcement to search a genealogy site like 23andMe without a court order. But genealogists solving adoption cases knew there was a workaround. They could upload crime scene evidence to GEDmatch, a sort of Wikipedia of DNA that has a looser customer service agreement. Ms. Rae-Venter said she was not aware of these conversations.\u201cI didn\u2019t get into any debates,\u201d she said. Rather, after a review of Mr. Holes\u2019s previous cases, she agreed to help him. It was only later that she was told the details of the Golden State Killer case. \u201cThis man needs to come off the street,\u201d she said. There is a misconception that solving a case using this new approach is as simple as finding a genetic match in a database. \u201cDNA is an initial baby clue,\u201d said Ms. Rae-Venter. There were obstacles to overcome in the Golden State Killer case. A crucial step involves following cousins back until a common ancestor is identified. Many of the suspect\u2019s relatives were recent Italian immigrants \u2014 and so the team hit dead ends in locating family tree data. Ms. Rae-Venter then guided the team in how to fill out the branches using birth records, newspaper clippings, social media profiles and family tree data. Her trainees, which included two people from the F.B.I., two people from the Sacramento County district attorney\u2019s office along with Mr. Holes, were quick studies, she said.After several months, a handful of men emerged as candidates for further investigation because of their ages and histories in California. The team took a voluntary DNA sample from the man who looked like the most likely suspect. He was not a match. But he was closely related to the Golden State Killer, which was helpful information.Ms. Rae-Venter then turned to an eye color prediction tool on GEDmatch. It said that the suspect\u2019s eyes were blue. A site called Promethease.com, created for health risk analysis, suggested that the suspect would bald prematurely.Only one man they were looking at \u2014 Mr. DeAngelo \u2014 had blue eyes. A DMV photo showed a receding hairline.Investigators knew that these types of predictions could be misleading. But they illustrate how layers of clues built up to reinforce moving in a certain direction. Soon after the Golden State Killer announcement, Parabon, a forensic consulting firm, said it would be launching a genealogical arm. CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist known for her work on adoption cases, went on to announce breakthroughs in six murder cases and two sexual assault cases. Because these women have been public about their work, Ms. Rae-Venter said she felt safer coming forward. If multiple people were out there identifying perpetrators from semen or blood, it helped make any one genealogist less of a target.But other genealogists feel that in the excitement about helping catch the Golden State Killer, some in their community are failing to remember that cooperation comes at a cost. Once they\u2019ve turned over their insights about all that can be gleaned from public family tree and genetic data to law enforcement, there is no taking them back if they don\u2019t like how the techniques are being used. Ms. Rae-Venter agrees that these investigations have the potential to go off the rails. She has seen it in her work with adoptees.\u201cThere are people who are self-proclaimed \u2018search angels.\u2019 They are charging adoptees money and they really don\u2019t know what they are doing,\u201d she said. After hearing reports of genealogists showing up at police departments to offer their services, Ms. Rae-Venter has been reminded why a certification process could be useful.  \u201cIf anyone gets it wrong it could damage this whole, emerging field,\u201d she said.Not yet.The cousin is from Britain. Finding genetic matches and family tree data for people outside the United States is exponentially more difficult. But just recently a new match popped up, and so this may be the year she solves that case as well. An earlier version of this article misstated the genders of people the man known as the Golden State Killer is charged with killing. It is 13 women and men, not 13 women.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jewish State\u2019s Nation-State Bill Non-Scandal", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow a law became something quite different in the media.Opinion ColumnistAnyone who follows the news from Israel knows that the Knesset last month passed legislation that takes the Jewish state a step closer to apartheid and outright theocracy. For instance, the bill explicitly authorizes Jewish-only communities and requires secular courts to adopt Jewish ritual law in certain cases. It also promotes the settlements.Actually, the nation-state bill, as the legislation is known, does none of that. Nearly all of its most controversial provisions were stripped from it before passage. But you\u2019d be forgiven for assuming otherwise based on the reaction to the bill \u2014 reaction that is far more revealing than the bill itself.If you\u2019re shrugging at most of this, you should: The bill\u2019s purpose was to codify into Israel\u2019s Basic Laws \u2014 akin to a constitution \u2014 aspects of Israeli identity long taken for granted by Israelis and outsiders alike.Whatever else you think of Israel\u2019s nation-state bill, this is undoubtedly worse. So where are the calls to boycott, divest and sanction Denmark?Shoddy reporting about the bill from some of the usual suspects furnishes at least part of the answer. Ordinary liberal distaste for a conservative Israeli government furnishes another part.And there are plenty of good reasons even for Israel\u2019s friends to dislike the bill as unnecessary, provocative, divisive and a transparent bid by Netanyahu to shore up his popularity in the face of corruption allegations and a military quagmire in the Gaza Strip.But if liberal Americans haven\u2019t (yet) given up on the United States in the age of Donald Trump, liberal Jews shouldn\u2019t be giving up on Israel on account of an overhyped, underwhelming law whose effects would be mostly invisible if they hadn\u2019t been so loudly debated. Countries we love will inevitably do things we don\u2019t like or fail to understand. The same goes for people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Serial Cat Killer Is on the Loose in Washington State", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll across part of Washington State, cats are turning up dead.At least 12 have been found since February. And the violence is ramping up \u2014 seven of these cases were reported in August alone, the latest on Tuesday.The mutilated remains of beloved pets have shown up in public places around Olympia, Wash. \u2014 on front lawns, in neighborhood parks, even on the grounds of a church.There may well be more cats involved. A case reported in Lacey, Wash., in February, involved body parts that could have come from three different cats.The case has become serious enough for the authorities in Thurston County to set up a 10-person task force, led by a former police officer with decades of experience investigating animal cases.The team, which includes a homicide detective, was to meet Thursday to put together a game plan for hunting down the cat killer. If found, the person could face as much as two years in prison for each cat killed.On Tuesday, a cat was found dead in Olympia, near where another cat\u2019s body had been discovered just days before. All the signs indicate that the killer was the same one who has been plaguing the county for months, the authorities say.The cat had been slit down the stomach and laid out, just like the other cats found in Olympia. The cats were \u201cdisplayed for people to see,\u201d said Erika Johnson, the animal cruelty investigator leading the task force. \u201cKind of like an arsonist goes back to the scene of fire. They want people to find these animals.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for shock value,\u201d Ms. Johnson added. \u201cIt\u2019s like a trophy.\u201dIn most cases, the perpetrator has been meticulous. The cuts are clean and there is little other evidence, an indication that the killer has experience doing this. In some cases the spines have been removed, in others the organs have been laid out next to the body. Some of the cats have been found dismembered.\u201cIt appears to be the same person,\u201d said Ben Elkins, a major crimes detective with the Thurston County Sheriff\u2019s Office.The killer has not been seen on video anywhere. The only slip-up was a surgical glove that was found near a cat called Tubby in Olympia, and potentially some DNA from Ollie, a fluffy white cat that was killed at the beginning of August in West Olympia.Ollie had fought back, and her nails are being tested.The results have not been disclosed, and Ollie\u2019s owner, Rhiannon Stockert, is struggling to deal with the loss of her pet.Ollie, a slightly overweight and cross-eyed cat that liked to sleep indoors, was discovered with her spine ripped out and displayed not far from home. Ms. Stockert has struggled to sleep since the killing. She eyes people who walk past warily and has had security cameras installed.\u201cShe\u2019s family,\u201d said Ms. Stockert, breaking into tears during a phone interview. The episode has made her fearful that the killer may return, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a creepy feeling to know that this person has that type of evil in them.\u201dAlthough there is no indication that the suspect in Washington has hurt people, it\u2019s possible that animal killings could lead to something worse, the authorities say. \u201cWhat if this is a steppingstone for a future serial killer, or a person who\u2019s going to do something to a human being?\u201d Detective Elkins said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their issue is, but it\u2019s not normal.\u201dSome people Ms. Johnson has prosecuted for violent crimes started with animal cruelty, \u201cjust desensitizing themselves.\u201dIt is possible that the cat killer could move on to people, Detective Elkins said.\u201cThere have been past cases where perpetrators were caught that turned out to be serial killers,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that the case in this?

{"Headline": "Facebook Is Asked to Change Rules for Journalists and Scholars", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook is being asked to change rules that restrict how journalists and scholars conduct research on the site \u2014 a request that raises unresolved issues about how the First Amendment applies to the social media era.\u201cWe understand that, in the wake of revelations concerning the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is facing new pressure to protect the data that users entrust to it,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThis pressure is warranted and indeed overdue. Addressing legitimate privacy concerns, however, need not entail the obstruction of public-interest journalism and research.\u201dFacebook appreciated the recommendations, Campbell Brown, the head of the company\u2019s global news partnerships, said in a statement, but she did not say whether Facebook would adopt them.\u201cJournalists and researchers play a critical role in helping people better understand companies and their products \u2014 as well as holding us accountable when we get things wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do have strict limits in place on how third parties can use people\u2019s information, and we recognize that these sometimes get in the way of this work.\u201dIf Facebook made the institute\u2019s proposed changes, it would be clear, for example, that journalists can create temporary research accounts expressing different political views in order to see which political ads are targeted at real Facebook users. Such accounts would be labeled to avoid fooling users into thinking real people were behind them.The letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asks him to voluntarily change Facebook\u2019s terms. But its footnotes contained the outline of a legal argument based on First Amendment concerns.A violation of Facebook\u2019s terms carries the risk of legal liability under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. That act includes a provision that forbids exceeding one\u2019s authorized access on a website, to permit civil lawsuits or criminal charges.\u201cIt\u2019s not crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are legitimate concerns about legal liability for violating terms of service. Criminal prosecution is very unlikely, but civil suits are possible, and in the absence of a definitive legal ruling, persuading a computer owner to change policies is one way out. It\u2019s a short-term solution that works at one site.\u201dStill, with more than two billion users, Facebook is no ordinary site. The Knight Institute asked Mr. Zuckerberg to respond to its letter by Sept. 7, citing the \u201curgency\u201d of permitting research on the site heading into the midterm elections.The institute included a proposed amendment to Facebook\u2019s terms that would permit journalists and scholars to use the otherwise banned techniques for the purpose of gathering information for the public, so long as they obeyed certain rules \u2014 such as not selling the data to commercial aggregators or advertisers.Facebook has sometimes instructed journalists or researchers to stop similar projects as a violation of its terms, the letter said, and \u201cthe mere possibility of legal action has a significant chilling effect,\u201d prompting some to downsize or abandon projects.Ms. Brown also noted that Facebook offers \u201ctools for journalists that protect people\u2019s privacy,\u201d including a technique for helping measure the performance of content on social media and a new method it is rolling out to analyze political advertising.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s Soccer Star Aims for a New Goal: Humbling His Own Bosses", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When Mohamed Salah is on the offensive, you better watch out.That\u2019s the lesson countless soccer opponents have learned from Mr. Salah, Egypt\u2019s goal-scoring maestro and sports superstar. But this week Mr. Salah trained his devastating focus on a new target: the bungling bosses of Egypt\u2019s national soccer association.In a blistering series of Twitter messages, video posts and leaked letters, Mr. Salah, 26, vented a summer\u2019s worth of frustrations against the leadership of the Egyptian Football Association for what he called its grossly incompetent handling of Egypt\u2019s short-lived World Cup campaign in Russia in June.Autograph hunters were permitted to knock on Mr. Salah\u2019s hotel door in the middle of the night, he said, while preening Egyptian celebrities barged in on him, invading his personal space. On long plane journeys, players traveled in economy class while their managers stretched out in business-class seats. Mr. Salah, who also plays for the English club Liverpool, couldn\u2019t even make it to the breakfast buffet without being swamped by fans.A good soccer association ensures that its players are relaxed, Mr. Salah noted on Twitter. \u201cBut in reality, I don\u2019t see anything but the opposite,\u201d he added.In Egypt, Mr. Salah\u2019s outburst came across as more than just a global star railing at domestic failings: It represented a rare, frontal challenge to the authority of a national institution in a country where dissent of any kind can be highly dangerous.Among those sent to Egypt\u2019s crowded prisons last week was Masoum Marzouk, a retired diplomat who called for a referendum on the repressive rule of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Others imprisoned since last year include a Lebanese tourist who publicly criticized Egypt, a woman who complained about sexual harassment, and several people who waved rainbow flags at a pop concert.Mr. Salah, arguably the most popular man in Egypt, is a different matter.During the World Cup, Egyptians vested their fragile hopes in Mr. Salah, inspired by his dazzling skills and small-town origins. His golden image had been burnished by endless accounts of his generosity and devotion to Islam: every time Mr. Salah scores for Liverpool, he falls to his knees as if in prayer. Even after the Egyptian team was knocked out of the tournament after three games, his halo was undiminished.So it was all the more striking to hear Mr. Salah and his lawyer rail angrily against Egypt\u2019s soccer bosses this week. \u201cYour World Cup failure is the direct result of the incompetent management which you have displayed\u201d since last year, the lawyer, Ramy Abbas Issa, wrote in a letter to the Egyptian Football Association. \u201cSuccess on the field took a back seat ever since.\u201dIn videos posted to Facebook, Mr. Salah lashed out at the bosses who made the team travel in the cheap seats. \u201cThey make us travel in economy class, which is exhausting for every player; all the other African teams fly in business class,\u201d said Mr. Salah, stressing that he was asking for the team, not just for himself.Stunned by the attacks, Egyptian soccer officials tried to defuse the crisis by turning to the playbook often employed by Egypt\u2019s political authorities when faced with an embarrassing situation.Some officials tried to ignore Mr. Salah\u2019s demands; other sought to deflect the blame onto his hard-charging lawyer, who was repeatedly referred to as a \u201cforeigner.\u201d (He is Colombian.) Still others patronizingly referred to Mr. Salah as a son of the soil who had become egotistical, or even suggested that his public defiance constituted an act of disloyalty.At a news conference on Wednesday, Magdy Abdel Ghany, a senior soccer official who drew scorn for traveling to the World Cup in a private jet, offered his services as a conflict mediator. \u201cThis huge building must find a way to deliver its messages to the public,\u201d he said, referring to the football association\u2019s headquarters.But there were few takers.\u201cIn a real country, the Egyptian Football Association would have stepped down and apologized to the public,\u201d said Nada Alaa, a soccer fan from the Nile Delta, speaking by phone. \u201cResign and relieve us after the abject failure,\u201d the billionaire Naguib Sawiris wrote in a Twitter post, referring to the entire board.Michael Wahid Hanna, an Egypt analyst at The Century Foundation in New York, said the dispute had an indisputably political flavor in a country where free speech had otherwise withered under Mr. Sisi.\u201cI think it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Mr. Hanna said. \u201cPolitical life is so stultified in Egypt; there are no frontal challenges to the state or big national institutions. So in that context, this dispute takes on political overtones.\u201dAfter a beach vacation with his family, Mr. Salah returned to Liverpool this month for the start of the Premier League season. He offered a reminder of his formidable talents when he scored in the 19th minute of his first game. His next game for the Egyptian national team, against Niger, is scheduled for Sept. 8.But before he will play, he wants the football association to meet a list of seven demands, including posting two bodyguards outside his hotel room, and granting him the right to refuse all \u201cV.I.P.\u201d meetings. Failing that, his manager has threatened, he will publicly call for the resignation of the entire football association.\u201cYou tried, in your press conference, to say everything and make it seem like I hate my country,\u201d said Mr. Salah with a stern face this week. \u201cThank God, the people know otherwise.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalshMohamed Ezz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In a 2015 interview with the Chinese online portal NetEase, Ms. Huang compared Hitch cars to cafes and bars.\u201cIt\u2019s a very futuristic and very sexy scenario,\u201d she told NetEase.It\u2019s a rare moment of self-reflection in China\u2019s internet industry, which has grown to rival Silicon Valley in both size and influence. Two Chinese companies, Tencent and Alibaba, rank among the top 10 publicly listed companies in the world in valuation. Four of the 10 most valuable start-ups are from China, according to CBInsights. One of them is Didi, which ranks second only to Uber.But the potential for abuse in China is severe. Corporations are subject to little scrutiny from state-controlled media until problems spin out of control. Spotty enforcement and slow lawmaking leave the public less protected from exploitation. Chinese people are fixated on their phones, spending four more hours on average a week online than Americans. The industry\u2019s extreme growth \u2014 the number of internet users has doubled, to 800 million, in eight short years \u2014 has created a culture in which companies prize money over users\u2019 well-being.Didi itself admitted this week that it had lost its way. In a statement on Tuesday, it said it would stop using scale and growth to measure its success.\u201cIn the past few years we forged ahead wildly, riding on aggressive business strategies and the power of capital,\u201d the company said in the statement from Cheng Wei, its chief executive, and Jean Liu, its president. In the face of lost lives, the statement said, \u201cthe whole company started to question whether we have the right value system.\u201d\u201cTruly disgusting, despicable marketing for Didi Hitch that\u2019s all sexual innuendo and all about \u2018picking up\u2019 girls,\u201d said Rui Ma, a technology investor who works in both Silicon Valley and China, on Twitter. She added, \u201cDidi are you running a service for sexual predators or a ride hailing app?!\u201dWhile it wasn\u2019t obvious to female passengers that their drivers might want to hook up, the drivers knew. Until Didi deactivated Hitch, the car-pooling service allowed drivers to share comments with other drivers on the looks of their passengers, leading some male drivers to seek out the ones others had declared attractive.The problem goes well beyond Didi. China has grown so fast that many facets of life \u2014 shopping, online banking, transportation \u2014 lack the sort of established incumbents common in the West. Tech companies can swoop in and become dominant in those areas. That makes Chinese companies appealing to investors. It also makes them potentially dangerous.My conversations with Chinese tech companies and their investors, including some from the United States, revolve around user growth and the amount of time they can keep users glued to apps. On occasion I asked why they lent their technology to the government for surveillance, or what they thought the social impact might be from the videos, games and endless feeds of mind-numbing information they send to the public. They either gave me blank stares or said their technologies were merely neutral tools.\u201cNo matter how we complain or criticize, bad companies, be it Didi or Baidu, simply won\u2019t change,\u201d Ye Ying, editor of The Art Newspaper China, wrote on her WeChat timeline. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped using Baidu long time ago. Should I delete the Didi app as well?\u201dEven with women in top jobs, the industry can\u2019t seem to shake the attitude. Ms. Liu is probably China\u2019s most prominent female technology executive.Hitch\u2019s suggestive strategy was overseen by Ms. Huang. In one corporate video the company compared her to Hua Mulan, the female warrior of ancient China, and promoted her as a skilled executor of the company\u2019s vision. The video\u2019s English title is \u201cLean In, Jelly,\u201d using her English name.The question now is whether Didi, and executives in the rest of the industry, can root out those attitudes to protect users.\u201cWithout the interference of a value system, the vast majority of them will choose their job performances over users\u2019 safety,\u201d wrote Feng Dahui, a former Alibaba executive and industry critic, in a WeChat post. \u201cThis is the ethical dilemma of most internet elites.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But a red lip costs $18.50 plus tax. Ms. Mann is a researcher and a writer. We were in a line that wrapped halfway around a city block, and we were talking about color: red versus pink, shimmery versus matte. One woman liked that peach gloss Michelle Obama goes for; another thought Meghan Markle had a nice defined nude thing going.\u201cSomebody might come out with swatches,\u201d said the woman in front of me. \u201cLast year a girl came out and showed us the shades so that once you got up there, you knew.\u201d\u201cI was just trying to Google for them, actually,\u201d said a brunette in workout clothes.\u201cWell, if you want that, I get the emails,\u201d said the first woman, and a group of us quickly clustered around her phone to study a digital rendering of nine lipstick shades, all free today only, only one per person, in honor of National Lipstick Day.\u201cI want Moxie,\u201d said the woman with the phone, whose superior knowledge and experience had quickly made her our leader. \u201cBut I\u2019d settle for Dare You if they run out.\u201dA curly-haired little girl with a tiny gold purse, waiting with her mom farther up the line, dashed past us and back again. We would all be standing there a half-hour later when her dad stopped by in a football jersey to take her home for her nap, and her voice would lift into a wail, her arms stretched back toward the crowd of women whose choice of Sunday morning activity suggested a shared commitment to both femininity and thrift.Why wear lipstick at all? I don\u2019t usually, but I\u2019ve been trying to wear it more often as I get older and vie for higher-paying jobs. It\u2019s a strategy, and it works. If you look at photos of successful women \u2014 whether chief executives or actresses or politicians \u2014 they\u2019re all wearing lipstick. These women appear confident, responsible and sure of everything, a surety that starts with their gender. Nothing says \u201cI\u2019m a woman\u201d like a red lip.This is what you pay $18.50 for: category affiliation. The same applies to clothes made for women and haircuts for women, which are exponentially more expensive than for men. I had a lot of time in the lipstick line to think about all this \u2014 the fact that the pink tax is unfair to women while also revealing us to be complicit weirdos.In a way, this made revolutionaries of all the women in line. Our culture demands that we look a certain way, and we had all dedicated our morning to ensuring that we could look that way without paying for it.But alas, the category of free is filled with even more land mines than the category of woman. An hour into our wait, I was fully aware that if I had worked that hour instead, I would have made enough to buy a lipstick and maybe even liner to match. I\u2019d also given away my email address and been instructed to wave my arms and cheer for a National Lipstick Day video. I turned my back to the camera and left soon after.If I\u2019ve learned anything from lipstick, it\u2019s that my face is worth at least $18.50, plus tax.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maria Konnikova Shows Her Cards", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA conversation with...The well-regarded science writer took up poker while researching a book. Now she\u2019s on the professional circuit. Dr. Konnikova is an experimental psychologist trained at Columbia University. But her latest experiment is on herself. For a book she\u2019s researching on luck and decision-making, Dr. Konnikova began studying poker. Within a year, she had moved from poker novice to poker professional, winning more than $200,000 in tournament jackpots. This summer Poker Stars, an online gaming site, began sponsoring Dr. Konnikova in professional tournaments. We spoke recently for two hours at the offices of The Times. An edited and condensed version of the conversation follows.I\u2019d been thinking, for a while, about what my next book was going to be. I was interested in the theme of skill versus chance and was looking for a way to get into it. A friend suggested I read John von Neumann\u2019s \u201cTheory of Games and Economic Behavior,\u201d the foundational text of game theory. Von Neumann, as you know, was one of the geniuses of the 20th century \u2014 the hydrogen bomb, computing, economics. And he\u2019d been a poker player. It turned out that all of game theory came out of poker!When he was trying to understand how strategic decision-making worked, he concluded that poker was the perfect analog, because it was a blend of skill and chance and because, over the long run, skill can win. I decided that poker was the way to go. I knew I\u2019d need to spend a few months living in that world. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to dedicate myself to this like a career, because otherwise it\u2019s just going to be \u2018a writer dabbles in the world of poker.\u2019\u201dNo, no. When I started this, I didn\u2019t know how many cards were in a deck. I hate casinos. I have zero interest in gambling.It\u2019s been an unexpected journey. I don\u2019t think anyone could have predicted that I would have gone in less than a year from not knowing how many cards were in a deck to winning a major poker title. I\u2019ve been studying, playing, living, breathing poker for eight to nine hours a day. Every day! When I\u2019m between events and in New York, I\u2019m reading, watching videos or live-streaming very good players.There might be a specific concept I want to work on, and I\u2019ll watch some videos of people doing this and take notes. Sometimes I\u2019ll go to New Jersey and hop onto the poker website at an internet cafe. Online poker is illegal in New York, but not in Jersey. I think he was talking about my background in experimental psychology. I did a doctorate on overconfidence and risky decision-making with Walter Mischel, who invented the \u201cmarshmallow test.\u201d I wanted to see if people with high levels of self-control made better decisions in risky conditions, like in the stock market. Usually, people with high self-control do so much better at everything than people with low self-control. But it ends up that in unpredictable environments like the stock market, successful high self-control people \u2014 when in an environment where control is taken away from them \u2014 take longer to figure things out. They are too confident and won\u2019t take negative feedback from the environment. For the most part. I\u2019ve been very lucky because my coach introduced me to high-level players. They are not only brilliant but nice, and they\u2019ve taken me under their wing. So yeah, there are people who aren\u2019t nice to me. I mean, I\u2019ve been called everything at the poker table. I\u2019ve been propositioned at the poker table \u2014 like, actually propositioned! Probably both. I called the \u201cfloor,\u201d which is management, and had him moved to another table. Obviously, the first thing people notice about me is my gender. And people stereotype. There are people who\u2019d rather die than be bluffed by a woman. They\u2019ll never fold to me because that\u2019s an affront to their masculinity. I never bluff them. I know that no matter how strong my hand, they are still going to call me because they just can\u2019t fold to a girl. Other people think women are incapable of bluffing. They think if I\u2019m betting really aggressively, it means I have an incredibly strong hand. I bluff those people all the time. There are people who think that women shouldn\u2019t be at a poker table, and they try to bully me. So, what do I do? I let them. And I wait to be in a good position so that I can take their chips. Just like life, right?The motive for this book was about getting back to what I\u2019d studied in grad school: the illusion of control. How much of our lives do we actually control \u2014 and can we tell the difference? People often ascribe everything good to skill. And then when bad things happen, they say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s bad luck.\u201d Or they say, \u201cYou make your luck.\u201d That\u2019s just empirically impossible. And it drives me crazy because luck, by definition, is something you can\u2019t make. Luck is just \u2026 randomness. So that\u2019s what I wanted to write about. Poker was a way into it.Now, it is true that I\u2019ve long been preoccupied with the darker side of humanity. I\u2019m interested in deviations because they make you notice the normal. In psychology, you learn a lot about the brain by looking at the deviant cases. When you ask if my books have a progression, I\u2019d say the world of con artists has a lot of overlap with poker because of belief, deception, figuring out what people are representing.Fraud really thrives in moments of great social change and transition. We\u2019re in the midst of a technological revolution. That gives con artists huge opportunities. People lose their frame of reference for what can and can\u2019t be real. Are there more con artists now? It\u2019s more that technology made conning easier. Before, if you wanted to con someone, you had to do expend a lot of energy doing research. Was a person a good target? Today, we\u2019re all on Twitter and Facebook, putting out all this information about ourselves. With cellphones and emails, it\u2019s much easier to inundate a large number of people and to catch one person at a vulnerable moment. In the past, the grifter would have a lot of misses. Now, they don\u2019t care if they\u2019ll have a thousand misses. All they need is one hit.For the next year, yes. But I\u2019m never going to stop being a writer. Why can\u2019t I do both? I love poker. Why would I stop? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maybe Your Sleep Problem Isn\u2019t a Problem", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conventional wisdom is that morning people are high achievers, go-getters, while late risers are lazy. But what if going to bed in the wee hours is actually an advantage?It starts off with a montage of perky professionals, rising before dawn in homes and executive-class hotel rooms around the world, stretching their gym-toned bodies and firing up coffeepots at an hour usually reserved for mating fruit bats.\u201cHere\u2019s to all 180 million of you early risers, go-getters and should-be sleepers,\u201d the voice-over says, as Disney\u2019s \u201cHeigh-Ho\u201d swells in the background. \u201cBecause the ones who truly change the world are the ones who can\u2019t wait to get out in it.\u201d It\u2019s basically the idea that Ben Franklin touted more than 250 years ago \u2014 \u201cearly to bed, early to rise\u201d \u2014 with everyone else cast as lazy or self-indulgent.But what if they are wrong? What if night owls are actually the unsung geniuses? What if we are the ultimate disrupters and rule changers, the ones who are better suited to a modern, postindustrial society ruled by late-night coders, digital nomads, freelance moguls and co-working entrepreneurs?Perhaps it is finally time for the night owls of the world to rise! (Just not too early, of course.)I knew I was different by the time I was 7 or 8. My parents\u2019 efforts to get me to sleep by 7:30 p.m. were pointless. I have painful memories of those nights, lying wide-awake with the lights out, my mind whirring as I watching the minutes on my old digital clock grind by \u2014 30 minutes, 60, 90. Only my hamster Stuart shared my nocturnal proclivities, rattling along on his squeaky wheel in the darkness. Things got worse in my teens. My father, who was an extreme lark, would wake up by 6:30 a.m. and storm into my room, huffing, \u201cSociety starts at dawn,\u201d as he yanked off my bedcover. He was not wrong. Schools, office jobs and sports leagues were all designed around a lark\u2019s schedule. And there was nothing I could do about it. The notion that I could simply reset my internal wiring with a little self-discipline seemed patently false, likely damaging. Keep in mind that my sleep hygiene, to invoke a term that had not yet come into vogue, was excellent. I didn\u2019t touch alcohol or caffeine, and found it easy to avoid screen time before bedtime, since the only screen in my house was a cathode-tube television serving up dreck like \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi.\u201dAnd I have it fairly bad. My body naturally wants to go to bed around 2 a.m. and rise around 10 a.m. Whenever I try to adjust to an early schedule, my brain is like mush. Conversely, I light up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree around 9 p.m., and for the next few hours I am my most me: alert, clever, inspired to create.Not that society has ever shown much flexibility toward my sleep cycle. I have had an office job for most of my adult life, and I am now married with two children under 10, so I regularly rise by 7:30 a.m., doing my best to fake some Fred Rogers good cheer as I pack lunches and get our sons off to school. As a result, I suffer chronic sleep deficit. That is, I have a so-called sleep problem, although technically, that is not accurate. I sleep fine. It is everyone else who has a problem with it. The book details how every human runs on a 24-hour circadian rhythm, an internal clock, which coordinates a drop in body temperature, for example, as it prepares for slumber, and cranks back up when it is time to wake. What larks like my father never understood is that not everyone\u2019s clock is the same. When night owls are forced to rise early, their prefrontal cortex, which controls sophisticated thought processes and logical reasoning, \u201cremains in a disabled, or \u2018offline,\u2019 state,\u201d Dr. Walker writes. \u201cLike a cold engine in an early-morning start, it takes a long time before it warms up to operating temperature.\u201d That might even serve an evolutionary purpose. When early humans lived in small tribes, as in the early scenes of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d staggered sleep schedules bestowed a survival advantage: Someone was always awake to watch for prowling leopards and club-wielding rivals, according to the book. But it has been downhill for us night owls ever since. The rise of agriculture brought fields to till at daybreak. The industrial revolution brought factories with 8 a.m. time clocks. Night owls were forced to adapt, and that appears to have taken a toll.I certainly know what it is like to burn the candle at both ends. When I graduated from college, I found the morning rhythms of office life to be an eye-opener \u2014 though not literally, of course. At my first job, as a newspaper reporter in Orange County, Calif., I was required to be at my desk at 8 a.m. I held that job for 14 months, taking only one week of vacation, but my body never acclimated. Night after night I would lie awake until 1 a.m. or later, freaking out about my inevitable exhaustion the next day, as the Santa Ana winds violently rustled the Italian Cypress trees outside my bedroom window. It\u2019s the old \u201cdress like your boss\u201d formula for success, but with chronotypes, not clothes. But what if the modern-day workplace no longer operates under that formula? What if being a night owl is no longer a handicap, but an asset?Tech entrepreneurs are even advertising their night owl tendencies as a status symbol. The traditional 9-to-5 workplace is starting to fall out of favor, especially in Silicon Valley and creative sectors where the workday is no longer tied to daylight hours. And, with robots and artificial intelligence further eroding the old system by taking over the routine tasks, the new workplace culture is less about punctuality and more about creativity and breaking the rules. This may not be a coincidence. The very essence of our chronotype makes us oddballs, prone to looking at life through a different lens. We are the weirdos who feel most alive skulking through the darkness, secure in the illusion that we own the world for at least a few precious hours every night while everyone else slumbers. In those wee hours, we feel the freedom to think any thought, dream any dream, safe from the scrutiny and judgment of the strait-laced world. Does that mean we are, in fact, narcissists? Perhaps. We are at least different. Maybe special. Granted, those traits may add up to embezzler as much as disrupter, but after a lifetime of hearing negatives about our chronotype, I\u2019ll take what I can get.It would certainly make my life easier if scientists somehow proved that night owls were a teensy bit smarter and a weensy bit bolder.

But less than a minute into the encounter, he is shoved, falls to the pavement and slams his head, causing his turban to topple over.The footage does not include audio, and Mr. Natt does not speak English and could not understand what the teenagers were saying during the assault, the police said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and later released, the authorities said.On Wednesday, the police arrested a 16-year-old, whose name was withheld because of his age, and an 18-year-old, Tyrone McAllister, who were both charged with attempted robbery, elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. The arrest of Mr. McAllister drew a rebuke and apology from his father, Darryl McAllister, the chief of the Union City Police Department, south of Oakland.Chief McAllister said that his son started to get into trouble with the law several years ago and had been \u201cestranged from our family and our home\u201d in recent months.It was not clear whether Tyrone McAllister, who was being held in the San Joaquin County Jail, or the other teenager, who was being held in the county\u2019s juvenile detention center, had hired lawyers. Mr. McAllister was sentenced to three months in jail in April for misdemeanor assault and theft, according to court records.While the Manteca police did not label the assault a hate crime, Sikhs in the United States have often been targets of discrimination, particularly after the Sept. 11 attacks. In some assaults, Sikh men have been wrongly assumed to be Muslims.In the attack on July 31 of this year, in which there have been no arrests, two men ambushed Surjit Malhi of Turlock, Calif., threw sand in his eyes and hit him in the head with what appeared to be a stick and a belt. His truck was also vandalized with a message: \u201cGo back to your country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John McCain\u2019s Parting Message: Our Greatness Is in Peril", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday\u2019s Republican Party is the biggest threat to the country that McCain served and loved. He offered an alternative.Opinion ColumnistJohn McCain was no moderate. He won Barry Goldwater\u2019s Arizona seat in 1986 and was, for the most part, a fitting heir to Goldwater. McCain supported a smaller federal government, a hawkish foreign policy and the typical Republican positions on abortion, guns and other issues. But McCain pursued his conservative ends through means that are depressingly rare in today\u2019s Republican Party. McCain believed in the American ideals of pluralistic democracy.He despised autocracy. He was willing to accept defeat when his side lost a political battle. He pushed for an election system not dominated by the wealthy. He came to reject racism as a political strategy. And in his dying months, McCain was one of the only Republicans to oppose President Trump not just with his words, but also with his vote.I expect the Trump presidency to end poorly for Republicans, in some combination of disgrace, unpopularity and defeat. If it does, at least some Republicans will be looking for ways to reinvent their party. They will want an antidote to Trumpism, a set of ideas that manage to be conservative and anti-Trump. What would a Republican Party more in the mold of John McCain look like? Second, a more McCain-like Republican Party would understand that racism is both immoral and, in the long term, politically ruinous. McCain had a multiracial family \u2014 the kind that is increasingly America\u2019s future. Rather than scapegoat immigrants, he took risks to pass immigration reform. After Charlottesville, he declared, \u201cWhite supremacists aren\u2019t patriots, they\u2019re traitors.\u201d Third, McCain believed in democracy and its vital, fragile institutions. He accepted his two haunting presidential defeats honorably. He has reportedly chosen the victors in those campaigns \u2014 Obama and George W. Bush \u2014 to deliver eulogies at his funeral. Most significantly, McCain fought for campaign-finance laws to reduce the influence of plutocrats.Imagine how different our politics could be if even some Republicans \u2014 \u00e0 la T.R. \u2014 occasionally took the side of the little guy against corporate behemoths. And even if you disagreed with McCain on as many issues as I did, imagine if the Republican Party ultimately came to resemble him more than Trump.Above all, McCain believed in American greatness \u2014 as a reality, not a slogan. He knew that the United States could play a unique role in the world, as a defender of freedom and human dignity. He also knew that the role was anything but assured. It required hard work, good choices, compromise and sacrifice. McCain\u2019s final message for his country was a warning: Our greatness is in peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Distracted? Work Harder! ", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrouble focusing could just mean that your work isn\u2019t complex enough, and that there isn\u2019t enough of it.Mr. Bailey is a productivity consultant. When it comes to focusing at work, there is no shortage of scapegoats to blame for our wandering minds. Social media, the ever-churning news cycle, chats with colleagues \u2014 these distractions can lead to a working state of mind that is far from focused. But there\u2019s one possible cause of frequent distraction we don\u2019t often consider: Our work isn\u2019t complex enough, and there isn\u2019t enough of it.This idea isn\u2019t a popular one, especially with those who feel they\u2019re already working at capacity. That\u2019s a growing number of us these days, when busyness \u2014 at work and at home \u2014 is seen as a kind of status symbol. But this busyness is often a guise for something else: We procrastinate by doing mindless, distracting tasks that make us feel productive, but in reality accomplish little. Can you change this innate human behavior? Yes, but you may need to take on more work, and work on stuff that\u2019s a little harder.Complex tasks demand more of our working memory and attention, meaning we have less mental capacity remaining to wander to the nearest stimulating distraction. In his book \u201cFlow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience,\u201d the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that we\u2019re most likely to enter into that state of total work immersion when the challenge of completing a task is roughly equal to our ability to complete it. We get bored when our skills greatly exceed the demands of our work \u2014 such as when we do mindless data entry for several hours. And we feel anxious when the demands of a task exceed our skills \u2014 as when we\u2019re unprepared to give a presentation. Understanding your skill level and skill set, and pairing those abilities with a worthy task, will make you more likely to be fully engaged in your work.Consciously taking on a greater number of complex projects is a powerful way to enter a mental state I call hyperfocus \u2014 an attentional mode in which one task consumes your complete attention. Your mind wanders less often in hyperfocus because you\u2019re more engaged. That means you\u2019re also more productive.Besides questioning the complexity of individual tasks, it\u2019s worth reflecting on whether you have enough work to do in general. If not, you\u2019re inviting distraction.Think back to your last tight deadline. Did that timeline offer the luxury of tending to unproductive distractions like scanning the news and refreshing Twitter? Probably not. Yet, on nondeadline days, it can feel impossible to focus on the task at hand. The research surrounding attention suggests that our minds are biologically wired to focus on anything that\u2019s novel, pleasurable or threatening \u2014 and distractions can be an enticing cocktail of all three. This is one of the reasons I recommend taming distractions in advance, and there are many tactics and tools to help you do this: downloading a distraction-blocking application for your computer, putting your phone in Do Not Disturb mode or just leaving it in another room can help.Once we\u2019ve removed distractions, we\u2019re forced to face our work \u2014 and it\u2019s often only then that we discover how much, or how little, we truly have on our plate. One hour spent hyperfocusing distraction-free can be worth an entire afternoon of distracted work.Later I realized this guilt came from the fact that I was working without intent. Intention is the key to productivity \u2014 when we have more to do than time to do it in, choosing what we do ahead of time becomes essential. Once I\u2019d tamed the busywork, I realized there was still space for meaningful work, and I took on more complex tasks, including thinking about the book that inspired this article.Here\u2019s an exercise: Take a few days to assess roughly how much of your time you spend on unproductive busywork, and how difficult it is to become engaged in individual projects. At the same time, reflect on your energy levels. Busywork can be a sign you need a rest; when your mental stamina is low, your mind gravitates to the easiest thing on your plate. But if you\u2019re still falling victim to distraction, consider the possibility that you might need to work harder \u2014 and smarter \u2014 on projects that will both fill your days and enrich your life.

{"Headline": "The Best Pork Chops Aren\u2019t Actually Chops", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy relegate pork shoulder to the braising pot when you could put tender, juicy shoulder steaks on the grill? Alison Roman makes the case.What if I told you the best grilled pork chop in the world is actually not a chop at all, but sliced pork shoulder? Marbled with and surrounded by fat, the crown jewel of winter braising could soon become the hero of summer grilling. No, not by smoking a large hunk of meat for 64 hours in an extremely expensive grill, though that would be delicious. You\u2019re going to slice the shoulder into thick steaks, then grill them hot and fast to a perfect medium-rare, and it\u2019s going to be revelatory.Just like a braised pork shoulder, these steaks are excellent with just salt and pepper \u2014 but with minimal effort, they can be more than excellent. Giving them a dip in a spicy, sweet and tangy bath made from citrus juice, chile paste and a bit of fish sauce seasons them from the inside out and helps them caramelize on the grill, getting as charred and flavorful as possible. Feel free to marinate them up to 24 hours in advance, but I, for one, am never thinking that far ahead, and know that they are good left to sit for even 20 minutes, about the time it takes to get your grill scorching hot.From there, you can eat them as is, alongside other grilled vegetables, but I am a huge fan of laying the just-sliced pork over a bed of rice or noodles and leaves of crunchy lettuce to let the juices from the pork dress everything below, then topping the whole thing with fresh herbs and lightly pickled shallots. (Think of it as a very inauthentic and possibly lazy version of the classic Vietnamese dish bun cha.)Squeeze some grilled citrus over everything, along with some marinade you\u2019ve reserved to use as dressing. Then let the juices from the pork mingle with all that to create what is maybe the best-tasting sauce in the world \u2014 a good fit for what is surely the best pork chop in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Urban Meyer Placed on Paid Leave at Ohio State Following New Allegations", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOhio State announced Wednesday evening that Urban Meyer, the head coach of its storied football team, had been put on paid administrative leave while the university investigated allegations that Meyer knew a longtime former assistant coach had been accused of domestic abuse in 2015.Meyer, one of the most successful coaches of the past two decades, said last week that he had not heard of the domestic abuse accusations until recent days, but a report on Wednesday suggested that Meyer had known about the accusations for far longer.In a statement Wednesday released by the university, Meyer said he and Athletic Director Gene Smith had agreed \u201cthat being on leave during this inquiry will facilitate its completion. This allows the team to conduct training camp with minimal distraction. I eagerly look forward to the resolution of this matter.\u201dRyan Day, a 39-year-old co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach who joined the program a year ago, will serve as acting head football coach, the statement said. Two other Ohio State coordinators, Greg Schiano and Kevin Wilson, have experience as head coaches at major college programs.Ohio State is one of college football\u2019s flagship programs. Meyer is one of just two active head coaches who have won multiple championships: two at Florida in the 2000s, and one at Ohio State after the 2014 season.Meyer, a native of Toledo, Ohio, was hailed as a savior when he assumed the head coaching job in late 2011 as Ohio State emerged from a scandal in which players had exchanged signed memorabilia for tattoos. The head coach at the time, Jim Tressel, lied about when he learned of the infractions. Meyer\u2019s salary \u2014 $7.6 million after he signed an extension through 2022 earlier this year \u2014 is among the highest in the sport.At a news conference last week, Meyer said he had been aware of the 2009 arrest. His wife, Shelley, and he attempted to help shepherd the young couple through it.Meyer denied previous knowledge of the 2015 episodes, though. He said he had learned about them through a text message the night before the news conference.Shelley Meyer persistently reached out to Courtney Smith about the allegation, according to Smith.\u201cAll the wives knew,\u201d Smith told McMurphy, referring to the coaches\u2019 wives. \u201cThey all did. Every single one.\u201dCourtney Smith also shared photos of her body, bruised and bloodied \u2014 by Zach Smith, she said \u2014 with McMurphy and said she had shared those photos with coaches\u2019 wives in 2014 and 2015.McMurphy is a longtime college football reporter based in Tampa, Fla., who was let go by ESPN in a large round of layoffs in the spring of 2017. In an interview Wednesday he said a noncompete clause in his contract had prohibited him from publishing stories on his beat for a rival outlet. So he has taken to releasing various reports via Twitter and Facebook.Smith has worked for Meyer since 2005, when he was a graduate assistant at Florida, and he played for Meyer before that, at Bowling Green. He is also a grandson of Earle Bruce, a former Ohio State coach whom Meyer has identified as a mentor.The questions of who knew what, and when, about allegations of domestic abuse against an Ohio State athletics employee echo those raised in recent weeks about two other former university employees affiliated with athletics.Last month, Ohio State announced that an independent investigation, which is still continuing, had uncovered more than 100 former students who said that Dr. Richard H. Strauss, a former university employee and team doctor, had sexually abused them. Three lawsuits have been filed by former athletes in several sports. They say that Strauss used his position as a university-designated medical professional to molest them and that several authority figures knew about it, including a former wrestling coach and a former athletic director. Both have denied that they knew about the Strauss abuse.That scandal has ensnared Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the most powerful elected Republican politicians in the country, who was an assistant wrestling coach for several years while Strauss was the team doctor. Jordan has denied having had knowledge of the allegations, and he has argued that accusers have been put up to fabricating stories by an unspecified \u201cdeep state.\u201dBohonyi has not commented since the woman, Eszter Pryor, last week spoke publicly for the first time about her experience.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Suki, Patience Seasons the Curry", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 PhotosKelly Cho, the chef of Suki, a six-seat Japanese curry shop in the East Village, eats nothing for an hour before she tastes her curry, just clearing her palate with a sip of green tea. She won\u2019t open the restaurant until she\u2019s convinced that the flavor is right, even though it\u2019s a dish that she\u2019s cooked for decades and that her mother cooked for decades before her.Curry came to Japan from India by way of the British in the 19th century, and got sweeter and gentler en route. Early recipes were most likely cribbed from Isabella Beeton\u2019s 1861 \u201cBook of Household Management,\u201d which included instructions for curried beef, doused with a \u201cwineglassful\u201d of beer, and curried veal, with an addendum of fried apples.In Japan, home cooks often rely on store-bought bricks of instant curry roux, which they dress up with secret ingredients, anything from chocolate to Nescaf\u00e9 to apricot jam. Ms. Cho, who grew up in South Korea with a Japanese father, builds her curry from scratch, even making her own butter for the roux to get the right consistency, neither free-flowing nor at a standstill, but slow, with the slightest cling.She sweats onions until their sugars run, breaks down tomatoes and Fuji apples, and layers a dozen spices united in musk. It would be impolite to reveal all, but note a distant, leavening bitterness \u2014 fenugreek \u2014 balanced by nutmeg and mace with their whiff of Christmas.The curry simmers for five hours, then is set aside to mellow for \u201canother hundred,\u201d Ms. Cho said, before it returns to the stove. It\u2019s nearly as thick as gravy. From there, she adjusts the heat to the diner\u2019s preference, with pinches of cayenne.Request it mild, and the first spoonful is unabashedly sweet, but still earthy, like a carrot left in the ground for winter harvest. Then the other notes announce themselves: the cooling menthol of star anise, cardamom like a warming pulse. Although served in a separate bowl, the curry is not meant to be eaten alone; it should be tipped over the accompanying rice, which absorbs and subdues.To my taste, the more cayenne, the better. It doesn\u2019t yield heat so much as roundness, filling in the backdrop. And an accompanying relish of pickled radish, cucumber and ginger, preserved for a month and turned bright fuchsia, changes the entire dish, matching sweet with sour, which for a moment holds the upper hand.The curry is at its sweetest plain. Add ground beef, and it\u2019s suddenly franker and richer. Order it \u201cdry,\u201d and it\u2019s cooked down in a pan to a texture verging on sloppy Joe.It becomes a dip when paired with pork katsu, cutlets soaked in pineapple and onion for half a day until tender, then painted with egg and milk and tumbled in cornstarch, potato starch and panko for a crust that almost hovers over the meat, half crunch, half air. Two cutlets come to an order, sliced with the evenness of harp strings, the better for dunking in the curry.Most comforting is yaki curry, an innovation from the Mojiko district in Kitakyushu, Japan, with rice and curry baked in a casserole under a thatch of mozzarella, Cheddar and colby. It arrives still heaving, the curry bubbling below. You have to break through the cheese to reach it, making a lovely mess.In bowls of ramen and udon, the curry base is amplified by dashi. Ramen gets a snap of cayenne, but it\u2019s udon, chewier, with an earthy flavor all its own and in a broth deepened by kelp, that stands up to the curry best.On a typical evening, the only people behind Suki\u2019s counter are Ms. Cho and one of her children, Jimmy and Tiffany Yoon, who take turns helping their mother. She quietly tends to the brief kitchen \u2014 stove and oven, griddle, rice cooker perched atop a fryer \u2014 while they take orders. Diners, sitting shoulder to shoulder on four stools facing in and two facing out, grow neighborly.Suki\u2019s official opening time is 5 p.m., but everything depends on when the curry is ready. When I first stumbled on the shop, just after 6 on a Saturday night, I peered inside and Ms. Cho looked up from the stove with a smile.\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said.slide showAdvertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistIt is simply not healthy for the country to have a president stuck perpetually in attack mode, fighting enemies real and imagined, pushing a toxic agenda that mixes the exaltation of grievance and the grinding of axes.The president\u2019s recent rallies have come to resemble orgies for Donald Trump\u2019s ego, spaces in which he can receive endless, unmeasured adulation and in which the crowds can gather for a revival of an anger that registers as near-religious. They can experience a communal affirmation that they are not alone in their intolerance, outrage and regression.At these moments, the preacher and the pious share a spiritual moment of darkness. In fact, there is no such thing as fake news. If something isn\u2019t true, it isn\u2019t news. Opinions, like mine here, are also not news, even if printed in a newspaper or broadcast by a news station. There may be news in such opinions, but the vehicle is by definition subjective and a reflection of the writer\u2019s or speaker\u2019s worldview.This \u201cfake news\u201d nonsense isn\u2019t really about the dissemination of false information. If it were, the administration could demand a correction and would receive one from any reputable news outlet.No, Trump has made a perversion of the word \u201cfake,\u201d particularly among his most ardent supporters, so that it has come to mean news stories he doesn\u2019t like, commentary that is unflattering to him and inadequate coverage of what he views as positive news about him and his administration.Trump doesn\u2019t want a free press; he wants free propaganda. This seems to work mostly among his own Republican base, but for him that\u2019s the point. The entire Trump presidency is about repayment to the most devout: the white nationalists, the Christian nationalists, the ethnonationalists.They believe that America was founded as a white, Christian nation and should be governed as one. They pine over lost culture and lost heritage. They rage against blossoming minority groups and immigrants. This is a Republican base governed by fear, and it has found its perfect apostle in Trump \u2014 a man who sells fear, gorges on it, bathes in it. Trump and his base are like two mirrors facing each other.Trump has killed the traditional Republican Party and raised and animated in its corpse a soulless, mindless monstrosity, loyal only to him. The moderating forces in the party have either been sidelined or subdued. Trump, feeling both unassailable among the poltroons who are Republican lawmakers and buoyed by his spellbound base, has moved further and further into his own alternate universe and away from acceptable norms and conventions.He is attacking the Robert Mueller investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dHe is attacking the FBI as a whole.He is attacking our international allies.He is attacking celebrities and athletes.He is attacking immigrants.He is attacking the press.He is attacking the truth.He does none of this because he is brave and strong, but rather precisely because he isn\u2019t. His attacks are a compensatory disguise for his own fear and insecurity. Trump is weak. Very weak. Unbelievably weak. But he knows now that his weakness is bolstered by the incredible power of the presidency and the overwhelming economic and military power of the country. America\u2019s greatness has given this coward a spine that only amplifies his bluster and bullying, his disrespect and his deceptions.As he feels emboldened, his base rides the wave with him. The supposed evangelical Trump supporters have accepted he is an imperfect instrument to achieve their desired goal of a religious liberty agenda cemented by conservative judges.And so, no matter how much he violates their religious tenets, they forgive him and cheer.Traditional Republicans among Trump\u2019s base look to the outrageous tax cuts and his efforts to undo regulation and undermine President Obama\u2019s legacy, and they forgive and cheer.The racist, white supremacists and Islamophobes share his hostility to people who are not white and Christian, and they don\u2019t even need to forgive him to cheer.That cheering for a man who is not only surrounded by corruption, but whose inner circle is also under criminal investigation, has become the discordant soundtrack of a man who is morally compromised and whose campaign may have been materially compromised.

{"Headline": "Review: Taco Quetzalcoatl in Salisbury, South Australia", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia Fare6 PhotosSALISBURY, South Australia \u2014 To get to Taco Quetzalcoatl from Adelaide, you drive north along four-lane highways, across desolate wetlands and past industrial parks. Half an hour outside of the city, there\u2019s a turn into a residential neighborhood of low brick houses, the type that cover so much of this country\u2019s suburban landscape. Nothing about the green lawns and narrow streets suggests that this is somewhere you might find a restaurant of any sort, let alone one of the best representations of Mexican food in Australia.A retail strip appears unexpectedly at the end of a block that\u2019s well removed from a major road or other businesses. It\u2019s as modest as they come, an aging collection of storefronts that includes a sparsely stocked grocery, a hair dresser and Taco Quetzalcoatl.The windows of the restaurant are framed by vibrant Mexican fabrics, and a chalkboard sits on the sidewalk proclaiming: Tacos, Burritos, Enchiladas. Inside, there is no real distinction between the kitchen and the few tables that make up the dining area. It is a room primarily used for cooking. Mexican grocery items are jumbled in with the chaos of the kitchen, and many of them are for sale.In other words, Taco Quetzalcoatl is a humble neighborhood taqueria, a bastion of comfort and delicious food that\u2019s common in many parts of the world, all of them very far away from suburban South Australia.Ms. Gallardo set out to cook the kind of foods that are practically impossible to find in Australia: pressing her own tortillas, creating mole from scratch, steaming tamales in banana leaves and making salsas fresh every day.Those salsas appear in colorful ramekins on the basic white tables, along with a selection of bottled Mexican hot sauces. The green tomatillo is smooth and tangy, the red habanero dynamic and fiery. They are wonderful dribbled over just about anything that comes out of this kitchen.Apart from the salsas, it\u2019s the corn tortillas that give the first real indication of the level at which Ms. Gallardo is operating. Soft and pale, their flavor is deep and elegant and almost nutty, with a whiff of something akin to savory marzipan. It is hard to coax this much complexity from masa; like sushi rice or handmade pasta, tortilla-making is a skill that takes years for the fingertips to master.Concessions have been made to the local palate. This is, after all, a neighborhood restaurant in suburban Australia. You can order tacos \u201cMexican\u201d style or \u201cAussie\u201d; the former comes with cilantro and onions, the latter with shredded lettuce and cheese, and sour cream. The Mexican cheese you\u2019d traditionally find on many dishes \u2014 cotija, queso fresco \u2014 has been swapped out for grated varieties that are more readily available and familiar in these parts.Some meat preparations are more straightforward and bland than the stewed or flame-licked versions you\u2019d find in Mexico. The delicate, balanced, chocolate-tinged red mole served over the enchiladas is revelatory, but the chicken inside is plain white meat.On the regular menu, Ms. Gallardo does not hold back with her pozole, which has in its layered, porky broth a kick of spice and a morass of comforting hominy and pulled meat. Globs of pure white pork fat dissipate on the tongue like warm piggy aspic.Recently, Ms. Gallardo was offered a space in a shopping center about a mile away, in the thick of Salisbury\u2019s downtown area. She has not yet decided whether she\u2019ll make the move. On one hand, she reasons, her business is sure to grow. On the other, she worries about what will happen when she attracts clientele that don\u2019t have to specifically seek her out.\u201cMy customers here are loyal,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to find me, they want my cooking. At a busy shopping center, who knows what people will expect? They might not like real Mexican food.\u201dI\u2019m sure that wherever Ms. Gallardo ends up, plenty of people will appreciate what she does. But here, in this space, tucked into the back corner of a residential neighborhood in suburban South Australia, Taco Quetzalcoatl feels like nothing short of a miracle.Advertisement"}

The variations may seem slight, but summertime \u2014 the season that leaves us daydreaming perpetually about beaches, barbecues and brightness \u2014 is often, on average, the wettest period of the year.And this summer has been particularly so.We had almost 7.5 inches of rain in July, about 3 inches above normal, according to Mr. Ciemnecki.So how does this fare for our remaining beach days?Ocean temperatures lag behind air temperatures, he said, so \u201csome of the warmest water temperatures around this area come in August and September, whereas some of the warmest air temperatures come in June and July.\u201d\u201cAbnormal rainfall amounts can lead to cooler water at the surface,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, mixing will bring the water back to equilibrium, but it can temporarily alter the temperature, as can wind and strong storms.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:They beat nearly 160 other blocks from 30 neighborhoods across the borough.Nina Browne, Brooklyn Botanic Garden\u2019s community program manager, who has overseen the competition for years and trains the judges, told us that this year\u2019s winner \u201cticked all the boxes!\u201d\u201cWhat stands out is that it is a really long block, so they have a lot of ground to cover and a lot of neighbors to involve,\u201d she said. \u201cParticipation rate is one of the metrics used in judging the Greenest Block in Brooklyn, and you can see a very high rate of participation on this block from corner to corner.\u201dThis was the block\u2019s fourth time entering the annual contest, and participants incorporated feedback from earlier attempts to win this year.\u201cThey created a children\u2019s garden and got children on the block involved,\u201d Ms. Browne said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of whimsy on their block in the use of upcycled materials, like old baby carriages and amps as planters that make you smile as you walk down the street.

{"Headline": "Trump Knows Digital Ads Work. Why Don\u2019t Democrats? ", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party\u2019s campaigns are ignoring obvious opportunities to engage with voters. Mr. Collins is a board member at Tech for Campaigns.President Trump may not be up for re-election until 2020, but since May 31, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee \u2014 his re-election campaign \u2014\u00a0has spent $629,500 on advertising on Google platforms alone, making it the top spender on political ads on Google platforms. That\u2019s nearly $200,000 more than the No. 2 spender, One Nation, a right-wing organization focused on influencing Senate elections.So why are Democratic campaigns ignoring such obvious opportunities to engage with voters? I\u2019m honestly not sure; perhaps old habits are hard to break. But outdated models aren\u2019t going to win in this digital world. Unlike the Democrats, Republican candidates and right-wing organizations are prioritizing the right channels.In the average 2016 Senate general election, Republicans outspent Democrats by a three-to-one ratio on YouTube, AdWords and other Google channels. From January to June, during the primaries, this gap was even wider at 20 to one.It\u2019s even worse for down-ballot, state-level campaigns, which are under-resourced in both manpower and financial support. A typical state legislative campaign might run with an average budget of $150,000 (just 10 percent of the budget of a successful federal House race). With a smaller budget, you need to be intentional and efficient. Why spend money on TV ads, which are often aired beyond your voting district or skipped entirely with DVRs, when you could be utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook ads that can zero in on specific ZIP codes and target voters by segment or even language?Other Democrats should take a cue and double down on digital: It empowers them to reach more people with less money, engage in back-and-forth conversations with voters and test what messaging is resonating in real time. It should also prove critical in turning out a younger voting population, which often sits out midterm elections.In Silicon Valley, support for Democrats is overwhelming, so how can we be getting beaten so badly at the digital game that we largely created?Since then, the organization has grown to over 7,500 skilled volunteers, completed over 75 projects with campaigns and played a major role in the Virginia 2017 midterms \u2014 contributing to nine wins, eight of them flipping seats from red to blue. They have built an impressive infrastructure that can rapidly scale to help hundreds of campaigns this coming November and long into the future.These volunteers are defining and executing digital strategies on campaigns: running email campaigns and paid digital ad programs, creating websites, building software and tools for caucuses and campaigns that save time and serve to amplify great candidates and ideas. It might be the largest force of digital talent that Democrats have assembled anywhere, and it came together in less than one year because so many talented professionals were craving a way to make a difference.Our tech community is full of smart people who have the passion and the optimism to make a change in our electoral process. It\u2019s time for us to step up and make our own contribution to the thousands of progressive candidates who are running for change. Let\u2019s start winning the digital game that we built before it\u2019s too late.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Threat \u2018Is Real,\u2019 Trump Officials Say, Vowing to Protect U.S. Elections", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top national security officials vowed Thursday to defend American elections against what they called real threats from Russia only weeks after President Trump seemed to accept President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s denials of interference during a summit meeting in Finland.After the meeting, Mr. Trump said he had not meant to endorse Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of election meddling, but insisted that the culprit behind the intrusion\u201ccould be other people.\u201d A few days later, he asserted that the idea of any meddling by Russia was \u201call a big hoax.\u201dBut the men and women charged with detecting and defending against any threats to the American political process showed no such ambivalence. They bluntly said that Russia was behind a \u201cpervasive\u201d campaign to weaken America\u2019s democracy and influence the 2018 election.They also sought to reassure voters that federal, state and local governments were taking steps to guard against what Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, described as a \u201c24-7 365-days-a-year\u201d effort by Russia to sow division as Americans head to the polls in the fall.\u201cRussia attempted to interfere with the last election,\u201d Mr. Wray told reporters in the White House briefing room, \u201cand continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day. This is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus.\u201dDan Coats, the director of national intelligence, echoed that assessment, saying that \u201cRussians are looking for every opportunity, regardless of party, regardless of whether or not it applies to the election, to continue their pervasive efforts to undermine our fundamental values.\u201dMr. Wray and Mr. Coats were joined at the briefing by Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, and Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency.Officials at the briefing did not describe specific threats to the coming elections, and they were vague about how the government was responding to what they called Russia\u2019s interference campaign. But they said Mr. Trump had directed them in a National Security Council meeting last week to aggressively confront the threats.\u201cOur democracy itself is in the cross hairs,\u201d Ms. Nielsen told reporters. \u201cThe progress we have made is real, and the nation\u2019s elections are more resilient today because of the work we are all doing. But we must continue to ensure that our democracy is protected.\u201dMs. Nielsen said the government had \u201cseen a willingness and a capability on the part of the Russians\u201d to hack into the American election infrastructure, including voter rolls and voting machines. In addition to helping states and local governments prevent that hacking, she said her department was working to ensure that methods were available to validate the vote if a cyberattack occurred.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, welcomed Thursday\u2019s pledges of action from Trump administration officials, even as he chided the president for failing to take the lead in confronting Russian election-year aggression.\u201cGlad to see the White House finally do something about election security \u2014 even if it\u2019s only a news conference,\u201d Mr. Warner said on Twitter shortly after the briefing. \u201cNow if only it was actually backed up by anything the President has said or done on Russia.\u201dElection experts say voting security has vastly improved since 2016, even if much remains to be done.The heads of the national security agencies on Thursday said that Russia was still trying to influence United States elections, contradicting statements made by President Trump.\u201cAll the states realize that securing their election systems \u2014 both administrative systems and voting machines \u2014 is a high priority,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, a leading expert on election administration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said computer systems and voting machines were now probably the most secure part of the election infrastructure, thanks in part to a stepped-up effort by Homeland Security officials.The greatest vulnerabilities, Mr. Stewart said, lie in individual political campaigns, few of which have come to terms with the threat posed by foreign actors like Russia. Barely a week ago, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, confirmed reports that Russian hackers had sought, apparently unsuccessfully, to break in to her computer network in the Senate, and at least one other campaign is known to have been attacked as well.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments playing down the threat from Russia, his security officials did not hesitate in directly blaming the Russian government as the primary culprit behind the interference campaign.\u201cWe acknowledge the threat. It is real. It is continuing,\u201d Mr. Coats said. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to have a legitimate election that everyone can have trust in.\u201dMr. Bolton said the president did raise the issue of meddling with Mr. Putin at their meeting in Helsinki, and defended what he said had been Mr. Trump\u2019s intense focus on the issue since he took office.\u201cI think the president has made it abundantly clear to everybody\u201d in the government who oversees election security. Mr. Bolton said that Mr. Trump \u201ccares deeply about it and that he expects them to do their jobs.\u201dThe intelligence agencies do not believe that Russian efforts to interfere in the 2018 elections have reached the same level as in the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Wray said. But he said the government was braced for the possibility that Russia could ramp up its efforts overnight, requiring a more forceful response from the United States.\u201cAny moment is just a moment before the dial can be turned up,\u201d Mr. Wray said.In the meantime, Mr. Wray said that the Russian efforts to inject divisive misinformation into American social media were continuing daily, even when elections are not on the horizon.On Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate voted down an amendment to an appropriations bill that would have allotted $250 million to states to improve election security before the midterms. Only one Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, voted for the measure. Others argued that Congress had already allotted $380 million for security improvements earlier in the year, and that more funds were not needed.Experts on election administration took issue with that.\u201cThere\u2019s no finish line in election security,\u201d said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a Washington-based organization centered on improving voting technology and security. \u201cThere needs to be a consistent funding stream \u2014 probably in all critical areas, but particularly in elections \u2014 to secure those systems from attack.\u201dBut Mr. Becker and others also said that states and localities needed to make quick and often cheap basic fixes to their systems, such as giving security training to workers and toughening passwords, and plan carefully before spending millions on new equipment.Mr. Becker compared the state of election security to trying to prevent burglaries: The two best ways to stop burglars, he said, are to secure a house against break-ins and to deter burglars from even attempting them.In election security, \u201cWe\u2019re doing a pretty good job of protecting the house,\u201d he said. \u201cBut where are the consequences against the criminal? That can only be done by the executive branch. The big question is, where is the president?\u201dEileen Sullivan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Although true-blooded socialists \u2014 Democratic Socialists, to be precise \u2014\u00a0remain a relatively small niche within the Democratic Party, they are having a visible impact on the party\u2019s agenda, with nearly every likely 2020 presidential contender embracing Medicare for all. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign galvanized progressive support for the idea of Democratic Socialism, and this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has embraced not only the label but also a blue-sky vision of American socialism \u2014 free public college, a jobs guarantee, guaranteed family leave and more \u2014 unbound by moderate liberal worries about government overreach or overspending.But it has also been emboldened by more conventional aspects of the Republican agenda, in particular the party\u2019s astoundingly hypocritical approach to debt and deficits. You may remember a time when Republicans pretended to care about the debt and deficits. That time was not so long ago, when Barack Obama was president. Republican governance has shown how much the party actually cares about the deficit: not one bit. One can perhaps imagine a Republican Party that could defend conventional notions of fiscal responsibility with some semblance of integrity, a conservative movement that governed according to its professed principles; even some deficit doves might find such a party useful as a pragmatic counterweight to progressive ambitions. But although Republicans will surely attack the new class of Democratic Socialists and their policies as debt-increasing budget busters \u2014 that is, after all, what Republicans do \u2014 their own actions will ensure that those criticisms have no real authority. Their opposition to the socialist agenda will be hollow, because they helped make that agenda possible.Advertisement"}

When members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party pooh-pooh his thuggish rantings and otherwise signal that they will overlook even his most dangerous behavior, they are inviting him to act out even more. Like a willful toddler, Mr. Trump lives to test limits. While breaking campaign finance laws may not sound as serious as, say, obstructing a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to help him get elected, it, too, violates the integrity of the American electoral system. If Mr. Trump arranged secret payments to hush up his affairs, then he conspired to deny voters information he feared would harm his electoral chances. His efforts to hide the money trail suggest he knew his behavior wasn\u2019t kosher. And while the initial payments to the women were made before Mr. Trump won the election, he didn\u2019t begin compensating Mr. Cohen until February of 2017 \u2014 thus any conspiracy was carried straight into the Oval Office.

Congress, unfortunately, remains crouched and trembling in a dark corner, hoping this is all a bad dream. It\u2019s not.

Almost instantly, the king of Bhutan pushed out one-sixth of the small Buddhist country\u2019s population. The Drukpas, the Buddhist elite, and the Hindu Lhotshampa had peacefully coexisted until 1989, when the king introduced his \u201cOne Nation, One People\u201d policy.

Aside from the fact that he\u2019s white, and a man, what\u2019s his point? What does it signify when people use this now ubiquitous formula (\u201cAs a such-and-such, I \u2026\u201d) to affix an identity to an observation? Typically, it\u2019s an assertion of authority: As a member of this or that social group, I have experiences that lend my remarks special weight. The experiences, being representative of that group, might even qualify me to represent that group. Occasionally, the formula is an avowal of humility. It can be both at once. (\u201cAs a working-class woman, I\u2019m struggling to understand Virginia Woolf\u2019s blithe assumptions of privilege.\u201d) The incantation seems indispensable. But it can also be \u2014 to use another much-loved formula \u2014 problematic.Being a black lesbian, for instance, isn\u2019t a matter of simply combining African-American, female and homosexual ways of being in the world; identities interact in complex ways. That\u2019s why Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a feminist legal theorist and civil-rights activist, introduced the notion of intersectionality, which stresses the complexity with which different forms of subordination relate to one another. Racism can make white men shrink from black men and abuse black women. Homophobia can lead men in South Africa to rape gay women but murder gay men. Sexism in the United States in the 1950s kept middle-class white women at home and sent working-class black women to work for them.Let\u2019s go back to Joe, with his NPR mug and his man bun. (Or are you picturing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tank top and a high-and-tight?) Having an identity doesn\u2019t, by itself, authorize you to speak on behalf of everyone of that identity. So it can\u2019t really be that he\u2019s speaking for all white men. But he can at least speak to what it\u2019s like to live as a white man, right?The switch in identities can be the whole point of the joke. Here\u2019s Chris Rock, talking about his life in an affluent New Jersey suburb: \u201cAs a black man, I\u2019m against the cops, but as a man with property, well, I need the cops. If someone steals something, I can\u2019t call the Crips!\u201d Drawing attention to certain identities you have is often a natural way of drawing attention to the contours of your beliefs, values or concerns.If someone is advocating policies for gay men to adopt, or for others to adopt toward gay men, what matters, surely, isn\u2019t whether the person is gay but whether the policies are sensible. As a gay man, you could oppose same-sex marriage (it\u2019s just submitting to our culture\u2019s heteronormativity, and anyway monogamy is a patriarchal invention) or advocate same-sex marriage (it\u2019s an affirmation of equal dignity and a way to sustain gay couples). Because members of an identity group won\u2019t be identical, your \u201cas a\u201d doesn\u2019t settle anything. The same holds for religious, vocational and national identities.And, of course, for racial identities. In the 1990s the black novelist Trey Ellis wrote a screenplay, \u201cThe Inkwell,\u201d which drew on his childhood in the milieu of the black bourgeoisie. A white studio head (for whom race presumably eclipsed class) gave it to Matty Rich, a young black director who\u2019d grown up in a New York City housing project. Mr. Rich apparently worried that the script wasn\u2019t \u201cblack enough\u201d and proposed turning the protagonist\u2019s father, a schoolteacher, into a garbage man. Suffice to say, it didn\u2019t end well. Are we really going to settle these perennial debates over authenticity with a flurry of \u201cas a\u201d arrowheads? Somehow, we can\u2019t stop trying. Ever since Donald Trump eked out his surprising electoral victory, political analysts have been looking for people to speak for the supposedly disgruntled white working-class voters who, switching from their former Democratic allegiances, gave Mr. Trump the edge.So we might do well to ease up on \u201cas a\u201d \u2014 on the urge to underwrite our observations with our identities. \u201cFor me,\u201d Professor Spivak once tartly remarked, \u201cthe question \u2018Who should speak\u2019 is less crucial than \u2018Who will listen?\u2019\u201dBut tell that to Joe, as he takes a sip of kombucha \u2014 or is it Pabst Blue Ribbon? All right, Joe, let\u2019s hear what you\u2019ve got to say. The speaking-as-a convention isn\u2019t going anywhere; in truth, it often serves a purpose. But here\u2019s another phrase you might try on for size: \u201cSpeaking for myself \u2026\u201dKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at New York University and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Lies That Bind: Rethinking Identity,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Northern Rivers Is a Breezy, Ex-Hippie Wonderland for Australian Chefs", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia fare: Critic\u2019s notebookThe appealing landscape and beaches have attracted young, talented restaurateurs and the \u2018boho-chic\u2019 set.That early prediction turned out to be correct. In the three years since Fleet opened, the town has changed tremendously. I\u2019ve been visiting for over a decade thanks to my father, who lives in the area, and the transformation is drastic. The retail strip that used to be home to a few small businesses is now buzzing with boutiques and cafes; the streets that used to feel sleepy are now often thick with wandering tourists. Fleet also foreshadowed an influx of ambitious young restaurateurs to the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, just south of the Queensland border. It\u2019s a stunningly beautiful part of the world, a not-quite-tropical lush hinterland that catches the rain and cradles a cobalt coastline. For a talented chef, the allure of Byron is obvious. The influx of money, brought by people looking for a certain beachy lifestyle guided by good taste, is sure to provide a decent customer base, as is the beach tourism and the many music and cultural festivals held in the area. Three years later, Fleet is one of the toughest reservations in Australia; the only booking I could secure was as a single diner, at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon. Despite the odd hour (Fleet\u2019s website refers to this midafternoon meal as \u201clate lunch\u201d), the experience was an intensely lovely way to spend a few hours. Ms. McCormack acts as host and server, and Mr. Lewis cooks and plates every dish in the restaurant, solo in the small kitchen but for a dishwasher. The food is almost simple, but not quite. Tiny curls of local squid come over rounds of yellow squash, with preserved lemon and a deeply savory crustacean oil. Spanner crab is jumbled with ribbons of zucchini and slivers of chestnut, but it\u2019s the sweet, deep seafood-broth-based sauce that makes the fresher ingredients sing. But there\u2019s something different about the most recent crop of restaurants in the area, an aesthetic that forcefully proclaims a regional style. The breezy atmosphere that makes this such a beautiful place to live and visit finds its way onto the plate, as does the area\u2019s history as a hippie enclave. Many of the best meals I\u2019ve had in the Northern Rivers could almost be mistaken for spa food, if not for the focus on bold flavor and intense pleasure. Shelter serves as a casual cafe in the morning, offering mixed grain bowls and avocado toast alongside the requisite high-quality espresso drinks. Lunch displays the chef Dennis Baker\u2019s ambition and verve, with dishes like raw kingfish with cultured cream, thinly sliced cucumber and a scattering of succulent leaves. The cooling green flavor of the succulent and cucumber brought a new kind of freshness to the fish, while the lightly tangy cream added luxurious texture. Dinner, served three nights a week, expands on the promise of lunch. Local octopus is sweetened with XO sauce and given a punch of dynamism by green chile. Brussels sprouts are roasted and served with tangy mustard and more of that lush cultured cream. I thought I was sick of roasted sprouts; Shelter proved me wrong. There\u2019s a real sense of place to much of this food, in the use of local ingredients and in the culture of healthy eating that has long been a part of Byron\u2019s dining ethos. There\u2019s nut milk with the salted fish at Paper Daisy, macadamia nut butter under the roasted pumpkin at Fleet and an almond paste accompanying the line-caught mulloway at Shelter. The chickpea pur\u00e9e that harmonizes a dish of shaved yellow squash, sea urchin and calamondin lime at Paper Daisy isn\u2019t called hummus, but it has all of that beloved dip\u2019s rich appeal. At Fleet, one of the signature dishes could be a parody of upscale-eating-meets-hippie asceticism: A fresh raw radish comes encrusted in sesame seeds with a touch of honey. It\u2019s reminiscent of those chewy sesame candies from health food stores, but the slightly bitter vegetal snap of radish somehow makes it doubly gratifying. But don\u2019t expect that to deter more young, talented people from setting up shop along this coastline. I asked everyone I spoke to why they chose the Northern Rivers, and got the exact same answer: Look around you. Look at this ocean; breathe this air. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to be here?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Virtues of Catholic Anger", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the face of the Pennsylvania abuse scandal, Christians should use their rage to combat evil within the church. The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest, is the editor at large of America magazine.One priest had his victim wash his mouth out with holy water after being forced to perform a sex act on the priest. Another arranged an abortion for a minor he impregnated. Compounding these appalling crimes were years of documented cover-ups by church officials. That most of these stories are decades old does not diminish the abject horror among Catholics today who read them today. Catholic wrath burns hot. Chief among those enraged are victims and their families, several of whom I know, many whose lives have been destroyed by sexual violence. Catholics not directly affected by the abuse are furious at both abusive priests and the bishops who covered up their crimes, and many have had their faith in the church severely shaken. Many believed that after the sex abuse scandals of 2002, the church had \u201cmoved on\u201d and so feel poleaxed by these new stories. Pennsylvania Catholics (of whom I am one: I grew up in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia) have shared their personal anger with me as they read about pastors they knew who had taken unforgiving stances with them on sexual matters while raping children. Some millennial Catholics, who were themselves children in 2002, are appalled as they read about sex abuse cases as adults for the first time.The Catholic clergy is furious as well. Like many priests, I have been deluged with emails from Catholics saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can stay in the church.\u201d To see a person\u2019s faith shaken in the church is to know that they may be tempted to distance themselves from God, another tragedy. And we are painfully aware that the financial settlements \u2014 justified, of course \u2014 mean slashing desperately needed programs at the diocesan and parish level: educational programs for the young, health care assistance for the aged, financial aid for the poor in the community. Then there are more selfish reasons: These stories, even though they represent a fraction of the priesthood, cast every Catholic priest in the darkest light. During the 2002 crisis I was spat upon in the subway on two occasions and at times was embarrassed to wear my collar. Lately, I have also been angry with the Catholic commentators who have been using these revelations to advance their own agendas, so that the suffering of children becomes an opportunity to stir up hatred, for example, of all gay priests, or L.G.B.T. people in general. All this anger may seem like an un-Christian scourge, tearing the church apart. In fact, it is good, healthy and clarifying.Anger is an important part of the life and ministry of Jesus. And so anger should be part of the Catholic life \u2014 with Jesus as a guide. Those Catholics who are feeling angry today are, in the Christian worldview, feeling God\u2019s anger. This is, as I see it, God\u2019s primary way of acting in the world: through our human emotions. How else would God act, how else would God intervene, how else would God move to change things, other than to rouse in us a burning desire to upend the tables of the clerical culture and chase out all those who have defamed and abused the trust placed in them?But more important than my suggestions is what each Catholic feels moved to do.Buried within one of the central texts of the Second Vatican Council, \u201cLumen Gentium\u201d (\u201cThe Dogmatic Constitution on the Church\u201d), a document of the highest teaching authority, promulgated in 1964, is a vivid call to arms, addressed to laypeople. The laity are, the Second Vatican Council said, \u201cby reason of the knowledge, competence or outstanding ability which they may enjoy, permitted and sometimes even obliged to express their opinion on those things which concern the good of the Church.\u201d Today their strong emotions should encourage them to follow the call of their church. In fact, their anger obliges them to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Cultural Treasures Are Made of Plastic. Now They\u2019re Falling Apart.", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMuseum conservators are racing to figure out how to preserve modern artworks and historical objects that are disintegrating. LOS ANGELES \u2014 The custodians of Neil Armstrong\u2019s spacesuit at the National Air and Space Museum saw it coming. A marvel of human engineering, the suit is made of 21 layers of various plastics: nylon, neoprene, Mylar, Dacron, Kapton and Teflon. The rubbery neoprene layer would pose the biggest problem. Although invisible, buried deep between the other layers, the suit\u2019s caretakers knew the neoprene would harden and become brittle with age, eventually making the suit stiff as a board. In January 2006, the Armstrong suit, a national treasure, was taken off display and stored to slow the degradation. Of an estimated 8,300 million metric tons of plastic produced to date, roughly 60 percent is floating in the oceans or stuffed in landfills. Most of us want that plastic to disappear. But in museums, where objects are meant to last forever, plastics are failing the test of time. Art is not spared either, as Georgina Rayner, a conservation scientist at Harvard Art Museums, showed at the American Chemical Society\u2019s national meeting in Boston this month. Claes Oldenburg\u2019s \u201cFalse Food Selection,\u201d a wooden box containing plastic models of foods like eggs and bacon, a banana and an oatmeal cookie, now appears to be rotting. The egg whites are yellowing, while the banana has completely deflated.Of all materials, plastics are proving to be one of the most challenging for conservators. \u201cI find plastics very frustrating,\u201d said Mr. Collum. Because of the material\u2019s unpredictability and the huge variation in forms of deterioration, he said, \u201cit\u2019s just a completely different world.\u201d\u201cWe have a very short history, in comparison to other materials, in understanding how long those materials last,\u201d said Hugh Shockey, lead conservator at the Saint Louis Art Museum. Metal, stone, ceramic and paper have survived thousands of years, while plastics have existed for a little over 150 years. In that short time, however, they have risen to dominate the materials we use today. And plastics increasingly appear in art and artifacts nominated for preservation. A walk through various Smithsonian Institution museums makes that clear. There\u2019s the art, of course: acrylic paintings, a polyester parabolic lens with a mirror-like surface, a fiberglass sculpture of a middle-aged woman poised to dig into a melting banana split. And there are the mundane objects, the documentation of human life: an electric can opener, a pink Princess rotary telephone, Tupperware, a six-by-eight array of coffee cup lids, all with different designs. \u201cYou have these objects in any museum collection, especially historic objects \u2014 they take you back to a time. But holding that moment in time in a material sense is tough,\u201d said Odile Madden, a plastics conservation scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles. Dr. Madden leads a small group of scientists at the institute\u2019s Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative, ModCon for short, who are working to help plastic live forever. The first step for these conservators and others is to determine simply what the plastic is. \u201cWe use this word as a monolith, \u2018plastics,\u2019 when in fact it\u2019s many hundreds and thousands of different things,\u201d said Gregory Bailey, a conservator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\u201cPlastic\u201d simply refers to something moldable. Often, plastics are mixtures of polymers \u2014 big, long-chained molecules \u2014 and small-molecule additives. The earliest plastics were made from modified natural polymers like cellulose, but most plastics today are based on synthetic polymers that last much longer. The additives may be so-called plasticizers that improve flexibility or fillers that strengthen the matter. \u201cThere are opacifiers, pigments and sometimes even glitter,\u201d Dr. Madden said. \u201cYou end up with an enormous number of possibilities for what a plastic composition could be.\u201dThe objects belonged to a reference collection donated to advance plastic conservation research at the institute. \u201cThis is all the drama,\u201d she said. She picked out a toothbrush split into two pieces at the middle. At its ends, the plastic handle was transparent, albeit yellowed. But near the breaks, the toothbrush is opaque, as if a cloud of white flowers had bloomed inside it. Dr. Madden held the broken toothbrush under a microscope. \u201cThe field started with very rudimentary physical tests, like a hot needle test\u201d on a surface to see if the plastic melted, she said. \u201cIf it gave off some kind of smell, does it smell piney? Does it smell like burnt hair?\u201d Today, conservation scientists use advanced analytical techniques like microscopy or spectroscopy to identify materials. Magnified, the white clouds in the toothbrush\u2019s handle turned out to be an intricate system of cracks within cracks within cracks. Ms. Lagana and Dr. Madden immediately identified the plastic as cellulose nitrate, an early material widely used in photography and motion picture film. The conservators had seen this type of damage many times before. \u201cThere is no other plastic that cracks in this way with this shape,\u201d Ms. Lagana said. Scientific analysis is usually accompanied by archival research. \u201cWe spend a lot of time studying the history of how these things are made,\u201d said Dr. Madden. \u201cIf it\u2019s a piece of Lego made before 1960, I\u2019m expecting it will be cellulose acetate, not ABS.\u201d For objects with almost no information, a good technique to start with is spectroscopy, an analysis of how molecules interact with light. Dr. Madden brought out a green-and-white striped vase and a small, red instrument. The instrument fires infrared light through materials, explained Michael Doutre, a ModCon scientist. After absorbing infrared light, the bonds that connect different atoms within molecules will bend and stretch in distinctive ways, like signature dance moves. By examining the moves recorded on a graph, scientists can identify the type of bonds and try to infer what the molecules are.Ms. Lagana holds the vase steady while Dr. Madden touches the tip of the spectrometer to it. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s polyethylene or it\u2019s polypropylene,\u201d said Ms. Lagana, a guess based on the feel and smell of the vase. Mr. Doutre started the analysis on a computer, and a graph appeared on the screen. Ms. Lagana was right \u2014 the graph indicated nothing other than simple bonds between carbon and carbon atoms, and carbon and hydrogen atoms. \u201cIn this case, the absence of things tells us it\u2019s polyethylene,\u201d Mr. Doutre said. \u201cThe plastic has lost some proportion of its mass,\u201d she said, because its plasticizer had migrated to the surface and emerged as white powder. Without plasticizer, the box became brittle and shrank, and then finally cracked along its sides. Shrinking and additive migration are two of the most common ways plastics degrade. That happens because the molecules within plastics are not arranged in the most efficient way, said Jane Lipson, a physical chemist at Dartmouth College. They are like frozen disorganized liquids, containing a lot of empty, random gaps between molecules. Over time, the large polymer molecules will slowly reorganize and pack themselves more efficiently, which looks like shrinking to the naked eye. Any small-molecule additives will work themselves out through the gaps until they reach the surface as a sticky liquid or a white powder. When plastics get warm, they degrade faster because the molecules have more energy to move around. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of finding their way to a place that\u2019s more stable,\u201d said Dr. Lipson. Often, conservators just try to find the best conditions in which to maintain the artifacts. \u201cMuch of the conservation is how do we manage the storage or display environment to slow down the deterioration as much as possible,\u201d said Mr. Bailey, of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. That may involve filtering out ultraviolet rays to decrease random breaking of plastic\u2019s molecular bonds, a tall order for the museum (it has lots of windows). Preserving a plastic artwork also may mean keeping the temperature low and humidity stable to reduce plasticizer migration, or providing an oxygen-free environment to prevent oxidation. Mr. Collum and his team are building a special display case for the Armstrong suit in carefully chosen conditions: 63 degrees Fahrenheit, 30 percent humidity, plus filters to remove contaminants. The conservators hope to have the display ready for next year\u2019s 50th anniversary of the moon landing. Even something as innocuous as cleaning an object for an exhibit can be a complex process. It seems easy enough to clear plasticizer from a surface, for instance, but cleaning prompts more plasticizer to emerge, effectively accelerating degradation. \u201cThe plasticizer is actually trying to find equilibrium between the outside of the plastic and the inside of the plastic,\u201d Mr. Shockey said. \u201cBut once you override the equilibrium, you can have a catastrophic event.\u201dRoutine dusting can scratch a plastic\u2019s soft surface, ruining a pristine, glossy finish. As an alternative, Mr. Shockey has pioneered a technique in which tiny microcrystals of dry ice or carbon dioxide \u201csnow\u201d are jetted over the surface to pick up dust and other contaminants. Despite their notoriety as a major pollutant, plastics have important stories to tell.Even if we move away from plastics, Dr. Shockey said, \u201cI think there\u2019s still the need for persistence of memory in human culture.\u201d He recalled the story of tortoiseshell and its plastic doppelg\u00e4nger, cellulose acetate. \u201cWe nearly hunted a particular turtle to extinction,\u201d Dr. Shockey said, \u201cand then we were able to turn away from the natural material to an alternative.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we use them instead of the more traditional materials,\u201d said Jeannette Garcia, a polymer chemist at IBM. For the most part plastics are cheap and versatile, lightweight yet strong. An earlier version of this article misstated a substance described by Dr. Odile Madden. She said opacifiers -- not pacifiers -- which are additives used to make materials opaque.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley \u2014 and Won", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "FeatureMining personal data has become a trillion-dollar business \u2014 which is why activists are pushing laws to curb the practice, and why Facebook and other companies are desperate to stop them.Supported byThe way Alastair Mactaggart usually tells the story of his awakening \u2014 the way he told it even before he became the most improbable, and perhaps the most important, privacy activist in America \u2014 begins with wine and pizza in the hills above Oakland, Calif. It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What is the most-sought placement?\u201cJust like other mediums, ad costs are highly dependent on a number of factors, including location, size, time and duration,\u201d Mr. Male said.\u201cPrime\u201d placements include wrapped cars or several ads in a station for a single company, he explained, as well as the shuttle from Grand Central Terminal to Times Square, which can be completely covered by an advertiser \u2014 both the interior and exterior of the three-car train \u2014 to immerse riders in the brand.\u201cThese are opportunities brands can use to break through to consumers,\u201d Mr. Male said, \u201cand they don\u2019t even approach the price of a single Super Bowl ad.\u201dHow do you measure the success of those ads?What\u2019s next for subway ads?\u201cOver the next decade and beyond, we have big plans for New York City\u2019s subways,\u201d Mr. Male said.\u201cImagine, for example, you\u2019re heading home in the middle of a Mets or Yankees game and there\u2019s a huge play in the outfield,\u201d he said. \u201cMade possible by the screens we\u2019re currently rolling out and in conjunction with coming 5G technology, soon we\u2019ll be able to dynamically stream that content to every screen in a subway car, providing a completely new and immersive experience that will add energy to anyone\u2019s commute.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:C+.(That stands for \u201cclouds, and then some.\u201d)Friday is also shaping up to be a C+.We\u2019ll share a weekend report card tomorrow.The brewery, with locations in Gowanus and Greenpoint, beat more than 600 entries from over 100 competitors across the state.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jahana Hayes Was Told She \u2018Had No Chance.\u2019 She, and Voters, Beg to Differ.", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was about a minute into Jahana Hayes\u2019s victory speech, which, to that point, consisted of two words \u2014 \u201cWow,\u201d she said twice, gathering her composure \u2014 when she recalled the launch of her unlikely campaign for Congress just 102 days earlier, \u201cwith no money, no network, no people.\u201d\u201cPeople told me I had no chance and I had no business trying to do this,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cWe proved them wrong.\u201dHer acceptance speech was, in many ways, a metaphor for Ms. Hayes\u2019s life, one that began with diminished expectations: a childhood of poverty in Waterbury, where she lived in public housing and was briefly homeless before becoming pregnant at 17. She then embarked on a career in teaching that led to a National Teacher of the Year award.And although Ms. Hayes\u2019s story likely has many origin points, her nascent political career probably began on a different stage from the one in Waterbury that she occupied on Tuesday night.In 2016, Ms. Hayes, a history teacher in Waterbury, was chosen as the National Teacher of the Year, and traveled to Washington to accept the award from President Barack Obama.As the president was about to speak, Ms. Hayes, visibly overjoyed, continued her clapping. \u201cYou just need to settle down,\u201d Mr. Obama quipped.\u201cThis is what makes her a great teacher,\u201d the president continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t be great if you\u2019re not enthusiastic.\u201dHer victory and sudden prominence could also expose Ms. Hayes to some of the same sort of backlash that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has seen since her primary victory, as Republicans and conservative commentators have seized on any evidence of her inexperience or unfamiliarity with world issues or even the mechanics of Congress.In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Hayes acknowledged the parallels between her race and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s.Unlike Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who is a democratic socialist, Ms. Hayes characterizes herself as a die-hard Democrat who represents a very different district in Connecticut than Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district in Queens and the Bronx. Ms. Hayes\u2019s district contrasts sumptuous weekend properties in the hills of Litchfield County with struggling cities like Waterbury, where a quarter of residents live below the poverty line.\u201cA representative of this district would have to be progressive on some issues and a little more moderate on others,\u201d said Ms. Hayes, who is raising four children with her husband of 10 years.Her opponent, Mr. Santos, won a three-way primary race, and has his own compelling back story as an immigrant and military veteran.He emigrated as a child from Portugal, where his home had no running water or electricity. His family settled in the Hartford area and he eventually became an engineer. In the early 1990s, he served in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm, as a fighter jet mechanic and rifleman.But Mr. Santos faces a tough general election. Organizations like the Cook Political Report, which rank congressional districts, note that Connecticut\u2019s Fifth District is solidly Democratic.Ms. Hayes certainly reflects that political demographic, advocating for progressive doctrines like Medicare for all and gun control, ideals that are anathema to the current White House. In her victory speech, she pulled no punches, castigating the recent separation of immigrant families at the Mexican border and referring to \u201cputting babies in cages.\u201dStill, she has not dwelled on either President Trump\u2019s rhetoric or his policies.\u201cI could probably count on one hand the number of times I mentioned him by name in this campaign,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cI think the concerns that people have about this administration are self-evident and I don\u2019t need to double down on that. We have to work to come up with solutions.\u201dMs. Hayes credits her own mentors and the support of the Waterbury community in helping her overcome a childhood marred by drug abuse \u2014 her mother was an addict \u2014 and instability. At one point, her family lost their apartment and she moved in with her grandmother.She put herself through school while working nights and raising her child. After enrolling in community college, she earned a four-year degree from Southern Connecticut State University and then earned master\u2019s and advanced degrees from two other universities in the state.Along the way, she married Milford Hayes, a police detective. They live in Wolcott, a suburban town settled in the 1730s with ample open space outside of Waterbury.After receiving the teaching award in 2016, Ms. Hayes put away her lesson plans at John F. Kennedy High School and moved to the school district\u2019s central office, where she mentors new teachers.Robert A. Johnston, the high school principal in Waterbury, said he was not surprised by news of Ms. Hayes\u2019s election success. He said she had a preternatural ability to connect with students. \u201cShe understood young people,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knew what made them tick.\u201dOne such person was not even a regular student of Ms. Hayes. When Megan Colleran was in fifth grade, she attended an after-school program at a museum in Waterbury that was taught by Ms. Hayes and another instructor.A decade later, Ms. Colleran, now a 19-year-old undergraduate at Central Connecticut State University, still keeps the note that Ms. Hayes inscribed on her final project. \u201cMy favorite girl,\u201d it reads. \u201cYou are so smart and have such a creative spirit.\u201dOn Primary Day, hundreds of Ms. Hayes\u2019s former students were waiting to see if their teacher would prevail. Many of the more than 500 supporters who filled the victory party at the Marriott Hotel were one-time pupils.Still, Ms. Hayes\u2019s campaign was not without difficulties. At the district\u2019s political convention in May, a late switch in votes from delegates caused her to lose the party\u2019s endorsement, even though she initially had more votes. In an interview, Ms. Hayes was diplomatic, saying only that she felt like the proper protocol was not followed.While Ms. Hayes would be the first black Democrat from the state in Congress, another Waterbury native, Gary Franks, a black Republican, represented the area for three terms in the 1990s.Still, a first is a first. And the former teacher has contemplated the new kind of role model she would make if elected this fall.Astead W.

{"Headline": "The iGen Shift: Colleges Are Changing to Reach the Next Generation", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "The newest students are transforming the way schools serve and educate them, including sending presidents and deans to Instagram and Twitter.Supported byThey are, of course, super connected. But on their terms. Which is why college-bound iGens (Gen Zers, if you prefer) present a challenge to the grown-ups on campus eager to reach and teach them.Consider orientation season. Katie Sermersheim, dean of students at Purdue University, has a mother lode of information and resources to share (including wellness initiatives and a new mindfulness room). But getting iGen\u2019s attention?\u201cIt can be frustrating slash extra challenging to figure out how to get the word out, whatever that word is,\u201d Ms. Sermersheim said. \u201cI do get discouraged.\u201dA generation that rarely reads books or emails, breathes through social media, feels isolated and stressed but is crazy driven and wants to solve the world\u2019s problems (not just volunteer) is now on campus. Born from 1995 to 2012, its members are the most ethnically diverse generation in history, said Jean M. Twenge, psychology professor at San Diego State University.They began arriving at colleges a few years ago, and now they are exerting their presence. They are driving shifts, subtle and not, in how colleges serve, guide and educate them, sending presidents and deans to Instagram and Twitter.They are forcing course makeovers, spurring increased investments in mental health \u2014 from more counselors and wellness messages to campaigns drawing students to nature (hug a tree, take a break to look at insects) \u2014 and pushing academics to be more hands-on and job-relevant.They are a frugal but ambitious lot, less excited by climbing walls and en suite kitchens than by career development.Most critically, they expect to be treated as individuals. Students raised amid the tailored analytics of online retailers or college recruiters presume that anything put in front of them is customized for them, said Thomas C. Golden of Capture Higher Ed, a Lexington, Ky., data firm. He sees group designations evolving into \u201csegments of one.\u201dStudents want to navigate campus life, getting food or help, when it is convenient for them. And, yes, on their mobile devices or phones. \u201cIt\u2019s not really technology to them,\u201d said Cory Tressler, associate director of learning programs at Ohio State University, noting that the iPhone came out when most were in grade school.It is why Ohio State this year, rather than battle device use, issued iPads to 11,000 incoming students. The school designated 42 fall courses \u201ciPad required\u201d (21 more will be added in the spring) and is building an app that in addition to maps and bus routes has a course planner, grades, schedules and a Get Involved feature displaying student organizations.In the works is more customization, so when students open the app it knows which campus they are enrolled at, their major and which student groups they belong to.Speaking to students on their terms just makes sense, said Nicole Kraft, a journalism professor at Ohio State who takes attendance via Twitter (she has separate hashtags for each of her three courses). She posts assignments on Slack, an app used in many workplaces. And she holds office hours at 10 p.m. via the video conference site Zoom, \u201cbecause that is when they have questions.\u201dDr. Kraft does not use email for class, except to teach students how to write a \u201cproper\u201d one. \u201cThat is a skill they need to have,\u201d she said.While these students are called \u201cdigital natives,\u201d they still must be taught how to use devices and apps for academic purposes, Dr. Kraft said. She\u2019s had students not know that they could use Microsoft Word on an iPad. \u201cWe make a lot of assumptions about what they know how to do.\u201dCampuses also have been slow to recognize that this age group is not millennials, version 2.0.\u201cIGen has a different flavor,\u201d said Dr. Twenge of San Diego State University and author of \u201ciGen: Why Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy \u2014 and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood \u2014 and What That Means for the Rest of Us.\u201dIt is tricky to define a large part of the population. But Dr. Twenge said big data sets revealed broad psychological patterns shared by those coming of age amid defining social, cultural and economic events.The difference between growing up in the prosperous 1990s versus seeing family members lose jobs and homes during the 2008 recession alters one\u2019s perspective, she said. It is why iGens are so focused on debt and insist that they get skills and experiences that will lead to a career.The prevalence of school shootings and domestic terrorism has also shaped them.\u201cThis generation defies the stereotypes of young adults,\u201d in terms of risk-taking, Dr. Twenge said. They are \u201cmore receptive to messages around safety\u201d and less eager to get driver\u2019s licenses, and they come to college \u201cwith much less experience with sex and alcohol.\u201dThey are also more cautious when it comes to academics, fear failure and have learning preferences distinct from millennials, said Corey Seemiller, professor at Wright State University and co-author of \u201cGeneration Z Goes to College,\u201d who queried 1,200 students on 50 campuses.\u201cThey do not like to learn in groups,\u201d favor videos over static content and like to think about information, then be walked through it to be certain they have it right.\u201cThey want a model\u201d and then to practice, said Dr. Seemiller, who posts samples when assigning a paper. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Let\u2019s look through them and see what works.\u2019\u201d Having grown up with public successes and failures online, she said, students are hungry to have a big impact, yet \u201cworry they will not live up to that expectation.\u201dAnd despite their digital obsession, Dr. Seemiller\u2019s research shows this generation favors visual, face-to-face communication over texting. They are not always good at live social interaction, but they crave it. \u201cThey want authenticity and transparency,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like the idea of human beings being behind things.\u201dAs a generation that \u201chas been sold a lot of stuff,\u201d said Dr. Seemiller, iGens are shrewd consumers of the tone and quality of communication. That\u2019s pushing colleges to focus not only on what they say, but also how they say it.Which is what orientation leaders and staffers in Princeton\u2019s office of the dean of undergraduate students \u2014 known on social media as ODUS \u2014 have tried to master in the way they welcome the class of 2022.Cody Babineaux, an incoming freshman from Lafayette, La., whose video of his acceptance to Princeton has 4.6 million Twitter views, appreciated it, especially the Harvard shirt sniffed and tossed out in the first 20 seconds. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t try too hard.\u201dGetting student attention and keeping it matters to administrators trying to build excitement for campus events, but also in prodding students about housing contracts and honor codes. \u201cWe are an office that enforces university standards. We can\u2019t be firing off,\u201d said Thomas Dunne, deputy dean of undergraduate students. \u201cBut you have to be animated and human-sounding. Our voice is very personal.\u201dODUS has become an active presence on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter with a vibe that winks, pokes, weaves in memes and slang terms like BAE (before anyone else) and on fleek (flawlessly styled), and applies hashtags with wit (a free ice cream for dropping by the ODUS office with dance moves worthy of Dean Dunne? #GetServed, #GameOfCones).Mr. Dunne, whose Facebook page began as a student prank without his knowledge more than a decade ago, leans on staff members who include 20-somethings. One, Ian Deas, who favors Snapchat, identifies student \u201cinfluencers,\u201d following them on Facebook and Instagram.In posts, he looks for \u201cthose trendy phrases that help us stay in the conversation.\u201d When ODUS staff members respond to student posts, it amplifies their reach. \u201cWhen we are being interactive, our stuff pops up in other people\u2019s feeds\u201d and drives curiosity about \u201cwho is behind the voice.\u201dBeing social on social media attracts students who might tune out official communication. Mr. Babineaux said he and his friends noted when college posts sounded \u201cgoofy\u201d or \u201clike your grandfather trying to say swag.\u201dHe also notices that his generation is criticized \u201cbecause we are always on our phones,\u201d which gets interpreted as being disconnected. In fact, he said, \u201cwe just have more connection with everyone all the time.\u201dIt is also how students like Mr. Babineaux learn and get information.\u201cSocial media has helped me get a lot more prepared for Princeton,\u201d he said, adding that he has scrolled through old posts of campus (\u201cI have never seen snow\u201d) and watched videos, including of graduation. \u201cI thought, \u2018That will be on my Instagram page in four years.\u2019\u201dThis is the third of four new Learning sections being published this year.

{"Headline": "What Do Ducks Hear? And Why Do We Care?", "Date": "2018-07-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byscience takeOver two seasons, 2016 and 2017, she spent months raising and working with more than two dozen hatchlings from three different species, all to determine what they hear underwater.A similar tactic might work with diving ducks, but first, as Dr. Williams said, it would make sense to answer a question that science hasn\u2019t even asked about diving ducks: \u201cWhat do they hear?\u201d\u201cThere actually is little to no research done on duck hearing in general,\u201d Ms. McGrew said, \u201cand on the underwater aspect of it, there\u2019s even less.\u201dThe training involved many steps. First she had to teach the ducklings to associate a sound with a treat. Then she had to get them to peck a target when they heard that sound. Eventually the ducks had to learn to respond to a light by diving and pecking one target, and then, if they heard a sound while they were underwater, to surface and peck another target. The ducks varied in learning ability, both by species and individual duckling. Over two years only nine of 29 hatchlings made it to the final stages of the hearing test. As for the differences in species, she said, \u201cThe long-tailed ducks are the smartest.\u201d But, she said, they also try to cheat. She said they \u201ctry and get the reward without doing the correct behavior.\u201dCommon eiders were too group-oriented to do any tests alone. \u201cI was actually only able to train one individual,\u201d Ms. McGrew said, of 11 hatchlings. \u201cBut she ended up being probably my most reliable duck.\u201dSurf scoters were not the smartest, she said, but once they learned the drill, they performed it reliably.In the end, it turned out that the ducks heard well underwater in a range from one to three kilohertz. That is unfortunately close to the hearing range of fish, which can hear up to two kilohertz.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Ludicrous Attack on Big Tech ", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe idea that Google and Twitter are rigging their platforms against him is patently false.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Case in point are some tweets this week from President Trump, who wrote his umpteenth in a series of attacks on the big tech platforms.The latest sputter \u2014 that\u2019s a digital equivalent that falls between clearing your throat of mucus and vomiting slightly in your mouth \u2014 was aimed at Google. In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him:\u201cGoogle search results for \u2018Trump News\u2019 shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on \u2018Trump News\u2019 are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation \u2014 will be addressed!\u201dWill. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night.But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can\u2019t get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don\u2019t cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can\u2019t stand the endless bullying, but let\u2019s stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.So whether it\u2019s the idea that Twitter \u201cshadow bans\u201d right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it\u2019s all codswallop.You can look that fine word up on Google if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And Google is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold \u2014 and in some cases, dangerous \u2014 ways.It is certainly true that some of tech\u2019s egregious sins \u2014 like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, Google and Twitter leaders are expected to appear \u2014 need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It\u2019s hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.Last week, for example, he tweeted: \u201cSocial Media Giants are silencing millions of people \u2026 People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!\u201dBut it\u2019s been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn\u2019t-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it\u2019s probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.It\u2019s certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It\u2019s pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)What\u2019s most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an \u201cinnoventor\u201d of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) \u2014 is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: \u201cFor one set, we can\u2019t take enough down; for another set, we can\u2019t leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.\u201dWhich makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.\u201cThey want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u201dNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not.

Mr. Eisinger is a reporter at ProPublica.Oh, the audacity of dopes. The crimes of Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen are notable not just for how blatant they were but also for their lack of sophistication. The two men did little to hide their lying to banks and the Internal Revenue Service. One can almost sympathize with them: If it wasn\u2019t for their decision to attach themselves to the most unlikely president in modern history, there\u2019s every reason to think they might still be working their frauds today.But how anomalous are Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen? Are there legions of K Street big shots working for foreign despots and parking their riches in Cypriot bank accounts to avoid the I.R.S.? Are many political campaigns walking felonies waiting to be exposed? What about the world of luxury residential building in which Mr. Cohen plied his trade with the Trump Organization? The answer is more disturbing than the questions: We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know because the cops aren\u2019t on the beat. Resources have been stripped from white-collar enforcement. The F.B.I. shifted agents to work on international terror in the wake of Sept. 11. White-collar cases made up about one-tenth of the Justice Department\u2019s cases in recent years, compared with one-fifth in the early 1990s. The I.R.S.\u2019s criminal enforcement capabilities have been decimated by years of budget cuts and attrition. The Federal Election Commission is a toothless organization that is widely flouted. No wonder Mr. Cohen and Mr. Manafort were so brazen. They must have felt they had impunity. How could they not? Any person in any bar in America can tell you who was held accountable for the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, which peaked 10 years ago next month: No one. No top officer from any major bank went to prison. But the problem goes beyond big banks. The Department of Justice \u2014 in Democratic as well as Republican administrations \u2014 has lost the will and ability to prosecute top executives across corporate America, at large industrial firms, tech giants, retailers, drugmakers and so on. Instead the Department of Justice reaches settlements with corporations, which pay in dollars instead of the liberty of their top officers and directors. Beginning with a charge to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, has fallen upon a rash of other crimes. In doing so, he has exposed how widespread and serious our white-collar-fraud problem really is, and how lax enforcement has been for years.At least he is also showing a way out of the problem. He and his team are demonstrating that the proper attention, resources and experience can go a long way to rectify the white-collar-prosecution crisis. What\u2019s Mr. Mueller\u2019s secret? For one thing, he has a focus. He and his team have sufficient resources to go after a discrete set of investigations. In the early 2000s, the Justice Department had similar success setting up the Enron Task Force, a special SWAT team of government lawyers that prosecuted top executives of the failed Texas energy trader. That contrasts with the financial crisis, when the Justice Department never created a similar task force. No single department official was responsible for the prosecutions of bankers after the global meltdown.The investigation\u2019s techniques are also instructive. The Southern District of New York, to which Mr. Mueller referred the Cohen case, raided the offices of Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former attorney, and fought for access to the materials, even as Mr. Cohen asserted attorney-client privilege. When federal prosecutors investigate large companies, out of custom and deference they rarely use such aggressive tactics. They place few wiretaps, conduct almost no undercover operations and do almost no raids. Instead government attorneys reach carefully negotiated agreements about which documents they can review, the product of many hours of discussion with high-powered law firms on behalf of their clients. All the battles over privileged materials happen behind closed doors and without the benefit of a disinterested special master, as the Cohen case had. Indeed it\u2019s worse than that. The government has essentially privatized corporate law enforcement. The government effectively outsources the investigations to the companies themselves. The companies, typically trying to appear cooperative or to forestall government action, hire law firms to do internal investigations. Imagine if Mr. Mueller relied on Mr. Trump to investigate whether he colluded with the Russians or violated any other laws, and Mr. Trump hired Rudy Giuliani\u2019s firm to do the inquiry.Moreover, Mr. Mueller isn\u2019t looking to go soft to preserve his professional viability. I\u2019m assuming that at age 74, he\u2019s not going to go through the revolving door after this. That hasn\u2019t been true for most top Justice Department officials in recent years. Many of them start out defending large corporations, and when they leave government they go back to the same work of defending large corporations. The same goes for the younger prosecutors who negotiate those corporate settlements. Almost all go on to become corporate defense attorneys. In those negotiations, they are auditioning for their next jobs, wanting to display their dazzling smarts but also eventually needing to appear like reasonable people and avoid being depicted by the white-collar bar as cowboys unworthy of a prestigious partnership.Of course, we don\u2019t know whether Mr. Mueller can go all the way to the top. The big issue in white-collar crime is whether the Justice Department can prosecute CEOs. Sure, it occasionally brings charges against lower-level executives of major corporations, but it hasn\u2019t held the chief of a Fortune 500 company accountable in more than a decade. While most observers believe Mr. Mueller will adhere to policy and not indict the president, will his report to Congress implicate the chief executive of the United States if the evidence warrants it?One man cannot fix the large problem on his own, however. \u201cFor these individual episodic financial crimes, the government can muster the capacity and courage to investigate and prosecute,\u201d said Paul Pelletier, a former federal prosecutor who recently ran for Congress in a Democratic primary. \u201cThe real question is whether, in the context of a national economic crisis, the Department of Justice has sufficient experience, resources and leadership to effectively tackle it. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s pretty obvious it does not.\u201d For that, the Justice Department requires more resources and bodies than the government devotes to white-collar crime today, and probably some changes in the law. Nevertheless, this should be a moment of reflection for white-collar prosecutors. It should not take a special counsel to uncover millions of dollars in bank fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. Using proper techniques, prioritizing crimes that can harm millions of people and stiffening their obsequious posture toward corporate executives will go a ways to remedying the situation. That must be sweet music not just to other Manaforts and Cohens but also to any corporate malefactors out there.Advertisement"}

It is closed systems that kill.Of course, we have learned that the internet can be just as good at building silos and reinforcing the algorithmic separation of people as at bringing them together.

We know how echo chamber effects get amplified, and how those echo chambers may be opaque, easily infiltrated by Russian trolls. The utopian view of the Internet has collapsed.The gale of nationalism is gusting against bread broken together, the arc of history bending toward justice, and all that. Is it a market correction or a long-term trend? I\u2019m not sure \u2014 but we urgently need to broaden our analysis.

Ms. Pawel is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.\u201d Gov. Jerry Brown praised Arnold Schwarzenegger for the role that he had played a decade earlier, as governor, in starting the environmental initiative. Mr. Schwarzenegger in turn hailed Governor Brown as a visionary leader and shrewd negotiator who had cobbled together bipartisan support crucial to passing the landmark deal. But the bond between the two governors on display underscored a more fundamental, long-lasting force in the Golden State: the Party of California.Among his many friendships with Republicans, Mr. Brown cherished his friendship with Earl Warren. When Mr. Brown defeated Richard Nixon to win re-election in 1962, he and Mr. Warren toasted the victory. When Mr. Brown lost four years later to Ronald Reagan, Mr. Warren was dismayed and wrote to his friend, \u201cYou have given our state good, progressive government for eight years and that is all any man could have done.\u201dJerry Brown modeled his second act after leaders on Mr. Starr\u2019s list like Hiram Johnson, Earl Warren and his father, whom he identified as the most successful governors, \u201cthe people who built the state, who were innovators and who were not ideologues or people who were pigeonholed into one partisan box.\u201d If Gavin Newsom wins election in November, as expected, the next governor of California will be a San Francisco Democrat best known as an early champion of same-sex marriage, legalization of marijuana and universal health care.

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s the Conversation We Really Need to Have About Bias at Google", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut that concludes the \u201cdefense of Google\u201d portion of this column. Because whether he knew it or not, Mr. Trump\u2019s false charges crashed into a longstanding set of worries about Google, its biases and its power. When you get beyond the president\u2019s claims, you come upon a set of uncomfortable facts \u2014 uncomfortable for Google and for society, because they highlight how in thrall we are to this single company, and how few checks we have against the many unseen ways it is influencing global discourse.Dr. Noble argues that many people have the wrong idea about Google. We think of the search engine as a neutral oracle, as if the company somehow marshals computers and math to objectively sift truth from trash.But Google is made by humans who have preferences, opinions and blind spots and who work within a corporate structure that has clear financial and political goals. What\u2019s more, because Google\u2019s systems are increasingly created by artificial intelligence tools that learn from real-world data, there\u2019s a growing possibility that it will amplify the many biases found in society, even unbeknown to its creators.Google says it is aware of the potential for certain kinds of bias in its search results, and that it has instituted efforts to prevent them. \u201cWhat you have from us is an absolute commitment that we want to continually improve results and continually address these problems in an effective, scalable way,\u201d said Pandu Nayak, who heads Google\u2019s search ranking team. \u201cWe have not sat around ignoring these problems.\u201dFor years, Dr. Noble and others who have researched hidden biases \u2014 as well as the many corporate critics of Google\u2019s power, like the frequent antagonist Yelp \u2014 have tried to start a public discussion about how the search company influences speech and commerce online.There\u2019s a worry now that Mr. Trump\u2019s incorrect charges could undermine such work. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s complaint undid a lot of good and sophisticated thought that was starting to work its way into public consciousness about these issues,\u201d said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who has studied Google and Facebook\u2019s influence on society.Dr. Noble suggested a more constructive conversation was the one \u201cabout one monopolistic platform controlling the information landscape.\u201dSo, let\u2019s have it.In the United States, about eight out of 10 web searches are conducted through Google; across Europe, South America and India, Google\u2019s share is even higher. Google also owns other major communications platforms, among them YouTube and Gmail, and it makes the Android operating system and its app store. It is the world\u2019s dominant internet advertising company, and through that business, it also shapes the market for digital news.Google\u2019s power alone is not damning. The important question is how it manages that power, and what checks we have on it. That\u2019s where critics say it falls down.Google\u2019s influence on public discourse happens primarily through algorithms, chief among them the system that determines which results you see in its search engine. These algorithms are secret, which Google says is necessary because search is its golden goose (it does not want Microsoft\u2019s Bing to know what makes Google so great) and because explaining the precise ways the algorithms work would leave them open to being manipulated.But this initial secrecy creates a troubling opacity. Because search engines take into account the time, place and some personalized factors when you search, the results you get today will not necessarily match the results I get tomorrow. This makes it difficult for outsiders to investigate bias across Google\u2019s results.A lot of people made fun this week of the paucity of evidence that Mr. Trump put forward to support his claim. But researchers point out that if Google somehow went rogue and decided to throw an election to a favored candidate, it would only have to alter a small fraction of search results to do so. If the public did spot evidence of such an event, it would look thin and inconclusive, too.\u201cWe really have to have a much more sophisticated sense of how to investigate and identify these claims,\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s law school who has studied the role that algorithms play in society.Google has no similar program, but Dr. Nayak said the company often shares data with outside researchers. He also argued that Google\u2019s results are less \u201cpersonalized\u201d than people think, suggesting that search biases, when they come up, will be easy to spot.\u201cAll our work is out there in the open \u2014 anyone can evaluate it, including our critics,\u201d he said.The kind of blanket, intentional bias Mr. Trump is claiming would necessarily involve many workers at Google. And Google is leaky; on hot-button issues \u2014 debates over diversity or whether to work with the military \u2014 politically minded employees have provided important information to the media. If there was even a rumor that Google\u2019s search team was skewing search for political ends, we would likely see some evidence of such a conspiracy in the media.That\u2019s why, in the view of researchers who study the issue of algorithmic bias, the more pressing concern is not about Google\u2019s deliberate bias against one or another major political party, but about the potential for bias against those who do not already hold power in society. These people \u2014 women, minorities and others who lack economic, social and political clout \u2014 fall into the blind spots of companies run by wealthy men in California.Eventually, this error was fixed. But how many other such errors are hidden in Google? We have no idea.Google says it understands these worries, and often addresses them. In 2016, some people noticed that it listed a Holocaust-denial site as a top result for the search \u201cDid the Holocaust happen?\u201d That started a large effort at the company to address hate speech and misinformation online. The effort, Dr. Nayak said, shows that \u201cwhen we see real-world biases making results worse than they should be, we try to get to the heart of the problem.\u201dYet it is not just these unintended biases that we should be worried about. Researchers point to other issues: Google\u2019s algorithms favor recency and activity, which is why they are so often vulnerable to being manipulated in favor of misinformation and rumor in the aftermath of major news events. (Google says it is working on addressing misinformation.)Some of Google\u2019s rivals charge that the company favors its own properties in its search results over those of third-party sites \u2014 for instance, how it highlights Google\u2019s local reviews instead of Yelp\u2019s in response to local search queries.The danger for Google is that Mr. Trump\u2019s charges, however misinformed, create an opening to discuss these legitimate issues.Advertisement"}

First we have Cameron Collins, the 25-year-old offspring of Representative Chris Collins of New York, indicted with Dad on an insider-trading scheme. It is possible that they\u2019re the first pair ever to be accused of conspiring during a congressional picnic.Meanwhile Donald Trump Jr. is twisting slowly in the wind while the president denies he\u2019s worried that his kid will wind up in the clink.Oh, memories. Just two years ago, Donald Jr. and Collins, a super-enthusiastic Trump evangelist, spoke on the same night of the Republican convention. \u201cUnder Barack Obama we have been losing,\u201d Collins told the crowd. It wasn\u2019t exactly a highlight of the evening, but as it turned out, few people in the room had a keener understanding of the importance \u2014 and profitability \u2014 of spotting a loser. Back to the Republican convention: After Representative Collins finished complaining about Barack Obama, Donald Jr. took the stage and rocked the audience with his prediction that Dad was going to run an administration for average Americans \u2014 \u201cnot a special class of crony elites at the top of the heap.\u201d To be fair, you couldn\u2019t expect Junior to realize that one of his fellow speakers was going to be accused of insider trading, which is sort of the definition of \u201cspecial class of crony elites.\u201d Or to foresee that his father\u2019s future cabinet would boast an E.P.A. head who tried to use his job to help get his wife a Chick-fil-A franchise.

It certainly sounds as if Dad is plenty worried, although the president denied it in a recent tweet: \u201cFake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics \u2014 and it went nowhere. I did not know about it.\u201dWe\u2019ve been around this president too long to buy the \u201cI did not know\u201d line. However, he could very possibly win some converts if he tried \u201cIf I knew, I forgot almost instantly.\u201dStep 1 \u2014 Donald Jr. gets invited to meet a \u201cRussian government attorney\u201d who would give him super-good dirt on Hillary Clinton. Perhaps he remembered his father\u2019s history of, um, doing stuff in Russia and imagined he was going to get something sexy.Step 2 \u2014 Whatever. Our boy bites. (\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d)Step 4 \u2014 Eventually Junior is called to testify before a Senate committee, where he swears his father didn\u2019t know anything about the meeting. Which, yeah, was actually not about adoption. The adoption story lasted approximately as long as Dad\u2019s career as the enemy of crony elites.So here we are. As things stand, the best argument for Don Jr.\u2019s side is that everything he did was a total failure. Incompetence is, unfortunately, not a legal defense. Meanwhile, Chris Collins\u2019s lawyer noted that \u201ceven the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share. \u2026\u201d Yeah, just his kid. Finally, we\u2019ve found someone who might make the Trump family saga seem heartwarming. Don Jr.\u2019s mounting legal troubles do seem to bring out his father\u2019s affections. At the time the first news of the Russian meeting erupted, Trump affirmed, through a spokeswoman, that his boy was \u201ca high-quality person.\u201d This is the sort of thing you\u2019d say about someone you were recommending to a neighbor who needed his yard mowed. But this week, Junior\u2019s been promoted to \u201cwonderful son.\u201d By the time the indictments come down, the younger Trump will probably be \u201cthe best child ever.\u201d And he can trade stories with Cameron Collins in the courthouse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Myanmar, a Facebook Blackout Brings More Anger Than a Genocide Charge", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Myanmar made international headlines twice this week, with each instance provoking a drastically different response from the country\u2019s citizens.The United Nations report, which highlighted the massacre of at least 10,000 Rohingya Muslims over the past year, was largely ignored by the local news media and internet users.The Facebook ban, by contrast, catalyzed a frenzied, vociferous response in Myanmar, where the social media platform is so popular that it is synonymous with the internet.On Facebook \u2014 where else? \u2014 users in Myanmar debated whether they should boycott the site for denigrating their military and spiritual leaders. In addition to the bans announced on Aug. 27, Facebook in January froze the accounts of extremist Buddhist monks who had fanned Islamophobia in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.\u201cWe have called Facebook to ask why they have done this,\u201d said U Zaw Htay, a Myanmar government spokesman. \u201cWe worry that this action will have an impact on national reconciliation.\u201dOn Facebook, Mr. Zaw Htay has dismissed well-documented Rohingya accounts of sexual violence committed by Myanmar soldiers as \u201cfake rape.\u201dMany members of the general public in Myanmar echo their leaders, convinced that the outside world, the United Nations included, has fabricated the slaughter that propelled more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh since last August.By the middle of the week, nationalists had suggested a mass migration to VKontakte, also known as VK, a social media network that is popular in Russian-speaking parts of the world.\u201cAnother social network is coming,\u201d wrote U Ye Htut, Myanmar\u2019s former information minister, on his Facebook page, referring to VK, which has been banned in several countries for its pro-Russia tilt.On Tuesday, a VK account was set up for Myanmar\u2019s commander in chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who was one of the individuals blocked by Facebook, where his page had 2.8 million followers.Despite the damning United Nations report on genocide, Myanmar has been shielded from formal criticism from the United Nations Security Council by two permanent members, Russia and China.\u201cWe have to go with Russia when the father of democracy, America, is unfair,\u201d Ashin Wirathu wrote on VK.Facebook had long operated under the assumption that just connecting people was a good unto itself, a company spokeswoman said, but the network\u2019s use as a tool to incite violence in recent years has made it clear that such connectivity can also be abused.Facebook now has 60 Burmese speakers to trawl for unacceptable content and will employ 100 by the end of the year, she said.This year, deadly communal violence in Sri Lanka was catalyzed by rumors, some spread on Facebook, that Muslims were trying to make Buddhists infertile, among other provocative myths.For some Facebook users in Myanmar, however, the platform remains an easy place to express anti-Muslim sentiment and use racist epithets like \u201ckalar\u201d against the Rohingya.\u201cThere are only two types of people in Myanmar: those who do not want soldiers and those who do not want kalar,\u201d wrote Thura Thu, a professed Buddhist nationalist, on his Facebook page.U Nay Zin Latt, a former presidential adviser in Myanmar, joined calls for patriotic people in Myanmar to abandon Facebook.\u201cEvery modernized person is moving from Facebook to VK,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMove to VK, which is suitable for nationalists. Leave dictator Facebook.\u201dMr. Nay Zin Latt, who regularly posts anti-Rohingya broadsides on his Facebook page, said that he had already collected 5,000 followers on his new VK account. But on Aug. 30, his VK account was blocked.\u201cThis profile has been temporarily suspended due to security concerns,\u201d read a notice on his page.The same happened to the VK account of Ashin Wirathu, the radical Buddhist monk.\u201cBoth Facebook and VK are committing crimes against human rights and freedom of expression by shutting down U Wirathu\u2019s accounts,\u201d said U Yar Za, a spokesman and bodyguard for Ashin Wirathu.\u201cWe nationalists are working for our people,\u201d he added. \u201cOwners of social media are working for themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s High Crimes and Misdemeanors", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principled case for impeachment is clear. What\u2019s missing is the courage.Opinion ColumnistMy reasons: First, being a terrible president and a wretched person are not impeachable offenses. Second, Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has so far produced evidence that can be interpreted as obstruction of justice, but not as clear proof. Third, impeachment in the House would be unlikely to translate into conviction in the Senate, even if Democrats win both chambers in the fall. Fourth, impeachment without conviction could strengthen Trump politically, much as it did for Bill Clinton after his own 1998 impeachment.And, like it or not, Trump remains popular with tens of millions of Americans. To overturn the results of an election for anything less than unambiguous evidence of criminal behavior is a danger to democracy itself. At least that was my view until this week. Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea changes this. The Constitution\u2019s standard for impeachment is \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d The standard is now met.Trump\u2019s longtime fixer acknowledged in court on Tuesday that he violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.\u201d That means Trump. That means that, as a candidate, Trump is credibly alleged to have purposefully conspired with Cohen to commit criminal acts. That means the duo did so \u201cfor purposes of influencing [an] election for Federal office,\u201d which is the legal definition of a campaign contribution.The Trumpian rebuttal to these charges is that Cohen is a sleazy lawyer and proven liar. And that the most prominent attempt to prosecute a political figure for violating campaign-finance laws \u2014 involving former Democratic senator and 2004 vice-presidential candidate John Edwards \u2014 failed in court. And that campaign-finance violations don\u2019t rise to the level of impeachable offenses, anyway.But if Cohen\u2019s lies as Trump\u2019s lawyer are one thing, lying under oath to a federal judge is quite another. Cohen\u2019s sentencing isn\u2019t until December, when he\u2019s expected to be sent to prison for up to five years. If he\u2019s being untruthful, that leaves plenty of time for any deceits to come to light. Ask yourself: Does he look like a guy eager to have his sentence doubled?As for the Edwards standard, the case failed because prosecutors could not prove that the former North Carolina senator received campaign donations from benefactors to influence an election, rather than simply cover up an embarrassing affair. In Trump\u2019s case, there is little doubt about the purpose of the payment to Stormy Daniels: To prevent disclosure of their alleged liaison, less than a month before the election and barely two weeks after the Access Hollywood tape came to light.To suggest that this doesn\u2019t amount to a felonious act also doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. The president is now, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator on charges already prosecuted by the government as a criminal matter against Cohen. Why should a lighter standard apply to Trump, since he\u2019s the one at whose direction Cohen claims to have carried out the payments? That question should especially engage those conservatives who demanded Clinton\u2019s impeachment (as I did). Take South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, one of the House managers overseeing the case against the 42nd president.The emphases here are mine. To conservatives reading this column, ask yourselves the following questions: If breaking the law (by lying under oath) to conceal an affair was impeachable, why is breaking the law (by violating campaign-finance laws) to conceal an affair not impeachable? If \u201ccheating the electoral system\u201d (by means of a burglary) was impeachable, why is cheating the electoral system (by means of illicit hush money) not impeachable? If cheating \u201cour institutions\u201d (by means of an \u201cassault\u201d in \u201cevery way\u201d on the legal system) is impeachable, why is cheating those institutions (by means of nonstop presidential mendacity and relentless attacks on the Justice Department and the F.B.I.) not impeachable?Advertisement"}

It could be a model for the nation.Ms. Firestone and Ms. De Anda run a nonprofit in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley focused on solving drinking water problems.Now, for the first time, a solution is within reach in California. State lawmakers are expected to vote this month to establish reliable funding sources to help ensure, for the first time, that all state residents have access to safe and affordable drinking water. It could be a model for other states.In 2015, the same year that the water crisis in Flint, Mich., made headlines, more than 21 million people nationwide relied on drinking water systems that violated basic legal health standards, according to the study. Throughout the country, low-income communities disproportionately bear the brunt of this crisis. In California, drinking water contamination is most likely to afflict small, low-income communities of color, particularly Latino farmworker communities that have not benefited from the tremendous economic growth in the San Francisco Bay Area and other urban centers. However, nearly every county in the state has a system without safe drinking water. In 2012, after a hard-fought grass-roots campaign, California became the first and only state to pass a right-to-water act. That bill enshrined \u201csafe, clean, affordable and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes\u201d as a basic human right. Yet more than five years later, legislators have yet to take the bold actions necessary to make that guarantee a reality.This is not just a problem in California. As the recent study in the National Academy of Sciences journal found, \u201cregulatory compliance\u201d with drinking water regulations \u201ccan be a challenge for rural systems due to limited financial resources and technical expertise.\u201d The study also noted that small systems \u201cface restricted access to loans and outside financing.\u201dNow a solution may be at hand in California. After more than a decade of intense community activism, negotiations and studies, a plan to help communities tackle drinking water problems has won the support not only of environmental justice and public health advocates but also of leaders from business, agriculture, labor and many local governments and water suppliers, though not all.The agricultural fee revenues would be targeted to address nitrate contamination from fertilizers, a common problem in farming areas. Money raised by the voluntary contributions, which would be collected from water customers unless they opt out, would be directed to disadvantaged communities suffering from water contamination caused by a range of pollutants, such as arsenic and uranium. Together, these sources are expected to raise $100 million or more a year. Advertisement"}

Mr. Jones and Infowars have used social media for years to spread dark and bizarre theories, such as that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Apple made its move on Sunday and the others followed on Monday.The actions, one of the tech companies\u2019 most aggressive efforts against misinformation, highlighted a difficult dilemma for their businesses. They have long desired to combat misinformation online, but they have also been reluctant to be arbiters of truth.But since a rise of misinformation online around elections, such as the 2016 presidential vote, the tech companies have faced increasing calls from lawmakers and the news media to address their role in that spread of false information and a related increase in partisan divisions. The tech companies have recently stepped up enforcement \u2014 but that has led to accusations of political bias, largely from conservatives.Apple on Sunday removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app. Commenting on the move, a spokeswoman said, \u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech.\u201dFacebook, Spotify and Google\u2019s YouTube site, which removed some Infowars content last week, followed with stronger measures on Monday. Facebook removed four pages belonging to Mr. Jones, including one with nearly 1.7 million followers as of last month, for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d Facebook said the violations did not relate to \u201cfalse news.\u201dYouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which had more than 2.4 million subscribers and billions of views on its videos, for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.Mr. Jones and Infowars are leaders in using the internet to spread right-wing conspiracy theories, an effort that was aided after Donald J. Trump appeared on Mr. Jones\u2019s show during the 2016 presidential campaign and praised Mr. Jones\u2019s reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Mr. Jones has repeatedly claimed that the government staged the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and numerous other mass shootings and tragedies.\u201cTo many, Jones is a bad joke,\u201d said the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut the sad reality is that he has millions of followers who listen to his radio show, watch his \u2018documentaries\u2019 and read his websites, and some of them, like Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, resort to deadly violence.\u201dMr. Jones and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.The big tech firms that control, via their websites and apps, how much of the world\u2019s media content is distributed have faced criticism in recent weeks for enabling Mr. Jones and Infowars.A Google spokesman said on Monday that YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel outright because he continued to flout policies he had already been penalized for violating.Mr. Jones and Infowars still have other ways to reach listeners and readers. They have increasingly been directing viewers to visit the Infowars website, which would limit their reliance on the tech companies, presumably foreseeing the bans. Twitter has not restricted the accounts of Mr. Jones or Infowars. A Twitter spokesman said the accounts were not in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules.Other tech companies\u2019 approach has been uneven; they have left up Infowars content on some of their services despite removing it from others.Infowars introduced a new smartphone app last month that is finding users on Apple\u2019s App store and Google\u2019s Play Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 23rd most popular news app on the Google Play store and the 33rd most popular news app on Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Monday, the Infowars app ranked ahead of apps like BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal on Google, and ahead of apps like MSNBC and Bloomberg on Apple.Apple decided to allow the Infowars app on its store after reviewing it, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Google Play Store has different policies than YouTube, a Google spokesman said.\u201cThe timing is very puzzling because he\u2019s been saying this stuff for years and they haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said.Conservatives warned that more sites would be cut off soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Red, and Ready to Flip", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYes, a majority of Americans find Trump repulsive. But more important, his policies are not popular. Contributing Opinion Writer It was titanic when the Speaker of the House, the Democrat Tom Foley, lost his seat in Eastern Washington State in 1994, a takedown that heralded a long winter for his party outside of coastal and urban enclaves.So if an epic upset happens again in that same district, as seems possible after Tuesday\u2019s primary, it will be because of party-flipping voters who haven\u2019t given Democrats a sniff in a generation\u2019s time. History is lurking again in the West.I caught up with the potential giant-killer in Washington\u2019s Fifth Congressional District, the Democrat Lisa Brown, just after the shame of Helsinki, when President Trump sided with the tyrant Vladimir Putin over his own country. While others were talking treason, Brown was sticking to basics in meetings with farmers and small-town residents. \u201cHealth care insecurity \u2014 that\u2019s the number one concern, a very big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, you really notice the enthusiasm of women. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of doorbelling, and the gender difference stands out.\u201dDemocrats don\u2019t need to remind voters of the monster in the White House. Trump will do that himself, with daily tweets and his hate-filled rallies. Nor do they need to send out trendy socialists from New York to districts where the main ideology is common sense.The case in point here is health care. The district is red. Trump carried it by 13 points. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking woman in Republican House leadership, has held this seat for 14 years. And in those 14 years, she has consistently voted for things that hurt people in her district. Specifically, she long tried to take away health care, backing proposals that would have left 70,000 people without insurance in her swath of Eastern Washington. That area, unlike the Seattle metro area 300 miles to the west, has a disproportionate amount of poor whites whose lives were aided immensely by Obamacare. The big Republican tax cut, favoring the rich, means nothing in place where family incomes are low. Trump\u2019s tariffs are killing farmers in a region where 93 percent of the wheat is sold overseas. Farmers fear those markets, lost in the incoherency of Trump\u2019s trade tantrums, may never come back, as buyers find other countries with saner leaders. But it was taking away something so fundamental to life as health insurance that prompted Brown to get into this race. It seemed like a lost cause; McMorris Rodgers has never received less than 56 percent of the vote in seven general elections. But on Tuesday\u2019s primary \u2014 basically an open poll, with the top two finishers going to the runoff, no matter the party \u2014 Brown held the incumbent to a near dead heat, both getting just below 50 percent of the vote. She may still top her with late returns.This week an audio tape emerged of Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, at a fund-raiser for McMorris Rodgers in Spokane last month. Throwing out any pretense of oversight, he told donors that Republicans in the House need to protect Trump from the special counsel.In this case, what happens in Spokane may stay in Spokane and hurt McMorris Rodgers. The culture of corruption around this president \u2014 his sleazy campaign manager on trial, three former Cabinet secretaries forced to resign in disgrace, all the grifting \u2014 have left many people saying, enough.Lisa Brown took a stand for working mothers back in 1993, when she brought her infant son to the floor of the Washington State Legislature for a late-night vote. She was told to remove the child. She protested; her day care was closed, and she had no choice. She went on to become the first female majority leader of the State Senate. After that, she served as a chancellor of Washington State University in Spokane. A seasoned pol, she will need to call on all her political muscle memory to win this race.For a quarter-century, Republicans have been winning in places like Spokane because of culture and resentment. The old way to scare people was through the three Gs \u2014 gays, guns and God.

{"Headline": "How America\u2019s Jews Learned to Be Liberal", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe answer lies in the 19th century, when Judaism became a distinctively American religion.Mr. Weisman is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Chosen Wars: How Judaism Became an American Religion.\u201dA startling opinion survey released this summer revealed just how wide is the rift between the world\u2019s two largest Jewish communities.Israelis approve of President Trump\u2019s handling of United States-Israeli relations by 77 percent, which is hardly surprising for the most pro-Israel occupant of the White House in many years. But only 34 percent of American Jews feel the same way, and 57 percent disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Israel, according to the same poll, which was taken by the American Jewish Committee.Israelis are red-state Jews. American Jews are blue-state \u2014 politically liberal in their outlook.That wasn\u2019t always true. Descended from immigrants who fled injustice, Jews of varying religious traditions have stood up for the underdog and voted for liberal Democrats since before the New Deal, in part because Democrats catered to immigrants\u2019 concerns and because anti-Semitism has been associated more with the right than the left. But the answer to why a majority of Jews are liberals has a deeper explanation, perhaps little appreciated, even by Jews themselves.That explanation lies specifically in Jewish-American history rooted in the 19th century, when Judaism became a distinctively American religion, substantially changed from what it had been for more than two millenniums.One factor in the rise of an American Judaism was practical. To assimilate and work in their adopted land, many Jews abandoned some of their ancient practices, from observing the Sabbath to keeping kosher and wearing distinctive clothing. Discarding these practices forced Jews to turn their faith into a devotion to core beliefs, rather than customs and practices.More broadly, Jews sought to \u201cAmericanize\u201d their rituals, making them look more like the church ceremonies of their neighbors. The largely German immigrants of the 19th century started Sunday schools, mixed men and women in family pews and incorporated choirs, organ music and sermons in their services while rejecting or shortening some obscure prayers. These changes provoked debates, division and lawsuits. But they took hold, even among traditionalists, and continued even after the influx of two million Jews from Russia at the turn of the 20th century.The most significant change to Judaism was its untethering from the ancient tradition of praying for an altogether human messiah to deliver the Jews back to Jerusalem, restore the ancient temple destroyed in the year A.D. 70 and re-establish the House of David to rule over Jews in their ancient land of Zion, as prophesied in the Bible. These were among the enduring 13 principles codified as central to Judaism by Maimonides in the 12th century.Rejecting the plea for a \u201cpersonal\u201d messiah was hardly without controversy. After disavowing the practice of praying for a personal messiah, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise was ousted from his synagogue in Albany, N.Y., on the eve of Rosh Hashana in 1851 and got into a fistfight with his detractors when he defiantly tried to take the Torah from the ark anyway. The ensuing riot had to be quelled by the police.But the abandonment of a belief in a Jesus-like messiah figure generally prevailed, as did the growing use of the term \u201ctemple\u201d in the United States to describe a Jewish house of worship, as if to imply that the ancient temple of Jerusalem had become irrelevant.Yet Jews continued to be drawn to the concept of an era of redemption as foretold by the ancient prophets, a time when the wolf would lie down with the lamb. The difference was that while Jews prayed for such a prospect, they increasingly understood that it was up to humans to work to achieve it. In this, American Jews were influenced by the mainstream Protestantism of the Second Great Awakening, the Transcendentalists and others who substituted human agency for God\u2019s work.The Pittsburgh Platform declared in 1885 that it was the duty of Jews \u201cto participate in the great task of modern times, to solve, on the basis of justice and righteousness, the problems presented by the contrasts and evils of the present organization of society.\u201d These pioneering Jews also redefined their history of the diaspora, or exile, seeing these punishments less as retribution for misdeeds committed in antiquity and more as a sacred assignment to disperse, proclaim justice and set an example for a world in need of repair.Today that idea has spread well beyond Reform Judaism. Arnold Eisen, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, the leading Conservative institution in the United States, has noted that the idea of Jews as a \u201cchosen people\u201d appears throughout the Bible and that Jews have embraced the message of later prophets that Jews are \u201cthe servant of mankind\u201d and \u201ca light unto the nations.\u201dFor many American Jews, the prophetic and messianic role of the Jewish people themselves has become central to their faith. A Pew Research Center survey of American Jews found in 2013 that among the five million American Jews, most regarded \u201cworking for justice and equality\u201d as a pillar of their Jewish identity.It happens to be true that the phrase \u201ctikkun olam\u201d is a kind of modern neologism, derived from Jewish mysticism. But the idea of Judaism with a social conscience is rooted in a rich history of American Jews struggling to Americanize their faith while seeing their \u201cchosen\u201d status as an opportunity to \u201crepair the world.\u201d Steven R. Weisman, the vice president for publications and communications at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Chosen Wars: How Judaism Became an American Religion\u201d and a former correspondent and editor at The Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel, This Is Not Who We Are", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrthodoxy should be respected, but we cannot allow the politics of a radical minority to alienate millions of Jews worldwide. Mr. Lauder is president of the World Jewish Congress.These events are creating the impression that the democratic and egalitarian dimensions of the Jewish democratic state are being tested. Israel is a miracle. The Jews of the diaspora look up to Israel, admire its astonishing achievements and view it as their second home. However, today some wonder if the nation they cherish is losing its way. For 4,000 years, the Jewish people were seen as the world\u2019s moral compass.The Zionist movement has been unwaveringly democratic from its very start. Writ large upon its flag were liberty, equality and human rights for all. It was also one of the very first national movements to guarantee full equality and voting rights for women. And when Israel was founded, it immediately became the first and only democracy in the Middle East. Its Declaration of Independence guarantees \u201ccomplete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,\u201d as well as a guarantee of freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. Theodor Herzl, Chaim Weizmann, Zeev Jabotinsky, David Ben Gurion and Golda Meir always emphasized the need to combine Jewish nationalism with universal humanism. So now, when Israel\u2019s government appears to be tarnishing the sacred value of equality, many supporters feel it is turning its back on Jewish heritage, the Zionist ethos and the Israeli spirit. Tragically, the new policies will not strengthen Israel but weaken it, and in the long run they may endanger Israel\u2019s social cohesiveness, economic success and international standing. But the greatest threat is to the future of the Jewish people. For over 200 years, modern Judaism has aligned itself with enlightenment. The Jews of the new era have fused our national pride and religious affiliation with a dedication to human progress, worldly culture and morality. Conservatives and liberals, we all believe in a just Zionism and a pluralistic Judaism that respects every human being. So when members of Israel\u2019s current government unintentionally undermine the covenant between Judaism and enlightenment, they crush the core of contemporary Jewish existence. Already today, the main challenge facing the Jewish diaspora is a deep \u2014 and deepening \u2014 generational divide. All over the world, and especially in North America, Jewish millennials are raising doubts that their parents and grandparents never raised. The commitment to Israel and Jewish institutions is not unconditional. Passing the torch to this younger generation is already a difficult undertaking \u2014 as many leaders, educators, rabbis and parents will attest. But when Israel\u2019s own government proposes damaging legislation, this task may well become nearly impossible. Let us not forget: A vast majority of the world\u2019s Jews do not identify as Orthodox. They are traditional, secular, Conservative, Reform or completely unaffiliated. Orthodoxy should be respected, but we cannot allow the politics of a radical minority to alienate millions of Jews worldwide. We are one people, few in number, and we must stop sowing division among ourselves. Once we are united, our future will be boundless. I have always stood by Israel and I always will. But now, as a loving brother, I ask Israel\u2019s government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage being heard in Israel and throughout the Jewish world. As president of the World Jewish Congress, I call upon Israeli leaders to rethink their destructive actions during this summer of disharmony. This is not who we are, and this is not who we wish to be. This is not the face we want to show our children, grandchildren and the family of nations. Let us work together to change course and ensure that Israel will continue to be the Jewish democratic state it is meant to be. Ronald S.

{"Headline": "A Symbol for \u2018Nobody\u2019 That\u2019s Really for Everybody", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityThe blue and white wheelchair icon is more than a guide to parking spots and ramps. It allows millions to fully participate in society.Ms. Guffey is a professor of art and design history. I was 12 years old when I first encountered the blue wheelchair symbol. I still remember sitting in our family car on that hot Southern California afternoon in 1975 as my mother pulled into the department store parking lot. Something was wrong. The cars were all parked in the wrong places. Then, as we drove near the store\u2019s front door, we saw a new set of neatly painted blue and white lines on the pavement, and a little wheelchair symbol stenciled on each space. The rest of the parking lot was filled, but these spaces were all conspicuously empty. I especially remember the comments that came after the new spaces arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame,\u201d our neighbor told my mother one day. \u201cIt used to be if you arrived early enough you could count on getting a parking space in front of the store. Now nobody can use them.\u201d Later I wondered, who is \u201cnobody\u201d? I was born with cerebral palsy. At that point I had never used a wheelchair, but as soon as I saw that figure, I knew instinctively that it was a friend and an ally. Whatever my neighbor or other people said, the little figure was whispering a message of inclusion directly to me. To this day, I have a complicated relationship with wheelchairs. I did not use one at all until my 40s, when I first visited the New York Maker Faire in Queens, N.Y., and my wheelchair use remains peripatetic. Even so, I\u2019ve long recognized this symbol as a kind of lifeline that allows me to participate in and contribute to larger society. Like many disabled people, I was born with a body that allows partial mobility. As a child, I used heavy braces and special orthotic shoes, and I\u2019ve always found it challenging to merely move across a room. I fall frequently, and my injuries have included concussions, broken teeth and sprained limbs. Despite these setbacks, the symbol has guided me through places, and pointed out spaces that are safe. This month, the \u201cwheelchair symbol,\u201d formally known as the International Symbol of Access, turned 50. It\u2019s an occasion worth celebrating.The original symbol was conceived by Susanne Koefoed, a Danish design student during the turbulent summer of 1968 \u2014 a year now remembered for social upheavals like the resistance in Prague, the strikes in Paris and the raised fists of black American athletes at the Mexico City Olympics. In the student-led design workshop in Stockholm that she was attending, Koefoed planted the seed for another sort of revolution when she came up with an idea for common signage to guide disabled people to accessible facilities. She drew a schematic wheelchair. The symbol really took off in 1974, when the United Nations approved it as a key component of barrier-free design. Officially rendered in the now-familiar blue and white, the international convention for roadside amenities, the little icon became a familiar sight in parking lots, restrooms, ramps and other public places across the globe. In 1990, when President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act into law, the \u201cwheelchair symbol\u201d came to legally identify a host of standardized accommodations for disabled people. By this time, it was one of the most recognized symbols in the world. In the United States, it is now accepted as legal signage and can be found on road signs, disabled parking tags and other official documents across the 50 states. It\u2019s been years since I first heard my neighbor openly complain about the wheelchair symbol, or the accommodations it is meant to provide. Today, I recognize that even then, the little figure was moonlighting. Yes, its official job remains to identify facilities and guide disabled people to ramps, automated doors or larger toilet stalls. But it also reminds us that access to buses and trains, entry to stores and classrooms, and the enjoyment of parks and pools is a legal right shared by everyone \u2014 disabled or not. And it reminds us of our fundamental obligation to support one another and to continue building the barrier-free society that we know we can build. We can also happily note that my neighbor was wrong: The wheelchair symbol is not a design for nobody. It actually belongs to all of us.

Here's How to Do It Right.", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Research shows that talking about failure makes for happier, more productive workers. Supported byWe\u2019ve all flopped on a big presentation.After weeks of careful preparation and practice, you feel ready to knock it out of the park. But the day comes and, for whatever reason, every joke seems to fall flat, you bumble through all your numbers and your technology seems to be working against you.\u201cWe respond that way, and then we feel bad about responding that way, and so we try to cover it up instead of learn from it,\u201d Mr. Staats said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of the reaction. It is natural.\u201dBut first, we have to talk about it.\u201cI believe that almost everyone can benefit from sharing and hearing another perspective,\u201d said Tasha Eurich, a Denver-based organizational psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s healthy to ask about what went wrong in a meeting. You have to engage other people in that process of learning.\u201dIt can be tempting to hide behind the safety blanket of Slack or email, but having face-to-face conversations around failure can be especially effective in building stronger relationships among colleagues. The ability to convey tone, body language and other non-linguistic reactions often plays a positive and humanizing role in these conversations, and all of that is lost in email, Mr. Staats said.It\u2019s also worth putting thought into how you frame the incident: A long-winded, venting session can be cathartic, but it also has the potential to sound self-centered or melodramatic.\u201cInstead of telling a story of how horrible things went, frame it as, \u2018Can you help me with this?\u2019\u201d Mr. Staats said. \u201cWe see that when you ask others questions, most people actually want to help.\u201d He added that by asking a question, \u201cwe activate in them that spirit of helping.\u201dIt goes both ways. When our co-workers ask us questions, we\u2019re more likely to develop a positive opinion of them because we see that they\u2019re humbly turning to us as someone they perceive as having valuable knowledge, according to Mr. Staats.\u201cWhen that happens, you actually take it as a compliment,\u201d he said.However, the enemy of benign envy, according to the paper, is \u201cmalicious envy\u201d: The type of envy others feel when we talk about our achievements much more often than our struggles. Projecting that image of perfection can be especially harmful for those in leadership positions who risk coming across as disingenuous, Ms. Brooks and her colleagues found.A simple way to understand this is to look at the polished-though-unrealistic lives many of us present on social media.\u201cOn Instagram and Facebook, people post these curated, shiny, beautiful personas of themselves, which contributes to this general belief that other people don\u2019t experience as many failures as we do,\u201d Ms. Brooks said.Ultimately, the researchers found that talking about failure \u2014 both during the fact and afterward \u2014 can help to cultivate closer relationships with colleagues.Other than helping you seem more approachable and likable, talking about failure and encouraging your peers to do the same can also make you a more efficient worker.Amy Edmondson, a professor in leadership and management at Harvard Business School, has studied three different kinds of failures: preventable failure, complex failure and intelligent failure. The latter two have the greatest potential to promote learning in the workplace.\u201cComplex failures occur when we have good knowledge about what needs to be done. We have processes and protocols, but a combination of internal and external factors come together in a way to produce a failure outcome,\u201d Ms. Edmondson said. \u201cThese kinds of failures happen all the time in hospital care, for example, where there\u2019s enough volatility or complexity in the environment that things just happen.\u201d Ms. Edmondson added that it\u2019s difficult to assign responsibility for complex failures, but that staying vigilant about these kinds of mistakes can help improve existing processes.Similarly, intelligent failure occurs when we\u2019re working in areas in which we don\u2019t have expertise or experience, or in areas that are uncharted in a broad, industrywide sense. \u201cWe might launch a new product that\u2019s never been launched before, and it\u2019s a failure. We should tell everybody!\u201d Ms. Edmondson said.When an intelligent failure is buried or goes undiscussed, others risk repeating the exact same mistakes. The result? Increasingly inefficient organizations that replicate, instead of learn from, the same mistakes.According to Sara Canaday, executive coach and author of \u201cYou \u2014 According to Them,\u201d the rise of start-up businesses has made it much more acceptable to openly celebrate intelligent failure.\u201cSuddenly, people are saying things like, \u2018fail fast or fail forward.\u2019 Those are brand new words in the nomenclature of business,\u201d she said. By linking resiliency to innovation and growth, start-ups contribute to a general professional culture that frames failure as a positive learning experience. Likewise, many hiring managers are increasingly looking for resiliency in job candidates. That means it can be in your best interest to thoughtfully embrace the too-common interview question about a time you failed at work and how you overcame the challenge. Ms. Eurich recalls an interview process in which a candidate was unable to acknowledge or reflect on any professional mistakes he had made.\u201cAgainst my advice, they hired him anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cHe ended up being one of the most problematic employees both from a performance perspective and a legal perspective. Screening people around us for their willingness to talk about their failure is so important.\u201dEven when you grow comfortable with the prospect of sharing your failures at work, it\u2019s important to remember that not every company has a culture that will welcome or even tolerate this kind of openness. That\u2019s not to say employees can\u2019t create \u201csafe spaces\u201d among themselves to share their struggles. In fact, Ms. Edmondson encourages it, but factors like seniority are likely to impact how conversations about failure are received. Mr. Haushofer said he first wrote the CV in 2010 \u201cin response to a friend not getting something they tried out for, to comfort them.\u201d \u201cIn 2016,\u201d he said, \u201csomebody close to me didn\u2019t get an opportunity they wanted, so I updated it and sent it to them, too. It seemed to get a positive response, so I kept updating it.\u201d In fact, most of the positive emails he has received since putting the CV of Failures on his website have come from younger Ph.D. students, who have expressed relief at finding solidarity for their struggles. \u201cIf a first-year Ph.D. student who is relatively unknown published a CV of their failures, well, it might not work as well,\u201d said Ms. Brooks. She acknowledged that talking about failure is riskier for young professionals across the board, but said that if junior workers find the right audience \u2014 namely people who are professional peers, not superiors \u2014 to talk about failures with, the trust-building and humanizing benefits are worth it. \u201cIf you\u2019re having lunch with some of your peers, then revealing failure is a great strategy to induce levels of liking by reducing malicious envy,\u201d Ms. Edmondson said. Opening up about that presentation gone awry can be a gamble, but it\u2019s one worth making as long as you\u2019re making it intentionally. (Especially if you\u2019re sick of getting left off the post-work happy hour email invite.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Parasitic Vines That Feed on Parasitic Wasps That Feed on Trees", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesIt\u2019s parasites all the way down.Parasites have a leisurely lifestyle \u2014 set up camp at someone else\u2019s place, live off their food, profit (evolutionarily speaking). But new research shows that sometimes the parasite gets a taste of its own medicine, and from an unexpected source. Scientists studying wasps that target oak leaves found that a second parasite, a vine, can get its tendrils into the homes set up by the wasps, called galls, subverting their diversion of the host\u2019s resources. After that, things don\u2019t go so well for the wasp. Galls are like in-law apartments for parasites: swollen masses of plant tissue that route nutrients to wasp larvae, which grow and develop safely within until they are mature enough to leave. \u201cI thought it was maybe a seed or a fruit,\u201d said Scott Egan, an assistant professor of biosciences at Rice University in Houston and the study\u2019s lead author. But cutting open the growth revealed the body of a wasp inside, confirming its gall status. The scientists looked through their sacks of samples gathered in the field and found this gall was not the only one to be compromised.So, Dr. Egan went back to the Florida sand live oak forest where his collaborator, Glen Hood, first found the gall. Dr. Egan walked through the trees and kept his eyes open. Soon, he realized that in one patch, the oaks and their galls were threaded with a plant called the parasitic love vine. There the researchers found numerous instances of the vine entering the galls. The connection did not seem harmless. When the researchers dissected 51 love-vine-infested galls from one wasp species, they found that 45 percent contained a mummified adult wasp, compared with only 2 percent of uninfested galls. The vine isn\u2019t just randomly attacking the galls, the researchers conjecture. It usually attaches itself to stems, buds, and the tops and sides of leaves, but never to the undersides of leaves. That is where galls of this particular wasp species form, however. And when a gall is present, the vine\u2019s aversion to undersides seems to disappear. Gall-forming parasites have been studied for hundreds of years, as have parasitic plants. But this is the first time that a parasitic plant feeding on a parasitic insect feeding on a host plant has been reported, said Dr. Egan. Additional research will confirm whether it is more common than scientists had realized. And what of the sand live oak, the setting for this parasite death match? How is it doing? \u201cIn general, gall wasps can have fitness consequences for their hosts \u2014 they can reproduce less, generate fewer acorns,\u201d said Dr. Egan. The same is true for parasitic vines. But at least on first glance, the trees don\u2019t seem to be suffering too overtly. The team has been visiting some wasp-infested trees for ten years, and they are green and flowering, producing acorns. The hosts can take a certain amount of beating on a regular basis, it seems, and still survive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Afraid of Shahidul Alam?", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe imprisonment of Bangladesh\u2019s most respected photojournalist illustrates the country\u2019s drift toward autocracy.Ms. Spivak teaches at Columbia University.On Aug. 5, Shahidul Alam, the acclaimed Bangladeshi photojournalist, was dragged from his home by around 30 plainclothes policemen and taken into custody. The policemen forced their way into Mr. Alam\u2019s apartment building at 10:30 p.m., snatched the cellphones of the building\u2019s security guards and destroyed its video surveillance cameras. Mr. Alam\u2019s work over the decades has captured some of the most important political and ecological questions in Bangladesh and the region around it. A friend remembers waking up to the tragedy of the Rohingya people from Myanmar after seeing an exhibition of Mr. Alam\u2019s photographs in New York. I first encountered his work after a cyclone in Bangladesh in 1991. I was involved in the relief effort and visited the affected area after the storm. Mr. Alam\u2019s photographs captured the reality of my experience. Befittingly, in 2014, Mr. Alam was awarded the Shilpakala Padak, one of the highest honors for artists in the country, by the president of Bangladesh. The trigger for Mr. Alam\u2019s arrest was an interview he did with Al Jazeera, in which he spoke critically of the brutal repression of student demonstrations in Dhaka by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. He also spoke about official corruption, years of misrule, the suppression of dissent and extrajudicial killings and disappearances under the watch of Ms. Hasina\u2019s governing Awami League. Paradoxically, the imprisonment of Mr. Alam only proved his point. Mr. Alam was among the journalists who witnessed the Awami League faithful attacking student protesters while the police stood by. He photographed the protests and the repression. General elections in Bangladesh are expected between October and December. It is the obligation of artists and intellectuals to be constructively critical of their country of citizenship. Ms. Hasina\u2019s government must be deeply afraid of a credible, respected person like Mr. Alam, whose criticisms are taken seriously, both nationally and globally. His arrest and imprisonment is an attempt to silence critical voices. Ms. Hasina\u2019s government is not stopping with his arrest. It is trying to find ways of defaming him and tarnishing his reputation. Mr. Alam\u2019s partner, Rahnuma Ahmed, an anthropologist, visited him in prison and was startled to realize their meeting was being secretly videotaped by the prison authorities. \u201cFriends in the electronic media tell me they have been instructed by the agencies to produce \u2018dirty stories\u2019 on Shahidul, there is even talk of constructing him as a pedophile \u2014 pathetic given his love for children known to everyone,\u201d Ms. Ahmed said in an email.It is impossible for Mr. Alam to get a fair trial in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Hasina\u2019s son has accused Mr. Alam of inciting violence.\u201cBecause of his false posts and allegations, students became enraged and attacked the police and our party office,\u201d Ms. Hasina\u2019s son wrote on social media. \u201cMany policemen and several of our activists were injured. One of them, Arafatul Islam Bappy even lost his eyesight and is now permanently crippled.\u201dApart from massive violations of Mr. Alam\u2019s rights, a breakdown of social justice looms over Bangladesh. The prosecution of peaceful protesters demonstrates that Ms. Hasina\u2019s government understands justice only as revenge. The arrest, abuse and incarceration of Mr. Alam brutalizes his person and attacks the right to a free press and the promise of social justice. Bangladesh must immediately release him and the arrested student protesters from prison and drop the charges against them.Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak is a professor and the founder of the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society at Columbia University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Taliban Start Charm Offensive, Afghan President Calls for Cease-Fire", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Even as insurgents in Afghanistan have escalated their attacks against government forces across the country, they have also been staging a simultaneous charm offensive of sorts in advance of Eid al-Adha, the Islamic Feast of Sacrifice, which starts this week.In the past week alone, the Taliban have overrun a city, burned down government facilities, hidden in civilians\u2019 homes and killed hundreds of their opponents.The moves left many in the country expressing hope that the Taliban and the government would join a cease-fire and hold peace talks.On Sunday, the government made the first move. President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan proposed a conditional cease-fire with the Taliban, extending a trust-building measure to the insurgents before Eid al-Adha.\u201cI announce a conditional cease-fire starting from tomorrow, Monday, until Nov. 21, birthday of the Prophet Muhammad,\u201d Mr. Ghani said from Darul-Aman Palace on Sunday during celebrations for Independence Day.\u201cThe cease-fire is conditional, and if the Taliban also announce and observe the cease-fire, it will continue until the Taliban are observing it.\u201dSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Sunday that he welcomed the government\u2019s proposal. \u201cThe last cease-fire in Afghanistan revealed the deep desire of the Afghan people to end the conflict, and we hope another cease-fire will move the country closer to sustainable security,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.He added that the United States is ready to support and participate in negotiations. \u201cThere are no obstacles to talks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time for peace.\u201dThere was no immediate response from the Taliban about a new cease-fire, but Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said on Sunday that the group had identified hundreds of prisoners that it wants the government to release on Monday, so that \u201cthey can share the happiness of Eid with their families and friends.\u201dRelease of such prisoners has been a Taliban condition for another cease-fire.In terms of how it treats its own potential captives, the insurgents do seem to be abiding by the promise not to harm government troops who lay down their arms.When the northern district of Bilchiragh in Faryab Province was captured by the Taliban late Saturday, the militants promised the last 50 government defenders that they would be freed if they surrendered. When the government supporters capitulated, the insurgents allowed the Bilchiragh District\u2019s police chief, Ahmad Shah Khan, to speak by phone with a reporter.\u201cI am with the Taliban now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe negotiated through tribal elders, and the result is they will release the whole personnel of the district, and me, too.\u201dThere have been no reported cases of such surrenders, and the insurgents were pushed out of most of the city after six days.Central to the effort are Taliban fighters who send reports from the battlefield for inclusion in propaganda. During a quiet period in the Taliban effort to take over Ghazni this month, half a dozen insurgents walked up a mostly empty street in a Ghazni neighborhood, moving toward a young man speaking on the phone outside his house.\u201cThey are here,\u201d the man said into the phone as the insurgents approached him. He nervously put his phone away.\u201cAre you happy with the mujahedeen?\u201d the fighter asked.\u201cInshallah,\u201d or God willing, the man said.The so-called reporter did not seem satisfied with the vague answer, and he kept pressing.\u201cWe want to see one side in charge,\u201d the civilian told him diplomatically. \u201cThis side or the other side, everyone is tired of war.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll use it to say, \u2018See, people like us, and they are happy with the Taliban presence in their area,\u2019\u201d Mr. Qaisari said. \u201cIn reality, people are too afraid of them to say anything against them.\u201dBut even as they sought to portray themselves as hospitable to civilians, the Taliban were rampaging through Ghazni. In their six-day attack, they set fire to buildings and marketplaces, and attacked police and government positions. The insurgents repeatedly told civilians that they would not be harmed, but then took over their homes and shops to fight from them, killing 155 members of security forces.There were also 50 to 70 civilians killed, with attacks from both sides. Many of those civilians died in airstrikes on Taliban positions; the Ghazni Red Cross estimated that at least 24 perished in American and Afghan airstrikes to push out the insurgents last week.When the insurgents burned down buildings in Ghazni, they explained to residents that they were punishing displays of wealth and privilege. Setting a courthouse ablaze, one insurgent explained: \u201cWe don\u2019t need such fancy buildings. We hold our courts out in the desert.\u201d\u201cYes, he gives very good advice, which brings positive effects on learning methods,\u201d the principal quickly responded.As uncomfortable as the encounter appeared, it signaled a major change; insurgents were more likely in the past to be burning down schools than they were to be monitoring them.People in the district had just spent two years under an Islamic State reign of terror, complaining that the extremists had raped and enslaved women, and killed men and sometimes children suspected of supporting either the government or the Taliban.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the insurgent asked.\u201cNoruddin,\u201d the villager responded.\u201cWere you forced to seek refuge because of the Islamic State?\u201d\u201cYes, we went to the desert.\u201d\u201cSo now the Islamic Emirate came here and they captured the area,\u201d the Taliban militant said, referring to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, as the group calls its own government. \u201cAre you happy with the Islamic Emirate?\u201d\u201cYes, we are happy,\u201d Noruddin said.\u201cDid they oppress you?\u201d\u201cNo, none of them oppressed us.\u201d\u201cNone of the mujahedeen?\u201d\u201cNo, no,\u201d a very relieved looking Noruddin said as the questioning ended.The Bilchiragh District governor, Jamil Sadeqi, confirmed that the area had fallen. He said the insurgents had 600 fighters, and that the government forces, who were outnumbered, were unable to get reinforcements or air support.\u201cIt was not possible to fight,\u201d said Mr. Khan, the district police chief who surrendered. \u201cWe had asked for reinforcement and support, but it was not provided.\u201dIn exchange for their freedom, government forces who surrender to the Taliban typically promise not rejoin the fight against insurgents.Najim Rahim contributed reporting from Kunduz, Afghanistan, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Administration Gets Tough on Russia \u2014\u00a0Despite Trump", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president holds chummy meetings with Vladimir Putin, while his administration imposes new sanctions.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Certainly Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is asking for punishment when his agents use a chemical weapon against a double agent, brazenly meddle in Western elections, cheat in international sports, ruthlessly ravage Ukrainian territory or violate human rights.In fact, the sanctions announced Wednesday should not have been unpredictable. They follow a 1991 law requiring sanctions against any country that uses chemical or biological weapons. The administration should have imposed them months ago.Still, there is a value in demonstrating to Mr. Putin and his band that however friendly Mr. Trump may seem, or whatever hold Mr. Putin may have on Mr. Trump, the United States is not prepared to condone Russia\u2019s aggression or meddling. That Washington is continuing to punish Russia, despite anything Mr. Trump says or does, may also deter European leaders leaning toward lifting sanctions, like those in Hungary and Italy, from rushing to do so.Yet sanctions are a potent weapon whose effectiveness is diminished when they are not backed by united resolve. The discord in the United States, or in Europe, allows Mr. Putin to claim that Western penalties are the result not of anything Russia did, but of an internal dispute between Western hawks and doves, between those who would do anything to prevent Russia from being great and those who seek friendly relations with an important nation.Mr. Putin may even believe this, following the cynical Soviet view of international politics instilled in him in his K.G.B. years as a vicious game of thrones in which the West\u2019s concern for human rights or rules are just cynical weapons to be deployed when needed. Meddling in American and European politics is a direct product of that worldview.Sanctions may not persuade Mr. Putin or his followers that the world, or at least the West, really does get angry when he violates elemental rules of international behavior, as when Russia uses lethal chemical weapons abroad, incites violence in an independent neighbor, seizes foreign territory, cheats in the Olympic Games, murders opponents or uses cyberweapons to interfere in foreign elections. He is even less likely to be persuaded when he believes he has a kindred, or at least malleable, spirit in the White House, and hopes he can manipulate Americans to elect more of the same.What could persuade Mr. Putin is the certainty that some behaviors carry an inevitable and heavy cost. The Russians must see that any respite from sanctions depends on them, and not on the unpredictable resident of the White House or a few populist leaders in Europe.This would be a good time for Mr. Trump to declare that he is fully behind his State Department and National Security Council in demanding an accounting from Russia. An administration divided against itself only makes a mockery of sanctions. Advertisement"}

He Keeps Them Close.", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "The Republican nominee for Senate in Virginia likes to engage the racial fringes of his party, creating a dilemma for mainstream G.O.P. leaders wary of his views.Supported byWOODBRIDGE, Va. \u2014 Corey Stewart stands at the end of a long driveway that leads back in time, to his 18th century plantation manor hidden in woods behind a modern housing development. Mr. Stewart, the Republican Senate nominee from Virginia, treats the brick home like a living museum, complete with buttons from Redcoats, a Civil War soldier\u2019s belt buckle and a room dedicated to George and Martha Washington, who were once visitors.This has made him a popular figure with white nationalists, much to the horror of many Virginia Republicans. While Mr. Stewart has disavowed some on the extreme right, interviews with dozens of his friends, colleagues, supporters and fellow Republicans yielded a portrait of a political opportunist eager to engage the coarsest racial fringes of his party to advance his Trumpian appeal.\u201cI don\u2019t think he said anything bad there,\u201d Mr. Stewart, 50, said during a 90-minute interview last month. \u201cIn fact I was one of the few people in the country that actually said pretty much the same thing.\u201dHe does not accept that slavery was at the heart of the Civil War.\u201cWe can debate about the causes of the Civil War,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut the causes of it were much more complex\u201d than only slavery.\u201cThe question of what actually caused the Civil War is secondary to the result of the Civil War, which is that after the war was over, slavery was ended and the North and the South reconciled. And I think we need to respect that.\u201dHe contended that the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was a concoction of the left.\u201cThis term they literally resurrected, \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which hadn\u2019t been used in 100 years, or whatever it was,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s clearly a coordinated effort to \u2014 because they know the term \u2018racist\u2019 has been overused \u2014 they\u2019ve come up with another one which is \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 an equally ridiculous term.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body,\u201d Mr. Stewart said during a recent appearance. \u201cNot one. I challenge anybody to find a single racist statement that I\u2019ve ever made.\u201dIn an extraordinary sign of discomfort with Mr. Stewart, some Republicans have been eager behind the scenes to provide opposition research aimed at discrediting him, with disaffected party members circulating racially inflammatory tweets and Facebook postings authored by one of Mr. Stewart\u2019s advisers.But many Republican leaders haven\u2019t publicly disavowed Mr. Stewart, mindful that Mr. Trump is supporting him, and that the president has strong influence with the party base \u2014 many of whom supported Mr. Stewart in the primary.Virginia has not elected a Republican statewide since 2009 and voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016. With its strong economy and elite public university system, Virginia has become a symbol of Southern moderation and tolerance, but the far right sees an ally in Mr. Stewart who will push back against the leftward drift and demographic changes underway in the state.For his part, Mr. Stewart said he sees virtue in being provocative.\u201cI think you need to be edgy,\u201d he said.Even as a teenager growing up in Duluth, Mr. Stewart was known for his ambition.\u201cI had many kinds of debaters,\u201d his high school debate coach, Jack Armstrong said. \u201cCorey was a street smart debater,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cby the time he was a senior he was ranking with some of the best in the state.\u201dHe came from a family of Democrats. His father was a longshoreman who couldn\u2019t vote because of a felony conviction, Mr. Stewart said, adding it was \u201cprobably manslaughter\u201d stemming from a fatal car accident. The younger Mr. Stewart was the first in his family to graduate from college, initially attending St. Olaf College in Minnesota, then transferring to Georgetown.\u201cI wanted more,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing wrong with it, but I just wanted to see more.\u201dHe eventually became an international trade lawyer and moved to Virginia, working at Foley & Lardner, a prominent firm. In 2006 he was elected chairman of the Prince William County Board, a county outside Washington, D.C., that has become majority minority in recent years.In his politics, Mr. Stewart embraced expediency over ideology. He was initially anti-development, riding concerns about the pace of growth, then later allied with developers. Amid the county\u2019s shifting demographics \u2014 its Hispanic population tripled rapidly \u2014 he picked up on immigration as a hot button. \u201cI changed my focus to address what people were telling me their concerns were,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get elected.\u201dMany found the ease with which Mr. Stewart adopted hard-line views unsettling, starting with colleagues at work.\u201cSome of the partners at the firm didn\u2019t like that very much,\u201d Mr. Stewart said of his immigration stance, adding, \u201cit became uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got this guy who is a transplant coming into Virginia trying to out-Southern folks who\u2019ve been here for 400 years,\u201d said Brian Schoeneman, a Fairfax Republican and former legislative candidate.\u201cThe monuments weren\u2019t contentious until the left started taking them down,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, adding that \u201cthankfully those efforts seem to have subsided.\u201dHe claimed that \u201cthe ones who were most vehement in terms of taking down the monuments were not African-Americans. They were white liberals.\u201dBut Kevin Chandler, president of the state\u2019s N.A.A.C.P., called Mr. Stewart \u201ctreasonous\u201d for his embrace of the Confederate flag.\u201cIt symbolizes hate. It symbolizes white supremacy,\u201d the Rev. Chandler said. \u201cAnd something such as that should not be displayed openly in the public.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a coincidence that this happened in my neighborhood,\u201d said Maggie Hansford, a local teacher who has decided to run for a board seat. \u201cOur chairman can\u2019t stop talking about the Confederate flag.\u201dMr. Stewart later issued a statement condemning the Klan.A \u201cCorey Stewart for Senate\u201d sign flanks the gravel driveway leading to George and Donna Randall\u2019s southern Virginia home.An avowed secessionist, Mr. Randall is eager to explain himself, welcoming a visitor onto his porch.\u201cI\u2019m a secessionist because the federal government is anti-Christian and we\u2019re different culturally,\u201d explained Mr. Randall, a retired heavy equipment operator whose forebears include Confederate veterans. \u201cThe government never surrendered, only the Army. We\u2019re still under Reconstruction.\u201dInterviews with Mr. Randall and his twin brother Gregory helped explain Mr. Stewart\u2019s appeal to his die-hard supporters.\u201cI liked Corey because he\u2019s a Trump supporter,\u201d said Gregory Randall, who plays Stonewall Jackson in Civil War re-enactments, in an interview at his home in Fredericksburg. \u201cHe\u2019s for low taxes, he\u2019s a big second amendment rights guy, he\u2019s against MS-13 and all these illegal people coming here that are committing crimes.\u201dGeorge Randall and his wife Donna have helped organize \u201cmeet and greets\u201d for Mr. Stewart.

An attempt to reach him at his Woodbridge, Va., apartment resulted in a police complaint that a reporter for The New York Times entered his dwelling unlawfully, an allegation The Times has denied.Mr. Stewart brushed off questions about the company he keeps, and returned repeatedly in the interview to his love of his adopted state\u2019s heritage, and his admiration for the president.\u201cAll these attacks, on all this Kessler stuff and everything else like that, most people are just, they don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are so used to the left calling Trump and other conservatives as racists and bigots.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to back down from my controversial positions,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I were to do that my base would be gone.

Supported byMr. Arteaga is a self-taught violinist and a Venezuelan dissident.I was raised in Valencia, Venezuela, by a poor, evangelical Christian family. I loved slipping away to a local internet cafe where I learned about music. The owner told me that if I helped him with the business, he\u2019d pay me. I used the money I earned to buy a cheap violin. I had only enough cash for half: The kind owner told me I could pay the rest later.My family didn\u2019t approve. They forbade me to play, forcing me to dedicate myself to the church and our faith. So at 15 years old, I fled home and began to practice on the streets. From then on, my music school has always been outside. I played my way through my country\u2019s collapse \u2014 on street corners and at rallies protesting the government. I played for pickpockets as they robbed people, so I would not be robbed or killed myself. And I played during the 2017 protests, where the national guard shot at me with rubber bullets, threw tear gas at me and destroyed my violin.That year, the government threw me in jail and tortured me. What got me through that month behind bars was the belief that I would play once again.And I did. But now I play here, in the United States, where I can play in freedom.At first, everything about New York City scared me. When I got here, for example, I assumed the Bronx was much less safe than Caracas, because I had heard it was a dangerous area. But in the Bronx I found I could walk the streets safely before the sun came up. That is nothing like Caracas, where you can\u2019t go out with brand-name clothes or smartphones without the risk of being mugged. Everything here is safer.Still, I was intimidated \u2014 scared of being insignificant in a city of so much talent and so many cultures. But I\u2019ve overcome my reluctance thanks to my violin, other musicians and the subway.When I\u2019m done playing I buy something to eat with the tips I receive. These tips are how I support myself, and people back home. When I play even for a short time I make good money because New Yorkers are so generous. Two or three times, people have approached me with a $100 bill and offered words of encouragement. Many people give me $2 bills. I\u2019ve learned they are for good luck \u2014 something I feel I\u2019ve now found. The next day I bought an amplifier and began to play without fear, because I understood that here I could play with my eyes closed without worrying about the police harassing or attacking me. I got to know other musicians, and now sometimes five or six of us play together, like at a big concert. I love how open New Yorkers are \u2014 they never hesitate to show you if they like the music.Wuilly Arteaga is a self-taught violinist and a Venezuelan dissident.Advertisement"}

Late last week, Twitter began softening its tone, especially after CNN and others found more than half a dozen tweets from Mr. Jones that clearly violated the company\u2019s policies. Twitter said it ordered Mr. Jones to take those tweets down.Even so, Twitter\u2019s actions stop short of a full ban of Mr. Jones and his publication from Twitter and leaves many questions unanswered about what actually gets people or organizations booted off the service. The company\u2019s policy calls for the short-term suspension of an account after repeated violations, but Twitter declined to clarify how many offenses would terminate Mr. Jones\u2019s account permanently.The suspension began after Mr. Jones tweeted or retweeted more than a dozen times during the day on Tuesday, including one post that linked to a live video session in which he apparently called for violence against certain groups, including the media. After a user flagged the tweet, Twitter said it determined the post violated its safety rules. Mr. Jones was ordered to take down the tweet linking to the video broadcast on Periscope, the live-streaming service that is owned by Twitter.A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday beyond confirming that Mr. Jones\u2019s new tweet broke its rules and that he was frozen out of using the service for a week.Then on Wednesday, the Infowars account posted the same offending video \u2014 and soon got the same timeout.

The hackers set up a fake page that mimicked the party\u2019s login page for its voter-registration website, a tactic that could gather names, passwords and other credentials of those using the voter database. The hackers also may have sent emails to people within the national committee to try to trick them into using the fake page, a tactic known as \u201cspearphishing,\u201d the officials said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, one of the officials said.\u201cThis attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections, and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks,\u201d said Bob Lord, chief security officer for the Democratic National Committee. He called the voter file \u201cthe party\u2019s most sensitive information.\u201dThe combination of this attack on the committee, continued influence operations by Russia and others using social media, and efforts to breach think tanks underscores that the cyber age has changed elections forever. So many systems are vulnerable to manipulation, from the voter-registration systems in the 50 states to the inner workings of the parties, that the opportunities for foreign and domestic manipulation are many.\u201cThe focus has gone from using the cyber realm to steal secrets to using it to impose national power,\u201d Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator until the position was eliminated a few months ago, said this month at Defcon, an annual convention that focuses on hacking and defenses against it.On Sunday, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the November elections.\u201cI can say definitively that it\u2019s a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we\u2019re taking steps to try and prevent it,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in an interview with ABC.Many of the hacking attempts are mimicking the techniques that were used to penetrate the Democratic National Committee in 2016. At the time, Russian state-backed hackers used trick emails to take senior party officials, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, to a page that looked identical to a password screen for Google\u2019s email service, Gmail. In fact, the page gave attackers access to the officials\u2019 accounts.Many of the warnings the national committee received several years ago about potential attacks either were ignored or did not reach the right individuals.Since then, the committee has taken steps to improve its cybersecurity. This year, it hired Mr. Lord, who previously held top technology roles at Yahoo and Twitter, and Raffi Krikorian, a former Uber executive, as its chief technology officer.The party\u2019s team has put new security practices into place and begun testing employees in spearphishing drills to see if they will click on the malicious emails. The national committee has also improved its cooperation with the F.B.I., according to law enforcement officials.The Votebuilder database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and files. A successful penetration of the database could have set off other hacks in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.Lookout first detected the fake website late Monday, using a newly built artificial intelligence system that spots fake sites as they are created, said Mike Murray, the company\u2019s vice president of security intelligence.\u201cWe realized the significance,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin hours, we started waking up people to get them on the phone.\u201dBecause the website was caught so quickly, it is impossible to know who the hackers were or how they planned to use the site, Mr. Murray said. Such attacks are easy, he said, because anyone with decent programming skills can make a fake website in a few hours.\u201cThe adversaries are becoming more sophisticated in how they use these websites, but the attack is the same,\u201d he said.Mr. Lord said the White House also needed to get involved to improve cyberdefenses.\u201cThese threats are serious, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that we all work together, but we can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the administration to take more aggressive steps to protect our voting systems.\u201dThe attempted hack was revealed as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cybersecurity division hailed its efforts to protect the nation\u2019s election systems from foreign intrusions.During a tour of the agency\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center near Washington on Wednesday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Christopher C. Krebs, her top deputy for cybersecurity, said the department was more prepared than it had been during the 2016 elections.\u201cWe are better positioned than at any time in history,\u201d Ms. Nielsen said, standing before a bank of computers and giant monitors showing real-time threats to the nation\u2019s cyber and physical infrastructure.An earlier version of this article misstated what cybersecurity officials said about hackers\u2019 efforts to gain access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s voter database. The officials said the hackers may have sent so-called spearphishing emails to D.N.C. officials, not that they did send such emails.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

{"Headline": "Red Flags for Immigrant Recruits: Calling Parents, Not Laughing at Jokes", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne Army recruit was flagged because he sent his parents in India money to move into a modern apartment. Another was faulted for calling his mother in Myanmar every week and for playing video games with noncitizens. And one was labeled a major security risk after an interviewer conducting a counterintelligence screening told a joke and the recruit didn\u2019t laugh.\u201cAbsolutely no reaction,\u201d the interviewer noted in a declassified report. \u201cLack of interpersonal communication and interaction skills.\u201dAll three enlisted in the military under a special program known as Mavni that promises immigrants with valuable language and medical skills a fast track to citizenship. And all three were labeled security threats by a Defense Department vetting system that has become increasingly strict since 2016.In recent months the Army has abruptly discharged scores of otherwise qualified immigrant recruits because of their foreign ties, some of them on grounds that seem trivial or erroneous. And scores more are in limbo over the issue.The military maintains that its strict vetting, which has led to lengthy backlogs and delays and has snagged the enlistment of at least one-third of current Mavni recruits, is necessary to weed out immigrants who might harm national security.But many of the immigrant recruits who have been flagged as security risks did not have any ties to terrorist groups or foreign intelligence agencies turn up in their background checks. Instead, declassified reports obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the recruits show that they were being faulted for routine phone calls to overseas relatives or mundane financial connections with their birth countries. The reports also appeared to be rife with errors, sometimes including the recruit\u2019s country of origin.Maj. Carla Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said the military had no plans to change its screening policy.\u201cAll recruits, including Mavni recruits, must meet the high standards and qualifications for military service,\u201d Major Gleason said in a statement. \u201cIf a background investigation reveals information that disqualifies a particular Mavni recruit from military service, then that recruit, like any other recruit with a similar disqualification, is either released from his or her enlistment contract or is separated from his or her respective service.\u201dBut recruits who are American citizens are generally not screened nearly as intensively as Mavni recruits are. And when an immigrant recruit spots mistakes in a security report, there is no official channel for correcting them.\u201cI didn\u2019t even recognize what I was reading,\u201d said Suraj Adhikari, a recruit from Nepal who is serving in the Army Reserves and recently obtained the results of his counterintelligence assessment. It labeled him a \u201cpotential risk.\u201dMr. Adhikari, the son of a sanitation worker and a schoolteacher, came to the United States on a student visa to study for a master\u2019s degree in agricultural science. He is now working on a second degree in data analytics. He enlisted in the Army in 2016, attracted by the promise of American citizenship, and drills regularly with his reserve unit in Omaha, where he is a supply chain specialist.\u201cIt makes me very proud,\u201d he said.His counterintelligence report said he was a security risk because the Nepali government had paid for his undergraduate education and may have influence over him. But he said he had paid his own way through college.\u201cIt\u2019s completely baseless,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even understand where they got that information.\u201d\u201cThey were under the gun to get it done quickly,\u201d Ms. Stock said of the interviewers. \u201cThe management was shoddy, the training was poor. They made a lot of mistakes that have ruined people\u2019s lives.\u201dOne of her clients is a 30-year-old research assistant from China who is working toward a doctorate in physics. The student\u2019s recruiter wrote in a letter that he was \u201cone of the best future soldiers in our station.\u201d But a counterintelligence report on the student concluded that he was a major security risk.The interviewer noted that the student had never worked for a foreign government, had never been arrested and had never used illegal drugs. But the unnamed interviewer, who acknowledged in the report that he or she was \u201cnot a medical professional,\u201d nonetheless concluded from the student\u2019s failure to laugh at a joke that he probably had autism.Ms. Stock brushed that conclusion aside. \u201cHe\u2019s not mentally ill, he\u2019s just shy,\u201d she said of her client. \u201cAnd it was a bad joke. The fact they put that in a report just shows the ham-handed process they use.\u201dThe report also raised concerns about the student\u2019s father, who worked for the Chinese Army from 1978 to 1999. Ms. Stock said the father\u2019s job had been to teach soldiers math.Ms. Stock pointed to reports on other clients that she said were rife with errors and misinterpretations. One recruit from India was labeled a moderate risk on the grounds that his brother worked for the country\u2019s prime minister; in fact, the brother is a clerk who processes pensions for railway workers.The security concerns in the reports sometimes seem contradictory. One recruit from Turkey was labeled a major risk because his family was wealthy, with $700,000 in assets overseas, while another was seen as a risk because he had no assets, and therefore \u201ca foreign entity could exploit, induce, manipulate or coerce him if he becomes too financially impaired.\u201d\u201cWhatever you do or say, it will be used against you, it seems,\u201d said Mr. Zhao, a Chinese graduate student and competitive swimmer who enlisted through the program as a combat medic. He spoke on the condition that his given name not be published, saying he feared retribution.His report labeled him a major risk because he has two parents in China, and thus \u201ccould be subject to influences through favors and advantageous promotions given to his family in his home country.\u201d\u201cI feel surprised and indignant they would use these bad words against me,\u201d Mr. Zhao said.Judging by the Army\u2019s experience with thousands of Mavni recruits, the security risk posed by immigrants is generally quite low, according to Naomi Verdugo, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who oversaw recruiting for more than a decade.\u201cWe don\u2019t see evidence the immigrants we are bringing in are less trustworthy; in fact, they are a higher quality than our average American recruits,\u201d Ms. Verdugo said. \u201cThey are better educated, better behaved. Surveys we did, the commanders always liked them. But some of the people I worked with have a strong anti-immigrant bias. They feel immigrants introduce risk we cannot mitigate, so it is not worth having them in the service.\u201dIn a closed Facebook group for Mavni recruits, immigrants traded stories this week about their counterintelligence reports. One man from Myanmar said he was flagged because he \u201cmaintains weekly contact\u201d with his parents back home.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he posted. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t talk to their parents?

{"Headline": "Giving Others a Voice in Congress, One Hand-Delivered Letter at a Time", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Debbie Matties felt helpless.The next day she attended the Women\u2019s March, and reflected on her past work volunteering on Democratic campaigns. But Ms. Matties, a Washington resident with little say in Congress, felt left out of the democratic process.So she joined a Facebook group of other disillusioned liberals with an eye toward constituency advocacy \u2014 if their voices could not be heard, at least they could amplify others across the country.\u201cWe started contacting friends and family who don\u2019t live in the District of Columbia saying: \u2018Hey, I live really close to the Capitol. Send me a letter by email and I\u2019ll print it at my house and bring it up myself because I just feel so frustrated and I don\u2019t know what to do with myself,\u2019\u201d Ms. Matties said.\u201cIt can\u2019t be more grass roots,\u201d said Ms. Matties, now the president of the coalition.On a recent Thursday afternoon, a little over a dozen Herd on the Hill volunteers made up of retired teachers, young professionals and families with small children gathered at the Hart Senate Office Building to prepare their door-to-door strategy for delivering about 110 letters throughout Capitol Hill\u2019s sprawling system of offices. Chatter before the afternoon\u2019s mission was pleasant \u2014 more book club than resistance group.\u201cHalf the struggle is just figuring out the buildings,\u201d said Erin Irby, a volunteer who works at a nearby coffee shop.Ms. Matties and the group\u2019s operations director, Karen Williams, went through a game plan: Have an elevator pitch ready for the interns helming the front offices. Make sure to get a photo outside the office near the lawmakers\u2019 wall plaque to post on social media. Since most of the letters were about migrant family separations and Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, try to ask for the business card of the legislative aide in charge of those topics.\u201cWhat if the office is closed?\u201d one volunteer asked. \u201cYou mean Rand Paul?\u201d Ms. Matties quipped back about the Republican senator from Kentucky, whose office is locked and accessible only by calling the front desk.But are the group\u2019s old-school methods effective? Not always, according to Brad Fitch, the president of the nonpartisan Congressional Management Foundation, a nonprofit that helps lawmakers and their aides operate more effectively. He said that electronic messages allow offices to most easily tally up where voters stand on specific issues for weekly reports.Still, Mr. Fitch said the foundation\u2019s surveys show that both constituents and office staffs are generally unhappy about email as the dominant form of communication, given its impersonal and often one-sided nature. And many messages from constituents, no matter the format, are unlikely to change their representatives\u2019 minds, he said.\u201cYou could get a million messages into John McCain\u2019s office regarding issues of war and peace,\u201d Mr. Fitch said. \u201cGood luck with that. He\u2019s got some pretty firm positions.\u201dBut \u201cniche issues are 95 percent\u201d of what members of Congress handle, Mr. Fitch said, and in those instances, a unique, hand-delivered note could lead to a moving story being told on the Senate floor that propels substantive change.And on even bigger political debates, Ms. Matties said that personal stories have the power to sway legislators, a belief that drives the volunteers.\u201cThe health care bill, the tax bill, the immigration issue,\u201d Ms. Matties said. \u201cThere are personal stories there that can make an impact in ways that are different from other issues.\u201d\u201cI mean, the Russia investigation is obviously important for our country,\u201d she added, \u201cbut there aren\u2019t many Americans who have a personal story to tell about the investigation.\u201dThe stories delivered present a physical manifestation, sometimes stacks high, of frustration or hope that seems to resonate with full-time staff members on Capitol Hill.\u201cThis is how we get the pulse of our constituents and learn the things we need to fight the hardest on,\u201d Alex Perez, a staff assistant to Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said after the volunteers dropped off a couple of letters, adding that he sees them sometimes as many as three times a week.And although Herd on the Hill leans left, some Republican offices, which can receive the most feedback on particularly charged issues as the party in power, also understand the benefit of the hand-delivered letters.It\u2019s a \u201cgood gauge\u201d of where voters stand \u201cwhenever they\u2019re not calling in and sending through Herd on the Hill,\u201d Jasmine Moody, a staff assistant at the office of Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said with letters in hand.Since Herd on the Hill started, there have been a few hiccups along the way. Ms. Matties said some office staff members have been reluctant to accept the at-times cumbersome bundles of hand-delivered letters for their weekly reports. Others have been flat-out rude, Ms. Matties said, considering the deliveries an intrusion.\u201cThere were some days where our printer couldn\u2019t handle the volume,\u201d Ms. Matties said. \u201cAt the time I was so upset, saying, \u2018We need to send these letters!\u2019 But everyone kept saying, \u2018This is a great problem to have.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The three boys and their coach are members of the Shan minority, local news media reports said.\u201cBasically, they are not considered as Thai,\u201d she said.The Wild Boars play in the northern town of Mae Sai. That is near a region at the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos known as the Golden Triangle. The area is a sanctuary for members of ethnic militias that have long pushed for autonomy from the Myanmar government, and a haven for opium farmers and methamphetamine traffickers.Twenty-eight children and two adults, including Mr. Ekkapol, were awarded citizenship by the local authorities on Wednesday. The three young Wild Boars were Mongkol Boonpiam, 13, Adul Sam-on, 14, and Pornchai Khamluang, 16.\u201cWe are very, very happy,\u201d Inn Khamluang, the father of the 16-year-old, said Thursday in a brief telephone interview.

But its subject was far from ordinary: Arthur Ashe, the world-class tennis player, the day after he became the first black man to win a singles title at the United States Open. In contrast to a mainstream press that quickly transformed Mr. Ashe into an African-American icon and exemplar of racial progress, Mr. Zimmerman represented the athlete as he lived, a complex and self-possessed man in the midst of a life-altering event. In time for the 50th anniversary of that historic victory, the photographs he took of that event are now the subject of a new book, \u201cCrossing the Line: Arthur Ashe at the 1968 U.S. Open\u201d (Hannibal). Mr. Zimmerman, by then a renowned sports photographer, had witnessed firsthand the nuances of race and prejudice in America. From 1952 to 1955, on assignment for Ebony, then the nation\u2019s most popular African-American magazine, he documented the lives of black people in the Midwest and the Jim Crow South. While these pictures sometimes documented social problems, like most civil rights photography of the period, they also celebrated the richness and breadth of African-American life. Despite the recent passage of the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act and other reforms, the United States in 1968 remained fraught with prejudice \u2014 from the slowly dying culture of segregation in the South to more subtle, but no less harmful, forms of racism in the North and beyond. White Americans, while marginally more comfortable with racial icons, typically reserved their respect for figures who were exemplary but unthreatening: Virtuous Americans, neither radical nor outspoken, who confirmed the possibility for success and served as a reminder that oppression could be overcome with hard work and the right attitude. With his historic victory at the U.S. Open, Mr. Ashe was quickly enlisted as a benign symbol of racial acceptance. Life magazine\u2019s cover story about his victory, for example, epitomized this approach. The cover photograph represented Mr. Ashe mid-game, racket in hand, his face expressing fierce concentration. While the associated article briefly mentioned the racism he experienced \u2014 he was sometimes mistaken for a waiter or busboy while playing at tournaments, for example \u2014 it also tempered the social consciousness emerging in him. Although Life acknowledged Mr. Ashe\u2019s nascent activism, such as his interest in working as a volunteer for the National Urban League, it strove to make it as palatable as possible to the magazine\u2019s predominantly white middle-class audience. \u201cWhat I like best about myself is my demeanor,\u201d read a pull quote from Mr. Ashe, reassurance that he was neither militant nor unreasonable. \u201cFor me, black is beautiful, but white can be beautiful, too,\u201d he was quoted as saying, further comforting white readers. Life transformed Mr. Ashe into a paradigm of emotional and physical reserve: \u201cDetachment \u2014 the air of icy elegance \u2014 is part of Mr. Ashe\u2019s image now. It is an extra piece of identification that will enhance his celebrity,\u201d it observed, the words \u201cicy elegance\u201d repeated on the magazine\u2019s cover. The accompanying photographs, including several by Mr. Zimmerman, were all tennis related, largely focused on the athlete\u2019s cool sportsmanship. As Eric Allen Hall noted in his book, \u201cArthur Ashe: Tennis and Justice in the Civil Rights Era,\u201d the tennis player fully understood the important position he held after the U.S. Open. For African-Americans, as exemplified by his coverage in the black press, he was a role model who was also committed to advocating for racial equality and justice. For whites, he served as a nonthreatening symbol of racial progress \u2014 a benevolent sports hero ripe for corporate sponsorships and product endorsements. Mr. Ashe also understood that his extraordinary achievement, and its attendant celebrity, provided him with a platform for advancing his political beliefs. A few days after the U.S. Open, he became the first athlete to appear on CBS\u2019s public affairs program, \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Despite his momentous victory, he spoke as an activist, weighing in on subjects as diverse as civil rights legislation, the Black Power movement and the role of the African-American athlete in the civil rights struggle. Mr. Ashe\u2019s appearance was initially applauded by many. But as his activism intensified and his international tennis ranking declined, he was assailed by some in the mainstream media for squandering his formidable athletic talent on politics. In the end, the nation found in Arthur Ashe its latest racial hero. But Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s subway photograph presented a characteristically nuanced view of his historic feat, one commensurate with Mr. Ashe\u2019s own belief that true heroism was \u201cremarkably sober, very undramatic.\u201d Avoiding the limited representation of his subject as a consummate athlete or racial symbol, Mr. Zimmerman\u2019s photograph revealed a dimension of his life downplayed by a media intent on lionizing him: his humanity. In an environment of rampant segregation and prejudice \u2014 when African-American men and women were still reduced to dehumanizing stereotypes, caricatures, or, in more liberal quarters, magical or mythic beings \u2014 this humble image not only brought its subject down to earth, it also underscored that he was one of us. In an era when racial and ethnic differences fueled unspeakable hate and discrimination, this was nothing less than revolutionary. This column is an excerpt from the author\u2019s essay in \u201cCrossing the Line: Arthur Ashe at the 1968 U.S. Open.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

This conversation, Maureen said, occurred on his private plane filled with junk food.And he hasn\u2019t changed much in the White House. He even calls it \u201cthe set,\u201d she said, as if it\u2019s just for him and just for television.\u201cHe\u2019s thinking of this as a reality show and he will get those ratings,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cHe\u2019s an attention addict.\u201d\u2018We\u2019re the Selfie Stick\u2019What about the role of the media covering President Trump?When asked about this last night, she acknowledged that the media and the president are caught in an intense symbiotic relationship.

France, its chief executive and chairman, was pulled over in Sag Harbor, N.Y., Sunday night.France, 56, quickly announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence. His uncle, Jim France, will take over his responsibilities in the interim.Nascar has a substance abuse policy that applies to the \u201cmisuse\u201d of alcohol and prescription drugs. It is unclear if this policy applies to executives, or whether the family-controlled sport will penalize its chief executive.During a radio interview after the report, France said, \u201cRumors are always interesting, but they\u2019re seldom right. The France family is locked and loaded in its dedication to Nascar.\u201dHe did not deny the existence of exploratory discussions, however.Selling a stake in Nascar would be complicated. The France family doesn\u2019t disclose the exact ownership stake of each family member.According to a number of sports, business and media executives consulted for this article, none of whom would agree to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of Brian France\u2019s arrest, buying Nascar would not make a lot of sense for a private equity firm, in part because there are no easy solutions to Nascar\u2019s problems.A buyer looking to boost its value and sell in a few years \u2014 the usual playbook for private equity \u2014 would have difficulty. The next owner of Nascar will have to play the long game of developing the next generation of fans.Nascar\u2019s television ratings have followed the same trend, and are down by about half since 2005. The rating for the sport\u2019s marquee race, the Daytona 500, continues to fall. The age of the average Nascar viewer is 58, and the fan base is skewing older faster than that of any other sport.These difficulties aren\u2019t unique to Nascar. Every sport is challenged by younger fans who aren\u2019t inclined to spend hours in a stadium or in front of their TVs. Ratings across television have been falling for a decade. Sports is not immune. College football and baseball have suffered large attendance drops, and the N.F.L.\u2019s television ratings are down 19 percent in just the last two years.But a potential buyer of Nascar would receive only its rule book and media rights, not tracks or teams. International Speedway Corp., known as I.S.C., owns 13 tracks and the Motor Racing Network. It is a publicly traded company. The France family owns a controlling stake, but it is separate from the Nascar stake. Experts say a potential buyer for Nascar would likely want to buy control of I.S.C. as well.Even that would not guarantee success. For years stock car racing has struggled to develop star drivers as fan favorites like Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon and especially Dale Earnhardt Jr. retired.Sunday night in Watkins Glen, N.Y. an heir might have emerged. Chase Elliott, the 22-year-old son of Nascar Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, won a Cup Series race for the first time.A few hours after Elliott\u2019s win, France \u2014 who did not attend the race \u2014 was being pulled over on the other side of the state by the police.Nascar does has a number of positive attributes, according to financial analysts. It may be a family business, but the organization has professional marketing and sales teams that are widely respected.Its media rights also retain value. Besides the main Nascar Cup Series, Nascar has other lower-tier racing series, such as the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series, providing hundreds of hours of content. Its schedule also runs in the summer, when there is a dearth of competitive sports.Now it just has to find its way out of this difficult summer.Advertisement"}

The Department of Education recently provided this new data on over 5,000 schools across the country in response to my Freedom of Information Act request.The new data makes clear that the federal government overlooks early warning signs by focusing solely on default rates over the first three years of repayment. That\u2019s the time period Congress requires the Department of Education to use when calculating default rates.At that time, about one-quarter of the cohort \u2014 or nearly 1.3 million borrowers \u2014 were not in default, but were either severely delinquent or not paying their loans. Two years later, many of these borrowers were either still not paying or had defaulted. Nearly 280,000 borrowers defaulted between years three and five.Federal laws attempting to keep schools accountable are not doing enough to stop loan problems. The law requires that all colleges participating in the student loan program keep their share of borrowers who default below 30 percent for three consecutive years or 40 percent in any single year. We can consider anything above 30 percent to be a \u201chigh\u201d default rate. That\u2019s a low bar.Among the group who started repaying in 2012, just 93 of their colleges had high default rates after three years and 15 were at immediate risk of losing access to aid.

{"Headline": "Breaking Norms Will Renew Democracy, Not Ruin It ", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of President Trump\u2019s alleged transgressions offend against the etiquette of modern liberal governance, not the Constitution. Mr. Kesler is a senior fellow of the Claremont Institute and a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.Hardly a day goes by without President Trump being accused of breaking a presidential norm or two, doing something that no president has ever done \u2014 nor, it\u2019s implied, ever ought to do. He tweets. He runs down the F.B.I., the intelligence community, his own attorney general. He makes fun of other politicians. He hires and fires cabinet secretaries, lawyers and communications people with abandon. He revokes a former C.I.A. director\u2019s security clearance. He fails to disclose his tax returns. He picks his Supreme Court nominees from a list prepared by outside groups. He alternately threatens and sweet talks foreign despots. Guilty as charged \u2014 but so what? All norms are not created equal. Hence breaking norms is neither good nor bad except as the norms themselves are good or bad. We elect presidents partly to separate the wheat from the chaff: to energize government by shedding or retiring norms that no longer serve the public good, and by adopting fresh ones that do. Once in office, however, these politicians had to figure out how to conduct themselves in their new roles. The Constitution left it largely up to them, by a combination of written laws and unwritten customs and habits, to develop the culture of constitutionalism that it needed to endure and to fulfill its promise of good government. The resulting formal and informal norms helped both to grease the wheels of government and to legitimate them over time. Larger political currents have amplified and complicated their efforts. In the early 19th century the country was well on the way to a quasi-parliamentary political system in which Congress dominated the executive, even arrogating to congressional caucuses the right to nominate presidential candidates. Andrew Jackson\u2019s election in 1828 shattered those arrangements and helped to create the national party system with its nominating conventions still familiar to us. He broke many prevailing norms and instituted new ones that helped to secure the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers and to preserve the executive branch\u2019s equality.And that, surely, is the larger question. Presidents are often called upon to adjust norms; it\u2019s almost part of the job. The crucial question is how the norms in question stand in relation to the Constitution and the common good. Are the norms President Trump is accused of breaking vital to American democracy and constitutionalism, or are they vital rather to the way government operates in contemporary Washington, which, like the way government was operating in the 1820s, may have surprisingly little to do with either democracy or the Constitution?Disturbing our NATO allies\u2019 slumber seems more like due diligence than recklessness. Mr. Trump\u2019s manner of treating members of his own administration is often regrettable, but then for his entire term so far he has been entangled in a pitched battle with elements of the executive branch nominally under his own authority \u2014 a frustration no previous president has had to face. Must he, in addition, acquiesce in the permanent security clearances of the previous administration\u2019s spymasters, when they seek to wield these as licenses to kill his foreign policy and his whole presidency? Hard to imagine Jackson or F.D.R. sitting still for that.Besides, future presidents will be free to ignore or repudiate Mr. Trump\u2019s views and his blunt manner of doing business. This occupant of the White House seems to enjoy breaking norms, and he has been conspicuously more successful at breaking them than at devising and blessing new ones for our troubled times. But if he is to make America great again, President Trump will have to cherish his legacy as a norm-builder, too.Charles R.

Even asking if he has a significant other seems too much a risk.The title of \u201cThe Piranhas\u201d in Italian \u2014 \u201cLa Paranza Dei Bambini,\u201d or \u201cThe Fishing Trawler of Children\u201d \u2014 is arguably more evocative, suggesting the tiny fish who are attracted to a bright light by nighttime nets meant for bigger fish. It is the first of two novels; the second, \u201cFierce Kiss,\u201d is scheduled for translation into English in 2020.Both tell the story of a gang led, in the novel, by a clever but coldhearted high school student, Nicolas Fiorillo. He is charismatic and quotes Machiavelli like a knife. He believes that the old gangsters who controlled drug running in central Naples have become weak and decides to take over the business. This is no \u201cbaby gang,\u201d but a real enterprise of young criminals who did not come up through the Camorra, Naples\u2019s dominant crime group. Instead, they are like hundreds of thousands of young unemployed Italians who see little hope in following their parents\u2019 career paths.\u201cThey despise their parents,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they can\u2019t pay the mortgage\u201d and have accumulated too much debt.What sets them apart is their use of social media: While silence was the code for old-school mobsters, these younger ones are endlessly texting each other, posting their exploits on Facebook, chronicling their lives and aspirations electronically. Phones are as important as weapons.\u201cThe new generation understands that if you aren\u2019t on social media you don\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Saviano said. \u201cThey are like Camorra 2.0.\u201dThe true story behind this novel is compelling, and it\u2019s not hard to see why Mr. Saviano chose it for his novelistic debut. The Nicholas character is loosely based on Emanuele Sibillo, who was 19 when he was gunned down in 2015. A bit tubby, he wore dorky glasses and sported a beard that strove unsuccessfully to evoke the Islamic State. But he did not look much like a clan leader; more like a Berkeley Futurist. As with his other books, Mr. Saviano conducted extensive research: He interviewed the young survivors, families of the dead, lawyers and judges. He used wiretaps for some of the dialogue.Mr. Saviano said that Mr. Sibillo has transformed into \u201ca myth,\u201d with a cult following among many young people and tribute pages and videos viewed widely on the web. \u201cHe risked his life for what he wanted.\u201dMr. Saviano\u2019s phone buzzed as we talked. It did often. How much of his shadowed life is spent on that iPhone?\u201cSixty percent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. This is something else I share with them.\u201dMaybe because he spends so much time alone, Mr. Saviano seems remarkably self-aware. And he\u2019s come to see, as he suggested with his phone use, that he\u2019s not so different from the people he writes about. They shared the same narrow streets; Mount Vesuvius, hazy in the distance; one of the world\u2019s most beautiful bays. Both Mr. Saviano and his subjects are rich, thanks to their common interest in violence.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I am hated so much by the Camorra,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they think we are similar. We have the same concept of not being afraid to die, of having great ambitions.\u201d\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to die, but I hate the Camorra more than anything because they ruined my country,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t deny I have a feeling of vengeance against them.\u201d Vengeance, another shared trait.But it is not just the Camorra. As he has spoken out against the new government, corruption, deals between politicians and the mob, and in favor of migrants, he has become ever more polarizing. He has accused Mr. Salvini, the deputy prime minister, of inching the nation back to authoritarianism, a growing worry around Europe.With all the guards, Mr. Saviano is not easy to get near. But on the square where the S.U.V. has stopped \u2014 the spot where the young gang once shot randomly, killing a boy now memorialized there \u2014 some fans have managed to get close enough to take a selfie with Mr. Saviano. An older, local woman, Raffaela Ippolito, has cut through the crowd.\u201cCan I greet you?\u201d she asks cheerily, extending her hand to Mr. Saviano. \u201cCompliments for everything you have done. You are great. But say something nice about Naples.\u201dOutside Mr. Saviano\u2019s ever-vigilant vise of protectors, Ms. Ippolito has more to say. \u201cPart of what he writes is true,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s only the bad side of Naples. There are so many good things. But it\u2019s his job.\u201d\u201cFierce Kiss,\u201d the novel after \u201cThe Piranhas,\u201d is already selling briskly in Italy and will not prove her wrong.\u201cThe ending is not a happy one,\u201d Mr. Saviano said, \u201cas you can imagine.\u201dIan Fisher is a former New York Times reporter and editor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Trolls Have Won. Sorry, There\u2019s Not Much You Can Do.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bytech fixWhen it comes to online comments and discourse and what you can do to limit their toxicity, you only have a certain amount of power. The real leverage lies with the tech companies. This column is going to be a bit unusual. Typically, I write about a broad tech problem and offer some solutions. But this week, I\u2019ve stumbled into a topic that many agree has no easy fix: online comments.What does that show us? That you as an internet user have little power over content you find offensive or harmful online. It\u2019s the tech companies that hold the cards.Given the way things are going, our faith in the internet may erode until we distrust it as much as we do TV news, said Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches social media courses. Why are internet comments so hopelessly bad, and how do we protect ourselves? Even though there is no simple fix, there are some measures we can aim to take. Here\u2019s what you need to know about how we got here and what you can try.There are many theories about why the internet seems to bring out the worst in people. I gathered a sampling of some noteworthy findings.Ms. Papacharissi said that in her 20 years of researching and interviewing people about online behavior, one conclusion has remained consistent: people use the internet to get more of what they do not get enough of in everyday life. So while people have been socialized to resist being impulsive in the real world, on the internet they cave to their temptations to lash out.\u201cThe internet becomes an easy outlet for us to shout something and feel for a moment fulfilled even though we\u2019re really just shouting out into the air,\u201d she said.This is nothing new, of course. Before the internet, people took their frustrations to TV and radio talk shows. The internet was simply a more accessible, less moderated space.Daniel Ha, a founder of Disqus, a popular internet comment tool used by many websites, said the quality of comments vary widely depending on the pieces of content being discussed and the audiences they attract. For example, there are videos about niche topics, like home improvement, that invite constructive commentary from enthusiasts. But there are others, such as a music video from a popular artist or a general news article, which ask people from all around the world to comment. That\u2019s when things can get especially unruly.\u201cYou have an airport of people from all walks of life coming together, and they\u2019re speaking different languages with different attitudes and they\u2019re just saying stuff,\u201d Mr. Ha said. Comments can be terrible simply because many people are flawed. It\u2019s up to the content providers and tech platforms to vet their communities and set rules and standards for civilized discussion. That is an area where many resource-strained news publications fall short: They often leave their comments sections unmoderated, so they become cesspools of toxic behavior. It is also an area where tech companies like Facebook and Twitter struggle, because they have long portrayed themselves as neutral platforms that do not that do not wish to take on the editorial roles of traditional publishers.Tech companies have long employed various methods to detect fake comments from bots and spammers. So-called Captcha tests, for Completely Automated Procedures for Telling Computers and Humans Apart, ask you to type a word or select photos of a specific item to verify you are human and not a bot. Other methods, like detecting a device type or location of a commenter, can be used to pin down bots. Yet security researchers have shown there are workarounds to all these methods. Some hackers are now getting extremely clever about their methodologies. When the Federal Communications Commission was preparing to repeal net neutrality last year, there were 22 million comments posted on its site between April 2017 and October 2017, many of which expressed support for the move. \u201cIt was like Mad Libs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read through different comments one by one, it\u2019s hard to tell that some are from the same template. But if you use these machine learning algorithms, you can pick out some of these clusters.\u201dFor the issue of spoofed comments, there is a fairly simple solution: You can report them to the site\u2019s owner, which will likely analyze and remove the fakes. Other than that, don\u2019t take web comments at face value. Mr. Kao said the lesson he learned was to always try to view comments in a wider context. Look at a commenter\u2019s history of past posts, or fact-check any dubious claims or endorsements elsewhere on the web, he said.Yet once you report an offensive comment, it is typically up to tech companies to decide whether it threatens your safety or violates a law \u2014 and often harassers know exactly how offensive they can be without clearly breaking rules. Historically, tech companies have been conservative and fickle about removing inappropriate comments, largely to maintain their positions as neutral platforms where people can freely express themselves.In the case of Infowars, Apple, Google and Facebook were the ones that banned some content from the conspiracy site after determining it violated their policies. Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said on Tuesday that the company did not suspend the accounts belonging to Infowars because its owner, Alex Jones, did not violate any rules. \u201cIf we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that\u2019s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction,\u201d he said in a tweet. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment elaborating on the decision.Beyond reporting comments individually, you could also use an online petition tool like Change.org to demand that tech companies remove offensive content. (But note that supporters of Infowars are already on that site petitioning for the site's content to be restored on YouTube.)When publishers and tech companies fail to address inappropriate comments, Ms. Papacharissi recommended an exercise in self-discipline. \u201cThink before you read,\u201d she said. \u201cThink before you speak. And you don\u2019t always have to respond. A lot of things do not deserve a response. Sometimes not responding is more effective than lashing out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Giving government workers the shaft is long-term G.O.P. policy, but even so I suspect that Congressional Republicans would have preferred that Trump not make this announcement two months before the midterm elections. The timing, as opposed to the general hostility to public servants, is probably personal to Trump.Two things in particular seem relevant here. First, Trump has always chiseled and cheated those who work for him: his business career is littered with tales of unpaid workers and contractors. Since he makes no distinction between personal business and being president, squeezing a few bucks out of the federal workforce just comes naturally.Beyond that, Trump is feeling under siege from the \u201cdeep state,\u201d which to him means any part of the government that answers to rule of law as opposed to being personally loyal to him. His wage chiseling may in part represent a way of lashing out at everyone in government: these days they all look like Robert Mueller to him. Whatever the precise motivations, this is a teachable moment, one that reveals not only another layer of Trump\u2019s personal awfulness but what Republicans really mean when they pretend to care about fiscal responsibility.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get the Most Out of College", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "OpinionThey\u2019re privileged, pivotal years. Navigate them with as much care as you did the path that got you there. Supported byOpinion ColumnistWe overwhelm teenagers with advice about choosing a college. Go big. Go small. Put prestige above cost. Do the opposite.We inundate them with tips for getting in. Spend summers this way. Write essays that way. Play a niche sport. Play an obscure instrument.So for several years \u2014 during visits to campuses, interviews with experts on higher education and interactions with recent graduates \u2014 I\u2019ve been gathering wisdom along those lines.My focus is on optimal ways to socialize, to prioritize, to pick up skills integral to any career and to open up exciting opportunities both en route to a degree and after you\u2019ve acquired it. Not nearly enough of the roughly 20 million Americans who are beginning or resuming college over the coming weeks pause, in their trepidation and exhilaration, to think about that.Many don\u2019t have the luxury: College for them is a slapdash scramble to grab credits as they can while working a demanding job, caring for family members or both. More than a third of the students enrolled in higher education in this country attend two-year institutions. Those at four-year institutions often don\u2019t participate in the romantic ideal of nurturing dormitories and verdant quadrangles. They live with parents. They pray for parking.But others do have the freedom to tailor their time. They just neglect to take advantage of it. My friend Eric Johnson, who provides guidance to underprivileged students at my alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, put it to me this way: \u201cThe more you regard college as a credentialing exercise, the less likely you are to get the benefits.\u201dJohnson is as thoughtful and insightful about higher education as just about anyone I\u2019ve come across. The wisest students, he said, \u201cmove into a peer relationship with the institution rather than a consumer relationship with it.\u201d They seize leadership roles. They serve as research assistants.Many students, nervous about a new environment, follow friends from high school or people whose demographic backgrounds match their own into homogeneous cocoons. That can indeed provide solace and support. But it\u2019s also a wasted opportunity \u2014 educationally, morally, strategically. Diversity opens you to an array and wealth of ideas, and being comfortable with it is an asset in just about any workplace or career. You can decide to establish that comfort in college.But perhaps the most important relationships to invest in are those with members of the school\u2019s faculty. Most students don\u2019t fully get that. They\u2019re not very good at identifying the professors worth knowing \u2014 the ones who aren\u2019t such academic rock stars that they\u2019re inaccessible, the ones with a track record of serious mentoring \u2014 and then getting to know them well.Reading her essay, I was reminded of an interview I did several years ago with Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, about her days at the University of Denver. She said she liked to sign up for the front end of office hours, because she wanted to catch professors when they weren\u2019t feeling depleted and watching the clock. She read up on professors beforehand and, if their written work was accessible, familiarized herself with it, so she could make mention of it. That flattered them and pegged her as a serious, considerate person.Taking that too far, of course, could be repulsively obsequious. The correct calibration is everything. And it\u2019s worth acing, because a professor or administrator who takes a genuine interest in you can be a bridge to other influential people inside and outside the school, to limited-space seminars, to special collaborations, to exclusive summer programs, to competitive internships, to graduate work and more. Damian Walker saw that at U.N.C.-Chapel Hill, from which he graduated last spring. \u201cThe most influential thing I did here was find mentors,\u201d he told me. And he found them largely by opening up to them.Walker attended U.N.C.-Chapel Hill as a Carolina Covenant scholar, which means that his family was poor enough for him to qualify for full financial aid. He told me that early on he went to an open campus discussion about police violence against minorities. Several faculty members were also there, and he approached Judith Cone, the vice chancellor for innovation, entrepreneurship and economic development.\u201cI didn\u2019t know who she was,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShort lady. I shared my story about how police shootings affected my life, my family. She gave me her business card and said, \u2018Follow up.\u2019 I still have that business card to this day.\u201d He went to see her in her office and kept going to see her in her office, and with the encouragement and help of her and other faculty members, he cobbled together the money to go to an educational conference in Massachusetts, to meet with entrepreneurs in New York City and to spend the summer between his junior and senior years interning for a company in China. He\u2019s about to head back to China to teach English for a while. He\u2019s well on his way to fluency in Mandarin, which he thinks will give him a definite edge in any future business career.\u201cWe know that exercise is very, very important,\u201d said Jan Collins-Eaglin, the associate dean for wellness at Pomona College in Southern California. \u201cIt will calm you down.\u201d She noted, too, that many schools have invested in their mental health services but that many students hesitate to use them. \u201cSeeking help is not taboo,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get over that, you are one step ahead of the game.\u201dOne crossroads that students often get needlessly worked up about is choosing a major. It\u2019s less make-or-break than you think. I hear that from a majority of thriving college graduates, and the professors I speak with strongly caution students against wedding themselves to a single field of study before being exposed to several of them. College\u2019s greatest gifts can be an introduction to a passion you didn\u2019t previously have and a pivot into an occupation you never before envisioned.Regardless of major, there are skills to insist on acquiring because they transcend any particular career. Communication \u2014 clear writing, cogent speaking \u2014 is one of them, and many different courses can hone it.I asked Mitchell scholars if there was a department or discipline that they wished they had paid more heed. Science majors mentioned humanities. Humanities majors mentioned computer science and statistics. In retrospect, if not in real time, intellectually curious people appreciate and want the benefits of balance. So incorporate it, to some degree, in your college years.Several Mitchell scholars also fretted that they\u2019d lost out on some of what college had to offer by sticking to predetermined scripts, sweating perfection and avoiding risks. That dovetailed with a concern that many professors articulate to me \u2014 that students aren\u2019t learning to stumble and to right themselves, which they can do in college with lower stakes than later on. Something else that can come in college is an enormously expanded self-knowledge that translates into a hugely improved design for living. But that hinges on an adventurous spirit, especially outside the classroom.Is it poetry? Music? Sport? Those and more are abundant on college campuses. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to shape a life that leads you to a happy place,\u201d Delbanco said. Let college do precisely that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Motherhood and the Back-to-College Blues", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySummer is ending, and all my baby birds are leaving the nest. Ms. Renkl is a contributing opinion writer. NASHVILLE \u2014 It is dusk in August, and the voices of the robins fill the air. All spring I watched these birds building their nests and raising their nestlings, those sharp-eyed babies making harsh, monosyllabic demands. All summer I watched the robins teaching their fledglings to flutter up from the ground and into the tree limbs, or at least the inner branches of a dense shrub, as quickly as they could. Now the young birds have grown past the one-note call of desperation they made under their parents\u2019 care. All the robins, young and old, are singing the same song now. At twilight it is a mournful sound \u2014 something less than heartbreaking, something more than melancholy. Or maybe this edging sadness has nothing to do with robins. Summer is ending, and my younger sons \u2014 the only two still at home even part of the year \u2014 are heading back to college, and I can hardly bear to see them go. When they were younger, the connection I felt to them was visceral. During those early days of carrying a child \u2014 in my body or in my arms \u2014 I came to feel like one-half of a symbiotic relationship. It\u2019s been years since then, but motherhood still thrums within me like a pulse. My youngest child is 20 years old and 6 feet tall, but still I catch myself swaying whenever I\u2019m standing in a long line, soothing the ghost baby fussing in my arms. I haven\u2019t forgotten how exhausting it was to be the parent of young children or how often I was frustrated by the close rooms and constricted plans of our lives in those days. I haven\u2019t forgotten how repetitive that life was, how often I felt unable to draw a deep breath. And yet I sometimes let myself imagine what a gift it would be to start all over again with this man, with these children, to go back to the beginning and feel less restless this time, less eager to hurry my babies along. Why did I spend so much time watching for the next milestone when the next milestone never meant the freedom I expected? There will be years and years to sleep, I know now, but only the briefest weeks in which to smell a baby\u2019s skin as he nestles into my neck on dark, sleepless nights.Already they are packing the minivan we bought when the youngest was in second grade. The house that all summer has been loud with life will fall almost silent. My husband and I will drive them to their dorms on the other side of the state, take a few minutes to unload, and then turn around to head home again. I will lift a hand as we pull out, though I know they will already be turning away, turning toward their beckoning new life. It has been years since the last time they looked back after leaving a car.This is what we raised them for, and I\u2019m grateful for their independence, for the interesting lives they\u2019re making for themselves in the world. I will adjust again to the quiet, and be grateful for the freedom it brings. In a few days they will call to check in; their brother will drop by; they\u2019ll be home for the holidays before I know it. While they are away, I\u2019ll be living my own full and busy life, just as they are living theirs.And yet this sense of loss keeps murmuring in my ear. It says nothing so simple as \u201cYour children are leaving, and you will miss them terribly.\u201d Instead it hisses, \u201cAll the things you learned and all the ways you changed as their mother \u2014 what will you do with them now?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Generation Grows Up in China Without Google, Facebook or Twitter", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 Wei Dilong, 18, who lives in the southern Chinese city of Liuzhou, likes basketball, hip-hop music and Hollywood superhero movies. He plans to study chemistry in Canada when he goes to college in 2020.Mr. Wei is typical of Chinese teenagers in another way, too: He has never heard of Google or Twitter. He once heard of Facebook, though. It is \u201cmaybe like Baidu?\u201d he asked one recent afternoon, referring to China\u2019s dominant search engine.Now the implications of growing up with this different internet system are starting to play out. Many young people in China have little idea what Google, Twitter or Facebook are, creating a gulf with the rest of the world. And, accustomed to the homegrown apps and online services, many appear uninterested in knowing what has been censored online, allowing Beijing to build an alternative value system that competes with Western liberal democracy.Even if the Western apps and sites make it into China, they may face apathy from young people.Two economists from Peking University and Stanford University concluded this year, after an 18-month survey, that Chinese college students were indifferent about having access to uncensored, politically sensitive information. They had given nearly 1,000 students at two Beijing universities free tools to bypass censorship, but found that nearly half the students did not use them. Among those who did, almost none spent time browsing foreign news websites that were blocked.\u201cOur findings suggest that censorship in China is effective not only because the regime makes it difficult to access sensitive information, but also because it fosters an environment in which citizens do not demand such information in the first place,\u201d the scholars wrote.Zhang Yeqiong, 23, a customer service representative at an e-commerce company in Xinji, a small city a few hours\u2019 drive from Beijing, echoed that sentiment. \u201cI grew up with Baidu, so I\u2019m used to it,\u201d she said.The attitude is a departure even from those born in China in the 1980s. When that generation was coming of age a decade or so ago, some were rebels. One of the most famous was Han Han, a blogger who questioned the Chinese political system and traditional values. He sold millions of copies of books and has more than 40 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.Many young people in China instead consume apps and services like Baidu, the social media service WeChat and the short-video platform Tik Tok. Often, they spout consumerism and nationalism.In March, when the social media giant Tencent surveyed more than 10,000 users who were born in 2000 or after, nearly eight in 10 said they thought China was either in its best time in history or was becoming a better country each day. Nearly the same percentage said they were very optimistic or quite optimistic about their future.One who describes herself as patriotic, optimistic and outgoing is Shen Yanan. Ms. Shen, 28, works in the operations department at a real estate website in Baoding, a city of roughly three million people near Beijing. She believes China is a great country and will do her best to make it stronger, she said.Every evening, she watches one to two hours of South Korean soap operas on her phone. She does not have any news apps on her smartphone because, she said, she is not interested in politics.

For instance, there\u2019s a very interesting congressional race next week in Ohio that your friends might enjoy hearing about. For a minute or two. On the other hand, you could skip over Paul Manafort\u2019s trial, given that there will be another one next month.Wait, a second Paul Manafort trial?

This is one part of the trial you could definitely discuss over a bottle of wine on the back porch with the cicadas chirping in the background. Did you even know they made jackets out of pythons?

{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Arrested and Jailed. For Voting.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow did you learn about the Alamance 12? Who are they? I read a few stories about the case in the local newspaper and learned they were convicted felons who appeared to have largely voted by accident in the last election, and that nine of the 12 were black. I knew in an instant that I needed to write about this case. It took me a few months of on-and-off efforts to get some of the 12 and their lawyers to agree to talk with me. That\u2019s when I got on a plane. How do voters who are ineligible to vote still end up on the voter rolls?Ineligible voters can end up on the rolls because of mistakes and imperfect elections databases. When you move from one state to another, you don\u2019t always automatically get taken off your old state\u2019s registration list. People convicted of crimes or who register even though they are not citizens are not always instantly culled by elections databases. What does the law actually say about what a citizen is required to have with them in order to vote?This seems like a simple question, but it\u2019s actually a doozy because there\u2019s no single law that governs voting in this country. We have federal laws that seek to ensure people\u2019s right to vote. We have Constitutional amendments that lay out a few fundamental rights \u2014 that women can vote, that 18 is the national voting age, that voting cannot be denied because of race. But we also have 50 states with their own election laws and wildly varying rules. They get to regulate early voting, what kinds of identification voters need to show to prove their identity, whether felons can vote, how ballots are cast and counted. And this is where huge political and legal battles over voter fraud and discrimination are now unfolding. Some states do not require identification at all when you go vote. But other states \u2014 many of them Republican-controlled \u2014 have passed laws demanding photo identification or some proof of citizenship from voters. Critics say these laws discriminate against low-income voters, younger voters and racial and ethnic minority groups. Why would illegal voting be classified as a felony?Improper voting by a convicted felon is a low-level felony in North Carolina, but it\u2019s still treated as a serious crime, punishable by up to two years in prison. A conviction affects your record. It puts you at risk of being labeled a habitual offender. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether you intended to defraud the election system, or whether you simply didn\u2019t know the law.Most prosecutors in the state did not file charges after the state found that 441 felons had voted improperly. But the district attorney in Alamance County was an exception \u2014 he said that defending the integrity of the election system was important, and he filed charges. What happens next for the Alamance 12? Will there be trials? And will the outcome have implications outside of North Carolina? Three of the 12 have pleaded their cases down to misdemeanors just to be done with the ordeal. The others could decide to fight, and that would mean criminal trials unless the district attorney decided now to drop the charges. They do not have the strongest defense because it\u2019s hard to argue they did not, in fact, vote. But they could argue they were never told they had lost their voting rights. They could try to call probation officers or other court officials as witnesses to testify to that. They could essentially ask a jury to acquit them because they never intended to break the law, even if they technically did. This may just be the story of 12 people in a small North Carolina county, but I think it\u2019s interesting and important. It\u2019s about race, history, voting rights, access to the ballot box and so many of the other issues that are swirling in the fight over a basic American right. If there\u2019s a trial, I hope to be there to bring you the rest of the story. This week we learned more about Harvard\u2019s admissions process through court filings in a lawsuit accusing the university of violating federal civil rights in a way that discriminates against Asian-Americans. We offer a brief excerpt here: The sorting begins right away. The country is divided into about 20 geographic \u201cdockets,\u201d each of which is assigned to a subcommittee of admissions officers with intimate knowledge of that region and its high schools.Generally two or three admissions officers, or readers, rate applications in five categories: academic, extracurricular, athletic, personal and \u201coverall.\u201d They also rate teachers\u2019 and guidance counselors\u2019 recommendations. And an alumni interviewer also rates the candidates.Harvard says it also considers \u201ctips,\u201d or admissions advantages, for some applicants. The plaintiffs say the college gives tips to five groups: racial and ethnic minorities; legacies, or the children of Harvard or Radcliffe alumni; relatives of a Harvard donor; the children of staff or faculty members; and recruited athletes.Whether Harvard gives a penalty \u2014 in effect, the opposite of a tip \u2014 to Asian-Americans goes to the heart of the current litigation. A 1990 report by the Education Department found that, while Harvard was not discriminating against Asian-Americans, it was not giving them a tip, either. A 2013 internal report by Harvard found that being Asian-American was negatively correlated with admission, as did an expert analysis for the plaintiffs. But using a different statistical approach, Harvard\u2019s expert found a modest bump for two subgroups of Asian-Americans \u2014 women and applicants from California \u2014 belying, Harvard said, the overall claim of discrimination.Here are some of the stories that we\u2019re talking about, beyond The Times.We publish many articles that touch on race.

{"Headline": "Precious as Silver, Vanilla Brings Cash and Crime to Madagascar", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "SAMBAVA, Madagascar \u2014 Bright moonlight reflected off broad banana leaves, but it was still hard to see the blue twine laced through the undergrowth, a tripwire meant to send the unwary tumbling to the ground.\u201cThis is the way the thieves come,\u201d said the vanilla farmer, lowering his voice and sweeping his flashlight beam over a ditch.SambavaMozambiqueChannelAntsahalalinaMadagascarIndianOceanBy The New York TimesThe lush mountains in Madagascar\u2019s northeast produce about 80 percent of the world\u2019s vanilla, one of the most expensive flavors. Its price has soared, reaching more than $600 a kilogram last year, or about $270 a pound \u2014 more than silver \u2014 compared with $50 a kilogram in 2013.Growing Western demand for the flavoring is partly driving the price spike, with vanilla used in everything from ice cream to alcohol to cosmetics. Supply was diminished by a cyclone that ravaged crops last year on the island, which lies off the coast of southeast Africa.With the perfect climate and soil for growing vanilla, the Sava region of Madagascar is in the midst of an economic boom.So-called vanilla mansions have sprung up above traditional thatched grass huts. Even the humblest homes often boast solar panels and LED lights that make once-dark villages glow by night. Gleaming SUVs ply the broken streets of Sambava, the vanilla capital, where bustling markets line the roadsides.The windfall, however, has come at a cost. Vanilla\u2019s high price, combined with rampant poverty and a corrupt, weak state, has made the crop a favorite target of violent criminal networks.The story of the vanilla trade in Madagascar is one of dangers and rewards, and can be told through three vital links in the chain that delivers the flavor from the fields to port, where it is exported to the world.Most vanilla still comes from small farms, like Mr. Oclin\u2019s, where the work is backbreaking.Vanilla plants need to be nurtured for three to four years before bearing pods. The flowers bloom once a year for 24 hours and must be immediately pollinated.Melipona bees in Mexico, where the Aztecs first used vanilla, originally did this job, but the insects never existed in Madagascar. So each season, about 40 million vanilla plants are fertilized by hand using a toothpick-sized wooden needle.Once pollinated, a flower produces green beans within two months; the vanilla fragrance is tucked inside in thousands of little black seeds and an oily film. The beans begin fermenting once picked, so growers must quickly find buyers.The hard work does not bother Mr. Oclin.\u201cThe problem is security,\u201d he said, explaining that thieves will attack and kill farmers for their vanilla pods.So not only does he patrol his plot of about 3,000 vanilla vines, he pays three men to stand guard every night during the four months before the summer harvest.The men are armed with double-pronged fishing spears and clubs, plus Mr. Oclin\u2019s rifle. Each night, a vigilante group patrolling local plantations stops by with a half-dozen men armed with clubs and machetes.\u201cEvery vanilla plot will be guarded,\u201d Mr. Oclin said.With little public trust in a corrupt police force and justice system, mob justice often prevails when a suspected thief is caught.In April, a local militia captured a thief with a little over three pounds of freshly picked vanilla. He was beaten with sticks until he collapsed, then hacked to death with machetes, according to residents. It was just one of dozens of similar \u201cvanilla murders\u201d over the past two seasons.But arrests do happen.On one day this year, \u201cwe had 33 convictions,\u201d said Volozara Sakina Mohamady, the director of the prison in Antalaha, one of the Sava region\u2019s main ports. \u201cMostly for vanilla.\u201dDespite the risks, Mr. Oclin has seen a small payoff from the vanilla trade. He now has a smartphone and a Facebook account, and his one-room home has a TV and satellite dish powered by solar energy.In Sambava, in the shade of a mango tree, Pascale Rasafindakoto, 44, a \u201ccommisionnaire,\u201d or middleman, waits with dozens of his peers for lower-level sellers to arrive from the countryside with small plastic bags of vanilla beans.The aroma, texture, and bean size (bigger is better) are examined and a price negotiated.Sometimes, Mr. Rasafindakoto ventures into the countryside in a battered car in search of deals. His trip back might include a forced stop at one of the frequent roadblocks, where the police expect a payoff to pass.\u201cI\u2019ve never had any problems with gendarmes,\u201d he said smiling. \u201cI work with them. I have to give them something so they are my friends.\u201dWith beans spoiling so quickly, growers have little bargaining power. They often get much less money for their beans than middlemen like Mr. Rasafindakoto receive when selling the beans to a central curing facility.\u201cWe\u2019ve been poor for too long,\u201d said Dominique Rakotoson, 55, a longtime farmer in Sambava who represents 100 families of vanilla growers. \u201cDespite the price hike, most farmers remain poor because they sell their crops right away, or too early.\u201dTales of commissionaires swindling growers abound. They also are widely accused of lowering overall quality by mixing good and bad vanilla.\u201cThe middlemen is where the shady business goes on,\u201d Mr. Rakotoson said.Mr. Rasafindakoto shrugs off talk like this. His family now has a new house with a flat screen TV and makes frequent trips to the beach to barbecue with friends.The vanilla trade is hard work, he said, so why not enjoy the good times while they last?\u201cWith vanilla, life is sweet,\u201d Mr. Rasafindakoto said. \u201cIt has sped up and we can live it fully.\u201dMichel Lomone presided over his warehouse in Antalaha, watching a small army of aproned women curing, sorting and packing tons of dried vanilla into boxes for export to multinational flavoring and fragrance companies.While wealthy by local standards, Mr. Lomone\u2019s biggest concern is the same as Mr. Oclin\u2019s: theft.\u201cThere is no security of goods or of people,\u201d Mr. Lomone said. \u201cThe system of justice is rotten. There\u2019s total impunity. It\u2019s like cocaine in Latin America. They get the little guys, but not the head.\u201dMr. Lomone said hundreds of pounds of vanilla have been stolen from his warehouses over the years. All his employees are frisked when they leave work.\u201cThe pods are so small and valuable it\u2019s easy to hide them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like with diamonds in South Africa.\u201dMr. Lomone produces the highest quality \u201cbourbon\u201d vanilla, using a curing technique that takes months.\u201cVanilla takes patience,\u201d Mr. Lomone said.Mr. Lomone said he was concerned about the boom\u2019s effect on local culture, with people doing whatever they can to get rich quick.\u201cNow in Madagascar, it\u2019s not a problem of poverty to eat, but of social poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the competition to keep up with others making fast money. It\u2019s not good. We can\u2019t keep going like this.\u201dMap by Baden Copeland. Produced by Craig Allen and Gray Beltran.Advertisement"}

I've never met a Trump supporter who did not know exactly who he is.Opinion ColumnistThat\u2019s the bit of the United States the rest of the world finds hardest to fathom. Why the scorn for handouts, the equating of universal health care with socialism, the obsession with self-reliance, the refusal to see that a profusion of guns leads to a profusion of mass shootings? Of course a crowded Europe with its wounds seeks solidarity in the name of stability, while America with its wide-open spaces embraces the right to be left alone (at least until you need Medicaid) and the right, whatever its risks, to the next frontier.I said it\u2019s different in the West. It\u2019s not so different in the West, it\u2019s just that you see more clearly what the country stood for in its own mythologized self-image, what it was to be an American, what it was to aspire to some new and exemplary measure of freedom, and how far things have fallen to produce President Donald Trump.No part of the country today is immune to American fracture or the squalid Trump wars, to cultural confrontations over identity and gender and race, to the effects of stagnant incomes over decades, or to the narcissism of modernity.In a purple state, unlike in Brooklyn, N.Y., or Palo Alto, Calif., these differences press in on each other. Conversations occur that break through ideological lines. Grand Junction, in western Colorado, voted for Trump at the last election. There, I spoke to Robert Babcox, a pastor, who praised the president for sticking to his campaign promises and, \u201cfor all the bravado,\u201d getting the economy revved up.Words don\u2019t kill, I said. Some things are worse than death, he said. So, I asked, Trump\u2019s great? No, the pastor said. He only trusted Trump \u201cto a degree.\u201d Someone should take away his cellphone, he said. Americans can come together, he said, praising John F. Kennedy. \u201cI served in the Navy,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw so many taken before their time \u2014 white, black, Hispanic. It all hurt me just the same, and they all bled red, and that lesson stayed with me.\u201dIt\u2019s also why the itch to believe that the moment has come when everything starts to unravel must be viewed warily. Sure, Trump sounds more desperate. But who\u2019s the enforcer if Trump has broken the law? It\u2019s Congress \u2014 and until things change there (which could happen in November) or Republicans at last abandon a policy of hold-my-nose opportunism, Trump will ride out the storm.Trump was a symptom, not a cause. The problem is way deeper than him.For William Steding, a diplomatic historian living in Colorado, American individualism has morphed into narcissism, perfectibility into entitlement, and exceptionalism into hubris. Out of that, and more, came the insidious malignancy of Trump. It will not be extirpated overnight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trapped in 99-Million-Year-Old Amber, a Beetle With Pilfered Pollen", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe discovery is among the strongest evidence in the fossil record that the insects pollinated prehistoric cycads, a plant that preceded flowering plants.Bees and butterflies are praised for their pollination prowess. But millions of years before they ever flirted with a flower, beetles were one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent pollinators. Dr. Cai first started studying the amber while doing research in China. Stuck inside was a two-millimeter-long insect, known as a boganiid beetle. These beetles have a tiny cavity filled with hair at the base of their mandibles that acts like a pocket for collecting pollen. When he was done cutting, trimming and polishing the amber, Dr. Cai had what was essentially a biological sample mounted on a golden glass slide. He placed the fossil under a microscope and examined it at 400 times magnification. There, he found the beetle\u2019s mandible pocket. And surprisingly, he saw dozens of specks of pollen, some even clustered in clumps, alongside the beetle. \u201cI was very excited. I just wanted to know what was this pollen,\u201d Dr. Cai said. \u201cIt\u2019s not on the body of the beetle, but it\u2019s very close to the beetle and to its mouth part,\u201d he said. He noted that the pollen may have once been on the beetle, but it could have slid off as the pair were engulfed by tree resin. Cycads, unlike most flowering plants, have distinct male and female plants. When a beetle flies to the cones of a male plant, perhaps seeking pollen to eat or for a place to lay its eggs, it brushes against the pollen. Then while visiting dozens of other cycads, it may happen upon a female cycad and deliver that pollen. Though this piece of amber is 99-million-years-old, Dr. Cai and Dr. Engel think it provides a snapshot of a pollination process that may be much older, possibly dating to the Triassic Period. If so, that may mean that beetles were pollinating plants more than a hundred million years before butterflies and bees were first pollinating flowers, which may have been around 130 million years ago.\u201cInsects and plants are the two dominant titans of our world,\u201d said Dr. Engel. \u201cThe intimate, love-hate relationship between these two behemoths of diversity through time is a major tale to tell, and this fossil is just one component of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Weaponized Ad Technology\u2019: Facebook\u2019s Moneymaker Gets a Critical Eye", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has made a mint by enabling advertisers to identify and reach the very people most likely to react to their messages. Ad buyers can select audiences based on details like a user\u2019s location, political leanings and interests as specific as the Museum of the Confederacy or online gambling. And they can aim their ads at as few as 20 of the 1.5 billion daily users of the social network.But microtargeting, as the technique is called, is coming under increased scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Some government officials, researchers and advertising executives warn that it can be exploited to polarize and manipulate voters. And they are calling for restrictions on its use in politics, even after Facebook, in response to criticism, recently limited some of the targeting categories available to advertisers.Facebook is just one player among tech giants like Google and Twitter that also offer data-mining services to try to influence consumer and voter behavior. But Facebook\u2019s gargantuan reach, vast holdings of user data and easy-to-use self-service advertising system have made it a lightning rod for political microtargeting.Much of the new attention being paid to microtargeted advertising has emerged from investigations into how Russian groups interfered in elections and how the voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. Microtargeting, they have found, was a central tool for foreign groups trying to interfere in elections.\u201cThese techniques raise fundamental questions about the relationship between privacy and democracy, as concerns about voter surveillance could lead to disengagement with the political process,\u201d Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, wrote in the report.New research on how groups tied to the Kremlin exploited the technology during the 2016 presidential election in the United States is also raising concerns.Then on Election Day, the same Russian group sent the same Facebook user demographic an ad urging them to boycott the presidential election.\u201cNo one represents Black people. Don\u2019t go to vote,\u201d the ad said.In the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Facebook has made major changes to try to deter subversive groups from exploiting its system.But there remain many categories available to political and other advertisers, including selecting audiences by their ZIP code, education level, brand of smartphone, and whether they are politically moderate, very conservative or very liberal.Facebook has also said that it would require anyone seeking to run a political campaign or political issue ad to confirm their identity and location as well as disclose who paid for the ad. In May, Facebook introduced an archive containing political ads shown on Facebook and Instagram. It includes information on the ad costs, viewership and certain demographics of the ad audience.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said the archive and other changes would \u201chelp prevent the abuse\u201d of the company\u2019s advertising tools.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible to advertise in obscurity on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Leathern said in a statement.But critics, including some civil rights experts and researchers, say that Facebook\u2019s recent efforts have done little to disable microtargeting as an engine of voter manipulation. The company\u2019s new political ad archive, for instance, does not include details on the criteria used to target voters.The problem, critics of microtargeting say, is that even a small amount of money could potentially have large negative effects.To stoke anxiety among Latinos last year, for instance, the Internet Research Agency used Facebook to aim an ad at users interested in Mexico, Latin hip-hop and the Chicano Movement. The ad showed a cartoon of immigrants standing in front of a barbed-wire border with a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to steal your jobs,\u201d it said, \u201cwe came to make a living.\u201dThe Russian group paid 10.6 rubles \u2014 about 16 cents \u2014 for the Facebook ad, which was seen 283 times. But the targeting was so successful that the selected group spread the ad, which eventually racked up 16,000 reactions and 95,000 shares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Something Digs Intricate Tunnels in Garnets. Is It Alive?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe deep red gems have long been found marred with internal markings. Researchers propose a new explanation involving fungal microorganisms who have found a nice place to live. Deep red garnets are found all over the world, from Thailand and Sri Lanka to the Adirondacks. They\u2019re even the state gem of New York. The stones that make their way into rings and necklaces must have a flawless interior. But sometimes garnets are marred with intricate traceries of microscopic tunnels. When Magnus Ivarsson, a geobiologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, first saw these tunnels, he wondered what could be making them.From the beginning, the researchers looked for alternative explanations. One of the most promising was that grains of another stone wore their way through the garnet. However, the mineral doing the tunneling must be harder than the surrounding substance, and garnets happen to be very, very hard. About the only things that could do that to garnet are diamonds or sapphires. But those aren\u2019t present in significant quantities where these garnets were found, said Dr. Ivarsson. In that area, \u201cthere is basically no mineral grain that can be propelled through a garnet like that,\u201d he said.Furthermore, the tunnels branch and connect with each other in a very unusual pattern, looking a bit like the structures made by some kinds of single-celled fungus colonies. When the researchers cracked the garnets open, they tested the insides of the tunnels and found signs of fatty acids and other lipids, potential indicators of life. It\u2019s not unheard-of for microorganisms to live in rocks \u2014 endoliths, as such creatures are called, have been found living encased within sandstone in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, among other places. Endoliths can get nutrients from water percolating through rock, or perhaps even dissolve it to feed themselves, while living safely.At the moment, the researchers\u2019 best guess for the origins of the tunnels goes like this: At first, normal wear-and-tear on the surface of a garnet creates divots. Microorganisms, probably fungi, can colonize these hollows. Then, if the stone is the best nearby source for certain nutrients, such as iron, perhaps they use an as-yet mysterious chemical reaction to burrow deeper, harvesting sustenance as they go. \u201cI think there\u2019s a two-step process, a superficial weathering, then an organism takes over,\u201d said Dr. Ivarsson. No one, not even Dr. Ivarsson, is totally convinced of the explanation yet. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely work to be done,\u201d he said. The team did not try to extract living organisms from the stone this time around, and indeed is not sure whether the creatures that made the tunnels would still be present within. They also don\u2019t know whether the process may have occurred millions of years ago in the gems where it is seen, or if it occurred more recently.The next step would be to take organisms directly from the tunnels or the soil near where the stones were found and grow them in the lab. Then it would be possible to see whether they can actually carve their way through fresh garnet \u2014 or if the origin story of these mysterious structures must lie somewhere else. Advertisement"}

Traditional grocery retailers are lusting after digital technology; online companies are seeing benefits in bricks and mortar.

Groceries are unique in that their inventory is perishable, fragile and heavy. Grocery customers often shop at the last minute, like to see the food they are about to eat and don\u2019t want to pay high delivery fees.Chieh Huang, the C.E.O. of Boxed, poses the big question: \u201cAre technology folks like us going to figure out retail faster than the retailers figure out technology?\u201d\u2022 Some 40 percent of U.S. businesses are now female-owned, up from 29 percent in 2007.\u2022 Women of color made much of the difference.

Schmidt is really living the dream.In 2013, Mr. Schmidt did something some of us have considered: He quit his job (prepping handblown glass chandeliers in SoHo) and moved to the beach.We stopped by his workshop at Marina 59 on a recent morning to learn about his craft.To make his boards, Mr. Schmidt shapes \u201cblanks\u201d \u2014 or long pieces of unshaped foam with a planer \u2014 or an electric shaver.\u201cThere are no straight lines on the board, so shaping is done all by light and by feel,\u201d he said.He then layers on sheets of fiberglass and a coating of epoxy resin in a room heated to between 95 and 100 degrees, which helps keep the syrupy resin malleable. Finally, he sands out any imperfections.The process is similar to woodworking, said Mr. Schmidt, who spent time as a young man working for a carpenter in \u201clandlocked\u201d Richmond, Va., where he\u2019s from. Shaping a board also reminds him of surfing.\u201cThe work is done quietly, by yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re connected to an object and the rhythm in your body, and you have time to think and recalibrate.\u201d\u201cThe best is when people I make boards for tell me, \u2018Dude, I just had the best session of my life,\u2019 or \u2018I caught the longest wave of my life,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI get to create something with my own hands that connects people to the ocean and water.

Particularly now that we\u2019re making lists of all the women our president has ever compared to a canine. Back when I worked for New York Newsday, he sent me a copy of a column I\u2019d written, scrawled with objections, along with an announcement that I was \u201ca dog and a liar\u201d and that my picture was \u201cthe face of a pig.\u201d At the time, he was only a flailing real estate developer trying to make a deal with the city, yet it still seemed so weird that at first I wondered if it might be a joke, or some enemy of Trump\u2019s trying to embarrass him. But no, it was a missive from the man himself. Lately, everything seems to start with reality TV. You\u2019ll remember that Omarosa appeared on a U.S. version of \u201cBig Brother\u201d and dished the dirt on her former boss. \u201cThe bad tweets happen between 4 and 6 in the morning,\u201d she confided to a fellow contestant. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody up there but Melania.\u201d But this was pretty small potatoes compared to what Stormy might come up with. (Plus, people, do we really think Melania was up there?)One thing that\u2019s for sure is that the tweets tell us a lot about the president\u2019s own miserable insecurities. He\u2019s been shooting off insults about people\u2019s intellect for years, from Robert De Niro to Arianna Huffington to Lindsey Graham, who not only got called \u201ca total lightweight\u201d and an \u201cidiot\u201d but also, in the cruelest cut of all \u201cnot as bright as Rick Perry.\u201d We could go on and on.

{"Headline": "What Does It Mean to Be Human? Don\u2019t Ask ", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEASWe don\u2019t see the problem with our self-importance because our narcissism is so complete. Over time, the idea of \u201cbeing human\u201d has surely meant \u2014 and will continue to mean \u2014 many things. There is and has never been just one answer. But surely one thing it ought to involve today is the ability to recognize that the question itself is a problem. We humans are very self-focused. We tend to think that being human is somehow very special and important, so we ask about that, instead of asking what it means to be an elephant, or a pig, or a bird. This failure of curiosity is part of a large ethical problem. The question, \u201cWhat is it to be human?\u201d is not just narcissistic, it involves a culpable obtuseness. It is rather like asking, \u201cWhat is it to be white?\u201d It connotes unearned privileges that have been used to dominate and exploit. But we usually don\u2019t recognize this because our narcissism is so complete. We share a planet with billions of other sentient beings, and they all have their own complex ways of being whatever they are. All of our fellow animal creatures, as Aristotle observed long ago, try to stay alive and reproduce more of their kind. All of them perceive. All of them desire. And most move from place to place to get what they want and need. Aristotle proposed that we should strive for a common explanation of how animals, including human animals, perceive, desire and move. We know Aristotle as a philosopher, but he also was a great biologist who studied shellfish and other creatures large and small. He encouraged his students not to turn away from studying animals that don\u2019t seem glamorous, since there is something wonderful in all of them, not least the sheer fact that they all strive for continued life. This sense of wonder, which should lead us to a fuller ethical concern, is a deep part of our humanity. But wonder is on the wane, and we humans now so dominate the globe that we rarely feel as if we need to live with other animals on reciprocal terms. New issues arise constantly. The world needs an ethical revolution, a consciousness-raising movement of truly international proportions. But this revolution is impeded by the navel-gazing that is typically involved in asking, \u201cWhat is it to be human?\u201d We now know that animals need many things that don\u2019t always cause suffering when they are absent: the chance to associate with others of their kind in normal groupings; the chance to sing or trumpet in their characteristic ways; the chance to breed; the chance to move freely through unobstructed space; the chance to pursue curiosity and make new discoveries. So we also need, I believe, an approach that focuses on a plurality of distinct \u201ccapabilities,\u201d or freedoms, that each species requires to live a flourishing life. So let\u2019s put aside the narcissism involved in asking only about ourselves. Let\u2019s strive for an era in which being human means being concerned with the other species that try to inhabit this world. Martha C. Nussbaum is the Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Are Not Born Human", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE Big ideasOur humanity is a process that begins with negation. Mr. L\u00e9vy is a French philosopher, filmmaker and activist.What does it mean to be human? The immensity of this question can be boiled down to an old principle proposed by the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, which he attributed to fellow philosopher Baruch Spinoza: \u201cDetermination is negation.\u201dBut negation of what?First, of God. In the beginning there was God \u2014 the source of infinite action. In the Western tradition, man has no purpose without God. For Christians, man was created in God\u2019s image; for Jews, God is a good worker who lends a hand. For atheists (who, let\u2019s not forget, are Judeo-Christians in their own way), man\u2019s purpose is in part to topple God from his throne. If this isn\u2019t a complete negation of God, then it at least limits his power, as humans come to occupy the space formerly reserved for God alone. Determination is also a negation of nature. Nobody will deny \u2014 most of all not Spinoza \u2014 that a human is \u201cnatura naturata,\u201d a thing among things, a nature among natures, a figure of the world woven from the same fiber as all other ordinary figures. But to be human is also to desire transcendence, to aspire to be more than merely a sliver of nature.In his day, the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes pondered the difference between humans and machines. Today, on the cusp of a revolution in artificial intelligence, we are pondering a similar question: How will we be able to tell a real human from a synthetic one?  A real human is \u201cres cogitans,\u201d a thinking thing, as Descartes put it. A source of \u201cintentionality,\u201d as the philosopher Edmund Husserl wrote. Being human means taking a leap out of the natural order. To be human requires an escape, in one way or another, from that mass of atoms, cells and particles from which you and I and everything else is composed. It is to be endowed with a soul, which \u2014 even if it is immaterial, without expanse or density, even if it is perfectly invisible, impalpable and inconsistent \u2014 acts as a passport out of nature and into our human essence.This systematic denaturalization, this confidence that a piece of oneself can escape from the natural order of the world, is akin to a second birth. Nature is the first stage of humanity; but it can, under no circumstance, be its horizon.But there is also a third birth. To be human, of course, is to be part of another entity that we call society. With all due respect to the \u201cRousseauism\u201d of those who have never truly read Jean-Jacques Rousseau, man has never existed entirely on his own, with no attachment to a community of others. But here, we must be very careful. To idolize the social sphere, to passively accept the constraints that result from the imposition of social laws and norms, can prove fatal for human striving. Here lies the bleak realm of Martin Heidegger\u2019s \u201cwe.\u201d Here are the nameless, faceless mobs prophesied by Edgar Allan Poe and who today have been unleashed on social media. This private power may not be accessible to us at first. We aren\u2019t born human; we become it. Humanity is not a form of being; it is a destiny. It is not a steady state, delivered once and for all, but a process.To be human also means knowing that one can win battles, but never the war. Death will have the final say. If this seems all too tragic, if we are troubled by the sense that the inhuman is the rule and the human the exception, we must come to understand it as a source of salvation.Ultimately, I am sure of nothing. Philosophy is strictly concerned with the field of the possible, not the knowable, so I can only wager on what may be. But I do know one thing: The history of this past century teaches us that when we place our bets on nostalgia \u2014 when we dedicate ourselves to the search for some lost native land, for something pure \u2014 we only pave the way for totalitarianism. We trigger the machines to clean, purge and wash us away.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Backs Suit Accusing Harvard of Discriminating Against Asian-American Applicants", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department lent its support on Thursday to students who are suing Harvard University over affirmative action policies that they claim discriminate against Asian-American applicants, in a case that could have far-reaching consequences in college admissions.\u201cHarvard has failed to carry its demanding burden to show that its use of race does not inflict unlawful racial discrimination on Asian-Americans,\u201d the Justice Department said in its filing.The filing said that Harvard \u201cuses a vague \u2018personal rating\u2019 that harms Asian-American applicants\u2019 chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias; engages in unlawful racial balancing; and has never seriously considered race-neutral alternatives in its more than 45 years of using race to make admissions decisions.\u201dBut the Trump administration is turning the same tool against affirmative action in college admissions, a major \u2014 and highly contentious \u2014 legacy of the civil rights era, and one that white conservatives have opposed for decades. In the past few years, the anti-affirmative action cause has been joined by Asian-Americans who argue that they are being held to a higher standard, losing out on coveted slots at places like Harvard as African-Americans, Latinos and other groups get a boost.A handful of states already ban public universities from relying on affirmative action, pushing several toward a model that takes socioeconomic factors into account instead of race. Public universities in California and Washington have tried to engineer class-based diversity in their student bodies, believing that giving a lift to lower-income students will end up bringing in more minority students as well.Now, universities that factor race into admissions have found a powerful new opponent in the Trump administration, which argued in its filing on Thursday that the court should deny Harvard\u2019s request to dismiss the case before trial.The government said that Supreme Court rulings require that universities considering race in admissions meet several standards. They must define their diversity-related goals and show that they cannot meet those goals without using race as a factor in admissions decisions.The department argued that Harvard does not adequately explain how race factors into its admissions decisions, leaving open the possibility that the university is going beyond what the law allows.\u201cHarvard has failed to show that it does not unlawfully discriminate against Asian-Americans,\u201d the Justice Department said in a statement Thursday.Harvard said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d but not surprised \u201cgiven the highly irregular investigation the D.O.J. has engaged in thus far.\u201d\u201cHarvard does not discriminate against applicants from any group, and will continue to vigorously defend the legal right of every college and university to consider race as one factor among many in college admissions, which the Supreme Court has consistently upheld for more than 40 years,\u201d the university said in a statement.\u201cEliminating race-conscious admissions would disproportionately harm applicants of color, including some Asian-Americans,\u201d Harvard alumni said in their filing.\u201cApplicants\u2019 opportunities to amass credentials that make for a competitive college application are greatly affected by race,\u201d alumni and students wrote. \u201cGiven racial bias in standardized testing and endemic racial inequities,\u201d they said the school must continue to consider race.Officials from both departments said that the Obama administration had used guidelines to circumvent Congress and the courts to create affirmative action policies that went beyond existing law.Civil rights leaders and others argue that this stance effectively undermines decades of policy progress that created opportunity for minorities.The department typically files statements of interest in cases that it believes directly affect the federal government\u2019s interests.\u201cAs a recipient of taxpayer dollars, Harvard has a responsibility to conduct its admissions policy without racial discrimination by using meaningful admissions criteria that met lawful requirements,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s alarming that Trump is aligning himself with anti-civil rights activist Edward Blum in this subversive attempt to say that civil rights protections cause discrimination,\u201d said Jeannie Park, the head of the Harvard Asian-American Alumni Alliance and co-founder of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, referring to the founder of Students for Fair Admissions. \u201cTrump does not speak for Asian-Americans, just as Blum does not.\u201d\u201cHarvard today engages in the same kind of discrimination and stereotyping that it used to justify quotas on Jewish applicants in the 1920s and 1930s,\u201d Students for Fair Admissions said in a court filing.Harvard, which admitted less than 5 percent of its applicants this year, said that its own analysis did not find discrimination.A trial in the case has been scheduled for October.If it winds its way to the Supreme Court, it could be heard by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for the vacant seat once held by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. The case could have far-reaching implications for the nation\u2019s colleges and universities that consider race in their admissions processes.The Justice Department is pursuing its own investigation into Harvard\u2019s admissions policies based on a complaint it received.The Obama administration used statements of interest in novel ways to further its civil rights agenda, sometimes by making the unusual move of intervening in local cases.An earlier version of this article misstated when the Justice Department released a statement of interest supporting students suing Harvard in an affirmative action case. The filing was made Thursday, not Friday.Vivian Yee contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How to Make Them Stop", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOnline ads have always been annoying, but now they\u2019re worse than ever.Consider what happens when you shop online for a wristwatch. You peruse a few watch websites and the next thing you know, a watch advertisement is following you everywhere. On your computer, it\u2019s loading in your Facebook feed. On your phone, it\u2019s popping up on Instagram. In your web browser on either, it\u2019s appearing on news sites that have nothing to do with watches. Even if you end up ordering the watch, the ads continue trailing you everywhere.They\u2019re stalker ads.To the ad industry, targeted ads are better for people than the old days of randomly blasting commercials.\u201cThe content isn\u2019t free, so what would you rather see?\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chairwoman for the ad agency 360i. \u201cAds that are at least trying to be of interest to you, or ads that are spray and pray?\u201dFortunately, I have good news. After several years of interviewing internet companies and privacy experts and testing many web tools, I finally managed to make my stalker ads go away.Before you try to exorcise targeted ads, it helps to understand what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.Let\u2019s say you are shopping online for a blender. You load a webpage for a blender from Brand X, then close the browser. The next time you open the browser, ads for the blender are following you from site to site. They\u2019re also showing up in some of your mobile apps like Facebook and Instagram.When you visited Brand X\u2019s website, the site stored a cookie on your device containing a unique identifier. Brand X hired multiple ad tech companies to do its marketing. The ad tech companies embedded trackers that also loaded on Brand X\u2019s website, and the trackers took a look at your cookie to pinpoint your device.The trackers can tell if you are interested in buying something. They look for signals \u2014 like if you closed the browser after looking at the blender for awhile or left the item in the site\u2019s shopping cart without completing the purchase. From there, the ad tech companies can follow your cookie through trackers and ad networks on various sites and apps to serve you an ad for the blender.Ms. Hofstetter said that among ad tech companies, there are good actors and bad actors. The good ones will try to minimize the chances of annoying you by showing you the blender ad only a few times and stopping if they detect that you made the purchase. The bad ones only care to persuade you to buy the blender, so they will relentlessly serve you the ad and not bother to determine whether you already bought it.Things get extra messy when brands employ multiple ad tech companies that employ different approaches. Perhaps one ad company finished serving you the blender ad after a few times on Facebook. But elsewhere on the web or inside another app, another ad tech company served you that same ad endlessly.Here are a few simple steps you can take if you are being pestered by an ad and want that to end:There are more extreme methods to take if you want to prevent targeted ads from ever following you around. But this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart: In my experience, you have to take all, not just some, of these steps to get the pesky ads to leave you alone forever.It will probably take you a couple of hours to set yourself up to prevent ads from haunting you. I gradually made all these changes to my devices and internet accounts over the last few years and only recently stopped seeing targeted ads. It was a grueling process.But I\u2019ve been happy with the results. Those wristwatch ads that once followed me are gone. And recently, I was served an ad for 7-11 on Instagram.Was that ad irrelevant to me? Yes. But was it a sign that I was no longer being well tracked? Also yes. I confess I was pretty happy to see it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeonard Pozner says he spends hours every day trying to erase online conspiracy theories that the death of his 6-year-old son Noah at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.But the bulk of his work is more methodical. Sandy Hook conspiracies are strewn around the internet on various platforms, each with its own opaque rules and reporting mechanisms. So Mr. Pozner has studiously flagged countless videos and posts for a wide variety of offenses \u2014 invasions of privacy, threats and harassment, and copyright infringement \u2014 prompting Facebook, Amazon and Google to remove false material about his son.Twitter has been less receptive to his claims and some smaller sites have simply not responded at all. But one company, Mr. Pozner says, has actively pushed back against his attempts.WordPress.com, one the internet\u2019s biggest blogging platforms, is operated by a company called Automattic, which also runs a wide array of smaller sites and internet services. Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists have been able to remain on WordPress.com thanks, in part, to policies put in place to resist previous campaigns to get content removed from its service, particularly through the strategic use of copyright claims.These debates have put tech companies into a sort of existential crisis. But for Mr. Pozner and others like him, the arguments have long been much more personal, as they struggle with images of family members being repurposed in horrifying new ways and experience harassment themselves because of misinformation online.\u201cThe only items that concern me is when his image is being used in a negative, ugly way \u2014 denying the tragedy, calling him a crisis actor and everything else that the typical global village idiot on the net does,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.In the absence of uniform online policies about hoaxes, Mr. Pozner\u2019s most effective tool has been filing copyright claims on images of Noah. He has filed such claims with Automattic about photos of Noah appearing on posts that labeled him a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d who had been spotted in Pakistan after Sandy Hook and others that claimed he was a \u201cfiction\u201d and that photos of him were created using images of his older half brother.Automattic has repeatedly responded to Mr. Pozner with form letters saying \u201cbecause we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.\u201d The letters explain that fair use could include \u201ccriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\u201d They also warn that the company could collect damages from people who \u201cknowingly materially misrepresent\u201d copyrights.\u201cThe responses from their support people are very automated, very generic, very cold and there\u2019s just no getting through to them,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.\u201cThey have taken this incorrect interpretation of freedom of speech to an extreme,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing WordPress has taken out \u2014 and where I\u2019ve been successful \u2014 is if someone posts personal information like my driver\u2019s license or address.\u201dAutomattic said that the responses Mr. Pozner received were \u201ca predefined statement\u201d that is used in copyright situations. \u201cWe regret that it was used in this situation,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe offer our apologies to the family for the response we gave to them.\u201dMr. Pozner\u2019s complaints appear to have been thwarted in part by longtime policies at Automattic intended to prevent the use of copyright claims to censor criticism and journalism on its platform. The responses sent to Mr. Pozner included a link to a post from 2013 describing the company\u2019s efforts to deal with spurious but effective copyright claims. The post also highlighted that the company had filed suit against two particularly egregious offenders in an effort to \u201cfight back\u201d on behalf of people who were posting material on the platform.Online platforms are not held liable for copyright infringement claims against people who use their platforms as long as they remove or block access to content in response to the claims. This is crucial to the function of any website where people can post content, and internet companies have traditionally tended to err on the side of removal, even when claims may be dubious. This has created opportunities for abuse, and Automattic has made fighting that a corporate cause.\u201cThey avoid getting involved because fair-use determinations are notoriously complex and fact specific,\u201d Mr. Rubin said of online platforms. \u201cPlatforms would rather eliminate their own potential liability by taking the content down and leaving it to the parties to battle amongst themselves in court.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Pozner, however, Automattic suggested that its approach was imperfect. \u201cWhile our policies have many benefits to free expression for those who use our platform, our system like many others that operate at large scale, is not ideal for getting to the deeper context of a given request,\u201d the company said in a statement.Although the posts reported by Mr. Pozner \u201dare not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law,\u201d the company said, \u201cthe pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that.\u201dHe has removed photos of Noah from Facebook by relying on policies that protect the privacy of children under 13, a process that has required him to send the company his driver\u2019s license and a copy of his son\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. Pozner has also successfully filed such reports with Google.\u201cYou can\u2019t even measure the volume of content I\u2019ve taken down at this point,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.At times, he has been able to explain the abuse he and his family have received, some of it because of his efforts to purge Sandy Hook conspiracies from the internet, and seek removals based on a slowly evolving awareness in the tech community about the issue. (In June of last year, a 57-year-old woman in Florida was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr. Pozner and his family.)A report to Vimeo led to a response on Friday from a representative who said he would assign the case to a specialist, but first told Mr. Pozner that he was sorry to hear about his situation.\u201cEveryone has gotten better this year, especially with all the work that I\u2019ve done to shame a lot of these platforms for continuing to abuse us and the memory of our children and just all of the ugliness that goes on,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cIf you type in Noah Pozner now into an image search on Google, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s mostly normal results but it used to be 99 percent hateful angry memes, so the cleanup is huge.\u201dMr. Pozner said he was tired of hearing technology companies say that they do not want to be \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d an oft-repeated refrain, particularly as concerns around misinformation on social media grow.\u201cTechnology platforms have had this misguided, futuristic vision of freedom of speech and everything was built around that, but it doesn\u2019t really fit into the day-to-day use of it,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cBy not taking action, they have made a choice. They are the arbiters of truth by doing nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Speech Scholars to Alex Jones: You\u2019re Not Protected", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSocial media goes Gestapo!\u201d wrote Bill Mitchell, a conservative Twitter personality with 366,000 followers, on Monday evening.\u201cThe great censorship purge has truly begun,\u201d warned Paul Joseph Watson, a contributor to Mr. Jones\u2019s website, Infowars.And in his own message on Twitter, one platform that hasn\u2019t removed his content, Mr. Jones asked: \u201cNow, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech?\u201dThe removal of Mr. Jones and Infowars came after months of mounting pressure on technology companies to tackle the spread of misinformation online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. On Sunday, Apple removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app and by Monday Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube had followed with similar measures.But this isn\u2019t the only effort to stop Mr. Jones from spreading his theories. He also faces multiple defamation claims, and well before Monday\u2019s moves, several scholars of free speech had already concluded that many of the things he has said online were not in fact protected by the First Amendment.In a recent court filing, four law professors who specialize in free-speech issues said that Mr. Jones\u2019s oeuvre was riddled with \u201cabsurd conspiracy theories\u201d and urged a federal judge considering a lawsuit against him not to let him hide behind the First Amendment while publishing his rhetoric.\u201cFalse speech does not serve the public interest the way that true speech does,\u201d the scholars wrote. \u201cAnd indeed, there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201dIn a breathless moment (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s like, whoa, whoa \u2014 C.I.A.?\u201d), Mr. Jones went on to suggest that Mr. Gilmore may have been involved in the attack on Ms. Heyer to bring about what he described as \u201cthe downfall of Trump.\u201dIn March, Mr. Gilmore sued Mr. Jones for defamation, arguing that he had suffered threats and harassment because of the report.In defending himself, Mr. Jones has claimed in court papers that his allegations concerning Mr. Gilmore were \u201copinion, not statements of fact\u201d and that Infowars is a \u201cfreewheeling\u201d website, \u201cin which hyperbole and diatribe reign as the preferred tools of discourse.\u201d His viewers, Mr. Jones maintained, \u201cexpect an interview or monologue to be more free-flowing and opinionated and less precise in its use of language than an article or a book.\u201dWhile they acknowledged that the protection of speech is \u201ca priority of the first order,\u201d the First Amendment scholars, from institutions like Rutgers University and the University of Chicago Law School, noted that since the Middle Ages defamation law has created \u201csocial boundaries about what speech is and is not acceptable.\u201d It has also, they wrote, long sought to balance the freedom of expression with the safeguarding of people\u2019s reputations.To do this, the scholars said, defamation statutes have always restricted some speech \u2014 especially for private figures like Mr. Gilmore, who have less of an ability than those like Mr. Jones with media platforms to \u201cdisseminate their own side of the story.\u201dThe scholars were particularly scathing when it came to Mr. Jones\u2019s contention that his videos on Infowars reflected nothing more than his beliefs. It would set a dangerous precedent, they said, if Judge Moon ruled on his behalf.\u201cIt would allow unscrupulous news organizations to couch their language as \u2018opinion\u2019 and to mask their meaning with implication and insinuation,\u201d the scholars wrote. That, they added, would leave \u201creaders clear as to the message but avoiding all liability for defamatory remarks. This should not be allowed and, in fact, is not allowed.\u201dThe law professors who signed the amicus brief were Lyrissa B. Lidsky, dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, Tamara R. Piety at the University of Tulsa College of Law, David A. Strauss from the University of Chicago Law School, and Carlos A. Ball of Rutgers.The brief was also signed by Michael B. Hissam, a lawyer at the firm of Bailey & Glasser in Charleston, W.Va., who is amicus counsel for Mr. Gilmore, and Katharine M. Mapes and Katherine O\u2019Konski, lawyers at the firm of Spiegel & McDiarmid in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are We Now Electing Supreme Court Justices?", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySure seems like it, from watching the TV ads for and against Brett Kavanaugh.Contributing Opinion Writer Unless you\u2019ve been hiding under a rock \u2014 an ever more appealing prospect this summer \u2014 you have no doubt noticed the televised election campaign being waged for Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court.Oops, Freudian slip there. Supreme Court justices are not actually elected, although if you picked the wrong day to skip civics class, or if you just landed from Mars, you would be forgiven for thinking they appear on a ballot.And Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., speaking at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute last year shortly after the Senate\u2019s almost completely polarized confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, mused, \u201cIt is very difficult, I think, for a member of the public to look at what goes on in confirmation hearings these days, which is a very sharp conflict in political terms between Democrats and Republicans, and not think that the person who comes out of that process must similarly share that partisan view of public issues and public life.\u201dThose were accurate, if reductive, descriptions of the nominee\u2019s positions. The commercial was highly effective, capturing public attention, catching the Reagan administration flat-footed, and leaving Judge Bork\u2019s partisans crying \u201cunfair.\u201d In \u201cThe People Rising,\u201d an invaluable but sadly out-of-print chronicle of the Bork episode, the authors, Michael Pertschuk and Wendy Schaetzel, described the essence of the anti-Bork media strategy. The insight was that paid media would drive unpaid media: \u201cA news conference to announce the \u2018premiere\u2019 of an anti-Bork commercial starring Gregory Peck, for example, is certain to attract more press coverage, especially TV, than the release of a scholarly report on Bork\u2019s record (though the quality of the coverage may be inferior.)\u201d So does this summer\u2019s pro-Kavanaugh campaign simply even things up with the past generation\u2019s mother of all confirmation battles? While that\u2019s a superficially plausible takeaway, it seems to me that there\u2019s a difference between advocacy for and against a Supreme Court nominee, a difference that matters. In other words, in this commercial, Judge Kavanaugh is being held out as the designated hitter for a specific cause that is often before the court. We are invited to picture the nominee as having been sent zombielike out into the world with a single mission. Confirm him, we are told, so that the Supreme Court, after a decade of deadlock on the Second Amendment, can finally get the project of expanding gun rights moving again.Given the N.R.A.\u2019s participation in the many Second Amendment cases that reached the court \u2014 in recent years, unsuccessfully \u2014 I wondered whether this aggressive advocacy would impel Judge Kavanaugh to recuse himself from future gun-related cases. After soliciting some expert opinions, I\u2019m persuaded that\u2019s not the case. The problem is one of taste rather than ethics, the continued degradation of our judicial politics.Maybe I\u2019m a bit touchy about the N.R.A. because of its underappreciated role in recent Supreme Court nominations. It was in 2009, with President Obama\u2019s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, that the organization agreed to do a favor for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who was then the Senate\u2019s minority leader, and not only oppose Judge Sotomayor but \u201cscore\u201d the vote on her nomination. Advocacy groups \u201cscore\u201d a vote by adding it to the report card they put out at the end of a congressional session, showing at a glance whether a member of Congress was on or off the group\u2019s bus. While an N.R.A. score of 100 percent is vitally important in some parts of the country, the organization had never before scored a Supreme Court confirmation vote. But Senator McConnell needed the favor because, despite his public vow to make sure that President Obama accomplished as little as possible, it appeared that a good number of Republican senators were ready to vote for the appealing nominee with a compelling personal story. Following the N.R.A.\u2019s announcement, Republican support melted away, and only seven Republicans voted for Justice Sotomayor\u2019s confirmation. The scenario was repeated the next year, when the N.R.A. opposed Elena Kagan\u2019s nomination. Neither of President Obama\u2019s nominees had a record on guns that could have provided a principled reason for opposition; indeed, Elena Kagan, solicitor general of the United States and former dean of Harvard Law School, had never been a judge. Only five Republicans voted for her confirmation.Where will this end? Here\u2019s my fantasy, my fondest hope for rescuing the Supreme Court from the precipice over which the current confirmation process is pushing it. In Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing, scheduled to begin in less than three weeks, a senator will play the N.R.A. commercial. What do you think of this, the senator will ask the nominee, who will assume his most sincere expression and reply: \u201cI\u2019m Brett Kavanaugh and I disavow that commercial.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Infowars and China\u2019s Great Firewall", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello, readers! Greetings from Hong Kong. I\u2019m Li Yuan, Asia tech columnist, and it\u2019s my turn to write the newsletter. This week, the tech world on both sides of the Pacific got embroiled in the topic I\u2019m most passionate about: censorship. Allow me to indulge a bit.But as exhausting and exasperating as the debate about tech companies\u2019 role in policing content may be for many Americans, I often watch it with envy and wish we could have similarly vigorous discussions about free speech and due process in China.As many of you may know, China has the world\u2019s most sophisticated and brutal internet censorship system called the Great Firewall. Over the past decade, the Chinese government blocked Google, Facebook and Twitter, along with thousands of other foreign websites. In their places rose the homegrown search engine giant Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter called Weibo, and the Facebook-like app called WeChat. The government also carried out many crackdowns on tools that help circumvent the Great Firewall.I was surprised by the reactions (good and bad) to the column. Some readers were sarcastic. Not having access to Google, Facebook or Twitter? \u201cLucky them!\u201d wrote one Facebook user. \u201cThey have not missed anything important!\u201d said another.The point of the column wasn\u2019t about access to those websites, which, as flawed as they are, constitute much of the internet in many countries. It was about access to information and what happens when a government controls the flow of information.I\u2019m especially surprised that the column went viral on the Chinese internet. Censorship is a tired topic to many Chinese, who live it everyday. Since both The Times and its Chinese website are blocked in China, people made screenshots or PDF versions of the column, then posted it on social media timelines or shared it in chat groups. I posted the links on my Weibo account but the tweet got blocked quickly.\u201cAfter reading your article, I\u2019m very worried about China\u2019s future,\u201d a lawyer in Beijing messaged me. Her family has been using tools to bypass the Great Firewall for years. She said her son was considered \u201cweird\u201d by his high school classmates because he shared information he learned from some blocked foreign websites. Now he\u2019s studying at a college in the United States.\u201cHe had to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was too different.\u201dThere were some discussions about how representative the young people in my column were. Some readers, especially expats, said they know plenty of Chinese who scale the Great Firewall. Some of my closest Chinese friends also said they will have to send themselves into exile if the government blocks all censorship-bypassing tools. It will be the last straw for them.But outside of these circles, it\u2019s often a different picture. Some people \u2014 even those who have many ways to get out of the Great Firewall \u2014 decide to stay in and defend it.So my column wasn\u2019t just about the young generation of Chinese. It was about all Chinese who grew up without access to uncensored information. Once inside the wall, it\u2019s hard to escape because often you don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know.In other news this week:Advertisement"}

A spokeswoman for Warner Bros. did not respond on the record to questions about the film.Other critics have applauded the inclusion of cast members who are not of East Asian descent. The cast includes the Filipino-American actor Nico Santos, and Henry Golding, the male lead, who has an English father and a mother from Malaysia\u2019s Iban indigenous group.Some Singaporean writers said they feared the film would mirror the underrepresentation of minorities that already pervades local films and television shows.\u201cBut judging from the trailers, the browner Asian characters are predominantly guards and domestic workers and drivers,\u201d Mr. Ng said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of oppressive, don\u2019t you think?\u201dSingapore, a financial hub at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, is a former British colony that gained independence as part of Malaysia in 1963 and then split from Malaysia two years later. The city-state\u2019s governing party has never lost its hold on power, and the government controls the domestic news media.Even though Singapore\u2019s Chinese ethnic majority accounts for about three-quarters of the city-state\u2019s population, the government often goes to great lengths to promote interethnic harmony as a symbol of national identity.\u201cWe don\u2019t really have enough of a precolonial culture to celebrate \u2014 we\u2019re on Malay land, but most of us aren\u2019t Malay, and Chinese culture was a little too Communist-affiliated in the old days,\u201d Mr. Ng said. \u201cSo a multiracial concept of nationhood was kind of the obvious choice for us.\u201dMr. Bhargava said he had left feeling disgusted and had concluded that diversity in Singaporean films \u201ccomes down to playing stereotypes so the majority race can find it amusing.\u201d His post went viral and sparked a debate about ethnicity and diversity.But Mr. Mathews, who has studied race, religion and immigration in Singapore, played down the debate over ethnic representation in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d\u201cI think most fair-minded Singaporeans would see this film as a work of fiction and not expect a high level of realism and accuracy in cultural portrayals,\u201d he said in an email.The film\u2019s detractors disagree.\u201cWhen it comes to representation, what I would like to see as a Singaporean is something that reflects my country and society in all our diversity and complexity, and helps audiences make connections between our experiences and theirs,\u201d Ms. Han wrote in the essay.\u201c\u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 does nothing to improve the situation,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}

An acquaintance in the German government even called to warn her about a threatening conversation on an extremist message board, and to ask if she had personal security.\u201cI\u2019m normally a pretty brave person, but when you feel like you\u2019re in a fishbowl and you don\u2019t know who it is that\u2019s throwing rocks at you, it\u2019s disconcerting,\u201d Ms. Weaver, 53, said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if it\u2019s somebody sitting in his mother\u2019s basement in Florida or if it\u2019s a gun-happy white supremacist who hates you who lives a block away.\u201dThe messages were not sexually explicit, she said, but made her feel that \u201che really wanted to push a more personal relationship and had a hard time accepting the boundaries I had set.\u201d\u201cHe threw his shoulders back and stood at his largest and leaned into me, as if he was going to launch at me for having the audacity to run for office,\u201d Ms. Underwood said, adding that her supporter came to her defense.Harassment is not new for women in politics, or anywhere else \u2014 and men face it too, especially if they are African-American or Jewish. But for women, the harassment is ubiquitous and frequently sexualized, and it has come to the fore this election cycle, partly because so many women are running and partly because more of them are discussing their experiences.\u201cBeing in the room with all of those women that are having those same concerns as me made me feel so much saner,\u201d said Samantha Carrillo Fields, 31, a candidate for the Texas House, referring not only to safety but also to other forms of misogyny on the campaign trail. \u201cO.K., so this is real. What I\u2019m feeling is real. It was really nice having that validation.\u201dWhen Rebecca Thompson, a Democrat, ran for the Michigan House in 2014, strangers followed her home from events and drove slowly, repeatedly, past her house. At one point, someone broke into her car. By the end of the campaign, she said, she was sleeping at her partner\u2019s house because she was afraid to be in her own.\u201cI felt unsafe throughout the entire campaign,\u201d Ms. Thompson, 35, said. \u201cIt almost seemed like psychological warfare, like they were trying to psych me out. It kept me on edge all the time, because I just didn\u2019t know where I could go, anywhere in the city, without feeling like I was being followed.\u201dBut she was not comfortable speaking out then. \u201cI told myself I had to just suck it up \u2014 there\u2019s no crying in baseball; there\u2019s no crying in politics,\u201d she said. \u201cHad those things happened now, I do feel like I would have been empowered to speak up about them.\u201dYet even still, some candidates interviewed said initially that they had not been harassed \u2014 but then, when given examples like menacing social media messages, said yes, they had experienced those things. Just as many have observed in the #MeToo movement that a certain level of misogyny is so expected as to feel unremarkable, these candidates said they saw the messages as par for the course. \u201cIt becomes so normalized, the types of things that people say,\u201d said Mya Whitaker, 27, a Democrat running for City Council in Oakland, Calif. \u201cBeing a black woman and existing, in some cases, is enough to piss people off.\u201dA different kind of normalization happens at the other end of the spectrum, where the harassment is so vicious and constant that it overwhelms the ability to react.Many said it was a point of principle not to be intimidated into silence. Others said their political ideals were simply more important. \u201cFor good reason, there\u2019s never any shortage of telling stories about women being harassed on the campaign trail,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cBut I cannot communicate to you strongly enough: Over all, this job is fun. This job is exhausting, but this job is amazing.\u201dRepeatedly, she and others urged prospective candidates not to be deterred. Ms. Zegers said that was why she deleted sexist Facebook comments.\u201cA lot of women pay attention to my page,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that we show a good dialogue about the issues and we don\u2019t scare women away from running.\u201dThe government is still composed mainly of men who have never experienced sexual harassment, while \u201cfar too many women experience these things,\u201d Ms. Underwood said.

{"Headline": "Why Even a Blue Wave Could Have Limited Gains ", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe divergent geography of 2018 means we will really have two midterm elections, and one favors Republicans.Mr. Wasserman is the House editor at The Cook Political Report. The proper way to view the 2018 midterms might not be as one event, but as two very different elections playing out at once. It\u2019s almost Mars vs. Venus: The Senate hinges on red, rural states where Democrats are on defense. But the House will be decided by swing, suburban seats where Republicans are highly vulnerable. These radically different maps could produce dramatically divergent results \u2014 and make Congress even more toxic and adversarial in 2019. It's hard to believe, but true: If every state\u2019s and district\u2019s election results on Nov. 6 were a uniform eight-point swing in the Democrats\u2019 direction from the 2016 presidential result, Democrats would gain 44 House seats \u2014 almost twice the 23 they need to control the chamber. But with that same eight-point swing, the party would lose four Senate seats, leaving them six seats short of a majority.A bifurcation that extreme is highly unlikely, because a handful of incumbents are personally popular enough to defy their constituents\u2019 normal partisan preferences. For example, Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, and Representative John Katko, Republican of New York\u2019s 24th District, an upstate area around Syracuse, have cultivated strong, independent brands: In Mr. Tester\u2019s case, as a farmer who butchers his own meat; in Mr. Katko\u2019s case, as a tough-on-gangs prosecutor. The Cook Political Report rates both of them as favorites for re-election.But in an era characterized by declining rates of split-ticket voting and an enormous, growing urban vs. rural divide (by my math, in 2016, Donald Trump carried 76 percent of counties with a Cracker Barrel but 22 percent of counties with a Whole Foods Market), holdouts like Mr. Tester and Mr. Katko could be more the exception than the rule.This fall, Democrats are defending 26 Senate seats, with Bernie Sanders and Angus King (more than half of their caucus), including five seats that voted for President Trump by 19 points or more. Republicans are defending only nine seats (fewer than a fifth of their caucus); all but one are states Mr. Trump carried. But in the House, where all 435 seats are up for election, Republicans are much more exposed: They must defend 25 districts Hillary Clinton carried, whereas Democrats must defend only 13 seats Mr. Trump won. Democrats are defending 7 of 11 competitive Senate seats. Republicans hold 60 of 64 competitive House seats. The map excludes four House races \u2014 three in Pennsylvania, one in New Jersey \u2014 considered \u201ccertain flips.\u201dCOMPETITIVE RACES:11 SENATE SEATS64 HOUSE SEATSHeld by DemocratsHeld by DemocratsHeld by RepublicansHeld by RepublicansMT.N.D.OHIONEV.IND.W.VA.MO.TENN.ARIZ.TEXASFLA.COMPETITIVE RACES:11 SENATE SEATS64 HOUSE SEATSHeld by DemocratsHeld by DemocratsHeld by RepublicansHeld by RepublicansMT.N.D.OHIONEV.IND.W.VA.MO.TENN.ARIZ.FLA.TEXASBy The New York Times | Source: Cook Political ReportIn my time covering races professionally, I\u2019ve never observed this little overlap between the battlegrounds of high-stakes Senate and House races. Of the 64 most competitive House races, only 14 are in states with highly competitive Senate races.These are two truly different universes: The median competitive Senate seat gave Mr. Trump 56 percent in 2016, has a population density of 88 people per square mile and falls below the national average in educational attainment and income. But the median competitive House district gave Mr. Trump 49 percent of the vote, has a population density of 407 people per square mile and ranks above the national average in college graduates and income.Compared with House districts, voters in competitive Senate races are more pro-Trump, less urban, less college educated, whiter and poorer. Below is a profile of the strikingly different \u201cbaskets\u201d of voters in the most competitive Senate and House races \u2014 using the median (middle) of the 11 most competitive Senate races and the 64 most competitive House races, as designated by the nonpartisan newsletters The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections.U.S.OVERALLMEDIAN HOUSE SEATMEDIAN SENATE SEAT46%49%56%2016 Trump vote sharePercentage point difference from U.S.:+3+10\u20132%+4%\t+19%Trump marginvs. Clinton+6+2162%74%80%White share(non-hispanic)+18+1230%32%28%Percent with bachelor\u2019s degree (age 25+)+2\u20132Population density(people per squaremile)9040788Median income$55.3k$60.0k$50.4kU.S. OVERALLMEDIAN HOUSE SEATMEDIAN SENATE SEAT46%49%56%2016 Trump vote sharePercentage point difference from U.S.:+3+10\u20132%+4%\t+19%Trump vote marginvs. Clinton+6+2174%80%White share(non-hispanic)62%+18+12Percent with bachelor\u2019s degree (age 25+)30%32%28%+2\u20132407Population density(people per squaremile)9088Median house-hold income$55,322$60,003$50,433By The New York Times | Sources: The Cook Political Report; Inside Elections; 2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. Figures rounded to nearest whole number.Even if Democrats have a stellar year nationally, Democratic Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana could still fall short of re-election in states where the president is still popular.But the Republicans\u2019 tenuous grip on the House is exposing the limits of gerrymandering. Several seats Republican mapmakers drew to be \u201csafe\u201d at the beginning of the decade, including districts outside Atlanta, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City and Washington, are suddenly under stress from the combination of college-educated whites fleeing the new, Trump-led G.O.P. and the potential for a Democratic wave.Much as 2016 produced an anomalous split between the popular vote and the Electoral College, 2018 could produce a split decision between the House and Senate. That would allow both parties to claim a midterm mandate \u2014 and reinforce their stubbornness.Just imagine a Democratic House majority with subpoena power to investigate every office of the Trump administration serving alongside a Republican Senate majority at the ready to confirm all of the president\u2019s judicial and cabinet appointments. Moreover, consider that the likeliest members of both parties to be ousted in 2018 are moderates who have the most incentive to work across the aisle. That would make it even more difficult to get much done in 2019.The long-term danger: The two parties could become accountable to two almost entirely different sets of voters with boiling contempt for one another\u2019s politics and little understanding of one another\u2019s way of life. And of the two chambers, the Senate is the more unrepresentative. Advertisement"}

This is real. This is what it feels like.\u2019 And it just unleashed the floodgates.\u201dReaders were electrified by Mr. Styron\u2019s confession in part because he inhabited a storybook world of glamour. After his novel \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice\u201d was adapted into a blockbuster movie in 1982, Mr. Styron rocketed from mere literary success to Hollywood fame. Meryl Streep, who won an Oscar for playing Sophie, became a lifelong friend, adding to Mr. Styron\u2019s roster of illustrious buddies, from \u201cJimmy\u201d Baldwin to Arthur Miller. He appeared at gala events with his silver hair upswept in a genius-y pompadour and his face ruddy from summers on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. And yet he had been so depressed that he had eyed the knives in his kitchen with suicide-lust.James L.W. West, Mr. Styron\u2019s friend and biographer, told me that Mr. Styron had never wanted to become \u201cthe guru of depression.\u201d But after his article, he felt he had a duty to take on that role.His famous memoir of depression, \u201cDarkness Visible,\u201d came out in October 1990. It was Mr. Styron\u2019s curiosity about his own mind, and his determination to use himself as a case study to understand a mysterious disease, that gave the book its political power. \u201cDarkness Visible\u201d demonstrated that patients could be the owners and describers of their mental disorders, upending centuries of medical tradition in which the mentally ill were discredited and shamed. The brain scientist Alice Flaherty, who was Mr. Styron\u2019s close friend and doctor, has called him \u201cthe great god of depression\u201d because his influence on her field was so profound. His book became required reading in some medical schools, where physicians were finally being trained to listen to their patients.Mr. Styron also helped to popularize a new way of looking at the brain. In his telling, suicidal depression is a physical ailment, as unconnected to the patient\u2019s moral character as cancer. The book includes a cursory discussion of the chemistry of the brain \u2014 neurotransmitters, serotonin and so forth. For many readers, it was a first introduction to scientific ideas that are now widely accepted.The book benefited from perfect timing. It appeared contemporaneously with the introduction of Prozac and other mood-disorder medications with fewer side effects than older psychiatric drugs. Relentlessly advertised on TV and in magazines, they seemed to promise protection. And though Mr. Styron himself probably did not take Prozac and was rather skeptical about drugs, his book became the bible of that era.He also inspired dozens of writers \u2014 including Mr. Solomon and Dr. Flaherty \u2014 to chronicle their own struggles. In the 1990s, bookstores were crowded with mental-illness memoirs \u2014 Kay Redfield Jamison\u2019s \u201cAn Unquiet Mind,\u201d Susanna Kaysen\u2019s \u201cGirl, Interrupted\u201d and Elizabeth Wurtzel\u2019s \u201cProzac Nation,\u201d to name a few. You read; you wrote; you survived.It wouldn\u2019t last. In the summer of 2000, he crashed again. In the last six years of his life, he would check into mental hospitals and endure two rounds of electroshock therapy.Mr. Styron\u2019s story mirrors the larger trends in American mental health over the past few decades. During the exuberance of the 1990s, it seemed possible that drugs would one day wipe out depression, making suicide a rare occurrence. But that turned out to be an illusion. In fact, the American suicide rate has continued to climb since the beginning of the 21st century.With suicidal depression so widespread, we find ourselves needing new ways to talk about it, name its depredations and help families cope with it. Mr. Styron\u2019s mission was to invent this new language of survival, but he did so at high cost to his own mental health.When he revealed his history of depression, he inadvertently set a trap for himself. He became an icon of recovery. His widow, Rose Styron, told me that readers would call the house at all hours when they felt suicidal, and Mr. Styron would counsel them. He always took those calls, even when they woke him at 3 in the morning.And so, one dark day in the summer of 2000, he wrote up a statement to be released in the event of his suicide. \u201cI hope that readers of \u2018Darkness Visible\u2019 \u2014 past, present and future \u2014 will not be discouraged by the manner of my dying,\u201d his message began. It was an attempt to inoculate his fans from the downstream effects of his own self-destruction.Millions of people reacted to these two deaths with shock and sorrow. Mr. Bourdain\u2019s suicide seemed particularly unthinkable, because his TV shows and books celebrated his great talent for joy \u2014 his delight in everything from Thai street food to jiu-jitsu. Many of us who were Mr. Bourdain\u2019s fans struggled to understand the apparent paradox of his life-affirming mission and his terrible urge for extinction.Clearly, fame offers no protection from suicidal urges. And in many ways, it makes things worse. If you kill yourself, everyone will want to know why. Fans who love you will feel betrayed. Your suicide could traumatize them, in all kinds of ways.But it can work both ways. Mr. Styron discovered that he could use his fame and storytelling genius to bring people back from the brink of death. And he could give family members the language they needed to forgive, love and empathize.One man wrote to Mr. Styron about his son, who had \u201cended his life in a jump from a high-rise building in Palm Beach where he had recently begun his career as an aeronautical engineer.\u201d The father confessed that he and his wife had spent years \u201casking ourselves what we did wrong.\u201d But Mr. Styron\u2019s op-ed \u201cenabled me to look at the matter in a new light.\u201d The man had finally been able to forgive himself \u2014 at least a little bit \u2014 for his son\u2019s death.And so, happily \u2014 if such a story can be called happy \u2014 he did not have to use his suicide note in the way it was originally intended. Years later, the note became public, appearing in a posthumous collection of his letters. That note is now a treasure, in that it gives us a glimpse of Mr. Styron\u2019s mind as he was considering his final exit. Even lost in that deep darkness, he wanted to leave behind a message of hope and fellowship:\u201cEveryone must keep up the struggle, for it is always likely that you will win the battle and nearly a certainty you will win the war. To all of you, sufferers and nonsufferers alike, I send my abiding love.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Overdose Left Him With Brain Damage. Now What?", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "OpinionSupported byDr. Lamas is a pulmonary and critical care physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.NORTH ANDOVER, Mass. \u2014 It was a Sunday afternoon, and in the cozy house at the end of the street, Andrew Foote sat in his usual chair while a movie played on the television. The young man\u2019s hands rested on two pillows, wrists bent and fingers contracted into fists. From time to time, he rocked forward as if to stand but then collapsed backward, into the chair. His few words were slow and slurred. More than four years have passed since the overdose. For Andrew\u2019s parents, the fear that their son will die has now been replaced by a new set of realities and unanswerable questions: Is this a good life? Is he happy? What will happen to him when they grow old? Andrew was a golden child. He was the oldest of four, a high school football star who remained humble despite the trophies that decorated his room \u2014 now alongside a urinary catheter, pill boxes and equipment for his feeding tube. \u201cHow many touchdowns did you make in high school?\u201d his mother prompted. His long-term memory had remained relatively preserved, though it was hard for him to call up the words. As we waited, my gaze traveled to a framed collage of family photos. There was Andrew in his letterman\u2019s jacket, blond hair cut short, lips curled upward in a shy smile. He was still a handsome guy. Mrs. Foote took pride in this, but his expression had dimmed. \u201cSeventy?\u201d his mother asked again. \u201cSeventy-what?\u201d It was hard to understand Andrew\u2019s speech, but he gave what sounded like the answer. Seventy-eight touchdowns. (Then the eighth highest in Massachusetts history, his father, Lenny Foote, interjected.) The call came early one fall morning in 2014. No one knew how long Andrew had been alone after the overdose, but by the time someone found him, he\u2019d stopped breathing altogether. The doctors told the Footes that although their son\u2019s heart was beating, they worried that he would not live. He would need to be transferred to Boston, to a bigger hospital. He might not even survive the helicopter ride. At Andrew\u2019s bedside each day, the Footes watched their son\u2019s chest rise and fall with the ventilator, listening to the staccato of his heart-rate monitor and hoping for signs that he was in there somewhere. When he started to \u201cstorm\u201d as a result of his injured brain\u2019s inability to regulate his body \u2014 breathing rapidly, blood pressure and temperature soaring \u2014 they looked on helplessly. They could not yet wonder what the future might look like; all they could do was hope that their son would make it through the night.A few days in, the doctors explained to Mr. and Mrs. Foote that they had been feeding Andrew through a tube in his nose. His death was no longer an immediate threat, but he wasn\u2019t going to get better any time soon either and his doctors needed to consider a more permanent method of nutrition. This would mean a surgery to place a feeding tube directly into Andrew\u2019s stomach. This decision was meaningful, because it signaled a commitment to continuing aggressive care for a young man who might never again open his eyes. Andrew\u2019s parents grasped onto faith and the hope, however slim, that their son might improve. And they gave the O.K. Mrs. Foote, who had worked in special education before the overdose, became Andrew\u2019s 24-hour caregiver. \u201cAs long as he can stand and somewhat help me, I\u2019m not putting him in a nursing home,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even consider it.\u201d Mr. Foote returned to his work in the city Parks Department. Though they knew their son would never be the same, they were optimistic. So they sent him to outpatient therapy, fought with their insurance company when they were told he no longer qualified and scrambled until they were able to find a new brain injury program near home. Even so, as the years passed, the Footes watched their son lose gains he had made in the early days at rehab. Though they were told that this was the natural progression of his injury, it was hard to scale back and realize that this was it \u2014 he most likely would never eat on his own without a feeding tube, never be able to use his hands or to talk clearly. He had turned 29 a few days before I met him, a bittersweet milestone. He no longer had friends to celebrate a birthday with and though he didn\u2019t seem to mind, it was hard for Mrs. Foote to be reminded of time passing. Mr. Foote had recently stopped by a nursing facility, just to take a look. He was almost 60 with a new diagnosis of advanced melanoma. He knew that he and Linda wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of Andrew forever. They\u2019d promised each other that the responsibility would not fall to his siblings.But for the moment, their son was home. \u201cI remember driving into Boston and crying and crying and begging just to say one more word to him. I basically sold my soul,\u201d Mr. Foote said. \u201cAnd to me, this is my wish. I got my wish. So now I just have to do what I have to do.\u201d When I visited them it was still cooler out, and they were looking forward to when the weather would turn warm again. Linda and Lenny Foote would help their son onto the tandem bike they had bought, and maybe his father would ride with him or maybe one of his siblings would come over. He and his family could all watch television together, and Andrew still laughed at Adam Sandler, this great big belly laugh that made everyone around him smile. Though he occasionally grew frustrated by things he could not do, he appeared unaware of the magnitude of what he had lost.As our conversation wound to a close, Mrs. Foote sat down next to her son. She had a few questions for him, and she wanted me to hear his responses.\u201cAre you happy?\u201d she asked Andrew.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, slowly, drawing out the syllable. \u201cYou\u2019re happy that you\u2019re still here?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d he repeated. This was a more complicated question. Andrew paused, looked around him. He did not seem to know how to answer. He moved a bit in his chair. And he was quiet. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should I Flush It? Most Often, the Answer Is No", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt might seem harmless at first: a thread of dental floss tossed in the toilet, a contact lens swirling down the drain of the bathroom sink. But even the tiniest of items can contaminate waterways.Larger products like wipes and tampons are also clogging sewer systems, resulting in billions of dollars in maintenance and repair costs.Wondering what\u2019s safe to flush or wash down the drain? We spoke with several wastewater management experts who explained why many frequently disposed items belong in a garbage can, not the toilet.Many wipes claim on their packaging to be \u201cflushable,\u201d but almost all of them contain rayon or viscose, said Rob Vill\u00e9e, executive director of the Plainfield Area Regional Sewerage Authority in Middlesex, N.J.\u201cUnfortunately, the natural water bodies these get into do not have the heat or micro-organism levels to effectively degrade these,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is why we see rayon accumulating in the oceans.\u201dWhile toilet paper will break down in anywhere from a minute to four minutes, wipes take at least six hours to disintegrate, Mr. Vill\u00e9e said.Furthermore, the pumps at collection systems that move waste downstream to treatment plants cannot tear them apart.\u201cWe see pumps that are designed to pump up to half a million gallons a day clogging,\u201d Mr. Vill\u00e9e said. Now that wipes are used around the world, he added, \u201cit\u2019s a problem internationally.\u201dDental floss, which is usually made of nylon or Teflon, should also stay out of the toilet.\u201cIt seems like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just a little string,\u2019 but it tends to wrap things up,\u201d Mr. Vill\u00e9e said. \u201cIt\u2019ll collect other things and make kind of a big wad of stuff. It\u2019s incredibly strong.\u201dWhen contact lenses are flushed down the toilet or washed down the sink, they do not biodegrade easily. As a result, they may make their way into surface water, causing environmental damage, new research has shown.The lenses are also impervious to the bacteria that break down biological waste at treatment plants. When researchers at Arizona State University submerged contacts in chambers with the bacteria, they found that the lenses appeared intact seven days later.\u201cWe discourage any kind of plastics because it can make its way through a treatment plant and end up in the receiving water,\u201d said Vincent Sapienza, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.Contact lenses \u201chave densities similar to water, so they don\u2019t readily float or sink at wastewater treatment plants,\u201d he added, which means they are not captured and removed at the plant.It is often assumed that tampons can be flushed down the toilet, in part because they are so small. But their absorbent materials, including the string, do not break down easily: They cannot be processed by wastewater treatment centers, and can damage septic systems.\u201cIt\u2019s best to simply wrap a used tampon in toilet paper and toss it in the garbage or, if you\u2019re in a public washroom, place it in the waste receptacle for feminine hygiene products,\u201d Playtex says on its website.Wastewater treatment plants are not designed to filter out pharmaceuticals, so drugs that are disposed of in the toilet or the sink drain end up entering streams, rivers and lakes.The technology that would be required to remove pharmaceuticals from the water at treatment plants is cost-prohibitive, said Ed Gottlieb, the industrial pretreatment coordinator at the Ithaca Area Wastewater Treatment Facility. It is far cheaper to use take-back programs that collect unused medications before they enter the water supply, he added, because those cost only $2 to $5 for each pound of medication collected.\u201cThe amount of pounds they collect is phenomenal,\u201d Mr. Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge. And yet there are studies done that show only a very small percentage of what\u2019s out there is being collected.\u201dKitty litter will not dissolve in water and can create clogs, even if it is labeled flushable.\u201cCat litter is a preternaturally absorptive substance, apparently designed to expand to roughly 60,000 times its original volume in some horrible malignant process like cancer, only worse,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMolly\u2019s toilet resembled one of those baking-soda-and-vinegar volcanoes the dumb kids in middle school made every year for science fairs.\u201dCondoms should never be flushed.\u201cI\u2019ve heard condoms called sewer lilies because they fill with air or gas and float to the top,\u201d said Cynthia Finley, the director of regulatory affairs at the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.\u201cAs a society, I think we\u2019ve become more germophobic,\u201d she said, adding that there is a tendency to want to flush anything that has bodily fluids. But wastewater treatment plants are not designed to handle anything except for human waste and toilet paper, she said.Facial tissues might seem safe to flush because they look so much like toilet paper. But unlike toilet paper, facial tissues have been treated with a chemical binder that takes time to release and break apart when flushed, Ms. Finley said.Likewise, paper towels and cotton swabs are also formulated to stay intact.If you\u2019re not sure, follow a simple rule: If it is not human waste or toilet paper, it should not be disposed of in the toilet, Ms. Finley said.The cost of both drinking water and wastewater go into a water bill, said Mr. Sapienza, the New York environmental official. When cities have to send crews to unclog sewers or, in worst-case scenarios, replace them, the cost is passed down to everyone who gets a water bill, he added.A YouTube video created by the City of Spokane Department of Wastewater Management showed what happened when items like flushable wipes were agitated in water. The wipes did not disintegrate. Kitty litter remained a sandy wet mass. The dental floss spun and spun.\u201cIf you define flushable as \u2018Yes, it will go down the toilet,\u2019 then everything here is flushable,\u201d Tracy Stevens, a pretreatment technician, says in the video. If you define it as whether it will make it to the treatment plant, she added, some of the waste will and some will not.More important, the treatment plants are not equipped to process these products.If hundreds of thousands of people are flushing those items, \u201cthey\u2019re going to cause trouble,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Russian Money Ends Up in U.S. Elections", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica needs a new model of campaign finance not to supplant the political marketplace but to correct for its inadequacies. Mr. Bauer is a professor of practice and distinguished scholar in residence at New York University School of Law. This, then, is the state of campaign finance: a no-holds-barred competition that has proved irresistible to foreign state actors. With the collapse of the 1970s model of regulation, the question is what should take its place \u2014 and what role should the United States government play? In effect, where reform once aimed to have government structure campaign finance with comprehensive rules, we have something close to an unregulated political marketplace. There are benefits: innovation, as in the development of advanced technologies and new forms of organization. But there are also steep costs: Markets can fail, delivering well \u2014 especially for the affluent \u2014 on some but not all measures of democratic health and vibrancy, and opening up opportunities for new and dangerous sources of abuse such as the Russian electoral intervention of 2016. What remains of the old legal framework is largely a study in unintended consequences, such as the effect of restrictions on the political parties in weakening them and aiding the rise of the super PACs. The government\u2019s role in reform needs a reorientation. A better model for the times could be built by putting less emphasis on elaborate, restrictive and increasingly futile regulation and instead providing public resources \u2014 and where necessary, facilitating access to private funding \u2014 for critical electoral functions. The goal would not be to supplant the political market, but to correct for its inadequacies. For example, candidates for national office are now entirely dependent on private funding. The federal government once offered matching funds and grants for presidential campaigns, but public support withered. The sums available through this program dwindled, and as campaign costs soared, few candidates had any reason to elect this option over private fund-raising. In 1986, Congress eliminated a tax credit for small donations that had been in effect for 14 years and claimed by millions of taxpayers. The government has also ineffectively regulated the rates charged to candidates for television and cable advertising, which is a significant factor in the astronomic campaign costs that drive frenetic fund-raising. A refreshed reform initiative could include among its aims bringing these programs back to life. We often hear a simplistic objection to providing public resources in support of the democratic process: It\u2019s \u201cwelfare for politicians.\u201d The answer lies in a step-by-step approach of targeting public support for specific, vital electoral functions. Funding to safeguard the electoral process and replace voting machinery should enjoy bipartisan public support. Both parties would benefit from assistance in conducting voter registration programs and in sponsoring candidate debates. In addition to government assistance, in the form of cash grants or tax credits, the government could also channel private financing to achieve specific goals, such as through regulatory relief to facilitate the ability of particular political actors, like the parties, to finance specific activities and strengthen their position relative to the super PACs.There remains the hard task of devising transparency rules appropriate to the changing modes of spending to influence elections. Recent experience also underscores the need to shore up the ban on foreign-national spending to influence elections and the disclosure of foreign government programs that seek to influence United States government policy. But the government has the affirmative obligation to underwrite or facilitate the financing of certain basic costs of a functional, flourishing democracy. It cannot leave all of these expenses to the market and to the private contributors who make up so small a share of the population. And it should act now \u2014 before the United States is spending less than the Kremlin on our elections.

{"Headline": "In Virginia, Women Form an Insurgency to Try to Topple Republican Dave Brat", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIDLOTHIAN, Va. \u2014 The Liberal Women of Chesterfield County did not exist when Representative Dave Brat, propelled by Tea Party-infused energy, shocked the Republican establishment in 2014 and defeated the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a primary triumph here that presaged even greater political upheaval two years later.Now they\u2019re all up in his grill.Mr. Brat stunned Mr. Cantor, building an army of grass-roots supporters on the ground that was aided in the air by conservative commentators like Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin. Then he made waves of another kind last year, complaining to Republican supporters about women, their health care protests, and their dogged presence in his face.They haven\u2019t gone away. A race that was once considered solidly in the Republican camp is now rated a tossup, and the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County are stirring women to come out in such great numbers that the Democratic nominee, Abigail Spanberger, a well-credentialed former C.I.A. officer, may make history of a different sort in a district that has been deeply Republican for decades.\u201cRepublicans are now feeling like me when the Tea Party emerged,\u201d said Becky Stuart Conner, a member of the Chesterfield County group.For Republicans, Mr. Brat\u2019s race is a bulwark in their defensive perimeter, the kind of district they must win to keep control of the House. The area\u2019s mix of affluent suburbs and conservative rural stretches resembles the Ohio district where a Republican candidate in a House special election on Tuesday, Troy Balderson, clings to a narrow lead.For Democrats, Ms. Spanberger\u2019s candidacy represents a test of the breadth and effectiveness of their coalition of newly emboldened female voters aghast at President Trump\u2019s White House tenure \u2014 and the ability of fed-up women to build an insurgency of their own.\u201cI think it is ironic, humorous,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said of Mr. Brat being on the receiving end of a rebellion. \u201cI read it as a cautionary tale of coming into the scene saying you want to do things differently, and not really doing it differently.\u201dVirginia\u2019s Seventh Congressional District runs from the exurbs of Washington to counties south of Richmond, roughly tracking the decisive battles of the Civil War where Ulysses S. Grant ultimately defeated Robert E. Lee. In some of the more rural stretches, Confederate flags still hang from front porches.But far more common are the booming commercial and housing developments closer to Richmond that are eating into what was once a conservative redoubt. Two counties that hug the commonwealth\u2019s capital are likely to determine the outcome: Henrico, where Ms. Spanberger lives and which increasingly leans Democratic, and Chesterfield, a onetime Republican stronghold that is showing signs of change.Mr. Brat is hardly alone among Tea Party-aligned Republicans who are now in highly competitive races in Texas, California, Iowa, Pennsylvania, New York and other states where the swelling suburbs have chipped away at the rural Republican strongholds.\u201cRepublicans are in the same dilemma Democrats were in when people started to become a little dissatisfied with Barack Obama,\u201d said Quentin Kidd, the director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, which conducts surveys of Virginia voters. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get enough of the benefits of enthusiasm for Obama and couldn\u2019t get rid of enough of the baggage of Obama. This is amplified in the Trump era for Republicans.\u201dIn Virginia\u2019s Seventh District, many of the women have been engaged in their communities, through school groups and locally-based organizations, but are becoming involved in campaigns for the first time.\u201cThey are novices in politics but not novices in being organized and engaged,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said.Kim Drew Wright said after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, she posted on Facebook to find like-minded women in what came to be known as the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County. Her first meeting drew 100 women. Now the group has more than 3,000 members on its private Facebook page.They have fused social and political activities, with meetings called to write postcards for candidates over drinks or coffee, hat-knitting sessions, and broader-based activities to get out the vote broken down largely on a school-district level.\u201cIt brought us super local but made us realize how important it is to be connected,\u201d Ms. Wright said.Over dinner at the Shaved Duck, a restaurant that was not open when Mr. Brat was first elected, Ms. Stuart Conner said she was so shy that, at first, she could not bring herself to even attend a meeting. Now she finds herself working on the effort several days a week. Her friend and dinner companion, Kristi Glass, said that the group \u201creally got people together to get into politics instead of crying and drinking about the election.\u201dWhen Sara Gaborik, another group member, worked the polls at a recent local election, \u201cso many people said, \u2018I have never seen a Democrat here before,\u2019\u201d she recalled.Ms. Gaborik said she moved to the county from Richmond several years ago for the same reason so many other women have \u2014 for the schools and lower housing prices.\u201cA lot of folks in Chesterfield started saying, \u2018I am a Democrat, and I believe in progressive values,\u2019 and we started saying, \u2018There are more and more of us,\u2019\u201d she said.Along with other women, group members have gone to events for Mr. Brat and tried to get in his grill.\u201cI give them credit for putting a target on Dave Brat\u2019s back,\u201d Mr. Kidd said.Mr. Brat no longer widely publicizes campaign events, instead requiring that people sign up in advance. He declined several requests for an interview.Ms. Ingraham said in an email that it was \u201ccritical\u201d that Mr. Brat \u201cstay close to the people \u2014 addressing their needs, listening to their concerns and answering their questions. Cantor lost because he ended up identifying more with the Swamp than the Seventh District.\u201dLike many new Democratic candidates, Ms. Spanberger has tried to inoculate herself against Republican assertions that she is a liberal in the mold of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader. Ms. Spanberger said that \u201cunder no circumstances would I vote for her to be speaker.\u201d She also points to her background tracking terrorists for the C.I.A. and her work on drug and money-laundering cases in law enforcement.Still, Mr. Brat has a reserve of strength and not simply from the more zealous who helped him defeat Mr. Cantor. He also has history on his side; Republicans have held the seat since 1970.At the Chesterfield farmer\u2019s market, the two women watching over the master gardener table showed how close the contest could be. Susan Oakley said she would back Mr. Brat because of his hard line on illegal immigration and his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s wall along the southern border. Marti Miller said she was considering Ms. Spanberger.\u201cThere is so much anger and viciousness in our politics today,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to see civility.\u201dLast Thursday night, more than 80 people came to meet Ms. Spanberger at a winery in Spotsylvania County. Several of them said that they were heartened to finally see a credible Democratic candidate, and that they were finally becoming comfortable letting their Democratic identity be known to their neighbors.\u201cIt\u2019s fun to find my peeps,\u201d said Tracy Jacobson, who moved to Virginia recently from Illinois. \u201cIt feels a little lonely being here.\u201dErin Sherwood, who said she was weary of the divisive words coming from Mr. Trump and Mr. Brat, summed up the feelings of many of the women in the district.\u201cWe feel the change coming,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.On both sides, the spat is vintage Trump: tawdry, cruel, vindictive and highly personal. That said, this is about more than a petty feud with a former aide who famously shares Mr. Trump\u2019s love of chaos, confusion and high drama. It is also a glaring reminder of one of this president\u2019s central failings as a leader: his disastrous judgment when choosing people with whom to surround himself.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump ran as a savvy outsider who knew how to get things done. His leadership acumen and gut instincts would enable him to hire all \u201cthe best people\u201d to help him run the country. The approach had worked in real estate. It was the core conceit of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d What could possibly go wrong?As it turns out, everything. As observers of real life as opposed to scripted television might have foreseen, Mr. Trump has proved wildly incompetent when it comes to matters of personnel. And while this occasionally results in some entertaining face plants, his failure has potentially serious repercussions for the nation. Take the case of Ms. Manigault Newman. In addition to whatever self-serving mischief she may have wrought during her time as a highly paid presidential adviser, she liked to make surreptitious recordings of private conversations, even in secure areas of the White House where personal recording devices are strictly prohibited. No matter how Ms. Manigault Newman may feel about this administration and its lack of truthfulness, compromising national security in order to cover one\u2019s backside is still a no-no. Answer: Precisely the kind whose primary client would be Donald J. Trump.Even if you grade on the Trumpian curve of loyalty matters above all else, Mr. Trump has repeatedly failed. These people are all grifters. Mr. Trump just assumed they were his grifters. Surrounding oneself with smart, competent, preferably noncorrupt people is important for any president. The job is too big for even the most gifted leader to handle alone. But for a president with no relevant experience in, knowledge of or identifiable interest in what the job entails, it is all the more vital. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he has a keen eye for talent, like so many of his other promises, turned out to be a mix of alternative facts and hot air. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stormy Daniels, Feminist Hero ", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor once we\u2019re listening to a woman who refuses to wear either a scarlet letter or a superwoman\u2019s cape.Ms. Filipovic is the author of \u201cThe H Spot: The feminist Pursuit of Happiness.\u201dLet\u2019s take a moment for Stormy Daniels. It\u2019s an extraordinary admission, and an extraordinary political moment \u2014 not just because of what it means for Mr. Trump. It marks an unanticipated feminist turning point. Ms. Daniels is an adult film star and, like the president, an unapologetic self-promoter. Hers is not a female archetype that has historically garnered much respect, trust or sympathy. Yet here she is, an imperfect, entirely self-possessed woman telling her story with clarity and without shame. And here we are, actually listening to her. Mr. Trump\u2019s own incompetence, inexperience and misogyny didn\u2019t stop his ascent to the White House; neither could a woman who spent her life cultivating capability, expertise and political pedigree. The usual rules don\u2019t seem to apply to Mr. Trump. And under the usual rules, a woman who so thoroughly breaks norms of female decorum and political propriety would be shamed into silence. Ms. Daniels is a sex worker, making her the kind of \u201cbad woman,\u201d scorned for her work, who is not often believed when she indicts a powerful man. The threat is that Mr. Giuliani would do to Ms. Daniels what lawyers have done for centuries to imperfect women (and in particular, rape victims): Humiliate them on the witness stand by suggesting their sexual histories render their testimony unreliable and their credibility questionable. Mr. Giuliani contrasted Ms. Daniels with the three \u201cbeautiful women, classy women, women of great substance\u201d who Mr. Trump has married, perfectly encapsulating the profoundly misogynist virgin/whore dichotomy imposed on women, where we can be only perfectly good or entirely bad. A woman who behaved like the thrice-married and affair-prone Mr. Trump \u2014 going on the radio to brag about her promiscuity, leaking sordid details about her sex life to the tabloids \u2014 would be unlikely to fall in the \u201cvirgin\u201d category. But men don\u2019t have to navigate these poles at all. It would be hard to invent two people who better encompass one of the longest-standing sexist double standards than Ms. Daniels and Mr. Trump. But Ms. Daniels also undercuts liberal impulses to turn her into an oversimplified feminist hero. She is a vastly imperfect person by any standard, at times brave and at times venal, obviously admirable and obviously self-interested. These complications, of course, exist in most human beings. But most human beings could not survive the scrutiny she is under, nor so deftly dodge efforts at simplistic caricature. What\u2019s incredible is to see Ms. Daniels embody so many human extremes \u2014 so much boldness, so many flaws, and so many taboos broken \u2014 and to see her story nonetheless believed and acted upon.Mr. Trump has built his image on gold-plated decadence and acts of dominance and degradation; in a sexist society, money and power continue to be the blunt masculine equivalents of the more enigmatic female sex appeal (which itself is largely measured and rewarded by men). There\u2019s little cost to men flaunting their wealth as extravagantly as Mr. Trump has. Women who have affairs with married men, whether those women are Ms. Daniels or Mr. Trump\u2019s second wife, are held more culpable as seductresses than the men who, like Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, actually broke their vows. But it\u2019s women who cross the line from looking sexy for pay to having sex for pay, like Ms. Daniels, who face the most judgment. The men who pay for it, or pay to watch it, are generally unremarkable. We are far from transcending the pervasive assumption that a woman\u2019s sexual decisions are decisive of her character and her integrity. In many swaths of the country, Ms. Daniels continues to be written off as a pole-dancing Hester Prynne \u2014 a woman not to be trusted. But the country is also watching her dogged refusal to be quiet and her unflagging insistence that she isn\u2019t the one who should be embarrassed. We\u2019re seeing a woman who refuses to wear either a scarlet letter or a superwoman cape, and she stands in sharp contrast to a self-aggrandizing president who may face serious consequences once this all unspools. The potential triumph of a deeply imperfect woman over a powerful man won\u2019t exactly break a glass ceiling. But it could put a little crack in a stereotype just as tough to shatter.

{"Headline": "A House Built on Family and Dungan Food in Brooklyn", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City10 Photos\u201cDungan cuisine\u201d says the sign, without fanfare, on a drowsing street. The address is just off Sheepshead Bay Road, not far from the waterfront in southern Brooklyn. Once the space was home to an Azerbaijani restaurant, one of many outposts in the neighborhood with roots in the former Soviet Union.Now it is Lagman House, likely the first and only restaurant in the city to offer the food of the Dungans, Chinese Muslims descended from seventh-century Arab and Persian Silk Road traders who married Han Chinese. In the late 19th century, thousands of them fled China after the government\u2019s brutal suppression of a Muslim uprising. Ten million lives were lost, one of history\u2019s highest wartime death tolls.The Dungans\u2019 escape route went through the Tien Shan mountains in deep winter; many died on the snowy passes. On the other side lay Imperial Russia, where they found refuge in what is today Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Among them were the great-grandparents of Damirzhan Azimov and his wife, Gulshat Azimova, who grew up in the village of Zhalpaktobe in southern Kazakhstan, immigrated to the United States in 2012 and opened Lagman House in June.This is how the world unfolds in New York City: Turn a corner, and there\u2019s a portal to another hemisphere, a glimmer of a different life.To make lagman, or la mian in Chinese (both names appear on the menu), Ms. Azimova rolls out long snakes of dough. These are coiled and slicked with oil, stretched thin, then thinner still, and looped around the backs of the hands, like the preliminaries to cat\u2019s cradle. They emerge from the pot taut and pliant at once.The noodles recur throughout the meal, first in ashlyanfu, a cool salad that juxtaposes springy lagman with slippery blocks of green-bean jelly, kin to Chinese liang fen and ready to wobble off the plate. The remaining ingredients \u2014 shredded omelet, fried beef and fastidiously partitioned tomato, cucumber, bell peppers and celery \u2014 are to be tossed at will with the condiments: garlic steeped in vinegar and hot oil, and chile like scarlet gunpowder.This might be followed by thon lamian, noodles in a ruddy beef-bone broth crowded with napa cabbage, green beans and fat thumbs of daikon radish. And classic lamian, in which beef and onions, quickly fried, are tipped over noodles like a rag\u00f9; the juices run down, but mixing is up to you.Ban thon is a soup whose noodles are mere scraps, made by rubbing the dough between the palms. \u201cLike you rub your hands when you\u2019re cold,\u201d explained Ali Azimov, 19, the second-oldest son, who oversees the dining room. Rough teardrops of dough fall into the boiling stock; they\u2019re more erratic in density, and chewier.For beshbarmak, a dish borrowed from the Dungans\u2019 Central Asian neighbors, the noodles are broad, rumpled kerchiefs, topped by fuller cuts of beef with generous margins of fat. (\u201cBack in Kazakhstan, they eat it with horse meat,\u201d Ali said.)Meat, while a constant, often seems secondary. The exception is huashi, a soup that showcases six types of meatballs, all giants of their kind. The baseline version is simply well-seasoned ground beef, quietly dripping and seething. Others take on coats: a haphazard quilting of rice, dried celery with its whiff of hay, and scrambled egg, a golden mantle. Two are shaped not like meatballs at all, but cinnamon rolls, layered with beef and omelet \u2014 one with yolks, the other only whites.Elsewhere is bread, pale, torqued fistfuls of jin momo, steamed and spongy, contracting and rebounding in the hand. Rice is meant to be eaten with rich hashes of vegetables (and beef, again in a supporting role) called \u201cgravies,\u201d including Chinese chives gone dark as jade, under a tumble of scrambled eggs, and bell peppers mobbed by long green chiles, half mellow and half stingers.The dining room is lit by Edison bulbs dangling from ropes in chandeliers like a ship\u2019s rigging. All the Azimov children (save for Deniza, at 7 the youngest) pitch in as needed: Daniyar, 23 and the eldest, cooks and, alongside Ali, fields diners\u2019 questions; when not in school, Almukhamad, 15, buses tables and Ruzana, 13, sometimes washes a dish or two.For dessert, there might be sanzi, which calls to mind a reeled-in lasso, ossified: skinny plaits of dough two feet long, doubled back on themselves and fried hard. They are noodles, of course, long as life. You snap them apart, piece by piece.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the Azimovs\u2019 15-year-old son. He is Almukhamad, not Alhmukhamad.Advertisement"}

All these socialists coming out of the woodwork must have them in quite a lather. So I write today with some friendly advice for the capitalist class about said socialists.You want fewer socialists? Easy. Stop creating them.Every once in a while in history, cause and effect smack us in the face. The conditions under which the czars forced Russians to live gave rise to Bolshevism. The terms imposed at Versailles fueled Hitler\u2019s ascent. The failures of Keynesianism in the 1970s smoothed the path for supply-side economics.You\u2019ve seen the United States go from being a country that your parents \u2014 or if you\u2019re 28, more likely your grandparents \u2014 described as a place where life got better for every succeeding generation to a place where for millions of people, quite possibly including you, that\u2019s no longer true.I could go on like this for 20 paragraphs. Many more, in fact. But you get the idea. Back in the days when our economy just grew and grew, we had a government and a capitalist class that invested in our people and their future \u2014 in the Interstate highways, the community colleges, the scientific research, the generous federal grants for transportation and regional development.During this time and into the Reagan era, the broader American left \u2014 defined not by party but by belief \u2014 played a constructive role in supporting civil rights, opposing the Vietnam War and doing what it could to fight the new concentration of wealth. But, with the Cold War raging, its numbers were small and its influence negligible. I have mixed feelings about this socialism boomlet. It has yet to prove itself politically viable in general elections outside a handful of areas, and by 2021 we could wake up and see that it\u2019s been a disaster for Democrats. But I understand completely why it\u2019s happening. Given what\u2019s been going on in this country, it couldn\u2019t not have happened. And if you\u2019re a capitalist, you\u2019d better try to understand it, too \u2014 and do something to address the very legitimate grievances that propelled it.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s no good solution, but this time democracy must prevail over justice.Mr. Casta\u00f1eda was foreign minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.Mr. da Silva\u2019s supporters and he have argued that he leads in the polls; that he is being barred from running because of a relatively minor corruption charge, based on confessions obtained through plea bargaining, which he and many jurists dispute; and that the Brazilian judicial system, thanks to a series of anti-corruption laws against the ineffectiveness of existing regulations, has become the arbiter of the country\u2019s elections.Allowing Lula to run would placate his backers, who are many, but severely weaken the sense that after almost two centuries of privilege, corruption, the absence of equal laws for everybody and the fall of the high and mighty, Brazil was finally entering modernity in a domain where the country and its neighbors have always fared worst: the rule of law. But denying tens of millions of Lula\u2019s constituents the possibility of voting their idol back into the Planalto presidential palace would almost imply disenfranchising them. As in Brazil, many of these cases \u2014 not all, obviously \u2014 are tricky. Some contenders are disqualified for valid reasons, or at least lawful ones. Others are unquestionable victims of political persecution. It is hard to dispute the notion that Lula\u2019s case tends to fall into the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan categories, rather than the others. Except that Brazilian democracy is not collapsing, demonstrators are not being murdered in the streets, students are not being jailed, and the media is not muzzled. As The Economist regretted a few months back, there may be government by judges in Brazil, but not a dictatorship.In the end, though I believe that the Lava Jato scandal, as well as the diligence of judges like Mr. Moro, have served Brazil and Latin America well, I prefer to see Lula on the ballot than in jail. The charges brought against him are too flimsy, the purported crime so petty (until now), the sentence so brazenly disproportionate and the stakes so high that in Latin America today, democracy should trump \u2014 so to speak \u2014 the rule of law. In an ideal world, the two go together and certainly do not clash with each other. In Brazil, they do. I\u2019ll go with democracy, warts and all. Jorge G.

It\u2019s really the caliber of appointment we were all hoping for.\u201dWell, not everyone. From other corners of the city artists and art professionals have been quick to voice concern that Mr. Biesenbach, who enjoys collaborating with pop-culture royalty like Tilda Swinton, Bj\u00f6rk and James Franco, will reprise some of the blunders of Jeffrey Deitch\u2019s short-lived, celebrity-studded (Mr. Franco and Dennis Hopper both had shows) tenure as MOCA director from 2010 to 2013.At a time when leading museums are trying to diversify their staffs and audiences alike, some critics here also noted that Mr. Biesenbach is another white male director in a long line of white men since the museum\u2019s founding in 1979.\u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face to the L.A. art world: a great disappointment, a missed opportunity of epic scope,\u201d Shana Nys Dambrot, the arts editor of LA Weekly, posted on Facebook. \u201cThey (the Board) have apparently learned nothing from the sketchy performances of their string of (only) white men (largely) imported from New York, like we need to be saved from ourselves. No qualified LA-based professionals? No women, people of color \u2026? No understanding of this cultural moment, certainly.\u201dThe artist Max Maslansky, responding to this reporter on Facebook, criticized the hire as the museum again \u201ckowtowing to celebrity-culture-oriented arts administrators, who still see L.A. as a provincial outpost ripe for international transformation from the outside, as if its native arts culture needs an upgrade.\u201dMr. Biesenbach, known as an advocate for new ideas and emerging artists, has had a long and largely successful run at MoMA PS1, starting at the smaller institution in 1995, when it was an artistic laboratory called the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center. (It became an affiliate of The Museum of Modern Art in 2000). At MoMA, he organized the landmark show \u201cPipilotti Rist: Pour Your Body Out (7354 Cubic Meters)\u201d in 2008 and Marina Abramovic\u2019s giant retrospective \u201cThe Artist is Present\u201d in 2010, before his Bj\u00f6rk survey in 2015 prompted intense backlash.Reached by phone in New York, Mr. Biesenbach acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t a great comparison. \u201cWhat I wanted to say is that as a curator I follow the artists, and I have the impression that L.A. is the new center for emerging artists because of affordable studios.\u201dHe also maintained that it was a mistake to think his focus is celebrity or pop culture. \u201cI think my legacy at MoMA has different chapters; I work in series,\u201d he said, describing a series on Mexico City, another on large-scale video and a recent program on Puerto Rico. Just one of them, he said, was devoted to \u201cpeople who work between media, like Tilda, Bj\u00f6rk and Antony and the Johnsons. It was an experiment. I\u2019m not planning on repeating exhibitions.\u201dMs. Hebron said that she was an early fan of Mr. Biesenbach\u2019s video and performance program at MoMA PS1. \u201cI\u2019m not bothered by his flashiness and think some of his programs have been interesting,\u201d she said.

Mr. Biesenbach said that the chief curator hire would not be his first step. \u201cI\u2019m very mindful of the need for diversity on the staff.

{"Headline": "The Catholic Church Is Sick With Sex ", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside of condemning adulterous behavior, Christ never said anything about whom you could love. Contributing Opinion Writer One pope was a father of 10 through multiple mistresses, a man who purchased the papacy with mule-loads of silver. It is said that Alexander VI, the most debauched of the Borgia pontiffs, elected in 1492, even had an affair with one of his daughters.Another pope contracted syphilis during his reign \u2014 a \u201cdisease very fond of priests, especially rich priests,\u201d as the saying went in Renaissance times. That was Julius II, known as \u201cIl terrible.\u201d A third pope, Pius IX, added Flaubert\u2019s \u201cMadame Bovary\u201d and John Stuart Mill\u2019s book on the free market economy to the Vatican\u2019s List of Prohibited Books during his long reign in the 19th century. He also formalized the doctrine of papal infallibility.What these Holy Fathers had in common was not just that they were badly flawed men putting forth badly flawed ideas: At the root of their moral failings is Catholicism\u2019s centuries-old inability to come to grips with sex. I say this as a somewhat lapsed, but certainly listening, Catholic educated by fine Jesuit minds and encouraged by the open-mindedness of Pope Francis. The big issue behind the budding civil war in a faith of 1.3 billion people \u2014 a rift that could plunge the church back into a medieval mind-set on sexuality \u2014 is the same old thing. And most of the church\u2019s backward teachings, dictated by nominally celibate and hypocritical men, have no connection to the words of Jesus. If you\u2019re going to strike at a pope, to paraphrase the line about taking down a king, you must kill him. Right-wing Catholics, those who think allowing gay members of the faith to worship with dignity is an affront to God, have just taken their best shot at Francis. The attempted coup was disguised as an expos\u00e9 by a conscience-stricken cleric, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2. He claims that the pope must resign because he knew about the sexual abuse of young seminarians by a disgraced cardinal and did not defrock the predator. That instructive was issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, designed to do to heretics what the Inquisition once did, without the stake-burning. The bishop\u2019s letter cites Old Testament sanctions against \u201csodomites\u201d and a New Testament interpretation from St. Paul, who admitted he was not speaking with direct authority from the divine. St. Augustine, who loved sex and had plenty of it before he hated it, set the church template in the fifth century, saying, \u201cMarriage is only one degree less sinful than fornication.\u201dWhat\u2019s missing from these puritanical pronouncements, from then till now, is the figure at the center of the faith. That\u2019s because, outside of condemning adulterous behavior, Christ never said anything about whom you could love. Nothing about homosexuals. Nothing about priestly celibacy or barring women from clerical ranks, for that matter.Last year, while walking the thousand-year-old Via Francigena, I came upon many Catholics along that pilgrim\u2019s path to Rome excited about the fresh air blowing through a Vatican that hadn\u2019t opened a window in decades. The only cloud over these spiritual sojourners was the constant news about criminal clergy. The conservatives would do nothing to fix this, but would make the church a global pariah. The old guard is infuriated by statements like the one Pope Francis made on Sunday. When asked how a parent should treat a gay child, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t condemn, have dialogue, listen.\u201dThe way out of the present crisis is more light, less darkness and a few bold and dramatic moves. For starters, clerics should not be judging other clerics; let lay members, women and men, conduct the investigations.Priestly celibacy should be optional. It\u2019s an anachronism, certainly not one of the \u201cinfallible\u201d truths, and may be one of the main reasons pedophilia is thick in clerical ranks. For the first thousand years of the church, married men could become priests, as they still can in the Greek Orthodox faith. Women should be priests. Duh. When asked about this, Francis said only men could serve because Jesus chose only men as his apostles. This logic is flawed, as Jesus also chose Jews, and you don\u2019t see a lot of them being invited into the priesthood.Advertisement"}

He\u2019s now one of six Republicans competing in a primary on Tuesday. But there is good reason to believe that Mr. Friess\u2019s campaign \u2014 aided by many of the politicians and groups he has donated to generously over the years \u2014 is now in a much-improved position to win the Republican nomination in his very Republican state, all but ensuring he would be elected governor in November.On Tuesday morning, the president weighed in with his own endorsement. Mr. Friess \u201cwill be a fantastic governor!\u201d he tweeted.In Wyoming, the state Mr. Trump won by a larger margin than any other, that may prove meaningful.It also doesn\u2019t hurt that he has been spending a lot of his own money on advertising and get-out-the vote operations, helping raise his profile in a state where many know him only as a transplant who moved Jackson, the state\u2019s billionaires\u2019 playground. Mr. Friess, who is 78 and has faced criticism that he is using his out-of-state Beltway connections to effectively buy an election, spoke with The New York Times about his campaign and whether he is a good fit for this moment when Republican voters are rejecting anyone they perceive as too cozy with the \u201celite.\u201dThe following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.Q. Hi, Mr. Friess. How are you?It wasn\u2019t I wanted to be the next governor of Wyoming. I just wanted to contribute to make Wyoming a wonderful place. We absolutely love this place, and now we have a half-billion-dollar deficit. And a lot of the elite here are treating my money, our money, the welders\u2019 money, the carpenters\u2019 money, nurses\u2019 money, truck drivers\u2019 money, as if it\u2019s Monopoly money.Almost all of my aunts and uncles lived to be over 100. So I\u2019m ready to go.You mentioned \u201cthe elite.\u201d Given your background and your success, don\u2019t you worry people will say, \u201cNo, he\u2019s one of the elite.\u201dMy mom and brother and I would go into the basement and butcher a couple dozen chickens every few months, put them in the freezer. And then a few days later get a couple bushels of corn. Because my mom said we can\u2019t afford any of that expensive store-bought food. So I\u2019ve always been the little guy.I really had a very special moment on the campaign trail where I went into a shop where there were eight welders. And they took a picture of me. And I had my white, white shirt on and next to me were the grimy, sooty guys who had been welding all day. And it just kind of clicked that these are the guys I\u2019d want on my unofficial governor\u2019s expense review board. Every time I see an expense I can impact, I\u2019m going to ask myself, \u201cWhat would my welder friends do?\u201dI think on something so complicated as tariffs, there\u2019s gonna be pluses and minuses. I think what his intent was to get us in a situation where we\u2019re not taken advantage of by other countries because of the mismatches.Whatever those inconsistencies are, as you go about correcting them, there\u2019s gonna be some glitches. Look what happened when we got rid of the monopoly of AT&T to switch to cellphones. You and I are talking on cellphones. Had we not deregulated AT&T, would we not be doing that? Sure, we have to be sensitive. And I think he\u2019s tried to accommodate that by giving subsidies in places. But bottom line, it\u2019s the whole thrust of he\u2019s going to renegotiate these deals.You\u2019ve got the endorsement of Donald Trump Jr. How useful is it to have the Trump name behind you? He ended the war on coal. Secondly, he said we\u2019re going to start saying Merry Christmas again. And Wyoming has a lot of people who are very enamored with the basic, fundamental underpinnings of our society and culture, which is the fact that Christian values are much of why our country is great. Here in Wyoming we are so, so proud of a president who puts America first.You mentioned that values, Christian values in particular, are important. Some people inside the Republican Party have criticized it for only talking to itself and said it needs to do a better job of being more inclusive. Do you think that\u2019s fair?I think that\u2019s about as deep a pile of hogwash as you can run into. The Republican Party has got Marco Rubio and (Ted) Cruz from a Cuban background. We\u2019ve got Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal from an Indian background. We\u2019ve got Tim Scott; the blacks. So as I walk around the country, I see more and more people gravitating to the common-sense love that Donald Trump has for America. And they love America, too.You think Donald Trump is a lover, not a hater or a fighter?Well, I think he hates evil. When people try to take people\u2019s freedom of expression and freedom of their religious beliefs, I\u2019m sure he hates that. But boy, there\u2019s no question that he loves America. Do you think though that there\u2019s any validity to the notion that some people in this country \u2014 black, brown, immigrant, gay, lesbian \u2014 may not feel welcome in Donald Trump\u2019s America?They may feel that. but then you should probably ask why? The unemployment for blacks is now the lowest it\u2019s ever been. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The \u2018Zombie Gene\u2019 That May Protect Elephants From Cancer", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterWith such enormous bodies, elephants should be particularly prone to tumors. But an ancient gene in their DNA, somehow resurrected, seems to shield the animals.Elephants ought to get a lot of cancer. They\u2019re huge animals, weighing as much as eight tons. It takes a lot of cells to make up that much elephant. All of those cells arose from a single fertilized egg, and each time a cell divides, there\u2019s a chance that it will gain a mutation \u2014 one that may lead to cancer.Vincent J. Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the paper, published in Cell Reports, said that understanding how elephants fight cancer may provide inspiration for developing new drugs.\u201cIt might tell us something fundamental about cancer as a process. And if we\u2019re lucky, it might tell us something about how to treat human disease,\u201d Dr. Lynch said.Scientists have puzzled over cancer, or the lack thereof, in big animals since the 1970s. In recent years, some researchers have started carrying out detailed studies of the genes and cells of these species, searching for unexpected strategies for fighting the disease.Some of the first research focused on a well-studied anticancer gene called p53. It makes a protein that can sense when DNA gets damaged. In response, the protein switches on a number of other genes. A cell may respond by repairing its broken genes, or it may commit suicide, so that its descendants will not have the chance to gain even more mutations.Both teams observed that the elephant\u2019s swarm of p53 genes responds aggressively to DNA damage. Their bodies don\u2019t bother with repairing cells \u2014 they only orchestrate the damaged cell\u2019s death.Dr. Lynch and his colleagues continued their search for cancer-fighting genes, and they soon encountered another one, called LIF6, that only elephants seem to possess.In response to DNA damage, p53 proteins in elephants switch on LIF6. The cell makes LIF6 proteins, which then wreak havoc.Dr. Lynch\u2019s experiments indicate that LIF6 proteins make their way to the cell\u2019s tiny fuel-generating factories, called mitochondria. The proteins pry open holes in the mitochondria, allowing molecules to pour out. The molecules from mitochondria are toxic, causing the cell to die.\u201cThis adds an important piece to the puzzle,\u201d said Dr. Joshua D. Schiffman, a pediatric oncologist at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah who has also studied cancer in elephants. More experiments are needed to confirm that LIF6 works the way Dr. Lynch and his colleagues propose, Dr. Schiffman added. \u201cAs a start, I think this is fantastic,\u201d he said.LIF6 has a bizarre evolutionary history, as it turns out.All mammals carry a similar gene, simply called LIF. In our own cells, it performs several different jobs, such as sending signals from one cell to another. But almost all mammals \u2014 ourselves included \u2014 have only one copy. The only exceptions to that rule are elephants and their close relatives, such as manatees, Dr. Lynch and his colleagues found. These mammals have several copies of LIF; elephants have ten.These copies arose thanks to sloppy mutations in the ancestors of manatees and elephants more than 80 million years ago. These newer copies of the original LIF gene lack a stretch of DNA that acts as an on-off switch. As a result, the genes could not make their proteins. (Humans also carry thousands of copies of so-called pseudogenes.) After the ancestors of elephants evolved ten LIF genes, however, something remarkable happened: One of these dead genes came back to life. That gene is LIF6.Somewhere in the course of elephant evolution, a cellular mutation inserted a genetic switch next to LIF6, enabling the gene to be activated by p53. The resurrected gene now made a protein that could do something new: attack mitochondria and kill damaged cells. To find out when the LIF6 gene first came back to life, the researchers took a close look at DNA retrieved from fossils. Mastodons and mammoths also carried LIF6. Scientists estimate that they shared a common ancestor with modern elephants that lived 26 million years ago.Dr. Lynch speculated that LIF6 came back to life at the same time that the ancestors of living elephants evolved extra copies of p53. As they developed more powerful defenses against cancer, the animals could begin reaching their enormous sizes.Elephants likely evolved other new genes that follow p53\u2019s orders, Dr. Lynch predicted. He also suspects that elephants have also evolved ways to fight cancer that are separate from p53 altogether. \u201cI think it\u2019s all of the above,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lots of stories like LIF6 in the elephant genome, and I want to know them all.\u201d Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a number we need for many purposes. But on its own it isn\u2019t an adequate measure of economic success. There are a number of reasons this is true, but one key issue is that it tells you only what\u2019s happening to average income, which isn\u2019t always relevant to how most people live. If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar, the average wealth of the bar\u2019s patrons suddenly shoots up to several billion dollars \u2014 but none of the non-Bezos drinkers have gotten any richer.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] But how do facts like these fit into the overall story of economic growth? To answer this question, we need \u201cdistributional national accounts\u201d that track how growth is allocated among different segments of the population. So why not do this?Some might argue that creating distributional accounts is tricky, that it requires making some educated guesses about how to pool different sources of information. But that\u2019s true of the process used to create existing national accounts, including estimates of G.D.P., too! Economic numbers don\u2019t have to be perfect or above all criticism to be extremely useful.In a reasonable world, then, something like the Schumer-Heinrich bill would become law in the near future. In the real world, of course, the proposal will go nowhere for the time being \u2014 because Republicans don\u2019t want anyone to know what distributional national accounts might reveal.And to be fair, progressives like the idea of distributional accounts in part because they believe that more knowledge in this area would help their own cause. But here\u2019s the thing: Knowledge is objectively better than ignorance. And in modern America, knowing who actually benefits from economic growth is really, truly important. So let\u2019s make finding that out, and disseminating the results, part of the government\u2019s job.Advertisement"}

He unleashed among Republicans the ugliness that mainstream Republicans always knew was there \u2014 indeed, they exploited it \u2014 but always thought they were smart enough and strong enough to control.Viewed that way, Trump\u2019s base itself becomes the enemy of the Republic. It is its enthusiasm for Trump that is the greatest impediment to a genuine search for truth and an honoring of it.Every time Trump\u2019s followers turn a blind eye to his corruption, dishonesty or hatred, they say to the Republicans they sent to Washington, \u201cIf you are my representative, you will follow my lead and promote my desires.\u201dIn effect, that means that if the base loves Trump, the base\u2019s senators and congressmen and women are obligated to also love Trump \u2014 or at least fake it.These mainstream Republican politicians seem to be making a different calculation: Trump will be gone soon, and as long as he doesn\u2019t literally destroy the country, they will be able to wrestle back a post-Trump party and restore things to some sense of normalcy.But I have a message for these Republicans: The party you romanticize in your heads, the one that exists in exile waiting to one day make its valorous return, is gone, gobbled up by the beastly base.Mainstream Republicanism is an artifact of another age, its adherent now skirting the margins, homeless, looking on from the other sides of burning bridges.Will you stand up for what is right? Will you stand up for the health of the country and be on the right side of history? Will you at least initiate an investigation into Cohen\u2019s accusation?I hold out no real hope that the answer is yes, but questions must be asked so that history can record the answers. It must be noted forever that Republicans had a chance to choose courage, but they chose cowardice. They had a chance to prioritize national interest, but they chose personal interest.It can\u2019t be pleasant to fall on a sword, but that is now the only honorable way out for these Republicans and, by extension, for the rest of us.For many, their entire life\u2019s work has led them to the halls of Congress. Their political lives and their personal lives are indistinguishable. They are political creatures. They can\u2019t imagine their lives apart from the offices they hold.But in a life there often comes a moment when life asks of you the ultimate ask. And it is only through submitting to what is right, even if at great cost, that the rest of one\u2019s life can be judged as respectable.This is one of those moments for Republicans. In this moment they have to separate career goals and personal ambitions for the high requirement to properly serve the country and protect its Constitution.Up to this point, these Republicans have failed miserably. In a few months, many will likely be shown the door in the midterms. Democrats will likely take control of the House and thus will likely conduct investigations. But Republicans now have a window to stand up before they are voted down \u2014 to say to history that they may have failed so far, but they came around in the end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Illinois Lawmaker Resigns After Ex-Girlfriend Says He Used Her Nude Photos to \u2018Catfish\u2019 Men", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn Illinois state representative resigned on Wednesday hours after a report about allegations that he posted nude photographs of his ex-girlfriend on Instagram without her consent in an effort to draw other men into \u201cgraphic\u201d conversations.The complaint accused Mr. Sauer of using an Instagram account filled with nude images of his ex-girlfriend, Kate Kelly, to \u201ccatfish\u201d other men, or lure them into an online relationship using a fake persona.\u201cAs a result of the allegations by Kate Kelly, a former girlfriend, I have decided to resign my office,\u201d Mr. Sauer wrote in his letter of resignation to the clerk of the Illinois House, where he represented the 51st District, which includes affluent suburbs north of Chicago. \u201cMy ability to fulfill my obligations as a State Representative and public servant will be affected by the distraction of addressing these allegations.\u201d\u201cAfter speaking with my family, I feel it is best to step away from my public responsibilities,\u201d he added.Ms. Kelly wrote in her complaint that after she was notified about the fake account by an Instagram user, Mr. Sauer acknowledged \u201ccatfishing\u201d at least eight men with her private photos over two years, Politico reported.Ms. Kelly and Mr. Sauer began a relationship over Tinder in 2016 but broke up in March 2018 after Ms. Kelly said she discovered Mr. Sauer had been dating other women, the article said.Politico also reported that Ms. Kelly wrote in the complaint that she had filed a report with the Chicago Police Department, which she said was investigating her claims.In his letter of resignation, Mr. Sauer did not confirm or deny Ms. Kelly\u2019s claims. His spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Reached by email on Wednesday, Ms. Kelly said she needed time to process the events of the day.Hours after the report of the accusations was published, Representative Jim Durkin, the top Republican in the Illinois House, issued a statement foreshadowing Mr. Sauer\u2019s resignation.\u201cThe allegations that have come forth against Representative Nick Sauer are troubling,\u201d Mr. Durkin said in the statement. \u201cHe will be resigning from office today.

Sauer are deeply disturbing and disqualifying conduct of a public official,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beyond Assyrtiko, Greek Whites Reach for Distinction", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesThe country is full of obscure and unusual grapes. Some already make wonderful wines, but too many fall prey to formulaic production. A vanguard of curious and adventurous drinkers recognizes that assyrtiko from the island of Santorini displays many of the characteristics that are associated with great dry white wine. It has been by far the most popular among Greek whites, a category that has grown recently in the United States.\u201cThere has been a significant increase in the sales of Greek wine in the U.S., and especially whites,\u201d said Sofia Perpera, director of Greek Wine Bureau-North America, a trade group. \u201cThe hottest category, by far, is assyrtiko.\u201dYet most people, including many who consider themselves wine lovers, still regard assyrtiko as something exotic, perhaps even alien.So what might they make of other Greek whites with names that are vastly more obscure, like moschofilero, roditis and savatiano, to say nothing of athiri, robola and malagousia. Or is that malagouzia?Spelling itself is a problem. The names of these Greek grapes must be transliterated into English from the Greek alphabet, which sometimes results in multiple renderings.So moschofilero is sometimes spelled without the \u201ch,\u201d and malagousia with a \u201cz\u201d instead of an \u201cs.\u201d And forget about the red grape agiorgitiko, sometimes written aghiorghitiko or even as its English translation, St. George.Having witnessed the rise in the quality of assyrtiko in the last decade or so, I was curious about these other Greek whites. Have they made a similar leap in quality? In an effort to answer this question, the wine panel tasted 20 Greek whites from recent vintages. We specifically excluded assyrtikos because we wanted to focus on these other emerging varieties.One thing was clear: These wines, no matter how obscure they remain, are far more available than they used to be. Years ago, gathering a variety of Greek whites required visiting specialty shops in Greek neighborhoods, like Astoria in Queens. Now, they are carried in fine wine shops all over. Our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch, was easily able to accumulate 20 bottles without the once-marathon legwork.This was all the more remarkable because, aside from eliminating assyrtiko from the list, we also did not want to include in our tasting international grapes like sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, which at one time seemed to be making inroads into Greece\u2019s vineyards.Nonetheless, winemakers do not require international grapes to make generic, internationally styled wines. They simply need the modern equipment and techniques of mass-produced white wine \u2014 temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks, yeasts that encourage certain aromas and flavors, and so on.Regardless of which grapes are used, I suspect, the result can be the sort of fruity, generically aromatic white wines that might come from anywhere in the Mediterranean, or the world. Wines like these are sound, refreshing and flawless, unless you consider boring and nondescript to be flaws. They could easily stand in for the pinot grigio at the corner bar.Quite a few of the wines we tasted fell into that category. \u201cWith so many having that zippy, stainless-steel feel, I thought I was at an albari\u00f1o tasting,\u201d said Matthew, referring to the Spanish wine from Galicia, which, despite its potential, often descends into formulaic production.A few followed another recipe, of barrel-fermenting and aging to achieve textured, chardonnay-like qualities. They were pleasant enough, but, again, generic.Joe noted that when he visited Greece a decade ago, he noticed that bright, crisp steel-fermented whites were often made for export, while the Greeks kept barrel-fermented whites for themselves.We were far more excited by wines that seemed distinctive and original, regardless of the method of production. These wines were fresh and refreshing and would be wonderful on a summer\u2019s evening with Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food. Our favorites were often profoundly herbal and floral.An unusual wine, our second pick, is made from the ancient muscat of Alexandria grape, which is found all over the Mediterranean. Often, it\u2019s used to make sweet wines, although I\u2019ve had excellent dry examples from Sicily, where it\u2019s called zibibbo. This bottle, the 2017 Terra Ambera from Manolis Garalis on Lemnos, a volcanic island in the Aegean, was dry, perfumed and floral.Our third wine was the 2016 Theon Dora from Giannis Stilianou in Crete, crisp, fresh and minty. It was a particular study in obscurity, as it was made from three grapes that were unknown to me: vidiano, thrapsathiri and vilana, all indigenous to Crete.The next two wines were both made of malagousia, a grape that was on the verge of disappearing in Greece 30 years ago but has been resurrected and is now found all over the country. The first, rendered malagouzia, is the 2017 from Antonopoulos in the Achaia region in the northern Peloponnese: tangy, fresh and slightly more austere than the zesty, harmonious 2016 malagousia from Zafeirakis in Tyrnavos in the Thessaly region.It was plain from our tasting that these grapes have the potential to make wonderfully distinctive wines. They are already excellent values. None of the wines in our top 10 cost more than $24, and six of them were $20 and under.The niche success of assyrtiko offers a formula of a different kind: Figure out what is not already saturating the market and go for it. A touch pink. Lively, refreshing, harmonious and profoundly, deliciously herbal. (DNS Wines, San Francisco)Perfumed and bountifully floral, with balanced, distinctive flavors. (Eklektikon, Wilmington, Del.)Crisp and fresh, with cool mint and citrus flavors. (Eklektikon)Balanced and clean, with fresh flavors of citrus, herbs and tropical fruits. (Winebow, New York)Tangy and fresh, with flavors of herbs, citrus and apple. (Verity Wine Partners, New York)Balanced and zesty, with flavors of citrus, herbs and peaches. (DNS Wines)Bright and succulent, with flavors of herbs and tropical fruits. (Verity Wine Partners)Fresh and distinctive, with savory herbal and earthy mineral flavors. (Nestor Imports, Brooklyn, N.Y.)Earthy flavors of citrus, flowers and tropical fruits. (Stellar Importing, Astoria, N.Y.)Rich, refreshing and nicely textured. (DNS Wines)In general, one selects the dinner menu before choosing the wine. For the pairings column, the procedure is reversed: The wine comes first. But exceptions can be made. The moment I tasted the noodles with Chinese broccoli at Majordomo, David Chang\u2019s new restaurant in Los Angeles, I knew I had to have the recipe, as it would be well-suited to beer or white wine. The Greek whites we tasted were the perfect foil for this spicy noodle dish. At the restaurant they make their own thick noodles using a combination of wheat flour and cassava starch, but the executive chef Jude Parra-Sickels suggested bucatini as an easy substitute. The pasta is mingled with bright broccoli, lightly coated with a rich sauce that conveys a bit of heat. In preparing and serving the dish, do not short change the mixing of the ingredients because the broccoli tends to hide under the pasta. You have to coax it out, especially as you serve it.

The young Parisian woman in red and the man in the black shirt exchanged words as they passed each other in the street. They went their separate ways.But then, she said, he threw an ashtray in her direction. She shouted at him. He swiveled around and followed her. Then, in front of more than a dozen people sitting at a cafe, he hit her, she said.The woman, Marie Laguerre, a 22-year-old engineering student, posted the cafe\u2019s surveillance video on social media the next day. There was no audio, but it showed her receiving a blow to the head as other patrons at the cafe watched in shock. In the video, although the man in the black shirt was only partly seen on camera, it appeared as though he had hit her.When they first passed each other, \u201che made noises with his mouth\u201d that were \u201cvery degrading,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cHe stuck his tongue out, too.\u201dShe initially told him to \u201cshut up,\u201d she said \u2014 in French, the phrase is more of a curse word, she explained.Ms. Laguerre said the man threw an ashtray at her from the other side of the cafe.\u201cI burst into rage \u2014 the adrenaline rushed through my veins,\u201d she said. \u201cI insulted him, and I think I said, \u2018Are you proud? Son of a bitch.\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s when he walked over to where she was standing and hit her, she said.Some of the men at the cafe jumped up to confront the man as he walked away; one brandished a chair. On social media, Ms. Laguerre thanked them for their support, saying they did all they could have at the time.\u201cTo all those who say that witnesses have not reacted enough: Everything happened very quickly and they did not have time to understand the situation. The attacker was dangerous,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.The man walked away, \u201cscreaming things like \u2018I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u2019 to the people who were there,\u201d Ms. Laguerre said. \u201cI think we were all in shock so we didn\u2019t think about calling the police.\u201dShe later filed a report with the police and the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office opened an inquiry into the episode, Ms. Laguerre said. She noted that the man had not been identified.\u201cIt\u2019s moving forward,\u201d she said of the investigation. \u201cI can\u2019t say much because it is confidential.\u201dMs. Laguerre was inundated with supportive messages from other women, including French politicians, who have vowed to crack down on street harassment.The #MeToo movement in France is still a work in progress, Genevi\u00e8ve Fraisse, a French philosopher, writer on feminist thought and director of research at the government\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research, said in an interview.Lately much of the discussion about sexual harassment and sexual violence in the country has centered on addressing street harassment and catcalling.But in the national conversation about sexual harassment, why is harassment in the streets the most important thing? Ms. Fraisse asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not only the streets that are the problem,\u201d she said.And some believe the #MeToo movement hampers sexual freedom.\u201cRape is a crime,\u201d the letter said. \u201cBut insistent or clumsy flirting is not a crime, nor is gallantry a chauvinist aggression.\u201dThe letter also suggested that in the case of men who masturbate by rubbing themselves against women on buses or subways, women could \u201cconsider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent.\u201dSome legislators have argued this is exactly the attitude that needs to change in France, a country where male chauvinism has often gone unchallenged and American attitudes about sex are considered puritanical or uptight.\u201cLiberty is fundamentally at stake,\u201d Ms. Schiappa wrote. \u201cThis is why combating harassment in the streets is a priority.\u201dThe man in the video wasn\u2019t the first one to harass her, Ms. Laguerre said.\u201cEvery time a man whistles at me or has this kind of disgusting behavior to me in the street \u2014 or even these heavy looks \u2014 it makes me angry and then the anger stays.\u201dIn a YouTube post, Ms Laguerre wrote: \u201cI am sick of feeling unsafe walking in the street.

Remembering Harlem\u2019s Muslim History.", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMalcolm X Boulevard in Harlem around 125th Street is now lined with artisanal French restaurants, wood-fired pizza joints and brunch places serving kale salad. A new Whole Foods supermarket shines from the corner. On Sundays, luxury tour buses idle at curbs, unloading foreign tourists who want to experience a gospel church service or a neighborhood meal.\u201cWe are here because a lot of this history is being erased,\u201d Ms. Merriman, whose own roots are Irish-American, told the group at the start of the walk. \u201cThe reason I am giving this tour is because you are mostly not going to see plaques. These histories are mostly oral histories and not written down.\u201dMany of the people on the tour were Muslims in their 20s with Arab or South Asian roots, who wanted to learn about a history they felt connected to as Muslims but knew little about. Some, economically, were gentrifiers themselves, new residents of the neighborhood, but they wanted to feel like part of the community they now called home.\u201cBack home, we think of America as a country that Muslims have only recently immigrated to,\u201d said Tasneem Ebrahim, 21, a Columbia University undergraduate from Bahrain. \u201cAnd nobody learns about the fact that Muslims were here since the beginning, since the first time people came to this country.\u201dMen wearing bow ties and suits, the signature attire of men in the Nation, sold literature and guarded the door. Brother Richard Muhammad greeted the tour and invited everyone inside another time, when services were not in session.\u201cHe is the father of everything you are about to see here,\u201d Mr. Allah said, gesturing to the portrait.Ms. Merriman explained to the group how Allah, who gave himself the name of God in Islam, preached that men were the creators of their own futures, and that black men were God personified. The ideas of the group, which is also known as the Nation of Gods and Earths, have traveled incognito into mainstream culture through lyrics of hip-hop artists like Nas, Busta Rhymes and Wu Tang Clan, who were influenced by it.\u201cBreakin\u2019 it down.

In the 1920s, Bengali ship workers jumped ship, moved to Harlem and married into the black community. A Muslim missionary from Sudan, Satti Majid, spread the ideas of Sunni Islam. The history of Islam in New York, she added, is as old as the city itself, in part because 10 to 15 percent of slaves are believed to have been Muslim.\u201cMuslim history is New York City history,\u201d she said.Ms. Merriman did not mention her personal connection to the subject until the end of the tour, even though her identity as a non-Muslim woman of European heritage was the first thing some of the participants noticed. \u201cShe knows what she knows,\u201d said Luqman a-Rahman, 29, an African-American who was raised Muslim in Crown Heights, midway through the tour. \u201cShe is going to give me the sandwich, and then someone I know is going to give me the dressing.\u201dBut for Sahar Amarir, 25, a French Moroccan graduate student from Paris doing a summer internship in New York, the idea of a white woman leading a multicultural group on a tour of Muslim Harlem made perfect sense given the liberal context of New York City, she said.\u201cI think as far as the philosophical idea of cosmopolitanism goes, this is the closest that human beings ever got to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating, being in America in this time of polarization, is that you are seeing the worst and you are seeing the best.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nixon, Clinton and Trump", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe more Trump is cornered, the more he mirrors Richard Nixon.Opinion ColumnistTwenty years ago last Friday, President Bill Clinton testified before the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and a grand jury about his sexual relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky.I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible. But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action. I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that. It was a clear admission, even if offered under duress and after the option to lie had vanished, and even if still splitting some hairs. I think his little speech after it was a disaster. It wasn\u2019t the right tone, and I\u2019m not sure he should have done it. And, I\u2019m not even sure that he shouldn\u2019t have just gone in and taken the Fifth Amendment, and said: \u201cLook, I don\u2019t get along with this man, Starr. He\u2019s after me. He\u2019s a Republican.\u201d He\u2019s this, he\u2019s that, and you know, just taken the Fifth Amendment. It\u2019s a terrible thing for a president to take the Fifth Amendment, but he probably should have done it.Donald Trump made clear then his approach to dealing with these sorts of problems: Admit nothing, confess nothing, deny everything, attack the person pursuing you.For me, it is clear that there was at least an attempt by members of the Trump team to conspire with Russians to influence the elections. The evidence of that is now public record. And, it is just as clear that Trump has attempted to obstruct justice by hampering the investigation and continues to do so.Whether the special counsel, Robert Mueller, will deem those actions to meet the legal threshold of criminality is another story.But, it seems to me that Trump is growing increasingly agitated over the very real possibility that more members of his campaign and possibly his family are open to liability and that he himself may be vulnerable to eventual impeachment. As such, he is mirroring the actions of President Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached. Nixon said: I said on May 22 that I had no prior knowledge of the Watergate operation. In all the testimony, there is not the slightest evidence to the contrary. Not a single witness has testified that I had any knowledge of the planning for the Watergate break\u2010in. It is also true, as I said on May 22, that I took no part in, and was not aware of, any subsequent efforts to cover up the illegal acts associated with the Watergate break\u2010in.We now know, of course, that that was a lie.But a full reading of Nixon\u2019s statements sound mild compared to the viciousness with which Trump is attacking the investigation looking into illegality, the press reporting on it and those providing information for it.Even in Nixon\u2019s false statement, one reads at least a rhetorical respect for American institutions and history, even if that respect did not exist in fact or in full.Trump has none of that.I believe he has absolutely no plans to personally cooperate with the investigation by sitting for an interview. He may have once believed that he could bluff his way through such an experience, but now his hostility and fear about the inquiry\u2019s conclusion has clipped his courage.And, I don\u2019t believe Trump is going to confess as Clinton did, or resign as Nixon did, regardless of what Mueller finds, whom he prosecutes or what he says in a report. Trump lies about almost everything, but one thing that he says is true: He is a fighter. But he\u2019s not a fighter because he is fearsome or brave. Valor has no relationship to the man. Trump fights for vanity.One of Trump\u2019s greatest fears and greatest insecurities is being embarrassed and being exposed. Trump is petrified that someone will remove the mask he has been crafting for seven decades, or of having it be revealed that that mask is made of paper rather than steel. Advertisement"}

Private lawyers for the president have all had private practices.\u201dThe Freeh Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.Mr. Freeh\u2019s company is known to be representing a Romanian businessman, Gabriel Popoviciu, who was sentenced to seven years in prison in August 2017 in a case centered on a real-estate deal in northern Bucharest.In a statement to The New York Times in response to questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s letter, a representative of the United States Embassy in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, said that the government did not comment on the views or conclusions of private American citizens.\u201cRudolph Giuliani is a famous federal prosecutor of the United States, who has fought with the mafia and corruption, and whose moral and professional probity commands respect all over the world,\u201d Mr. Dragnea said in a statement, adding that the scrutiny on what he called the \u201cserious violation of human rights and of the principles of the rule of law\u201d was welcome.Dan Barna, the leader of the Save Romania Union, a political party that was founded in 2016 to defend the rule of law and that has become the third-largest in Parliament, suggested Mr. Giuliani had no official status to justify writing the letter.\u201cI am convinced that President Iohannis is looking forward to the devastating messages that are likely to come from the barber and then from the chef of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Barna said.On Monday, the Foreign Ministry announced that it was summoning George Maior, the Romanian ambassador to the United States, to explain comments in which he had suggested that the letter from Mr. Giuliani was the result of a lobbying campaign by people defending those who have problems with the justice system.\u201cAmbassador George Maior had a stance that was not approved within the Foreign Ministry or within the government,\u201d a news release said.He said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s letter was \u201cbased on a seriously flawed understanding of the situation in Romania.\u201dMr. Burduja also asked Mr. Giuliani to clarify whether he had written the letter in the capacity of an official representative of the United States government and whether it reflected current Washington policies. Mr. Burduja also asked Mr. Giuliani whether he was representing any Romanian clients or interest groups.Alan Feuer contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Uganda\u2019s Refugee Camps, South Sudanese Children Seek the Families They\u2019ve Lost", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPALORINYA, Uganda \u2014 On a pale dirt road in the Palorinya refugee camp in northern Uganda, Raida Ijo clung to her 16-year-old son, Charles Abu. They sobbed quietly into each other\u2019s shoulder. They had been separated for 19 months, since the day that fighting broke out between rebels and government troops in their village in South Sudan.Charles was halfway through a math class in their village, Andasire, in South Sudan\u2019s Central Equatoria state, when the shooting started. He ran for the bush, and after a sleepless night in hiding, set off for the Ugandan border with his younger brother, Seme, 14.Their mother, Mrs. Ijo, feeling unwell, had checked herself into a hospital that morning. The boys knew that to try to find her would be too dangerous.\u201cWhen it\u2019s already tough just to survive, and you don\u2019t even know if your loved ones are alive, that adds a lot to the burden,\u201d said Joane Holliger, a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross to a program in Uganda, Restoring Family Links. \u201cThere are a lot of protection concerns for unaccompanied children \u2014 child labor, teenage pregnancy, prostitution, child-headed families \u2014 so the quicker we can trace their parents, the better.\u201dOver the last two years, 433 unaccompanied minors have been reunited with their parents in Uganda. Worldwide, the International Committee of the Red Cross has opened 99,342 cases as it tries to reunite families.In Uganda, the bulk of the work is done by Red Cross volunteers, called tracers, who work weekdays hoping to find missing family members in their allocated section of the camp.Agustin Soroba, 27, who was himself separated from his family for five months after being kidnapped, beaten and pressed into labor as an ammunition porter by South Sudanese soldiers, has been working as a tracer since February 2017.His area of operation is a series of blocks in Bidi Bidi camp \u2014 now Africa\u2019s largest with around 280,000 refugees. On a recent Wednesday, he was doing the rounds of unaccompanied children in his area whose cases were still in progress, and checking on families who had been reunified.One visit was to a small mud-built home where Margaret Sitima, 18, has been waiting for over a year to reconnect with her mother, last seen on her way to the hospital in the Ugandan town of Arua, after being badly beaten by soldiers on her journey out of South Sudan.Mr. Soroba pressed her for any more details she might have, and told her he would try his best.His colleagues urge people to report missing family members. They also hang posters of the missing and run a hotline that allows refugees to phone separated family members.One old man called his wife \u2014 the first time they had spoken in 14 months \u2014 to let her know that he was in Bidi Bidi and that he missed her. A woman in a yellow T-shirt called relatives in South Sudan with the news that her son had been sick but was recovering.Many of the unaccompanied children have witnessed extreme violence, adding urgency to the challenge of reunifying them with their families.\u201cMany of them are extremely disturbed,\u201d said Richard Talish, 33, an employee of the World Vision charity, who runs a safe space for children in Bidi Bidi camp. \u201cWe try to keep them busy, so they\u2019re not always thinking about the past.\u201dMr. Talish said that in art sessions, many children draw scenes of violence.Tracing can take time. The Abu brothers\u2019 case illustrates the obstacles to reuniting families split by South Sudan\u2019s war. The boys had no idea of their mother\u2019s whereabouts and whether she was alive. They said their mother did not know her age and could not spell her name, making it harder to locate her. Like many rural South Sudanese, she has never owned a mobile phone or a Facebook account.When one of South Sudan\u2019s three cellphone networks was taken offline in March over unpaid license fees, thousands lost their only means of contact.The tracing challenges are exacerbated by the lack of access to a centralized database of refugees in Uganda. A combination of confusion and corruption during refugee registrations, in the early months of the crisis, produced incomplete or erroneous records. Some refugees were registered more than once; others, not at all. Names were misspelled. Some records do not list a specific location within the camps, which sprawl for nearly 100 square miles of northern Uganda scrubland.Uganda is carrying out biometric registrations to clarify the number of refugees, following a scandal over inflated figures. Several government officials were suspended.Until their parents have been located, unaccompanied children live with foster families in the camps. Some are connected by charitable organizations, such as World Vision, which runs a database of potential foster caregivers, who must be matched by ethnicity and language with the child. Other children live with families they encountered on the road, or at reception areas near the border. Extended families and clans try to fill the gap.Florence Knight, 14, was one of six unaccompanied children taken in by a passing refugee family who found them hiding by the roadside near the burning remains of the truck that had taken them toward the border. The vehicle had been ambushed and most of its occupants killed.\u201cThey\u2019re like my own children now,\u201d said Ms. Knight\u2019s new foster mother, Betty Leila, 32, who now has 13 children, stepchildren or foster children. Many cry at night because of bad dreams.A few blocks away, another teenage girl, Betty Abau, is living with a family who found her crying and alone beside a river on their journey to the Ugandan border. She looked down at the floor, wringing her hands as she talked. She had been at school when violence erupted and forced her to flee without her parents.\u201cI don\u2019t know if they are alive or dead,\u201d said Ms. Abau.She said she had provided all the details she could recall to a tracing officer over a year ago, but had not received any updates. According to Lilias Diria, 32, Betty\u2019s new foster mother, she is one of six unaccompanied children living just in this cluster of half a dozen homes.The breakthrough in the Abu brothers\u2019 case finally came after a tip from a man who had recognized one of their relatives in the Palorinya camp, a scattered settlement of 180,000 refugees. Red Cross representatives asked the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 which oversees the refugee program in partnership with the United Nations refugee agency \u2014 to run a check for their mother. The search revealed nine people with similar names. A Red Cross tracer then set out to locate each woman, one by one, and found the correct Raida Ijo on the fifth attempt.On June 29, more than a year and a half after they last saw their mother, the boys packed their few possessions \u2014 clothes, cooking pots, jerrycans, a single rolled-up mattress, three live rabbits \u2014 into a Red Cross vehicle and set off on the two-hour drive from their foster home in Rhino camp, to their mother\u2019s ramshackle shelter of sticks, mud and thatch in Palorinya.\u201cFor a mother not to know where her children are is so hard,\u201d said an overjoyed Mrs. Ijo, who had spent days sitting in an open sided tarpaulin shelter worrying about her missing sons since fleeing to Uganda during a second round of violence in February 2017. \u201cThey came from my body. I brought them up. I love them. I didn\u2019t know if I would ever see them again.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the 99,342 cases opened by the Red Cross as it tries to reunite families. That refers to the total number of tracing cases currently open, including efforts to trace adults, not just minors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Serving Time Should Not Mean \u2018Prison Slavery\u2019 ", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA national strike by prisoners is the latest iteration of demands for freedom from forced labor. Mr. Loomis is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cA History of America in Ten Strikes.\u201dWith often privatized prisons operating with maximum security and limited communication among prisoners, even discovering what is happening remains difficult, yet prisoners have organized themselves nonetheless in one of the most important labor actions in this country. The prison strike is a multiracial action, but that African-Americans make up a disproportionate number of the nation\u2019s prison population and its leadership of this movement is no accident. This strike is part of centuries\u2019 worth of labor actions to protest the compelled labor out of black bodies by a white-dominated society. We should not see the prison strike as an isolated event. It is instead the latest iteration of demands for freedom from forced labor that go back to slavery. From the beginning of black chattel slavery in what became the United States, African-American workers have sought to take control over their lives and work. Sometimes this was through slave revolts such as Nat Turner\u2019s rebellion in 1831 Virginia. But more common was individual acts of resistance \u2014 running away, slowing down in the fields, stealing food from the master. During the Civil War, slaves freed themselves by walking to Union lines. What was a trickle in 1861 became a flood by 1864, as thousands of self-emancipated slaves followed Union soldiers. What the pioneering civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois called the \u201cgeneral strike\u201d of slaves changed the outcome of the war, forcing a reluctant Lincoln administration to move toward the Emancipation Proclamation and then the 13th Amendment, all while slowing the Confederate war effort by undermining the labor force and thus the economy. Slaves could not have won the war by themselves, but their actions were crucial in deciding the war and creating its moral impact. The civil rights movement challenged this prison regime, but by no means ended it. In Texas during the 1970s, segregated prison gangs worked under overseers picking cotton for no money. This was modern slavery. In 1978, 1,500 inmates at the Canfield Prison in Ellis, Tex., refused to work in support of a lawsuit (in part against unpaid prison labor) started by a civil rights activist imprisoned in 1972 for inciting a riot during a protest against a white-owned store. They started a prison strike, which spread through the state\u2019s prison system, gained nationwide attention and lasted for two weeks. As during the current prison strike, the Texas prisoners had few illusions of immediate victories. But in 1980, the Texas prison labor system was ruled unconstitutional, and no longer would they pick cotton under overseers for no money. This was one victory in a centuries-long struggle; yet Texas has continued to exploit its prisoners for poorly paid work. Just as the public attention of the 1978 strike contributed to that 1980 decision, so might the current prison strike create changes to the current system of prison labor exploitation. That can happen if we make changes to prison labor systems a central demand of our politicians. The strike will continue until Sept. 9, and it is up to us on the outside to make our voices heard in support of these workers. Slavery still has never ended in the United States. It continues every day in our prisons. We must wash ourselves of this moral stain on our society and treat prisoners with the human rights that every person deserves. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Voinovich, Dissident Russian Writer, Dies at 85", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVladimir Voinovich, a Russian writer whose satirical novels vexed the Soviet authorities in the Leonid Brezhnev era, resulting in his banishment from the country for a decade, died on Friday in Moscow. He was 85.Vladimir R. Medinsky, Russia\u2019s culture minister, confirmed the death in a condolence statement on Sunday. The cause was a heart attack, Mr. Voinovich\u2019s friend Yulia Pessina said on Facebook.Mr. Voinovich found himself under scrutiny by the K.G.B., and later said that he believed that during one of its interviews with him in 1975 the agency poisoned him with a cigarette that had been laced with some sort of hallucinogen.He moved to West Germany to join the faculty of the Institute of Fine Arts in Munich, and the next year his Soviet citizenship was revoked. Not until Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the glasnost era a decade later was he able to return.Mr. Voinovich, though free to live and publish in modern Russia, remained something of a dissident until the end, regularly voicing alarm about President Vladimir V. Putin and the revival of authoritarianism.Vladimir Nikolayevich Voinovich was born on Sept. 26, 1932, in Stalinabad (since renamed Dushanbe). His father, a journalist and translator of Serbian literature, was arrested on political charges when Vladimir was 4 and spent five years in a labor camp. His mother taught mathematics.Mr. Voinovich worked as a herdsman and trained as a locksmith before serving four years in the Soviet Army in Poland and elsewhere, from 1951 to 1955, an experience that gave him much fodder for his future literary works.His education had often been interrupted \u2014 he completed some but not all of the grades of Soviet schooling and later attended evening classes \u2014 yet he aspired to a literary life, something facilitated by his family\u2019s love of reading and emphasis on it. He began writing poetry while in the army and, during the post-Stalin years in the mid-1950s, published stories in a magazine, Novy Mir, and wrote songs, several of which became very popular.\u201cHe now had the reputation of a writer to be watched \u2014 in both senses of the word,\u201d the article said.He was also under scrutiny for supporting dissidents and for chafing at the restrictions of the Writers\u2019 Union, a body created by the Communist Party in an effort to control professional writers.In 1963 Mr. Voinovich had begun working on \u201cIvan Chonkin,\u201d the saga of a misfit army private and his encounters with the Soviet system. The initial work (there would be follow-up segments) was hailed in the West.Mr. Voinovich\u2019s survivors include his third wife, Svetlana Y. Kolesnichenko, and a daughter, Olga V. Voinovich.Mr. Voinovich said he did not set out to be a satirist, but merely to tell stories inspired by real life.He also observed differences in the ways his works were received, depending on who was reading them.\u201cRussians and Americans read my books in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans usually say they are funny. Russians say, yes, they are very gloomy, dark.\u201dThat, he said, was his own experience when he told of the incident with the tainted cigarette.\u201cIn 1975, I was poisoned by the K.G.B.,\u201d he said in the 1989 interview. \u201cIt was a terrible story and I wrote it. I met an American editor and she told me, \u2018Oh, I read the story about how you were poisoned by the K.G.B.,\u2019 and I asked her, \u2018What did you think about it?\u2019 She said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s very funny,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t consider it to be a funny story.\u201dIvan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Industry Pursues a Federal Privacy Law, on Its Own Terms", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow top tech companies are going on the offensive.In recent months, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others have aggressively lobbied officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere to start outlining a federal privacy law, according to administration officials and the companies. The law would have a dual purpose, they said: It would overrule the California law and instead put into place a kinder set of rules that would give the companies wide leeway over how personal digital information was handled.\u201cWe are committed to being part of the process and a constructive part of the process,\u201d said Dean Garfield, president of a leading tech industry lobbying group, the Information Technology Industry Council, which is working on proposals for the federal law. \u201cThe best way is to work toward developing our own blueprint.\u201dThe efforts could set up a big fight with consumer and privacy groups, especially as companies like Facebook face scrutiny for mishandling users\u2019 personal data. Many of the internet companies depend on the collection and analysis of such data to help them target the online ads that generate the bulk of their revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the strategy here is to neuter California for something much weaker on the federal level,\u201d said Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cThe companies are afraid of California because it sets the bar for other states.\u201dIn the United States, tech companies\u2019 efforts to fight privacy regulations gained momentum in late spring, as it became clear that the California proposal might become law.At a board meeting for the Information Technology Industry Council in May, Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top lobbyist, warned that an early proposal for privacy in California posed a threat to the industry and that the trade group needed to make the issue of privacy a priority, according to two people briefed on the meeting, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Until that moment, there had been a split in the tech industry about privacy rules. Companies like IBM and Salesforce, which sell data storage and software to other businesses, were more willing to accept consumer privacy laws, IBM and other members of the Information Technology Industry Council said. Social media and other companies that relied primarily on advertising for revenue, like Facebook and Google, were adamant that the industry should fight all rules.But at that meeting, it became clear that Facebook and Google had softened their resistance to a federal privacy law, as long as they were deeply involved in writing the rules.\u201cThere has been a complete shift on privacy,\u201d said Chris Padilla, vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. \u201cThere is now broad recognition that companies that were resistant to privacy rules can no longer just say no.\u201dGoogle said it seemed inevitable that privacy rules would come to the United States.\u201cThere are renewed efforts to define the privacy legislative frameworks of the future, and we look forward to working with policymakers around the world to move the process forward,\u201d Google said in a statement.Many of the companies also recognized that it was a good time to press ahead with a federal privacy law since Trump administration officials have expressed openness to a business-friendly approach to such rules.David Redl, the head of a division of the Commerce Department that is leading the agency\u2019s privacy efforts, said in a July speech that the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to prosperity will be our guide.\u201d\u201cWe also know that industry is looking to the administration to demonstrate leadership on this issue,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re rightfully concerned about the potential for a fractured and stifling regulatory landscape.\u201dLindsay Walters, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that the administration aimed to work with Congress on legislation \u201cthat is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity.\u201dThe administration said it intended to have an outline of potential rules by the end of the year. But the timeline could easily be pushed back, as numerous agencies may be involved, including the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology.In a sign of the latitude that a federal privacy law might give tech companies, at least three trade groups \u2014 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association, and the Information Technology Industry Council \u2014 are planning to push for voluntary standards instead of legal mandates that carry steep penalties for violations.In exchange for volunteering to follow certain guidelines on what kind of information they collect and share about users, the groups said, they would insist that the federal statute nullify California\u2019s rules.That position has outraged privacy advocates.\u201cThe idea that the companies that violated our privacy for more than a decade will suddenly have a self-regulatory blueprint is ridiculous,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president of Common Sense Media, a privacy and children\u2019s advocacy group that supported the California law.Privacy advocates said tech companies were pushing to undercut the California privacy law in other ways. Although passed in June, the law stipulates that lawmakers can pursue technical changes in its language until the end of this month. It is scheduled to take effect in January 2020.Any changes are supposed to be minor, but tech lobbyists and privacy groups continue to swarm the offices of the legislators behind the law, their aides said. Consumer privacy groups, which have been pushing lawmakers to leave the law virtually untouched, fear the companies are trying to soften protections.This month, the California Chamber of Commerce and other business and tech groups sent 19 pages of edits to the law to State Senator Bill Dodd, one of the bill\u2019s authors. They criticized language, such as the law\u2019s definition of personal information, that they said would apply to too many people or websites.In the letter, the groups said California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, would need more time to figure out how to enforce the rules and asked to delay enactment for one year. The business groups argued that the law could hurt a typical consumer.\u201cUnless the law is clarified, he or she might also inadvertently be deprived of special discounts and promotions,\u201d the letter said.In a rebuttal letter to Mr. Dodd, several consumer privacy groups called for him and other California lawmakers to keep any changes to a minimum, saying the tech industry\u2019s moves were \u201cexcessive in nature.\u201d\u201cThe sky is not falling, as industry suggests,\u201d the groups said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the trade group that is among those pushing for voluntary standards, instead of legal mandates, when it comes to the privacy of personal information online.

My parents, immigrants from rural Iran, struggled to provide opportunity for their children. A career in medicine promised a better future ahead. But five years after graduating from medical school, that future still seems on a distant horizon. I cannot afford to buy a house, still ride my bicycle to work and continue to skimp on meals in order to cover more than $3,000 in monthly loan payments.I am far from alone. A mentor in residency, several years my senior and making over $200,000 per year, once revealed that she had moved back in with her mother just to get a handle on her student loans. Another colleague had a marriage proposal rejected because of his mortgage-size debt.Perhaps all of this is simply self-interested economics. But if that is the case, so be it. The mere fact that student debt is causing the highest earners to struggle should awaken us to the severity of the situation. It also is a reminder that being in the top 1 percent of earners no longer means being in the top 1 percent of actual wealth.

We\u2019re talking about the natural world, so one has to be cautious. But if you look at all the destructive extreme weather buffeting the world this summer alone, it\u2019s as if Mother Nature were saying to us: \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t notice me tapping on your shoulder these past few years? O.K. Well, how about a little fire, Scarecrow? How about this:While climate scientists have long argued that you can\u2019t attribute any single weather event to climate change, a study last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine concluded: \u201cThe science has advanced to the point that this is no longer true as an unqualified blanket statement. In many cases, it is now often possible to make and defend quantitative statements about the extent to which human-induced climate change \u2026 has influenced either the magnitude or the probability of occurrence of specific types of events or event classes.\u201dClimate change makes the hots hotter, the wets wetter and the dries drier. Heidi Cullen, chief scientist for Climate Central, an environmental organization, was quoted as telling the Weather Channel in July that the national academies\u2019 report connecting global warming to the increased risk and severity of certain classes of extreme weather \u2014 like some of the heat waves, floods and droughts we\u2019re experiencing \u2014 carries the same scientific import as the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s 1964 report connecting smoking to lung cancer.

My free advice: If Democratic socialism or Democratic Trotskyism or abolishing ICE \u2014 the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency \u2014 is what will get you elected as a Democrat in your district in 2018, go for it. The Democrats must take the House back. But Trump would feast on those issues in a national election. Trump has no answer for that. He doesn\u2019t believe the climate science that NASA is telling him is true.

Now that\u2019s a platform worth running on, and it\u2019s one that can do what Democrats need most: make them the party of strengthening the working class and American security. Clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing and efficient buildings make everything we want to achieve in our society easier.

Andrew M. Cuomo has not only opened an investigation into the case, he has offered to officiate the couple\u2019s wedding in Albany.Dylan Toften and Thomas Hurd sought the license in Root, N.Y., about 50 miles from Albany. But the town\u2019s clerk, Laurel Eriksen, denied the couple\u2019s request. The Human Rights Division is investigating why Ms. Eriksen refused the couple their license.Mr. Toften wrote on Facebook on Monday that Ms. Eriksen denied the request because she personally objects to same-sex marriage on religious grounds. Ms. Eriksen told Robert Subik, Root\u2019s town attorney, she did not grant the license because the couple had not made an appointment.Though Ms. Eriksen did mention her personal objection to same-sex marriage to the couple, Mr. Subik said, she did not deny the couple the license because of her personal views. He said people requesting licenses are required to make appointments in advance because Ms. Eriksen is a part-time employee.Mr. Toften deferred comment to the state. Ms. Eriksen could not be reached for comment, and Mr. Subik said he advised Ms. Eriksen to not talk to the news media.\u201cThere is a campaign to undermine marriage equality by encouraging people to say I have an objection to treating gay couples equally,\u201d Ms. Tiven said.In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo called the denial of the wedding license \u201can unconscionable act of discrimination that goes against our values as New Yorkers.\u201d\u201cThis is an expansion of the Trumpian philosophy: they are against marriage equality and they are substituting their philosophy for the law,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the clerk is opposed to marriage equality that\u2019s her right but she can\u2019t impose her will onto others in violation of the law.\u201dMr. Subik said Ms. Eriksen informed the couple that the town\u2019s deputy clerk had no objection to issuing a license to a same-sex couple and would assist them if they made an appointment.\u201cI think she handled it professionally,\u201d he said of Ms. Eriksen. \u201cShe gave them an option for them to achieve their goal with another person in her office, and they were certainly free to do that.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf they make an appointment, the deputy clerk will handle it expeditiously and very professionally.\u201dOf Mr. Cuomo, he said, \u201cHis comments are not reflective of the facts of the case, and he\u2019s twisting it around for his own purposes.\u201dBut, Alphonso David, the governor\u2019s counsel, said individuals have obtained licenses from the town without appointments.\u201cYou cannot say I\u2019m not going to provide you a government service because I have a religious objection,\u201d he said.Mr. David said if Ms. Eriksen\u2019s denial centered on a procedural issue, she should not have mentioned her religious objections to same-sex marriage.\u201cIf a different-sex couple walked in and requested a marriage license, they would arguably have a marriage license,\u201d he said.If the Human Rights Division finds the town\u2019s clerk office in Root violated state law, the division can file a claim against the town or its officers.\u201cThe town has an obligation to make sure that a same-sex couple is treated in the same fashion as a different sex couple,\u201d Mr. David said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Liquor Have a Local Taste? They\u2019re Banking on It", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo one is sure whether spirits can convey \u201cterroir\u201d like wine does. But distillers are seeking, and selling, that sense of place.But the ideas don\u2019t stop at cars and computers.Other than the grains, each whiskey is made the same way. And yet each tastes subtly different: The Saskatchewan whiskey is smooth and nutty, the Minnesota a bit earthy, the Pennsylvania fiery and fruity. Initial chemical analysis, Ms. Grelli said, supports those impressions: The Pennsylvania rye, for example, had elevated levels of ethyl acetate, which imparts flavors like pear and bananas.Those differences, Ms. Grelli said, indicate that spirits like whiskey can have something that the distilling world has long dismissed: a sense of place, drawn from the soil and climate where the grains grow and the whiskey is made \u2014 in other words, terroir.Wigle\u2019s whiskey trio, called the Terroir Project, goes on sale this fall in select markets and is among the first in a wave of place-specific spirits \u2014 whiskey, vodka, rum and others \u2014 coming out over the next few years. The producers range from small, regional distillers to global names like Belvedere, the Polish vodka owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The new spirits are part of an international movement by distillers, plant breeders and academic researchers to return distilling to what they see as its locally grounded, agricultural roots.\u201cA lot of people think that when they drink a craft whiskey, they have to ask how it compares to a bourbon from Kentucky,\u201d Ms. Grelli said. \u201cWe like to ask, \u2018Does it taste like where it came from?\u2019\u201dTerroir is a concept usually associated with wine; it\u2019s what makes a Burgundy from the village of Gevrey-Chambertin taste different from one made the next village over, in Morey St.-Denis. It is an untranslatable and often imposing term for a very basic idea: that agricultural products are shaped by the soil, climate and culture where they are grown.Conventional wisdom, and most distillers, contend that the rigors of the distillation process strip out whatever nuances a grain might carry with it. And it\u2019s true, Ms. Grelli and others concede, that these days there isn\u2019t much difference between a bourbon made in Kentucky and one from New York.But that, they say, is simply the result of the industry\u2019s overreliance on a few giant suppliers of commodity grains. They believe that spirits with a sense of place can be made by cultivating regionally specific varieties, along with farming and distilling techniques that emphasize a spirit\u2019s local character.The most ambitious distillers predict a time, not far-off, when discerning drinkers will seek out, say, a Hudson Valley rye in the same way they might a Stag\u2019s Leap cabernet sauvignon.\u201cWe imagine a whiskey future where half the market is made up of small, regionally driven producers,\u201d Ms. Grelli said.Advocates for the idea argue that terroir was once a given in spirits making \u2014 that well into the 19th century, American farmers grew hundreds of varieties of corn, rye and other grains, and distillers used whatever was nearby.Over the last century, though, industrial farming and large-scale spirits production have encouraged distillers to focus on a limited range of grain varieties, grown not for taste but for alcohol yield, with much of the flavor coming later, in the barrel-aging process.For example, almost all the corn used to make bourbon is a high-yield, relatively flavorless variety called Yellow Dent No. 2 grade, grown by the millions of bushels across the Midwest.For his dissertation, Mr. Arnold is examining how soil and climate in different parts of the state affect the flavor characteristics in corn, and whether those qualities come through in a distilled and aged spirit \u2014 a project that, he believes, will help him make whiskeys that can be identified with specific parts of Texas. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping to do is tap into flavors that have been forgotten,\u201d he said.A similar effort is underway at High Wire, where Mr. Blackwell and his wife, Ann Marshall, produce estate-specific rums and whiskeys, drawing on crops grown along the South Carolina coast, and inland along the Pee Dee River.As with Wigle\u2019s rye whiskey, there seem to be subtle differences among High Wire\u2019s bourbons \u2014 the corn grown along the coast produces a funky, vegetal tone in the whiskey, while the corn from further inland produces cleaner, sweeter notes.\u201cOur relationship with Dr. Kresovich and the research team at Clemson has been invaluable,\u201d Mr. Blackwell said. \u201cTheir expertise and advanced lab techniques confirm and quantify aspects of terroir that we can only surmise from sensory experience.\u201dDistillers aren\u2019t just looking at terroir for curiosity\u2019s sake; they\u2019re seeking an edge to help them compete with cheaper established brands, and set themselves apart from the hundreds of other craft spirits released each year. \u201cWe have to differentiate ourselves because the costs are higher, so our focus on local, on the taste of a place drives that,\u201d said Alex Grelli, an owner of Wigle Whiskey.\u201cIf all we\u2019re trying to do is copy Scottish single malts, then we\u2019re going to bore the consumer and flood the retail shelf with similar products,\u201d Ms. Parc said.\u201cFor the last five to 10 years, it\u2019s been challenging for vodka,\u201d said Matt Pomeroy, Belvedere\u2019s global director of education. \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing to talk about with bartenders and consumers, because there\u2019s been no innovation. Now, there\u2019s a conversation to be had.\u201d\u201cThe combination of things in the air create such a different type of flavor,\u201d Mr. Erenzo said \u2014 flavors that might be different if he had set up shop even a few miles away.\u201cWe take a holistic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to build up a whole system around us.\u201dFor all its energy, the terroir movement in distilling is still small, and many of the industry\u2019s leading figures remain unpersuaded. Adherents disagree, but they admit that so far, laboratory testing, while promising, is inconclusive. Wigle\u2019s Terroir Project, for example, didn\u2019t control for the varieties of rye, which could also explain flavor differences. And even if tests did show a difference, it\u2019s not a given that drinkers used to industrial-scale whiskey would appreciate it.\u201cWe have to balance geeking out with how much this all impacts the consumer,\u201d Ms. Marshall, of High Wire, said.What both terroir skeptics like Mr. Kinsman and advocates like Ms. Marshall and Mr. Blackwell agree on is the importance of learning to talk about regionally specific spirits \u2014 whether that uniqueness comes from the soil and the climate that foster the crops, or the culture and techniques that manipulate them into vodka, rum or whiskey.\u201cWilliam Faulkner liked to say that even his postage-stamp of soil in Mississippi was worth writing about,\u201d Mr. Blackwell said. \u201cIf we can find something special about this place and suspend it in a bottle, then we\u2019ve found something honest and delicious and pure.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Lesson for Journalists From Today\u2019s TV", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTelevision dramas and comedies thrive on complexity. But journalism\u2019s reductive picture of society makes America more polarized and feeds the extremes.Ms. Rosenberg is a co-founder of an organization that supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems.Why do fictional television shows often do better than factual journalism at giving viewers a truer sense of the world in all its complexity?Here\u2019s a big reason: TV script writers understand that viewers can deal with nuance and contradictions. Good TV, whether cable or broadcast, shows us fully rounded people grappling with challenges that viewers can identify with on some level, invented and over the top though they may be. They can be larger than life, like the mafia-don-in-therapy Tony Soprano, or more ordinary people like Coach and Mrs. Coach, doing the hard work of marriage on the Texas high-school football drama \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d or Gretchen Cutler, a narcissistic sociopath on the road to maturity on \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst.\u201dThese characters don\u2019t always have the answers. They believe and do contradictory things. Stuff doesn\u2019t always work out. You know, reality.Viewers don\u2019t just tolerate complexity \u2014 they demand it. The one-dimensional characters of early network television dramas would seem boring and fake today.Journalists, however, too often seem to believe that audiences can\u2019t handle complexity. There are exceptions, but a vast majority of journalism actively avoids it. Or we quote both sides and think that\u2019s complexity. Like television writers, we are searching for a compelling story, but we tend to find it in the clash of the shrillest sound bites rather than in the fine distinctions that transmit important truths. If we have details or quotes that don\u2019t fit the narrative, we often strip them out. It\u2019s not fake news. It is all based on facts. But much too often it presents the most cartoonish and reductive picture of a very intricate world.The consequences of this are severe. It increases polarization. Both Republicans and Democrats believe that people from the other party are more extreme than they really are \u2014 and that\u2019s because journalists tend to present the extreme voices. People\u2019s views are not one-dimensional, and there\u2019s a lot we agree on. (A majority of Republicans favor regulating carbon emissions, for example.) But that doesn\u2019t get reported, while conflict does. When people feel attacked, they get defensive, close down and go on the attack themselves. They stop listening. Ms. Ripley reported on the research of the Difficult Conversations Laboratory at Columbia University. It assigned two people who disagree on an issue to discuss it. But first, they had to read a short article on a different controversial topic. If the article was simple and reductive, the conversation that followed tended to break down in negativity. But if the participants read an article that emphasized complexity \u2014 various points of view, more nuance, more attempt to understand the root of each side\u2019s beliefs \u2014 the conversation was much more productive. People didn\u2019t get converted. But they came away with a better understanding of why the other person thought that way, and more willingness to keep listening and talking. It\u2019s obviously easier to present complex characters in a book, documentary or long story than in daily journalism. But the principle still holds: Don\u2019t cartoonify. Bringing out complexity is possible even in the shortest pieces, and it would make our journalism more compelling, more impactful and more true. So here\u2019s what journalists can learn from scripted TV:They found a series of missed opportunities that revealed many of the mistakes daily reporters make that simplify and reduce reporting on politics. At the end of it, the lesson for viewers was that our divisions are intractable \u2014 not surprising, since intractability was what Ms. Winfrey sought to bring out. Viewers learned very little. She asked closed, yes-or-no questions. When someone had a response that indicated particularly interesting or complex thinking, she failed to explore it. She failed to broaden the debate with questions such as \u201cWhat is dividing us?\u201d She actually asked people for one-word responses. Several people made overtures to the other side; Ms. Winfrey ignored them. Even short news pieces can find different sets of people to quote, voices that express more subtle views. It\u2019s not just political stories and person-on-the-street interviews in which this happens. Journalists oversimplify in reported features as well \u2014 TV news features often seem more scripted than real, with characters who are entirely heroic or entirely villainous. We often over-claim, making a problem sound completely intractable or making a response sound as if it has now solved everything. Sorry, not credible. We need to realize that news consumers can handle shades of gray. This is the age of the television antihero. Television is full of horrible people. But showrunners know viewers wouldn\u2019t spend time with Dexter Morgan, the serial killer, or Walter White, the meth king, if we couldn\u2019t understand why they do what they do. They have back stories, and present moments in which they reveal their motivations. It\u2019s not just poor communities of color who get this treatment \u2014 every marginalized group does. Many people who live in the South or Appalachia feel mocked by the national media, which tends to look for the people with four teeth. \u201cYes, we do things that make us look like ignorant yahoos,\u201d an Alabamian told me. \u201cBut we also do other things \u2014 and you\u2019re not interested in that.\u201d Reporting by stereotype isn\u2019t necessarily inaccurate. But it\u2019s surely incomplete. In journalism, the wealthier and whiter you are, the more likely you are to be shown doing stuff. The farther you are from wealthy and white, the more likely you are to appear in the media having stuff done to you \u2014 either as a victim or as a person \u201cserved\u201d by a wealthier do-gooder. The stories of what these people are doing take a little work to find, since they don\u2019t have public relations firms or show up on the police scanner. But the work isn\u2019t hard. Journalists could just ask their sources: Who\u2019s doing things that I should know about? In universities across the United States, students watch \u201cThe Wire\u201d in urban sociology classes. It\u2019s a far richer and more vivid description of the world of drug dealers than any piece of journalism (which is one reason its creator, David Simon, left journalism for TV). The job of journalism is to hold a mirror up to society. Too often, though, stories about social issues feature static quotes instead of showing people facing challenges in their lives. Too often the stories are boring and simplistic. They are true, but they don\u2019t ring true. Advertisement"}

That\u2019s right, a Thursday.The election was initially scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11, but it was changed amid concerns that the date coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana and the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Primary elections generally suffer from abysmal turnout, but the decision by the Legislature to hold the primaries on a Thursday \u2014 rather than another Tuesday \u2014 is likely to confuse voters and to lower turnout further, giving a bigger boost to incumbents. Here are a few ideas to fight back and make these races for governor, attorney general, State Legislature and local judgeships more competitive. Depending on their party registration (and Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one in New York), voters have the chance to weigh in on Democratic, Republican or third-party primaries, and even unaffiliated voters can cast ballots, in the Reform Party primary.Mayor Bill de Blasio could ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts by allocating more money to the New York City Campaign Finance Board, a nonpartisan agency that sends people to knock on doors and call voters.The board might even still have time to place ads in subways and buses.

She was 14 when we took our first 200-mile backpacking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail, the great ribbon running through mountains and deserts from Mexico to Canada. It was just the two of us and a few million mosquitoes. One great thing about hiking with my daughter is that mosquitoes love to dine on her, thus neglecting me. On that trip, even DEET repellent and a head net couldn\u2019t fend them off:\u201cDad! I just counted! I have 49 mosquito bites on my forehead alone!\u201dShe was an old hand at outdoor masochism, for we had been going on family backpacking trips since before she turned 2. First, she and I resolved to complete the Pacific Crest Trail in my home state, Oregon. Then we decided to spend a few years hiking across Washington State. After that, how could we not complete California as well?Each day on the trail, we rose with the sun, carried all our possessions on our shoulders, filled our water bottles from creeks, rested in meadows dazzling with alpine wildflowers, bathed in rivers, and at dusk found a flat spot on which to unroll our sleeping bags and fall asleep while counting shooting stars.So if you\u2019ll indulge me once more, a few lessons from the wilderness:President Trump\u2019s turmoil isn\u2019t the only important thing in the world; another is family.The upshot is that today every American inherits a stunning patrimony, a piece of some of the most beautiful terrain in the world. You may not be able to afford a weekend house, but you\u2019re already a shared landlord of spectacular wilderness. For a day at a time, my daughter and I \u201cowned\u201d dazzling camping spots that even Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett can never buy. On our public lands, no one can pull rank on you \u2014 except a bear.In contrast, the wilderness is almost always too hot or too cold. It is vast and unbending, reminding us that we are not the lords of the universe, but atoms in the firmament. We are put in our place.Our most memorable segments of the Pacific Crest Trail were the ones that tormented us. There were exhausting 25- and 30-mile days through the searing deserts of Southern California, and cold rains and icy nights in Washington.Nature disciplined us, and sometimes frightened us, by making us ford high rivers, cross steep snow banks \u2014 or by getting us lost. Early one hiking season in the mountains of Oregon, when the trail disappeared beneath several feet of snow that had refused to melt, we became utterly lost for a couple of days, so I was thrilled to eventually come across footprints in the snow: We had stumbled on a trail! But after a while, my daughter noticed that the footprints had claws.\u201cDad,\u201d she said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a bear you\u2019re following.\u201dI\u2019m on a book leave this summer, and also glued to the news from Washington. But my escape to the wilderness is an annual therapy session, anchoring me to family and helping put me in my place.My legs are sore, my blisters are horrifying, and it looks as if I\u2019ll lose a few toenails.

What do you do with broken bikes? And what\u2019s the best way to get a bike out of a tree?Here in New York, those questions fall to Gil Kazimirov, 26, a general manager for Lime, one of our city\u2019s four dockless bikes operators.We recently spent an afternoon in the Rockaways with Mr. Kazimirov as he made repairs, checked in on bikes and responded to complaints.But first, we helped him rebalance the fleet.\u201cIn a dockless system, people can park the bike anywhere, which means that bikes can end up in less popular areas,\u201d Mr. Kazimirov said. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to make sure that people can get a bike when and where they need it.\u201dTo accomplish that, Lime uses bike trip data to pinpoint \u201chot spots,\u201d or locations where bikes are in high demand, and has employees move bikes to the hot spots from less popular areas.\u201cSometimes it means taking a bike from someone\u2019s house to the subway station before the evening rush hour, or moving a bike from Jacob Riis beach to the ferry on the weekend,\u201d Mr. Kazimirov said.Mr. Kazimirov checked an app on his phone. He saw a bike that had been idle for three days, meaning it needed to be moved.We found it on the sidewalk in an industrial part of the neighborhood.\u201cThis is what we\u2019d call a desert,\u201d Mr. Kazimirov said as we picked up the bike. \u201cYou can see there\u2019s not much traffic here.\u201dThen a distress call came in about a bike in Far Rockaway.\u201cIt looks like someone complaining that the bike is in front of their house,\u201d Mr. Kazimirov said.After a bit of searching, we found the bright green bike in a driveway on Beach 64th Street.And over the last few weeks, the types of complaints have changed, he said.\u201cWhen we first put them out, people would call in and say there was an abandoned bike, thinking that someone would steal them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d arrive and there\u2019d be nothing wrong.\u201cIt takes awhile for people to realize that, oh, the bike can just be there and it doesn\u2019t have to be in a dock,\u201d he added. \u201cEventually, they will just become part of the scenery.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Remember when everyone was complaining about snow showers in April and begging for warm weather?Well, now Mother Nature is letting us have it.Yes, East Harlem.The festival begins tonight with musical performances at 6 p.m. and continues with food vendors, games and dancing throughout the weekend.The lifting of the giglio starts at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.

{"Headline": "The Failure of Egypt\u2019s Revolution", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionDavid D. Kirkpatrick\u2019s engrossing account of his time as the New York Times Cairo bureau chief covering the Egyptian revolution, \u201cInto the Hands of the Soldiers,\u201d is a less uplifting but more instructive tale. He brings two new contributions to his retelling. One is The Times\u2019s extraordinary access to decision makers. Kirkpatrick gives an unmatched blow-by-blow of the Obama administration\u2019s Egypt diplomacy, with the Americans\u2019 mixed signals undercutting its impact. Of greater general interest in understanding the final outcome are Kirkpatrick\u2019s extensive interviews with Egyptian officials and with Morsi\u2019s aides. Kirkpatrick\u2019s other key contribution is his willingness to plunge into the messy, sprawling street violence, and show how each side could perceive itself a victim and step up its own provocative tactics in response.Egypt was Kirkpatrick\u2019s first Mideast posting. He presents himself as a bit na\u00efve, awed by the density of Cairo, fascinated by Islam and veiling. Only months after his arrival, upheaval erupted across the Arab world, and Mubarak\u2019s seemingly iron grip on Egypt was broken by the last people anyone expected to be consequential \u2014 the liberal activists, whose networks were tiny compared with the state or the deeply rooted Islamist organizations.Morsi had been president for nearly half a year, and had learned that winning elections was not the same thing as governing. The police, who detested him, allowed a wave of crime to shake public confidence in his government. Kirkpatrick had been in close contact with Morsi\u2019s aides as tensions rose. He found the Islamist administration to be confused, unsure how to assert its authority and pathetically desperate to curry favor with the police. Morsi\u2019s decree was most likely an attempt to pre-empt a ruling by Egypt\u2019s Mubarak-era high court that could cripple his presidency \u2014 grossly undemocratic for sure, but no more so than the judges\u2019 clear partisanship.At the height of the crisis, protesters opposed to Morsi surrounded the presidential palace. It was one of those huge confrontations where no individual could see everything. Most protesters were peaceful, though some tossed Molotov cocktails over the walls. The police mainly stood aside. The Islamists called out their own supporters, and civilian fought civilian in a night of street battles. About a dozen died, mostly from gunfire. Kirkpatrick traced the deaths as best as he could and believes the great majority of those killed were Islamists. He recognized that both sides could reasonably see themselves as victims of thuggery.Many of the activists insisted they didn\u2019t want a coup, but army intervention could mean nothing else. After huge marches on June 30, the military ousted Morsi. The president\u2019s supporters retired to two encampments. Clashes periodically erupted nearby and hundreds of people died, some Islamists killed by the government and some bystanders killed by the Islamists. Television stations called for a crackdown on the Islamist \u201ccockroaches,\u201d and many activists joined in. \u201cI had fallen in love with the young liberals of Egypt. It broke my heart to see them like this,\u201d Kirkpatrick says.On Aug. 14, the army finally moved on the encampments. Kirkpatrick and el-Sheikh were among the small number of journalists who witnessed the ensuing massacre. They spent hours sheltering from heavy, relentless gunfire, counting the bodies that went by. All told there were probably over 1,000 deaths. But by then, the country was ready to move on. The morning after, Kirkpatrick returned to the site to find a group of happy youths dancing to a pop song praising Sisi and the army.Egypt wanted stability and Sisi provided it, or at least its vestige. There was no more tolerance for protests. The new regime was even more harsh than Mubarak\u2019s. New demonstrations were crushed and the organizers jailed. Kirkpatrick lingers on the bitter aftermath, as former comrades exchanged recriminations whenever Facebook reminded them of the anniversaries of important marches. \u201cWe were so blinded by hatred. \u2026 We were non-Jews in Nazi Germany,\u201d one concluded. \u201cWe failed the test.\u201d The regime had already come for the Islamists and there was no one left for them.\u201cInto the Hands of the Soldiers\u201d is a journalist\u2019s eye view, not a comprehensive history. Kirkpatrick ignores or skips quickly through key grievances of the anti-Morsi movement, both the contrived (the Islamists blackmailed the army into rigging elections for them) and the genuine (Islamists were complicit in killings near the protest camps and in post-coup violence against Christians). Nor does he really treat the army\u2019s partisans as having legitimate fears of their own.Kirkpatrick suggests that if the activists had lived with Morsi\u2019s illiberal but weak rule until he could be voted out, democracy might have had a chance. Their mistake, he says, was \u201cthey trusted Sisi.\u201d They chose the greater of two evils. But he doesn\u2019t fully explore the risks of sticking with Morsi. Nor does he analyze how a revolution works, how power can be seized and lost so easily. The closest he comes is a remark that political power is like \u201cfairy-tale magic\u201d that only works if you believe in it. That observation is actually well-rooted in political theory: Revolutions happen when enough people stop blindly accepting that it\u2019s futile to resist the current regime.The activists\u2019 ability to organize street demonstrations, I would argue, was the kind of \u201cmagic\u201d that \u2014 for limited periods \u2014 could make a revolution (or a coup) possible. However, they never really understood its limits. I remember liberals in 2013 brushing off the threat from Sisi: If he tried to seize power, they\u2019d just make another revolution. They didn\u2019t grasp that you get only so many chances at revolution. A week of civil disorder is thrilling; three years are exhausting. Alliances broken are hard to rebuild. If you throw out too many elected governments, even bad ones, you\u2019ll throw out democracy with them.Kirkpatrick closes with Donald Trump\u2019s election as president. Obama could never decide how to handle Sisi but Trump\u2019s administration has been unconflicted: He is a strong leader for a region that can\u2019t handle democracy. Perhaps Egypt and the United States are not so different in that. The American president\u2019s nepotism and his paranoia about the \u201cdeep state\u201d are familiar to Egyptian activists. \u201cSo deliciously third world,\u201d one quipped. However, recognizing a leader\u2019s authoritarian tendencies is easy. The trick is to resist them in ways that don\u2019t erode democratic norms even further.Steve Negus has covered the Middle East since 1993.

You don\u2019t brag about your net worth. You don\u2019t share your salary with colleagues. You try not to ask your friends about their rent, even if it helps put your budget in perspective.We\u2019re discouraged from talking about money at every turn, but if you want to fix your financial situation, talking about it is necessary.Even setting aside that social taboo of discussing money, there are practical hurdles in your way to getting better at money: Learning about money is intimidating, and there\u2019s no structural system in place to teach us. Further still, we look at poor money skills as something to be ashamed and embarrassed of, which can keep us from being honest about money and seeking out the right kind of help. \u201cWe all know physical health numbers, like BMI, weight and clothing sizes, so we can assess where we fall on that spectrum,\u201d Ms. McLay said. \u201cBecause of a lack of agreed upon financial metrics, people feel fear or shame around what their finances look like.\u201d \u201cIf your finances cause you stress and anxiety, it\u2019s natural to want to keep this to yourself because you might feel embarrassed or ashamed about the decisions you made,\u201d she said.Ms. Mclay added: \u201cWhen you ignore your financial situation, minor problems happening on a regular basis build up to very substantial challenges.\u201dIt\u2019s time we all change the story and open up about money.As wages continue to stagnate and the income gap continues to widen, talking and learning about money is crucial for change.O.K., so you\u2019re convinced: Talking about money is important. So how do we begin?\u201cWhile it may be convenient to discuss whether you\u2019re spending too much on travel while you\u2019re in the car on a road trip, it can lead to a much healthier conversation if you sit down with a list of topics to discuss,\u201d she said. Pick a regular time to hold money meetings and talk about any financial goals, setbacks and habits. This will help you avoid fighting about those topics in the future. \u201cThe more we talk about our situations and either accept them or work on improving them, the healthier our relationship with money will get,\u201d she said.This also creates the possibility for learning. Maybe your friend tells you how she paid off her loan early, for example. Or maybe she just starts suggesting cheaper hangout alternatives. Either way, you invite better financial habits and solutions when you break the money taboo.\u201cSet three to four financial goals, like saving $5,000 or making $45,000 a year in a job, and start working toward those goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more financial goals you achieve, the more comfortable you\u2019ll get with your financial situation.\u201d\u201cThere are very few financial problems that improve by ignoring or neglecting them,\u201d Ms. Bailie added. \u201cWhen you begin to understand the value of being open and transparent about money, it starts to feel like an imperative.\u201d Illustration by Benedikt RugarAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sambal, a Pungent Reminder of Home and Hardship", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are more than 300 varieties of the spicy chile paste, born in Southeast Asian villages and passed down through generations.When my mom cooked sambal from scratch, she moved with controlled haste. Her eyebrows would furrow as she used her index finger to mix belacan, a pungent shrimp paste, with water. \u201cOpen all the windows!\u201d she would suddenly yell, her warning to my brother, father and me that fiery chiles would be hitting her oiled wok in a few minutes. Even with windows opened wide, the fumes from sizzling capsaicin invoked coughing fits and heavy breathing.My mother, who can neither read nor write, never used a cookbook; her version of sambal, a spicy chile paste that is a staple of Southeast Asian households, was passed down to her through generations of our family when we lived in Singapore. Since moving to New York, I\u2019m more than 2,000 miles but just one phone call away from my mother, who now lives in West Texas. When I recently called to ask for her sambal recipe to satiate my intense pregnancy hankerings, she gave her usual obscure measurements, like \u201chalf a packet of chiles\u201d and \u201cyou keep tasting and add until you know it\u2019s enough.\u201d From about age 5, I remember mixing sambal into white rice, fried fish, boiled eggs, stir-fried cabbage and a splash of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), a meal my mom prepared often. At times, the heat levels of her sambal reduced me to tears, but I never shied away from adding a scoop.Sambal is an essential ingredient in Malaysian, Singaporean and Indonesian cuisines. There are more than 300 varieties, and each household has its own version, depending on the dish, family palate and heat preference.Sambal oelek, the most basic kind and the one most familiar to Americans, is typically made of red chiles, vinegar and salt. The word oelek derives from the Indonesian ulekan dan cobek, the stone mortar and pestle used to prepare sambal. More elaborate versions can include shrimp paste, tamarind, ikan bilis (anchovies), garlic, lemongrass, ginger, shallots, scallions, palm sugar, coconut, rice vinegar or juice from the calamansi, a Southeast Asian citrus fruit that\u2019s a cross between a kumquat and a mandarin orange. In Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian cooking, sambal ikan bilis is a must-have condiment alongside nasi lemak, a fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and served with spicy curry, crisp fried anchovies, toasted peanuts, a hard-boiled egg and sliced fresh cucumbers. Sambal is as adaptable as the indigenous cooks who created it, and can be used as a marinade for skate, a base for curries, a sauce for stir-fries or a simple dip for fresh vegetables. Sambal\u2019s new popularity in the United States has made me both excited and territorial. In 1999, when I was 8, my family moved from Singapore to Alpine, Tex., a rural town of 5,000 where my father grew up. When you\u2019re living thousands of miles from your home country, craving your mother\u2019s or grandmother\u2019s sambal is like getting hit with a wave of nostalgia from a fond childhood memory you can\u2019t fully recreate.Food, especially dishes that were made and shared communally, has a way of linking us back to our families\u2019 generational hardships and triumphs. There\u2019s a rich and labor-intensive history in the ritual of preparing sambal that should be remembered, and perhaps even revered.My mother, Rosni Pattillo, grew up in a Malay kampong, or village, in Singapore during the 1950s and \u201960s. As a girl from a poor family with a strict father, she wasn\u2019t allowed to attend school. At age 11, instead of learning math and grammar in primary school like her brothers, she helped women in her kampong make and sell sambal for pocket money.As a child, she would squat hunched over a long rectangular stone in her neighbor\u2019s yard to pound the red chiles, garlic and belacan into a paste with a blunt rock that served as a makeshift pestle, a fairly common technique in kampongs. Her father told her that the day is not complete \u201c\u2018if you don\u2019t let sambal teach you a lesson.\u2019 she said. \u201cMeaning, the heat from sambal awakens your senses in your body.\u201d Ms. Eusope recalled how her grandmother roasted fresh red and green chiles in front of their kampong house every afternoon and mashed them in a granite mortar with a four-foot-tall pestle that required at least three people to lift. Ms. Eusope\u2019s job was to keep a close eye on the roasting chiles so they wouldn\u2019t burn; she later graduated to stirring the paste of chiles, limes, coriander seed and fermented soybean in a large wok in front of their home. The family made sambal several times a week; there were no refrigerators. Her grandmother would make packets of sambal and nasi lemak, and go from kampong to kampong selling them. \u201cFor my family, the women in our household are actually the captain of a ship,\u201d Ms. Eusope said. \u201cI remember watching my grandmother giving direction while stirring the pots, and no one ever talked back or ignored her. She is the glue to her ship that ties everything together.\u201dMost immigrants I know desperately miss their mother or grandmother\u2019s cooking, and yearn for recipes that were never documented.Instead, it was sambal that inspired her to experiment in her kitchen for the first time. Like most Southeast Asian home cooks, Mrs. Coombes\u2019s mother cooked from instinct and left little reference for anyone who wanted to replicate her recipes. Luckily, Mrs. Coombes had an old sambal cookbook that she had found in Malaysia. \u201cSambal ikan bilis is the first sambal I ever made. It blew my head off because I put so much chiles in it because I didn\u2019t know how to judge it,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, these recipes are not really tested, but it gave me an idea of what\u2019s inside.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Says", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 Myanmar\u2019s army commander and other top generals should face trial in an international court for genocide against Rohingya Muslims and for crimes against humanity targeting other ethnic minorities, United Nations experts said on Monday after a yearlong investigation.Myanmar has rejected allegations of widespread atrocities, asserting that its security forces were simply responding to attacks by Rohingya militants on Myanmar police posts and an army station on Aug. 25 last year. But the panel said there was enough information to warrant investigation and prosecution of senior officers \u201cso that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide.\u201dThe panel found evidence of genocidal intent in the operation, citing the prevailing rhetoric of hate directed at the Rohingya and statements by military commanders as well as \u201cthe level of organization indicating a plan for destruction; and the extreme scale and brutality of the violence.\u201dMyanmar\u2019s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and other civilian authorities \u201ccontributed to the commission of atrocity crimes\u201d by failing to use their positions to stop them, the panel said.Elsewhere, \u201cscorched earth\u201d operations by the military against Kachin and Shan ethnic minorities in northern Myanmar revealed similar patterns of attacks and sexual violence against civilians, the panel said.The accounts, collected from victims and eyewitnesses, \u201cwill leave a mark on all of us for the rest of our lives,\u201d Mr. Darusman told reporters in Geneva.Myanmar refused access and cooperation to the investigation, which based its report on 875 interviews and documents compiled in numerous field missions to Bangladesh and neighboring countries. \u201cOnly verified and corroborated information was relied upon,\u201d it said.The Tatmadaw\u2019s tactics were \u201cconsistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats\u201d in Rakhine State and in Myanmar\u2019s north, it said.The United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, has previously condemned the army\u2019s actions as ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide, but the panel\u2019s unequivocal assertion is likely to increase pressure for immediate international action.The panel said the United Nations Security Council should refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court or set up an international tribunal like those that investigated genocide and atrocities in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.

I\u2019m also leaning heavily on sauces like the salsa verde below, one of those little miracles you can make ahead, store in the fridge, then put on practically anything to bring it to life: simple steak, chicken, seafood, eggs. Or you could spoon it over sliced tomatoes for an unimprovable summer salad.Here are five dishes for the week:Here\u2019s that salsa verde I mentioned, made with parsley, garlic and capers, and paired with grilled cod, though you could easily do what I do and broil it. Serve with farro and green beans, topped liberally with that sauce for extra zing.This dish matches parsley, mint and garlic with grilled or broiled chicken thighs, then adds a cool yogurt sauce alongside for dipping. You could let the chicken marinate for 15 minutes while you pull together the rest of the meal: maybe cucumbers and tomatoes, to douse with the yogurt, and a pot of grains. Or you could prep the chicken and let it marinate up to 24 hours before cooking, a small gift you can give your future self.Very fast, and very good. Salt the shrimp, and then use the next 15 minutes to make a green salad and put a pot of rice on the stove. (Or, even better, skip the rice and use crusty bread to soak up pan sauce.) Then saut\u00e9 the shrimp, and you\u2019re done. Buy the best wild shrimp you can find and afford, and use regular red-pepper flakes instead of dried chiles you crumble yourself.

{"Headline": "Clues to Your Health Are Hidden at 6.6 Million Spots in Your DNA", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a sophisticated new algorithm, scientists have found a way to forecast an individual\u2019s risks for five deadly diseases.Scientists have created a powerful new tool to calculate a person\u2019s inherited risks for heart disease, breast cancer and three other serious conditions. By surveying changes in DNA at 6.6 million places in the human genome, investigators at the Broad Institute and Harvard University were able to identify many more people at risk than do the usual genetic tests, which take into account very few genes. The researchers are now building a website that will allow anyone to upload genetic data from a company like 23andMe or Ancestry.com. Users will receive risk scores for heart disease, breast cancer, Type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammatory bowel disease and atrial fibrillation. People will not be charged for their scores.A risk score, including obtaining the genetic data, should cost less than $100, said Dr. Daniel Rader, a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Rader, who was not involved with the study, said the university will soon be offering such a test to patients to assess their risk for heart disease. For now, the university will not charge for it.Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, senior author of the new paper and director of the Center for Genomic Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team had validated the heart risk calculation in multiple populations. The new tool also can find people at the low end of the risk range for the five diseases. This should prove useful to certain patients: for example, a woman who is trying to decide when she should start having regular mammograms, or a 40-year-old man with a slightly high cholesterol level who wants to know if he should take a statin. Still, there are concerns about how the genetic test will be used. \u201cIt carries great hope, but also comes with a lot of questions,\u201d said Dr. David J. Maron, director of preventive cardiology at Stanford University. \u201cWho should get tested? How should the results be provided? Physicians are not generally well trained to provide genetic test results.\u201d And, he wondered, will the results actually lead people to make decisions that improve their health?People may need genetic counseling before and after getting these sorts of risk scores, noted Eric Schadt, dean of precision medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Patients may not appreciate the consequences of learning they have a high likelihood of having a heart attack or breast cancer or one of the other diseases the test assesses.\u201cDo people really understand that once you learn something you cannot unlearn it?\u201d said Dr. Schadt, who is also chief executive of Sema4, a diagnostics company. But medical experts said this sort of risk assessment is the wave of the future. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can stop it,\u201d said Dr. John Mandrola, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Baptist Health in Louisville, Ky. The study began because there was general agreement among researchers that many common diseases are linked not to one mutation, but rather to thousands or millions of mutations, said the first author of the new paper, Dr. Amit V. Khera, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Broad Institute.In recent years, scientists have cataloged more than 6 million tiny changes in DNA that slightly affect the chances that people will get various diseases. Each of those genetic alterations has such a small effect \u2014 a 1 percent or so increase or decrease in a person\u2019s odds of getting a disease \u2014 that it would not be helpful to test for each one in isolation.Then they had to test the risk scores they obtained. Dr. Khera and his colleagues turned to the U.K. Biobank, which holds genetic and disease information on half a million people. The investigators found that their algorithm did predict the odds of being diagnosed with one of the five diseases. But the U.K. Biobank consists mostly of white Europeans. So the investigators also tested and validated their method in populations of East Asians, South Asians, African Americans and Hispanics. The researchers also tried their algorithm on 20,000 patients who were seen at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. They found that those who had a high risk score for a heart attack were indeed four times more likely to have had a heart attack than other patients.\u201cUnless I do this genetic testing, there is no way I could pick those people out,\u201d Dr. Khera said.Just as important is finding people at very low risk, he and other researchers said.At the University of Pennsylvania, doctors will incorporate risk scores on heart attacks into advice to patients on preventive care. Dr. Rader said he often sees healthy patients in their 30s and 40s with a family history of heart disease. They have borderline levels of LDL cholesterol, the dangerous kind. But many do not want to start taking a statin.For now, he said, he does his best to assess their risk, then tells some of them \u201cit\u2019s kind of up to you\u201d whether to take a statin. But that advice \u201cis not very satisfying,\u201d he said.A sophisticated genetic risk score might decide the matter. \u201cIf you have a really high score, here\u2019s your prescription,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your score is pretty low, you can hold off.\u201dThis sort of sophisticated genetic analysis is still very new, Dr. Mandrola noted. But, he said, in five or 10 years doctors \u201cmay look back on the way they predict risk today and ask, \u2018What were we thinking?\u2019\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The State Should Stay Clear of the Confession Booth", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRequiring priests to turn in people who confess to child abuse will backfire. That sentiment is easy to understand, particularly when you absorb the royal commission\u2019s discussion about the confession box. It was an ethos of forgiveness, inclined to view child sex abuse through the lens of sin, rather than crime. The consequences were devastating. Confessors and priests alike came to the misguided conclusion that God was the primary, or even the sole, victim of the abuse, leaving human victims to continue suffering. And yet the focus on the confession booth is not the answer, mainly because it\u2019s unlikely that priests will comply and turn in confessors. For a Catholic priest to violate the confessional seal and report a confessed abuser is to face the gravest spiritual penalty the church can muster: excommunication and eternal damnation. You don\u2019t need to value Canon Law or Catholicism to recognize that is an extremely serious matter for someone who does. So serious, in fact, that the state has no way of outbidding it. For all of its impressive rigor, the royal commission report simply doesn\u2019t engage with the question of what to do about a law that seems likely to be ignored. But the royal commission reported on testimony from several priests who said, in the words of one, that a priest hearing confessions \u201chas always been required to have at least \u2018moral certitude\u2019 of the penitent\u2019s contrition and purpose of amendment before granting absolution.\u201d This approach is far more likely to curtail reoffending than any attempt to compromise the institution of the confessional. It certainly addresses the commission\u2019s finding that the easy availability of absolution contributes to reoffending. It would increase the likelihood that abusers will go to the authorities since it is the only way they can receive forgiveness. And since keeping the state out of the confession booth wouldn\u2019t require priests to commit an excommunicable offense, it is far more likely to be applied than a law that extends mandatory reporting into the confessional booth.Whatever power the state possesses, it cannot simply rewrite Canon Law, and it cannot legislate away people\u2019s religious convictions, however much it might want to. The best approach would operate within the confines of Catholic practice, and thus remain equally persuasive anywhere it was adopted, whether in Victoria or Pennsylvania.Waleed Aly is a columnist and broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.Advertisement"}

Bannon but reviled by others who call him a violent purveyor of hate, was ordered to be freed on bail Wednesday, after challenging his conviction for contempt of court.Who is Tommy Robinson?Mr. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the English Defense League, an anti-Islam and anti-immigration movement known for violent street protests.Born and raised in Luton, north of London, he worked at the town\u2019s international airport but lost that job after assaulting an off-duty police officer. He was also arrested after being accused of inciting soccer violence, as a supporter of the Luton soccer club.\u201cWherever he has gone in his career he organized demonstrations that have resulted in extreme violence,\u201d said Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, an organization in London that researches hate groups.In 2012, Mr. Robinson was jailed for trying to enter the United States on somebody else\u2019s passport, and broke ties with the English Defense League.He founded a local branch of the German anti-Islam movement, Pegida, which was known for mass demonstrations against Islam in cities in eastern Germany. He drew support from right-wing politicians in Europe, like Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom.He contends that Muslims are disproportionately responsible for crime in Britain, particularly crimes against women and girls.He has claimed that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, \u201cis busy enforcing elements of Shariah right now.\u201dAnd he says that the people presented by mainstream media as moderate Muslims are actually dangerous extremists.Mr. Robinson was arrested outside a court in Leeds during a child sexual abuse trial. The restrictions on the news media in this case were common practice in England for trials in which judges fear that any media reports could influence the outcome.He had live streamed on Facebook for over an hour outside Leeds Crown Court, near the entrance, on May 25. In the broadcast, he revealed the identities of the defendants and the charges against them, and confronted some of them as they arrived in court.This fits very much Mr. Robinson\u2019s playbook, said Julia Ebner, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic Dialog, which works to counter extremism.\u201cEvery time he wants a campaign to go viral, he manages to trigger that with some provocative tweet or video,\u201d Ms. Ebner said. \u201cHe knew, of course, that he was crossing the boundaries of the law, but he did it because he has to feed his fan base through provocative actions.\u201dMr. Robinson and his supporters have argued that his case was about free speech. Yet, at rallies in Central London, his supporters were allowed to set up a stage and speak through loudspeakers near Britain\u2019s center of power.The judge added that an aggravating feature was that Mr. Robinson had encouraged others to share the video.Mr. Robinson attacked the judgment on a procedural basis, arguing that the court in Leeds had dealt with him summarily, as his sentence was pronounced hours after his broadcast occurred.\u201cTommy Robinson is not innocent today,\u201d Mr. Mulhall said, \u201cdespite how his supporters are attempting already to spin this.\u201dMr. Robinson previously had a nearly identical run-in with the law, after he broadcast video during the 2017 trial of four men who were later convicted of gang-raping a teenage girl. In that case, he was convicted of contempt of court, but received a suspended sentence.Mr. Robinson holds a prominent place among far-right groups, especially in the United States, who argued that his conviction had been in breach of free speech.He said, \u201cYou lose guys like Tommy Robinson you\u2019re not going to have a country.\u201dMr. Mulhall, of Hope Not Hate, said of Mr. Robinson, \u201cHe has become a rallying point around which people on the international far right have gathered.\u201dThis support has allowed Mr. Robinson, who had no regular income, to finance his activities through crowdfunding and financial help from like-minded organizations.While alliances among nationalist groups may seem a contradiction and have failed in the past, this new form of \u201cnationalist networking\u201d has been a success, Ms. Ebner said.\u201cBy partnering up internationally, they can really influence political discourse in their home countries by having such a loud voice,\u201d she said.Mr. Robinson is \u201cemblematic of the climate in which we are operating, the diminished power and importance of truth,\u201d Mr. Mulhall said, adding that the campaign for Mr. Robinson was \u201cin line in many ways with what we saw around the election of Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But refugee crises can go on for decades. Millions of refugees have lived in their country of shelter for more than 30 years. Two-thirds of humanitarian assistance \u2014 intended for emergencies \u2014 is spent on crises that are more than eight years old. \u201cAs long as the system is \u2018we feed you,\u2019 it\u2019s always going to be too expensive for the international community to pay for,\u201d Mr. Devictor said. It\u2019s gotten more and more difficult for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to raise that money; in many crises, the refugee agency can barely keep people from starving. It\u2019s even harder now as nations turn against foreigners \u2014 even as the number of people fleeing war and violence has reached a record high. Lebanon is host to approximately 1.5 million Syrian refugees, in addition to a half-million Palestinians, some of whom have been there for generations. One in three residents of Lebanon is a refugee. But something happened that could lead to real change: Beginning in 2015, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees crossed the Mediterranean in small boats and life rafts into Europe. Suddenly, wealthy European countries got interested in fixing a broken system: making it more financially viable, more dignified for refugees, and more palatable for host governments and communities. Donor countries agreed they would take more refugees and provide more long-term development aid to host countries: schools, hospitals, roads and job-creation measures that can help both refugees and the communities they settle in. \u201cIt looked at refugee crises as development opportunities, rather than a humanitarian risk to be managed,\u201d said Marcus Skinner, a policy adviser at the International Rescue Committee. There\u2019s a reason refugee camps exist: Host governments like them. Liberating refugees is a hard sell. In camps, refugees are the United Nations\u2019 problem. Out of camps, refugees are the local governments\u2019 problem. And they don\u2019t want to do anything to make refugees comfortable or welcome. Bangladesh\u2019s emergency response for the Rohingya has been staggeringly generous. But \u201cemergency\u201d is the key word. The government has resisted granting Rohingya schooling, work permits or free movement. It is telling Rohingya, in effect, \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about sticking around.\u201d This attitude won\u2019t deter the Rohingya from coming, and it won\u2019t send them home more quickly. People flee across the closest border \u2014 often on foot \u2014 that allows them to keep their families alive. And they\u2019ll stay until home becomes safe again. \u201cIt\u2019s the simple practicality of finding the easiest way to refuge,\u201d said Victor Odero, regional advocacy coordinator for East Africa and the Horn of Africa at the International Rescue Committee. \u201cAny question of policies is a secondary matter.\u201d However, though the refugees have work permits, Jordan has put only a moderate number of them into jobs.This is the model the United Nations wants the world to adopt.

Jo\u00ebl Boutroue, the head of the United Nations refugee agency in Uganda, said current humanitarian funding covered a quarter of what the crisis required. \u201cAt the moment, not even half of refugees go to primary school,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are around 100 children per classroom.\u201d The World Bank has so far approved two projects \u2014 one for water and sanitation and one for city services such as roads and trash collection. But they haven\u2019t gotten started yet. Mr. Devictor said that tackling long-term development issues was much slower than providing emergency aid. \u201cThe reality is that it will be confusing and confused for a little while,\u201d he said. Water, for example, is trucked in to Uganda\u2019s refugee settlements, as part of humanitarian aid. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge cost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we think this crisis is going to last for six more months, it makes sense. If it\u2019s going to last longer, we should think about upgrading the water system.\u201d Most refugee crises are not surprises, Mr. Devictor said. \u201cIf you look at a map, you can predict five or six crises that are going to produce refugees over the next few years.\u201d It\u2019s often the same places, over and over. That means developmental help could come in advance, minimizing the burden on the host. \u201cDo we have to wait until people cross the border to realize we\u2019re going to have an emergency?\u201d he said. Well, we might. If politicians won\u2019t respond to a crisis, it\u2019s hard to imagine them deciding to plan ahead to avert one. Political commitment, or lack of it, always rules. The world\u2019s new approach to refugees was born out of Europe\u2019s panic about the Syrians on their doorstep. But no European politician is panicking about South Sudanese or Rohingya refugees \u2014 or most crises. They\u2019re too far away. The danger is that the new approach will fall victim to the same political neglect that has crippled the old one. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Fake Group on Facebook Created Real Protests", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Black Elevation appeared to be an organization dedicated to fighting racism to the tens of thousands of people who visited its page on Facebook.The group promoted events and coordinated activities in several cities. It messaged activists and asked them to spread the word. It posted videos and photographs that encouraged people to show up at protest rallies. It even advertised a job opening.And it was all a lie. Black Elevation was actually part of an orchestrated political influence campaign, aimed at sowing divisions among Americans ahead of the midterm elections in November, according to Facebook.With 139,217 likes on its Facebook page, the influence campaign also showed an increased sophistication in understanding American culture and the use of technology, said Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. The creators of Black Elevation often used the colloquialisms of the activist community and relied on technology to mask their location, and may have even purchased fake followers to appear more popular.Facebook said the pages it recently removed had created roughly 30 real-world events since May 2017. The Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which analyzes misinformation online and works with Facebook, reviewed some of the pages and events, though the Black Elevation page does not appear to be among them.It was not clear why it was not among the pages the Atlantic Council was able to review. Facebook declined to comment on the Black Elevation page and would not say why it had removed the page before the council reviewed it.But following a trail of online bread crumbs, Mr. Albright detailed how Black Elevation leveraged tight-knit groups of activists in the United States to gain a following and persuade people to participate in real protest rallies.\u201cIt\u2019s clear from what we\u2019ve been able to find that this account was meant to provoke social class divides and create tension in marginalized communities,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThey were mimicking the language of activist pages and in some cases just copying them to attract followers.\u201d\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it was a false page,\u201d said Carla Cubit, an activist in New York who shared the page\u2019s Facebook events on her Twitter account. \u201cIt seemed legitimate.\u201dA woman who answered a telephone for Black Lives Matter in Memphis said she did not recall the event and did not know why it was posted on the group\u2019s YouTube page.Three activists who attended or promoted the Michael Brown events in the three cities said they were promoted by local chapters of the Black Lives Matter movement and in local email newsletters. The three people asked to not be identified because they feared being targeted by online trolls and they were embarrassed by their involvement with the Black Elevation Facebook page.The Black Elevation page was identical to other activist pages, down to the videos calling on the public to oppose racism, they said.No public evidence of those videos remains, but Mr. Albright was able to find at least two videos that were once posted on Facebook \u2014 one had 2.5 million views and the other about one million. One of the activists recalled a Black Elevation video being shared by several of his Facebook friends and said he joined the group shortly after viewing it.Another activist, who is a student at a university near Atlanta, said she joined the Black Elevation page when she noticed a paid advertisement for it on Facebook. The social media company confirmed that the group placed advertisements, though it would not reveal what demographic was the target or how much was spent on ads.In one of the few details offered about the page, Facebook said the group ran an advertisement seeking to hire an event coordinator. The ad for the part-time position, which was liked more than 1,000 times and shared nearly 300 times, promised payment in two parts, before and after the event.A student activist in New York said he applied, and was interviewed for the job over Facebook\u2019s Messenger app. He did not recall the name of the person conducting the interview, but said the interviewer asked few questions and made frequent spelling mistakes. He did not follow up afterward, and he said he was never contacted by the group again.Mr. Albright said it was the first time he had seen an influence campaign advertise for a paid position.Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the behavior of Black Elevation followed a pattern he observed with other Russian-backed influence campaigns.\u201cThey build these networks on the back of existing groups,\u201d said Mr. Nimmo. Once they persuaded several members of a group to trust them, they had a \u201cstamp of approval, which let them built out their reach in the community.\u201dThe Black Elevation organizers may have been trying to slide into the real world by hiring event coordinators or trying to persuade real activists to identify themselves as members of Black Elevation.Mr. Nimmo said all of the pages Facebook recently removed were aimed at left-wing activists in the United States. It is possible, he added, that a similar influence campaign has been focusing on right-wing activists.In a conference call with reporters last month, Facebook said it would work with officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share information on any influence operations it uncovered.\u201cI\u2019m sure this is something federal law enforcement are chasing, to try and see what more they can trace about this group by finding any payments they made,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cFor the people in the U.S., I don\u2019t think they did anything illegal. They just fell for the group like everyone else.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated in several instances the name of an activist group. It is Black Lives Matter, not Matters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Portrait of an Egyptian Neighborhood Breathing Toxic Dust", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensA photo essay by Mohamed Mahdy shows what it\u2019s like when your next-door neighbor is a cement factory that belches toxic dust. Today, black clouds of exhaust billow from the chimneys of the Alexandria Portland Cement Company, a subsidiary of a Greek cement and building materials producer, less than a mile away. Because Moon Valley lies directly in the path of the factory\u2019s emissions, toxic cement dust blankets the homes of nearly half of its residents, leading to numerous cases of chest infections and asthma. Many residents of Moon Valley come from Bedouin tribes that settled in Egypt\u2019s western desert centuries ago. While industrialization threatened their way of life, their descendants are now wrestling with a different consequence, one that literally threatens their well-being.  Mr. Mahdy, 22, lives just a 10-minute drive away. He started researching the problem two years ago when he learned that his friends\u2019 relatives had developed illnesses from the constant exposure to exhaust. He soon found other community members who suffered the same fate.  Mr. Mahdy \u2014 using black and white to expose \u201craw feelings\u201d \u2014 juxtaposed an image of Yousef, a boy with asthma who is confined to his home, with another image of children playing soccer. \u201cIt was really touching for me because he\u2019s still a kid and wants to live like other kids,\u201d Mr. Mahdy said. And soccer in Egypt is \u201ca big deal.\u201dIn one portrait, we see Amal, 11, wearing a breathing mask. In another, we see an X-ray of her weakened lungs. She developed asthma months after moving to Moon Valley at age 3, and has to wear the mask every day. Mr. Mahdy can relate: He also has asthma, so he knows how harmful the emissions can be. Nevertheless, he rented a place in the area and stayed in people\u2019s houses for a couple of weeks to immerse himself in his work. \u201cIt was really tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really tired, but I told myself, \u2018I can\u2019t see something if I\u2019m not actually there.\u2019\u201d He added that there\u2019s no avoiding the dust. \u201cYou eat it in your mouth\u201d as you walk through Moon Valley\u2019s streets, he said. Leave your window open for an hour, and a half-inch of dust would coat everything in your home. Worse, those who live close to the factory have to grapple not only with the fumes, but also with inescapable vibrations \u2014 strong enough to damage their homes \u2014 and noise pollution. The government has long ignored the pleas, until now. It\u2019s a promise of progress, and Mr. Mahdy hopes his project, \u201cMoon Dust,\u201d can keep the conversation going: He plans to exhibit his work in downtown Cairo in September and invite Moon Valley residents to share their stories with the media and environmental activists. \u201cI feel like if I bring those communities together in one place,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe something will change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Spoke for the Tree. Then He Got Fired.", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a little hillside in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, there is a patch of brown mulch that, until very recently, was a tree.It was not a rare kind of tree. It was not even a whole tree. It was the 10-foot-high living stump of what was once a mighty London plane tree, with a hollow inside big enough for people to stand in.The hollow tree had friends and fans. Children played in it. Adults stood in it and contemplated the inside-out view of the landscape. It served as shelter in downpours. People called it the treehouse tree.But according to the garden\u2019s management, the treehouse tree was an accident waiting to happen. It had sprouted a bushy head of new branches that it could not support in the long run. Playing inside it was against the garden\u2019s rules. The garden wanted to take the tree down to make room for a \u201cvigorous young tree\u201d that would help \u201cmake for a much healthier collection overall,\u201d it said in a letter to members.On July 23, the garden cut it down.The next day, he was fired.The garden would not say why, other than \u201cfor cause,\u201d citing the confidentiality of personnel matters, but a spokeswoman, Elizabeth Reina-Longoria, said, \u201cWe were saddened\u201d by the recommendation that people cancel their memberships.Mr. Baxt, 41, who worked at the garden for eight years, said the Lorax-like battle over one tree reflected a broader problem at the garden, a 52-acre preserve famed for its Cherry Esplanade and Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden and visited by nearly a million people a year.\u201cThis is ultimately a desperate plea for the garden to stop causing harm to itself,\u201d Mr. Baxt said.The garden, for its part, disagreed strongly, saying Mr. Baxt\u2019s representation was \u201cinaccurate\u201d and that \u201cstaff on all levels, as well as outside horticultural scientists, landscape architects and engineers with relevant expertise and knowledge\u201d were involved. \u201cStaff recommendations and feedback are always welcome and carefully considered,\u201d Ms. Reina-Longoria said in an email.By early July, a riot of green shoots, called suckers, had sprouted directly from the top of the stump.The question of whether these posed a danger was a matter of considerable debate.The garden said that because the tree\u2019s base was compromised, new branches would eventually pose a risk of falling, and that while the new growth could be pruned, that would require \u201cdisproportionate attention.\u201dMr. Baxt said pruning the tree would have taken only an hour or two a year.\u201cYou can\u2019t get any safer for a tree than a standing solid trunk with no load on it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo say it might be unsafe if branches grow out and get big enough to fall and hurt somebody \u2014 you could say that about any tree.\u201dMr. Baxt returned to the garden on Thursday for the first time since his termination. A security guard greeted him with a fist bump. \u201cI\u2019m mad, man,\u201d the guard said.Mr. Baxt stopped to point out a place where a tall shingle oak fell a few months ago, years after sustaining what he said was an easily avoidable wound at the base of the trunk, caused by construction equipment, that allowed fungus to enter and weaken the tree.The garden said the construction took place around 2004, before the current management was in place.\u201cThis is a museum, and the plants are the museum\u2019s collection,\u201d Mr. Baxt said. \u201cIf you think about it like MoMA \u2014 if they hire people to renovate and the staff says, \u2018You should really take these paintings off the wall first,\u2019 and they say, \u2018No, we\u2019re just going to paint, we\u2019ll avoid the edges of the paintings,\u2019 \u2014 how many years do you do that and just watch these paintings get slopped over?\u201dMr. Baxt led a reporter and photographer over to the scar where the treehouse tree had stood, about 50 feet from the garden\u2019s administrative offices. The three visitors were quickly escorted off the grounds in a golf cart.The garden\u2019s head arborist, Christopher Roddick, declined to comment by phone, but he echoed some of Mr. Baxt\u2019s broader concerns about management culture in a Facebook post after the firing. \u201cIn these times,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe message the executive class is sending is clear: working women and men should blindly obey orders with no questions asked, even when they are experts in their field.\u201dA former educator at the garden, LaShaun Ellis, said she missed the treehouse tree already.\u201cIt was just the sweetest thing,\u201d she said, \u201cthe way people gathered around it and just sort of fell in love with it as a sort of miniature bonsai version of its former self.\u201d Being inside a tree, she said, \u201cbrings you a lot closer to nature.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chicago Chain Kept Hawaiian Restaurants From Using \u2018Aloha Poke\u2019 Name", "Date": "2018-07-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAloha Poke Co., a Chicago-based restaurant chain, has been fighting to protect its trademarked, Hawaiian name for more than a year. It was not until this week, however, that the backlash to its efforts drew a public apology from the company.Though its name is Hawaiian, the company is not. The restaurant, which sells poke, a Hawaiian dish with seasoned chunks of raw fish, usually over rice, was founded in Chicago in 2016 \u2014 the same year it trademarked its name. In the months since, Aloha Poke has sent cease-and-desist letters asking businesses with similar names to find new ones.People in Hawaii were upset by the news, Kaniela Ing, a Hawaii state representative who urged people to boycott the company, said on Tuesday.He said it was especially ironic to see \u201caloha\u201d at the center of such a controversy because the word is representative of Hawaiian culture and can mean many things, including hello, goodbye and love.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to define,\u201d Mr. Ing said. \u201cBut I can say what it\u2019s not: It\u2019s not suing other people for using it.\u201d\u201cPerhaps the most important issue that needs to be set straight is the false assertion that Aloha Poke Co. has attempted to own either the word \u2018Aloha\u2019 or the word \u2018Poke,\u2019\u201d it said in the statement. \u201cNeither is true and we would never attempt to do so. Not ever.\u201d\u201cWe are truly sorry for all of the confusion that this has caused,\u201d it added.David Jacobsen, the owner of a poke restaurant in Bellingham, Wash., said he got one of the cease-and-desist letters last year. Back then, his restaurant was called Aloha Poke Fairhaven.\u201cWe were in no position to fight it,\u201d said Mr. Jacobsen, who was born in Hawaii. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very small. We\u2019re low budget.\u201dInstead of contesting the demands, the restaurant made the switch to its current name: Fairhaven Poke.While Mr. Jacobsen was taking down his website and changing his signs, Aloha Poke was expanding. Begun two years ago as a small food stall in Chicago, the company now has restaurants in several major cities including Los Angeles, Denver and Washington.The letters were an effort to stop trademark infringement, the company said in its statement. \u201cThis is a very common practice used across industries, and in particular, in the restaurant industry to protect the use of a business\u2019s name and brand.\u201dZach Friedlander, the company\u2019s founder, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But he said in a Facebook post on Monday that he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the reactions, adding that he left the company a few months ago.Despite lamenting that many facts had been \u201cleft out of the conversation on social media,\u201d Mr. Friedlander said that \u201cmore than anything I am truly sorry that anyone, especially native Hawaiians, have been offended by this situation.\u201dMr. Ing said the apologies were not enough. \u201cWe shared \u2018aloha\u2019 \u2014 and poke, for that matter \u2014 with him, and now he refuses to share it with us,\u201d he said of Mr. Friedlander.Mr. Jacobsen said that changing the name of his restaurant last year was inconvenient, but not too damaging for his business: Customers are still coming in for the fish he gets flown in from Hawaii.\u201cIt was the principle of it, more than anything, that we were upset with,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a business we\u2019ve actually moved on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Illness Is Bad Enough. The Hospital May Be Even Worse.", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe New Old AgeThe elderly are particularly vulnerable to \u201cpost-hospital syndrome,\u201d some experts believe, and that may be why so many patients return. When she moved from Michigan to be near her daughter in Cary, N.C., Bernadine Lewandowski insisted on renting an apartment five minutes away. Her daughter, Dona Jones, would have welcomed her mother into her own home, but \u201cshe\u2019s always been very independent,\u201d Ms. Jones said. Like most people in their 80s, Ms. Lewandowski contended with several chronic illnesses and took medication for osteoporosis, heart failure and pulmonary disease. Increasingly forgetful, she had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. She used a cane for support as she walked around her apartment complex. Still, \u201cshe was trucking along just fine,\u201d said her geriatrician, Dr. Maureen Dale. \u201cMinor health issues here and there, but she was taking good care of herself.\u201dBut last September, Ms. Lewandowski entered a hospital after a compression fracture of her vertebra caused pain too intense to be managed at home. Over four days, she used nasal oxygen to help her breathe and received intravenous morphine for pain relief, later graduating to oxycodone tablets. They believe it underlies the stubbornly high rate of hospital readmissions among older patients. In 2016, about 18 percent of discharged Medicare beneficiaries returned to the hospital within 30 days, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Ms. Lewandowski, for example, was back within three weeks. She had developed a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs, probably resulting from inactivity. The clot exacerbated her heart failure, causing fluid buildup in her lungs and increased swelling in her legs. She also suffered another compression fracture. \u201cThese hospitalizations can lead to big life changes,\u201d Dr. Dale said. Having grown too frail to live alone, Ms. Lewandowski, now 84, moved in with her daughter. As Medicare began penalizing hospitals for 30-day readmissions under the Affordable Care Act, he looked at the national data and noticed that most readmissions involved conditions seemingly unrelated to the initial diagnoses.Patients came in with heart failure or pneumonia, were treated and discharged, then returned with internal bleeding or injuries from a fall.\u201cOur general approach in a hospital is, all hands on deck to deal with the problem people come in with,\u201d Dr. Krumholz said. \u201cAll the other discomforts are seen as a minor inconvenience.\u201d He has argued instead that discharge marks the start of a 60- to 90-day period of increased vulnerability to a range of other health problems, stemming from the stress of hospitalization itself. \u201cThis is more than inconvenience,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is toxic. It\u2019s detrimental to people\u2019s recovery.\u201d Any hospital patient, or hovering family member, knows those stresses: Disrupted sleep, as staff draw blood and take vital signs at 4 a.m. A distorted sense of day and night. Unappetizing meals often served at inopportune times. Reduced muscle mass and poor balance following even a few days in bed. New prescriptions with unpredictable consequences. Shared rooms. Delirium. Pain.\u201cIt affects your hormones, your metabolism, your immune system,\u201d Dr. Krumholz said. \u201cAll these things have widespread effects,\u201d leaving people depleted and less able to stave off other health threats. The ripple effects vary considerably. Researchers at Yale followed discharged Medicare patients after hospitalizations for heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia. While post-hospital syndrome remains a hypothesis for now, research on several fronts may help establish its validity.\u201cThe more crowded it is when you come in, the more PTSD symptoms you\u2019ll have a month later,\u201d he concluded. Now the Columbia researchers are following 1,000 E.R. patients with heart attacks, tracking their weight and stress levels and giving each a wearable device to measure physical activity and sleep. The results may help substantiate the effects of post-hospital syndrome.\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten better and better at treating disorders, but we haven\u2019t gotten to the point where we avoid some of the collateral damage to the patient,\u201d Dr. Edmondson said.They could enable older patients, too, to wear their own clothes, get out of bed for walks (even with IV poles), eat enough to maintain their weight. They could assess how many lab tests patients actually need, and whether blood needs to be drawn before dawn. \u201cWe should never wake a sleeping patient unless there\u2019s a compelling reason, and that reason shouldn\u2019t be our own convenience,\u201d Dr. Krumholz said.But while we\u2019re waiting for hospitals to adopt such policies, we could try a D.I.Y. approach.Families can bring in favorite foods and help their relatives eat. They can ensure that patients have their hearing aids, dentures, eyeglasses, and walkers or canes to help them stay oriented and mobile. With a physician\u2019s O.K., they can accompany relatives on short strolls down the corridor to ward off deconditioning, and ask about curtailing wee-hour tests and readings. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put families in this position,\u201d Dr. Krumholz said. \u201cIt should come from the institution.\u201d But cultural change takes time.Among those moving in that direction is the University of North Carolina Hospitals Hillsborough Campus, where Bernadine Lewandowski had a private room, as all its geriatrics patients do. She was helped into a chair every day and encouraged to use a walker to reach her bathroom. The aftereffects proved profound, nonetheless. Already thin, she lost 15 pounds over two months. After her second hospitalization, she began wandering at night, apparently because of a new pain medication, and fell twice in two days. In April, she developed pneumonia, necessitating a third hospital stay.She\u2019s doing better now, her daughter said. After physical therapy, Ms. Lewandowski can climb the stairs, with someone at her elbow, to her second-floor room. Her weight has stabilized. She enjoys spending time with her family and visiting the hair salon every other week.But, Ms. Jones said, \u201cwe were hoping she\u2019d be with us for a short period and then return to her apartment.\u201d And that never happened.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of Dona Jones's mother. It is Lewandowski, not Lewandoski.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jewish Crossroads", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan a mix of liberal politics and soft traditionalism survive a militant left and a right-wing Israel?Opinion ColumnistEvery #metoo scandal is different, but most are alike in at least one way: Whether among Hollywood moguls or Southern Baptists, congressmen or Catholic bishops, the fall of prominent men usually accelerates some pre-existing debate about where the larger institution or culture should be going, and which side of its internal arguments deserves to gain.Lately the American Jewish community has presented an interesting case study, with the series of accusations against Steven M. Cohen, a sociologist who has spent much of his career studying the demography of American Jewish life, and linking trends in Jewish intermarriage and fertility to his people\u2019s cultural continuity.What Cohen\u2019s critics have in mind, specifically, is the way that the longstanding angst within the American Jewish community around assimilation, intermarriage and fertility tends to sustain a kind of soft traditionalist pressure even in liberal Jewish life \u2014 one that defines Jewish identity in exclusionist terms, they complain, while marginalizing \u201csingle women, queer people, unwed parents, and childless individuals or couples.\u201d(And then, of course, this complicated combination also reflects the fear among many politically liberal Jews that if they don\u2019t sustain a certain familial traditionalism, they\u2019ll just cede the Jewish future to the ultra-fecund ultra-Orthodox.)The interesting question is whether the combination can survive the pressures of our own era. One form of pressure comes from the left, which is increasingly intent on rooting out all residues of traditionalism within the liberal order \u2014 treating any form of nationalism as suspect, any policing of religious orthodoxy as dangerous, any approach to sex and family and childrearing that isn\u2019t purely gender-egalitarian as a dangerous atavism.That spirit, seeking ideological consistency and opposing (to quote Cohen\u2019s critics) \u201cpatriarchal, misogynistic, and anachronist assumptions about what is good for the Jews,\u201d may not be able to tolerate the mix of cosmopolitanism and tribalism, liberalism and traditionalism, that has defined American Judaism for years.These centrifugal forces, pulling leftward and rightward, have already alienated younger liberal Jews in the United States from the uncomplicated pro-Israel sentiments of their grandparents. And they may portend a future where the \u201cliberal politics with a dose of cultural conservatism\u201d combination gives way to a sharper choice for many Jews: a more consistently conservative Judaism bound to Israeli nationalism, and a liberal Judaism that\u2019s more consistently liberal and less identitarian \u2014 and perhaps ultimately more secularized and assimilated.Advertisement"}

In a free market, the story goes, you don\u2019t need to flatter your boss or the company selling you stuff, because they know you can always go to someone else.What Robin points out is that the reality of a market economy is nothing like that. In fact, the daily experience of tens of millions of Americans \u2013 especially but not only those who don\u2019t make a lot of money \u2013 is one of constant dependence on the good will of employers and other more powerful economic players. Oh, and social safety net programs can do more than limit misery: they can be liberating. I\u2019ve known many people who stuck with jobs they disliked for fear of losing health coverage; Obamacare, flawed as it is, has noticeably reduced that kind of \u201clock in\u201d, and a full guarantee of health coverage would make our society visibly freer.But seriously, do the real differences between New York and Florida make New Yorkers less free? New York is a highly unionized state \u2013 25.3 percent of the work force \u2013 while only 6.6 percent of Florida workers are represented by unions. Does this make NY workers less free, or does it empower them in the face of corporate power? If you\u2019re a highly paid professional, it probably doesn\u2019t make much difference. But my guess is that most workers feel at least somewhat freer in New York than they do in FL.Now, there are no perfect answers to the inevitable sacrifice of some freedom that comes with living in a complex society; utopia is not on the menu. But the advocates of unrestricted corporate power and minimal worker protection have been getting away for far too long with pretending that they\u2019re the defenders of freedom \u2013 which is not, in fact, just another word for nothing left to lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lemon Bars, With Blueberries in a Supporting Role", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteIt\u2019s a classic, arguably essential pairing, but striking the right balance can be tricky.The best lemon bars strike a perfect balance: They\u2019re both sweet and tangy, their sharp, creamy centers anchored by a crisp, buttery crust. My desert-island dessert, they\u2019re the one confection I can imagine eating ad infinitum \u2014 or, at least until the rescue plane arrives.And that is why I waited so long to bake something that seems so obvious in retrospect: lemon-blueberry bars.It doesn\u2019t necessarily work in reverse. Most lemon-focused desserts want to stay that way, guarding the fierce tartness of the citrus. In this case, I wanted the blueberries to function like vermouth in a martini \u2014 a delicate enhancement that never overwhelms the gin\u2019s punch.The key was to make sure that these bars remained firmly in the citrus camp. I wanted lemon bars dotted with blueberries, not blueberry bars brightened with lemon.The biggest challenge was in countering the berries\u2019 sweetness. Cutting the sugar and increasing the lemon juice in the curd helped. But so did adding more lemon zest, which, while not acidic like the juice, intensified the lemon flavor and kept the berries in check. I also threw in a little lime zest to round out the citrus notes. But that\u2019s purely optional.Since the blueberries in the filling also add moisture, these are soft, puddinglike bars that can ooze a bit when warm. So store them in the refrigerator until just before serving.For fancier occasions, these bars hold their own served on a plate with a fork, like a mini lemon tart. But even when they\u2019re slightly warm and gooey, I still like to eat them out of hand. After all, you may not find cutlery on a desert island, but palm fronds make good napkins in a pinch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Weeknight Dishes", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat to CookGood morning. I\u2019m Emily, and I have five weeknight dinner ideas for deep-August evenings, while the grill is still lit, the tomatoes are still fat and the corn is still sweet. One of my favorite summer meals made the list this week: an extra-large embellished Caprese salad, known in my home as the Super Caprese. I make it repeatedly this time of year, when those tomatoes are perfect and cooking can be as easy as slicing a few things, tearing up a few others, and toasting some bread to go alongside.Here are five dishes for the week:I want to call your attention to this fantastic Alison Roman recipe before summer is over \u2014 not because you can\u2019t make it year-round, but because the flavors are so big and neon that it all but demands to be eaten outdoors with a cold drink at hand. If you don\u2019t have a grill, cook the pork indoors in a cast-iron skillet; it will still be great. Serve with rice or rice noodles.The best kind of weeknight pasta: fresh and bright, with a sauce that comes together while the noodles boil. This recipe calls for jarred or canned oil-packed tuna, which deserves a spot in every weeknighter\u2019s pantry. It also calls for you to drink a glass of white wine while you cook, and I endorse that.Start with this recipe and then tinker with it to make the Caprese dinner of your dreams. Pile on arugula. Tuck in slices of ripe peach. Omit the prosciutto, or double it. Change up the cheese. Just don\u2019t neglect to serve it with a lot of fresh crusty bread or good toast. Arrange it on a big platter and you won\u2019t need anything else; it should serve three or four adults for dinner.So simple. So fast. The sauce here is surprisingly flavorful for the effort, so don\u2019t skip it. Double the zucchini to have enough veg for dinner, and serve with a grain like quinoa or farro (for that sauce, of course).Oh, this one is good: a creamy, sweet and spicy soup, tasting of summer but just right for an evening when the temperature has dipped. It\u2019s also vegan, and filling enough for a light dinner, though you could also make rice or a salad to serve alongside. Everyone at the table can choose how to top it, with chiles for heat seekers, chopped nuts for crunch, and scallions and herbs for a fresh finish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Houston Didn\u2019t Learn from Harvey", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has been a year since the hurricane devastated our city \u2014 and more rain will come soon.Ms. Swartz, an executive editor at Texas Monthly, is a contributing opinion writer. Having lived in Houston for 30 years or so, I knew that already. Some people have seasonal clocks for fall color or the first spring crocus; Houstonians know that hurricane season officially runs from the beginning of June through the end of November, but that the end of August through early September is the likeliest time for a hit. I\u2019ve been dreading the arrival of another storm season since Hurricane Harvey dumped 30 trillion gallons of water on Houston over several days beginning Aug. 25, 2017, causing over $200 billion in damage. We are still dealing with a critical housing shortage, still debating the best ways to protect ourselves from future storms. There has been a lot of collateral damage, too, in the form of recurring nightmares, countless lawsuits and finger-pointing at just about any governmental agency you can imagine. The nicest way to describe Houston today is a city that finds itself at a critical juncture: Can it face up to climate change or not?You can say \u2014 and it has been said \u2014 that we got ourselves into this mess. We built where we shouldn\u2019t have, almost always opting for expansion over conservation. We accepted storms and floods as the cost of living on the Gulf Coast, like blizzards in Boston or earthquakes in San Francisco. For years, staying safe meant keeping your gas tank filled and stocking up on flashlight batteries and bottled water. I\u2019ve been as deluded as anyone, cheerfully enduring Hurricane Alicia in 1983, which littered downtown streets with window glass from skyscrapers, and Tropical Storm Allison, which kept my family marooned in our neighborhood for days because of flooding in 2001. The deadly Hurricane Katrina, in August 2005, could have been a wake-up call that times \u2014 and weather \u2014 were changing. But instead of checking our coastal location and predisposition to flooding, I was entranced by the P.R. bonanza that was a byproduct of Houston\u2019s warm welcome to the New Orleans victims.A month or so after Katrina, Hurricane Rita landed me in a 10-hour traffic jam with my son as we tried to make a pre-emptive break for San Antonio. (The storm narrowly missed Houston but left East Texas in a shambles.) No worries \u2014 the gridlock was an opportunity for togetherness, despite the miserable heat. Running the air-conditioner would have used too much gas. I put up with Hurricane Ike, too, in 2008. We slept on the kitchen floor, supposedly the safest room in the house. In the morning, we had no power, a situation that lasted only 24 hours for us but became a three-week preview of the apocalypse for many friends. Then came Hurricane Harvey. While the rain kept falling (and falling), I listened numbly as television reporters warned of massive destruction, not just from the torrents of rain but also from the possible collapse of aging reservoirs on the west side of town. We would be right in the flood path if the water broke through. We were spared, but the George R. Brown Convention Center and the large exhibition hall adjacent to our pro football stadium were soon overflowing with storm victims, who were soon outnumbered by volunteers praised then and in the following months for their can-do spirit.Predictably, that spirit has become less palpable as the months have passed, and many people are still living in flood-ravaged homes or are homeless. A coordinated master plan remains somewhere in the ether. A $2.5 billion proposed bond issue is expected to pass this weekend, held up as proof that Houstonians are finally seeing that we need more than better flashlight batteries to keep ourselves safe. As Dale Morris, a director of strategic partnership with the Water Institute of the Gulf told me, storms like Harvey \u2014 not just ever-larger hurricanes, but the kind that park themselves in one place and wear out their welcome \u2014 are becoming more common, and no amount of cheery roll-up-your-sleeves denial is going to stop them. And yet that\u2019s what seems to be expected of us from the state and federal governments. So far, the state of Texas can\u2019t be bothered to help much with Harvey relief \u2014 Gov. Greg Abbott has refused to spend even a pittance from the state\u2019s nearly $12 billion rainy-day fund. And the Trump administration apparently believes that the $89 billion it set aside early this year for hurricane response is plenty to solve the problems of Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico combined. It looks to me like our much-touted individualism is about to be tested \u2014 and exploited \u2014 again. Houston and the surrounding Harris County are working on the recovery. But it\u2019s hard to plan without a budget, and it\u2019s hard to budget without adequate funds. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama understood this after Katrina and anted up, as did the governors of New York and New Jersey after the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. We are, so far, alone.Maybe the flood \u2014 or the fire \u2014 hasn\u2019t come to your door yet. But think about this: Houston, still stranded by the lack of state and federal support, is already a model for future climate disasters.

Both sides claim the moral high ground. The question: How should the most densely populated state in the country manage bear-human relations?But those same activists were not exactly thrilled.\u201cStopping the hunt on state lands does not stop the hunt,\u201d said Jeff Tittel, the director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. \"It only changes where the bears get killed. The hunt will continue on other public lands, including county parks, water company lands and private lands.

But Governor Brown has the opportunity to make his biggest impact yet by harnessing the power of forests to reduce carbon dioxide pollution, the principal cause of global warming.  Governor Brown should direct the California Air Resources Board, 12 of whose 14 voting members he appoints, to include a rain forest standard in proposed regulations the board is expected to release soon, updating the state\u2019s cap and trade program. This would be an enormously important step toward stabilizing the global climate, fortifying indigenous communities and their cultures and protecting the fragile and incredible biodiversity of these forests.At an aquaculture farm funded by carbon credits outside the Acre capital of Rio Branco, native Amazon River fish are raised on land cleared before the state ended the destruction of its forests. Local farmers produce eight tons of fish per hectare; that same hectare would support but a single cow on the poor grass that typically grows in these cleared soils. Local youth are trained to filet the fish, returning all waste to the farm as fertilizer (even the skin is tanned into leather for Herm\u00e8s purses). Others restore land by planting banana and rubber trees, avocados, pineapples, cashew and cacao to provide food and income all year. By maximizing production of both animal protein and export crops, these innovations reduce the demands for land that drive deforestation. Income from carbon credits is also fortifying indigenous cultures. Governor Brown is already a climate hero. Leading the fight to save global forests would be a crowning achievement and fitting final chapter for his time as governor. Advertisement"}

A neighbor said he did not always follow the local custom of acknowledging him when Mr. Bahena Rivera drove by in a Chevy Malibu. And, more alarmingly, a woman said he made her uncomfortable with a romantic advance and repeated Facebook messages in the middle of the night.\u201cHe would just stare. He wouldn\u2019t really like talk,\u201d said the woman, Brooke Bestell, 20, who had turned Mr. Bahena Rivera down when he asked her out on a date. \u201cSomething about him was off.\u201dOver the course of this week, Mr. Bahena Rivera, 24, went from a quiet farmworker whose real name was unknown, even to his employer, to a homicide suspect whose arrest inflamed the national immigration debate.President Trump has cited the first-degree murder charge against Mr. Bahena Rivera as proof of the need for tougher border security. Iowa politicians and conservative news outlets have seized on the case as ammunition as November\u2019s election nears. And here in Brooklyn, population 1,400, residents have struggled to understand how the man they saw at the grocery store could be tied to the death of Mollie Tibbetts, a psychology student and summer camp counselor who disappeared last month while out for a jog.Mr. Bahena Rivera, who is jailed on a $5 million cash bond, was one of many Mexicans who have made their way to Iowa\u2019s pastures, where farmers often struggle to find eligible workers to tend their crops and cattle. Mr. Bahena Rivera grew up in El Guayabillo, a village of unpaved roads some three hours\u2019 drive from Acapulco on Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast, and attended the only elementary school in the village of about 400 people.\u201cA very good person, a simple guy with no vices,\u201d Victor Manuel Nu\u00f1ez Carbajal, who attended school with Mr. Bahena Rivera, said in a Facebook message. Neighbors told Univision network that his father tended his small corn plot and also milked dairy cows in the village, earning less than $10 a day.Mr. Bahena Rivera came to the United States at age 17, his lawyer said, with the equivalent of a middle school education. After a few years at another farm, he went to work at Yarrabee Farms outside Brooklyn, which is co-owned by Craig Lang, a former Republican candidate for Iowa agriculture secretary.\u201cI would say he always did his work on time,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t much for conversation.\u201dHis lawyer, Allan M. Richards, said Mr. Bahena Rivera had been a law-abiding employee since arriving in the United States. \u201cHe\u2019s here living the American dream and working seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and trying to do his best at his job,\u201d Mr. Richards said. He said Mr. Bahena Rivera\u2019s family members were not yet willing to speak publicly.Federal officials said they have no record of Mr. Bahena Rivera entering the country legally and said that he appeared to have used false documents to obtain employment.The sheriff\u2019s department in Poweshiek County said it had not interacted with him until this week. Neither had any state law enforcement agencies in Iowa.Mr. Lang said Mr. Bahena Rivera had been hired at the farm in August 2014 after presenting a valid Social Security number, which was checked with a federal database, and a state-issued identification card. The new employee was known around town as Cristhian Bahena Rivera, but around the farm by the fraudulent name listed on those documents, a name the authorities did not disclose.Outside of work, Mr. Bahena Rivera started dating a Brooklyn high school student, Iris Monarrez, whom he met in 2013. Around 2014, they had a daughter. And for about a year, they lived together. Mr. Bahena Rivera once posted on Facebook that the day he met his girlfriend was \u201cel mejor d\u00eda de mi vida,\u201d or \u201cthe best day of my life.\u201d When she posted a photo of herself in 2015, he wrote in Spanish, \u201cMy beautiful cool princess.\u201d\u201cHe was really romantic,\u201d said Aby Felix, a second cousin of Ms. Monarrez, who she said has been separated from Mr. Bahena Rivera for about two years. \u201cHe would bring her flowers.\u201dResidents said Mr. Bahena Rivera was an attentive father who was often seen playing with his daughter in the city park.His arrest has rattled Brooklyn, a small town where most everybody knows everybody else, and where many had assumed someone from outside the community was responsible for Ms. Tibbetts\u2019s disappearance on July 18.Ms. Tibbetts, a student at the University of Iowa known as a talented writer, had attended high school in Brooklyn and was known for her frequent jogs around her hometown. After weeks of investigating and national news coverage, police found security video that showed a dark-colored Malibu driving back and forth as she ran on the day of her disappearance. The Malibu was later tied to Mr. Bahena Rivera, who police said cooperated and led them to her body after being taken into custody on Monday.A medical examiner said Ms. Tibbetts, whose funeral is Sunday, died in a homicide from \u201cmultiple sharp force injuries.\u201dMany here said they felt terrible both for the Tibbetts family and for Ms. Monarrez, who could not be reached for an interview and whose Facebook page has been flooded with vitriolic messages from outside Iowa.Some in Brooklyn were perplexed by the arrest of a man many knew as a familiar, if unremarkable, face around town. Mary Jo Seaton, a former owner of a Brooklyn grocery store, said he often stopped by her store in the late afternoon or early evening, usually with two other young men she presumed to be his co-workers.\u201cThey would be talking to each other, smiling, laughing, and if you spoke to them or said hi, they would smile back at you,\u201d Ms. Seaton said.Because they spoke Spanish and most store employees did not, she said, they did not talk at length with staff. \u201cI thought he seemed like a very nice person \u2014 a clean-cut, American person,\u201d Ms. Seaton said.Others found his behavior more troubling. Ms. Bestell, the acquaintance who declined a date with him, said he would not make conversation when she encountered him in person, but he would send repeated social media messages over a period of months.\u201cJust over and over, like every week or so, he would message me again,\u201d Ms. Bestell said, including as recently as June 13 at 3 a.m.After he was arrested, two of Ms. Bestell\u2019s friends told her that he had also messaged them online over the years. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many other girls he probably was trying to talk to,\u201d she said.Ann Klein reported from Brooklyn, Mitch Smith reported from Chicago and Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles.

Instead of a rabbi, a stage and television actor officiated, opening with a rhyming rap about how they met.\u201cI didn\u2019t really want a wedding, I just wanted a party,\u201d said Mr. Mendelsohn-Lessel, 36, who works in a factory producing coffee roasters. \u201cI don\u2019t like the establishment and institutions.\u201dMs. Eizenman, 29, a graphic designer born in Moldova to a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother, would not have qualified as sufficiently Jewish to marry through the official channels without undergoing a conversion, because, legally, Jewishness is matrilineal.Thousands of Israeli couples a year are now ignoring the legalities, bypassing the state rabbinical authority, known as the Chief Rabbinate, and marrying any way they wish.There is no civil marriage in Israel. Under a political compromise reached 70 years ago between the nation\u2019s secular Zionist founders and the religious forces whose support they needed, the rabbinical authorities have exclusive control over marriage and divorce. The disproportionate power granted to ultra-Orthodox political parties by Israel\u2019s coalition politics keeps the system in place.Supporters of the system say it preserves unity by maintaining one standard of Judaism that adheres to strict Jewish law and that it protects future generations from canonical chaos.\u201cIt\u2019s important to continue with the centralized rabbinical marriage registration, an institution that is recognized throughout the Jewish world,\u201d said Eliezer Simcha Weiss, the Rabbinate-affiliated rabbi of a local regional council in central Israel, who noted that the vast majority of couples still marry through the Rabbinate.But to register with the Rabbinate couples must qualify as Jewish. A bride has to plunge in a ritual bath before the wedding, be veiled and follow the groom to the canopy, where she routinely has a nonspeaking role. The traditional wedding contract is written in Aramaic. And if things do not work out in the end, the wife is dependent on her husband\u2019s agreement to obtain a religious divorce.Many young Israelis want a more egalitarian ceremony and freedom from the strictures of the rabbinical authorities leading to a surge in alternative weddings.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Israel is no less than a quiet revolution driven from the bottom up by organizations and individuals,\u201d said Uri Keidar, executive director of Be Free Israel, an organization that advocates civil rights and pluralism and is one of several offering alternative marriages and unions.\u201cThey have decided they are done with waiting for our politicians or the Chief Rabbinate,\u201d he added. \u201cIsraelis, by the thousands, are reclaiming their Judaism and choosing their own path to marriage, while the political system is in stalemate.\u201dJewish marriages performed by rabbis of the more liberal streams of Reform and Conservative Judaism, though popular in the United States, are not officially recognized in Israel. Still, some Israelis are opting for the more flexible, egalitarian ceremonies offered by Reform and Conservative rabbis. Other Israelis get a friend to marry them, or they sign a civil union agreement with a lawyer, or they register as common law spouses or simply live together.Even a small but growing number of observant Orthodox couples are rejecting the Rabbinate and marrying according to strict Jewish law, but in private, more egalitarian ceremonies performed by maverick Orthodox rabbis.The alternative marriage wave also caters to gay couples who cannot legally marry in Israel.There are few legal drawbacks in not having a state-sanctioned wedding since common law couples receive similar rights and benefits in Israel. And should an unregistered marriage break down, no religious divorce is required through the Rabbinate since the state did not recognize the couple as married in the first place.Rabbi Weiss, of the Rabbinate, dismissed the reports of a surge in alternative weddings as a promotional campaign by the organizations advocating them. He described the Foreign Ministry video as \u201cfake news.\u201dSome couples, he noted, have a big, alternative wedding and then marry a second time in a small Rabbinate ceremony, if only to satisfy more conservative relatives.The 2018 study on wedding trends, by Panim, a network of Jewish and Israeli organizations, indicated that more than half the couples who married alternatively met the Jewish legal requirements for a Rabbinate wedding but opted against one because of their convictions.Gal Nitsan, 30, recently married Oz Shorer, also 30, in a ceremony led by a female Reform rabbi one Friday at sunset on a beach in northern Israel.\u201cIt was clear to both of us that neither of us wanted any connection with the Rabbinate,\u201d said Ms. Nitsan, who is a speech therapist. \u201cMarrying through the Rabbinate means agreeing to inequality.\u201d\u201cBut I said to myself my great-grandparents, grandparents and parents married under the chuppa with the seven blessings,\u201d she added. \u201cI wanted to continue that tradition.\u201dSo with the rabbi\u2019s help they drafted their own vows and a version of the marriage contract in modern Hebrew. \u201cWe built a new interpretation of it,\u201d Ms. Nitsan said, \u201caccording to the rules we wanted to live by together.\u201dMore than 400,000 Israelis, mostly from families who emigrated from the former Soviet Union, are not considered legally Jewish and cannot marry through the Rabbinate without undergoing conversion. Other couples are required to undergo special background checks to prove their Jewish credentials.Liliya and Alexander Vilenchik, whose families came from Moscow and St. Petersburg, were married in the Jerusalem hills in July by Nardy Grun, a secular rabbi or humanistic spiritual leader.\u201cBoth of us are Jewish from the \u2018wrong\u2019 side,\u201d said Ms. Vilenchik, 25, meaning their fathers are Jewish but not their mothers.The couple rewrote their seven blessings \u201cto be more secular, without God, God, God all the time,\u201d Ms. Vilenchik said. Some secular brides also break a glass, a ritual traditionally performed by the groom. Ms. Vilenchik chose not to because she was in heels.Pola Barkan, 28, director of the Cultural Brigade, a group that promotes Russian culture in Israel, married Mark Barkan, 29, in an Orthodox Rabbinate ceremony. After his family had fought to remain Jewish in the Soviet Union, Mr. Barkan said he would not give up on it so easily. Still, Ms. Barkan insisted on adding an eighth blessing, praying for all her friends to be able to marry without exception or exclusion.Rabbi David Stav, the chairman of Tzohar, an Orthodox organization that helps couples navigate the Rabbinate bureaucracy, said, \u201cEvery monopoly needs competition. I think the competition will be good for the Rabbinate and improve it.\u201dBatya Kahana-Dror, the director of Mavoi Satum, a group that helps women who have been refused a Jewish divorce by their husbands, also facilitates private, unregistered Orthodox weddings.\u201cIt\u2019s a civil revolution,\u201d Ms. Kahana-Dror said. \u201cThe young religious public is very critical of the Rabbinate. Today there are options. People are voting with their feet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The pattern becomes especially clear when they descend into falsehoods. \u201cThere are reasons why illegal-immigrant crime can carry a poignant punch among people of good will,\u201d French writes. \u201cThe murderer wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. I\u2019m reminded of the pain that people feel when, for example, they find out (in different crimes) that the police didn\u2019t follow up on a lead or a prisoner was wrongly released on parole. The feeling is palpable.\u201dImagine, for example, that you heard the killer in a mass shooting had been able to purchase a gun illegally, because of a failure in the background-check system. Wouldn\u2019t that heighten your sense of injustice about the crime? For most of us, the answer is yes. \u201cThe official failure magnifies the personal injustice,\u201d as French argues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Monuments for a New Era", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-ArtWhat should replace statues celebrating the Confederacy? Six artists imagine a way forward.We asked artists to contemplate these markers of our country\u2019s racist and violent history \u2014 the space they take up, physically and psychically \u2014 and imagine what should happen when they are gone.It has taken a tremendous effort to remove the Confederate statues that have been taken down so far. This is a great beginning. I\u2019d like to replace the 68-foot-4-inch column and base that for 133 years provided a platform for a figure of the white supremacist general Robert E. Lee with an anti-monument. I\u2019d call it \u201cThe Legacy of Slavery Is in the Way of Progress and Will Be Until America, Which Benefits From That Legacy, Has Been Replaced With a Completely Different Society.\u201d Rather than sticking a monument to an African-American hero atop the structure that was once a pedestal for a racist, I would lay the upended column across the road \u2014 which is still called Lee Circle \u2014\u00a0making it impassable. This broken and shattered ruin would be an intentionally inconveniently placed eyesore, disrupting travel and commerce. The placement would demand that visitors confront how slavery and the ideals that maintained and rationalized it continue to stand in our way. A 84-foot-10-inch-deep hole (representing the height of the former monument including the now removed statue of Lee) would create a gaping abyss. There would be no barriers to protect people from falling in.This reimagined monument transforms visitors from spectators of history to participants in a shared memory. It creates a space for confronting America\u2019s history of slavery and segregation \u2014 acknowledging their ongoing manifestations and the healing that can take place through reconciliation. Near my home in Brooklyn is the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch that stands at Grand Army Plaza at the main entrance to Prospect Park as a tribute to defenders of the Union. It includes the figure of a crouching African-American man who seems to be surveying and assessing the battle situation. As a New Orleanian, I see the Live Oak as more than just a common tree found in my city. It\u2019s a marker of years past and years to come. To me, it represents the different races of people who came together to create a unique culture. To embrace the diversity of New Orleans is to embrace your neighbor\u2019s culture while also celebrating your own.I\u2019m glad that the Beauregard monument has been taken down. When I imagine a replacement monument that reflects the diversity and creolization of New Orleans, I imagine an abstract Live Oak tree interpreted four ways, with each version covered in a soil type that is found in Louisiana. Driving on the roundabout, passers-by see the Live Oak Tree in its three-dimensionality. Each side has a unique look, but they all come together, forming a kind of family tree. Mold making is a fundamental stage for most sculptural work, but molds are rarely counted as works of art in their own right. Sculptural positives \u2014 the work they produce \u2014 are the objects to which we ascribe value. Presented as part of the final piece, molds suggest the latent potential of those immutable values from which American ideals are cast. Molten glass is blown into empty wooden molds, charring the surface. What emerges are distortions of the original sculptural reference. These \u201cdistorted replicas\u201d are emblematic of our struggle as a society to conform our realities to the ideal.Around each monument, I propose a sanctuary for African gray parrots. A wrought-iron flight cage with elevated walkways, providing a perched perspective, and featuring a cacophony of feathered talkers with unusual catchphrases. Or we could mimic a preschool project by coating the offending objects with peanut butter, shaking seed on the surface \u2014 massive feeders across the nation. George Washington Carver would be proud. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lost in the Storm", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "Houston thought it was prepared for a major hurricane like Harvey. But as the flooding overwhelmed the city\u2019s emergency systems, families like the Daileys found out too late that they were on their own.Wayne, who as a child in Galveston County spent hours watching the cloudscapes drift over the Gulf of Mexico, kept multiple weather apps on his phone and had already been tracking the storm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get us,\u201d he told his sister. But coastal storms were a part of life that he had prepared for, and they did not concern him.He was more worried about his wife. Casey Dills-Dailey was undergoing surgery to remove the adrenal gland above her left kidney. The surgeon predicted an uncomplicated operation, conducted through tiny incisions. Still, Wayne wondered, would the surgery do what it was supposed to do? Was the doctor as skilled as he said he was? It was hard to grasp that the life of his 38-year-old wife could be endangered.The operation came after years of mysterious symptoms that began when Casey was in her early 30s. She had hot flashes and eventually stopped menstruating. Her face became chubby, and her full-but-shapely figure ballooned to nearly 250 pounds, fattening in odd places, including the space between her shoulders. Ugly red marks appeared on her abdomen. The illness left her in pain, nauseated and unable to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time.Casey was referred to Dr. Curtis Wray, a surgical oncologist, to remove what doctors suspected was a noncancerous tumor that was releasing extra cortisol, causing her Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The diagnosis helped explain many of her problems, from high blood pressure to erratic moods. Casey could not wait to look and feel like herself again.That morning, a resident surgeon said Casey should expect to stay three or four days for recovery. He described the operation\u2019s potential complications \u2014 bleeding, infection, damage to other organs \u2014 which frightened Wayne. Dr. Wray, the senior surgeon, came in and reassured them. His team had performed the operation many times. Surprising Wayne and Casey, he predicted she would be home in 24 hours.Wayne asked to see the tumor when it was out. After surgery, Dr. Wray called him from the waiting area and showed him an image on his phone. The tumor was the width of Wayne\u2019s two thumbs put together. Most important, to the surgeon it appeared benign.After Casey was settled in her hospital room, Wayne drove home to spend the night with their two sons. The family lived outside the Houston city limits in northeast Harris County, in a trailer park where homes stretched along fancifully named streets \u2014 Drifting Winds, Island Song and theirs, Enchanted Path Drive.The Daileys were what Wayne called a \u201csimple, simple family\u201d: Casey, a housewife who home-schooled their oldest son, Luke, 14; their youngest son, Ronnie, 10; and Wayne himself, a \u201cmiddle-class worker, a lower-class worker,\u201d without a steady job. For more than a dozen years, he had operated heavy machinery at oil refineries, clawing trenches into the earth for foundations and pipe racks. The finances were in his wife\u2019s name in case he did not make it home. He had survived explosions, survived co-workers. Lately, he had been working for a friend\u2019s tree-service firm. Casey made their uncertain income stretch, scrapping junk metal and advertising homemade quilts for $50 on social media; it took her about a week to make each one.Their trailer-park community had its drugs and gangs and violence, the evening cracks of gunfire and whining sirens. But four generations of family members and friends filled the homes on their block. Casey\u2019s parents lived across the street, next to her aunt. Three homes over, there was Casey\u2019s grandma\u2019s bowling partner. Next door was Erasmo Villa, from Mexico, who with his brother-in-law had drywalled the Daileys\u2019 home free of charge just because they were neighbors, and neighbors help each other. Casey cultivated roses that bloomed from pale pink to vivid red, growing impossibly high.Casey grew up in the trailer. Her mother had many miscarriages before giving birth to her only child, and Casey quickly took a place at the center of the family, clinging like a bear to her grandpa\u2019s neck. As an adult, she cared for him and other sick relatives until they died.Having little money did not mean the Daileys could not be generous. Casey joined the homeowners\u2019 board, chaperoned school field trips and led a Cub Scout troop with Wayne because nobody else volunteered. An evicted family with three children had slept on pallets on the Daileys\u2019 living-room floor. Wayne and Casey served as temporary guardians for one of Ronnie\u2019s friends so he wouldn\u2019t be sent to a foster home during his parents\u2019 rough patch. Their Wi-Fi password evinced their Christian faith: 12loveGod.That night after Casey\u2019s operation, Wayne picked up the boys from their grandparents\u2019 trailer. He ate dinner, put the television on in the bedroom and fell asleep. At around 9:30 the next morning, Casey called him from the hospital. \u201cCome up here,\u201d she said. They were discharging her.Tropical Storm Harvey was rapidly strengthening in the gulf, and Wayne stopped to pick up necessities. When he walked into the imposing hospital in the early afternoon, though, nothing looked amiss. In truth, doctors at Casey\u2019s hospital, Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, were preparing for a possible hurricane, sending stable patients home. During Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Memorial Hermann, with 540 patients inside, lost power and was evacuated, as medical workers manually squeezed air into the lungs of patients whose mechanical respirators had failed. Since then, billions of dollars had been spent to protect the hospital and other facilities at the Texas Medical Center campus.A surgical intern just weeks out of medical school examined Casey. He prepared discharge instructions and wrote two prescriptions: one for a stool softener and the other for 40 tablets of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller. He did not prescribe steroids, which would typically be needed when a steroid-producing tumor like Casey\u2019s was removed.A nurse went over the bright-orange folder of information, explaining how to keep the incisions clean to avoid infection and emphasizing the importance of being as active as possible to help prevent a potentially deadly blood clot from forming in her legs or lungs. Casey was to follow up with Dr. Wray in a week.She arrived home that afternoon in pain and ready for a nap. Casey\u2019s aunt from across the street texted to offer help and asked whether Casey and Wayne were ready for the hurricane. Casey responded that they would fill containers with water, hunker down and keep an eye on their outdoor dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s all we can do.\u201dLate the next night, Friday, Harvey barreled into the Texas coastline northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to strike the United States in over a decade. It stalled, losing strength but absorbing more water from the gulf, before pinwheeling into Houston.\nOn Saturday night, before 10 p.m., Wayne opened his screen door, stepping barefoot onto the stoop to look at what was coming. Wind chimes tinkled, and the roof dripped a steady beat of rain between crashes of thunder. Branches tipped with small red flowers swayed dizzily above the door. A shock of lightning brought the trees into sudden light. Less than an hour later, he opened the door again to a hiss of sheeting rain that obscured the rumble of thunder. Behind him in the house, an emergency alert blared from one of their mobile phones, a flash-flood warning: \u201cImminent Threat \u2014 Severe.\u201dHarris County\u2019s top elected official, Judge Ed Emmett, also decided that there should be no mass evacuations. With a population of more than 4.5 million \u2014 about equal numbers outside and inside Houston \u2014 Harris County\u2019s roughly 1,700 square miles held more people than half of the states in the country.Texas law requires every jurisdiction to have plans for managing emergencies, and as the lead county official, Judge Emmett served as its emergency-management chief. On Sunday, he was based at the county\u2019s emergency operations center, in the Houston TranStar building, which houses Harris County\u2019s lead agency for disasters, the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.As the storm moved into the area, the activity in the vast headquarters picked up. Personnel from various agencies gathered at rows of desks, their partitions marked by edge-lit glass signs with the office logo glowing an eerie white. Just below the room\u2019s high ceilings, giant video screens played the news and tracked weather.Webbed with rivers, creeks, lakes, bayous and reservoirs, Harris County had experienced a notable increase in severe, storm-induced floods in recent years. Storms in 2015 and 2016 killed more than a dozen people and swamped parts of the \u201c500 year\u201d floodplain \u2014 an area that according to previous models had only a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a given year. Climate experts predicted that the trend would continue as the atmosphere warmed and extreme weather rose in frequency and intensity. The built environment worsened the problem: Concrete covered ever more miles of rainfall-absorbing prairieland, and sewers and ditches were designed by the local government to overflow into the streets, which were considered part of the drainage system. This helped protect homes and businesses from flooding, but it could trap their inhabitants when streets became canals.A dizzying array of agencies participated in emergency response, coordinating their activities using the National Incident Management System, a protocol that arose from efforts to jointly battle wildfires in the 1970s and that was adopted nationally after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The concept was simple: Disaster response, and the responsibility for it, started at the point of impact and moved out and up as resources were overwhelmed. Individual and local-community preparedness \u2014 stocking food, water and medicines and looking out for neighbors \u2014 was the initial safeguard. The 911 system was the next, connecting people with police, fire, rescue and emergency medical assistance. The circle expanded from there. If one of the county\u2019s 54 independent fire departments, which were responsible for water rescues, found itself overwhelmed, it could reach out to the fire desk at the county emergency operations center in the TranStar building, which could request assistance from other local fire stations or from representatives of the Coast Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency sitting nearby. Health and medical services had a separate hierarchy of support agencies.When Harvey reached Harris County, beginning to release what became a once-in-a-thousand-years rainfall of more than 1 trillion gallons, officials were confident they could prioritize people in life-threatening situations. But as the water rose on Sunday, it overwhelmed those preparations. Many local fire departments lacked boats or trucks that could handle flooded streets, and those that had them could no longer share. A Houston police sergeant drowned in his vehicle trying to drive to work. The flooding was so widespread that it impeded the arrival of additional state and federal teams.At TranStar, officials felt agitated and helpless. They were getting personal emails appealing for rescues, sometimes with photographs of elderly relatives attached. There was no time to wait. \u201cI got a crazy idea,\u201d Rodney Reed, the assistant chief for operational support for the Harris County Fire Marshal\u2019s Office, said as Judge Emmett walked into a snack-filled room. \u201cI need you to support it.\u201d Reed argued that they should invite unaffiliated volunteers into the rescue effort. According to conventional wisdom, they get in the way and often end up needing help themselves. But Reed assured the judge that taking the step would save lives.And so at noon on Sunday, Judge Emmett stepped to a lectern before news cameras to make an unusual statement. A large screen looped colorful radar images of the storm behind him. \u201cThose of you who have boats and high-water vehicles that can be used in neighborhoods to help move people out of harm\u2019s way, we need your help,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment assets are fully utilized.\u201dJudge Emmett asked the public to call the emergency operations center if they were willing to volunteer. County officials wrote each offer on a sticky note or scrap of paper, affixing it to a wall with blue tape in neat rows according to geographic quadrants, ready to be pulled whenever a fire department called requesting boats.The perhaps-even-greater challenge was connecting the volunteers to the people who needed rescuing. Callers had trouble getting through to 911 as the volume of calls for assistance more than quadrupled. Judge Emmett asked people to stop calling unless they faced immediate danger. \u201cThe phone lines are backed up,\u201d he said.Like most other emergency agencies, the Coast Guard, which controlled many boats and helicopters, had not prepared to respond to distress signals posted on the public\u2019s technologies of choice: Facebook and Twitter. Instead, it used social media to disseminate five emergency numbers for the local Coast Guard station, setting up a separate, parallel dispatch system for residents in need of rescue. In a sign of the ad hoc nature of the triage system, personnel tracked urgent medical cases with a pencil-and-paper checklist. In its postings, the Coast Guard instructed people to mark their roofs or \u201cwave sheets, towels etc.\u201d to get rescuers\u2019 attention.Identifying who needed help the most was the crucial first step to responders saving lives. During the county\u2019s news conference, authorities sent a wireless emergency alert to cellular customers, including Wayne and Casey: \u201cCall 911 for LIFE THREATENING emergencies ONLY. STAY PUT IF SAFE.\u201d\nIf there had ever been a time to evacuate, this was not it. That morning, a man named Samuel Saldivar had driven into the neighborhood about a mile south of the Daileys\u2019 home to rescue his parents, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He loaded them and four of their great-grandchildren into a large white van and crossed a small bridge over Greens Bayou after sunrise. The bayou had often swamped bridges along its path, and officials had recognized the need to improve it.As Saldivar came off the bridge, the rising waters swept the van from the road. Saldivar was able to escape, and clung to a tree for the better part of an hour. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, had no boats. The sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived with one and, with a local firefighter, rescued Saldivar. But the van, with everyone else still trapped inside, was now submerged. The rescuers\u2019 boat, not fit for swift water, could not reach it. Saldivar\u2019s parents, two great-nieces and two great-nephews all drowned.Throughout Sunday, brown water continued to fill Enchanted Path Drive. By the afternoon, the floodwaters reached Wayne and Casey\u2019s garden. Luke asked his father if the flooding was going to kill the grass, or the rose bush, or the plants in the yard. Wayne said no. He also cut off the boy\u2019s restless entreaties to wade across the street, where Casey\u2019s aunt\u2019s car now stood parked in water to the top of its wheels. \u201cBe smart,\u201d Wayne snapped. \u201cNot like these people over here.\u201d He gestured at neighbors tracing a milky brown path toward the main road, submerged to their upper thighs and carrying umbrellas. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in that water,\u201d Wayne said.As Wayne monitored the flooding, he also kept an eye on Casey. Her pain had quickly become far more severe than anticipated. The Tramadol was not helping, and a months-old injury to her hip and leg was making it even more difficult to get up and move. She grew queasy shortly after Wayne removed an anti-nausea medication patch from behind her ear as instructed, three days after it had been applied at the hospital. Having coped with bouts of vomiting for years, Casey had the drug Zofran at the ready, and it seemed to help for a few hours at a time.\nOn Sunday her temperature was slightly higher than normal. Wayne\u2019s father, a former volunteer fire chief with some training in emergency care, explained by phone how to check her incisions for signs of infection like redness, swelling or pus. They looked fine. When she woke up, she even took a few phone calls, including robocalls with updates from Luke\u2019s home-school academy and Ronnie\u2019s elementary school.As the sky deepened into gray on Sunday evening, Wayne padded to the door in his bare feet and jeans. Rain dripped from the trees, drawing expanding circles in the dim water that now covered their lowest step. A man in a blue baseball cap, his shirt rolled up below his chest, waved as he waded by, water above his buttocks, pushing a small, round raft with a woman inside it. \u201cYou ought to go out,\u201d he warned. Wayne chortled, unconvinced. \u201cY\u2019all be careful,\u201d he responded.On Facebook Live, Wayne repeated the message officials were spreading. \u201cIf you\u2019re safe where you\u2019re at, stay where you\u2019re at. If you have to get out, get out.\u201d He reassured his anxious mother on Facebook. \u201cWe are safe.\u201dAs the waters rose Sunday night, Wayne stayed up with Casey, who could not stop vomiting. \u201cSomething ain\u2019t right,\u201d Casey said. On Monday morning, it continued raining, and the muddy water rose to their top step, just below the front door. Casey had finally fallen asleep, and when Wayne checked on her, he found it hard to keep her awake.\nAround 1:30 in the afternoon, Wayne called 911. In Harris County, 911 calls were routed based on geography to one of several primary \u201cpublic safety answering points,\u201d or PSAPs \u2014 independently managed call centers that were most typically housed in local police departments. He reached the answering point for calls outside Houston in unincorporated Harris County, at the Harris County sheriff\u2019s office. He told the woman who answered that Casey had recently had surgery. \u201cShe has been very sick. She\u2019s been vomiting for the past day and a half approximately, and she\u2019s in severe pain. And I don\u2019t want her to get in this water in her sutures. She needs to get airlifted to a hospital.\u201dThis was not a police emergency, so the communications officer transferred the call to a secondary PSAP, which would determine the next steps. The phone rang 10 times over the course of about a minute, much longer than usual. Another woman picked up, speaking quickly. \u201cFire and ambulance.\u201d After giving his address and confirming that he needed a water rescue, Wayne said that Casey had recently had surgery and had been vomiting for a day and a half. The second call-taker interrupted him. There were over a thousand calls for help, she said. \u201cAs soon as the fire department is able to make it to this area then you will be evacuated.\u201dThe job of a 911 call-taker is emotionally and technically demanding at the best of times. During Harvey, the stress was extraordinary. The overloaded call center where the second call-taker was working, Harris County Emergency Corps, served roughly a dozen independent fire and ambulance services in the county. The corps had doubled its staff to eight from four for the storm, but call volume had more than tripled. Every one of the six 911 lines and additional non-emergency lines was ringing nonstop. Personnel were working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in the building and a nearby hotel. Someone had posted the center\u2019s direct-dial phone numbers on Twitter, and it was now receiving calls from other parts of the county, requiring phone transfers that took up to 20 minutes.The center did something it had never done before. Its leaders walked to the call floor and told call-takers to bypass the formal triaging system that it normally used to assign emergency-priority codes to callers. Instead, they would log the call for water rescue and read a script saying that there were many calls and that the fire department would respond as soon as it could.The sheriff\u2019s communications division, which handled primary calls, also faced severe challenges. The basement had filled up with water from Buffalo Bayou, causing power failures. Its staff moved to a regional 911 training center, the only available backup location with a connection to the physical 911 network. After the move, key technical functions stopped working, including, for a time, the internal dispatch system.As Harris County flooded, the total volume of calls to one 911 call center shot up, but the number of calls that were assigned medical priority codes (in red) increased only slightly \u2014 some medical emergencies were coded as flood rescue calls after the center suspended normal questioning protocols.\n      Source: Harris County Emergency Corps\n      According to data provided by the sheriff\u2019s office, the proportion of 911 calls answered within an industry target of 10 seconds plummeted. On Sunday, more than 40 percent of 911 callers to the sheriff\u2019s office hung up during the long waits, according to internal email records from the regional 911 network provider. That further increased the load on communicators, who typically had to follow up on the so-called \u201cabandoned\u201d calls. In Houston the problem was even worse \u2014 of the nearly 40,000 calls, more than half ended in hang-ups.Oversight of 911 is fragmented among states and localities, systems are often poorly funded and there is no national mandate to upgrade. By the time it is widely adopted, experts say, next-generation 911 technology itself may well be obsolete. Harris County had been in the process of updating its technology for 10 years when Harvey struck, but the new system would not be operational until February of this year.Wayne knew none of that, though. Nor did he know that Casey had not been tagged as an urgent medical case.That evening, as it continued to rain, Wayne heard an airboat passing by his house and tried to flag down its driver, who had earmuffs on to protect against the earsplitting engine noise. The man slowed down when he saw Wayne in the doorway standing next to Ronnie. \u201cMy wife and my kids and I need out!\u201d Wayne shouted to the man. \u201cMy wife needs help. She has a medical condition.\u201d The man said he was on the way to pick someone up and would get Wayne and his family on the way back. \u201cJust stay right there.\u201dCasey was in the bedroom with the television on, lethargic and in pain. Wayne gave her the news, and she nodded. Wayne stuffed clothing, dry towels and rain jackets into bags. He let family members know that an airboat was coming for them, and his sister posted the news on his Facebook page. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t swim out,\u201d one of his oldest friends wrote. Wayne told everyone he loved them. \u201cWe are going to be O.K.,\u201d he wrote around 7 p.m., and then turned on Facebook Live. \u201cAs we wait for the airboat to come back for us, I\u2019ll just show y\u2019all what it looks like,\u201d he said.It was raining, but the water level had stopped rising. \u201cAirboats will be here any time now,\u201d Wayne said. A droning sound in the background grew louder. \u201cMatter of fact, I think I hear them now, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and end the video,\u201d he said.Wayne leaned out his front door to look at the main road, which was five trailer lots away at the end of their street. The airboat came into view. But instead of turning onto Enchanted Path Drive to pick them up, it continued on to wherever it was heading.Wayne felt a wave of panic, but he tried to keep his composure for his kids. He wanted them to feel sure that their father would get them out of there. Minutes later, their home lost power. The television news switched off along with the Wi-Fi, which the boys were using to watch videos. It would be night soon, and Wayne could see that the homes of their remaining neighbors were also dark.Wayne turned off Casey\u2019s fully powered cellphone to conserve its battery. His own phone could last nearly a day, and he had an external battery to extend it for another. Late into the night, he called and texted every number that his family and friends sent him to reach volunteer rescuers. He placed calls to a number for the Cajun Navy, an ad hoc volunteer group. He called strangers and took calls from strangers. By midnight, he believed Casey had been added to about a half-dozen rescue lists.But most rescue operations, both official and unofficial, had shut down for the night for safety. Casey was still running a slight fever. Wayne checked her incisions again. They still looked good. He tried to reassure worried friends and family members. \u201cIt will be tomorrow,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI have Casey stable for now. I have everyone sleeping. I am going to get some rest. I only had about an hour of sleep in about 28 hours. Love you guys and will keep y\u2019all posted.\u201dShe told Wayne that many neighborhoods in his area had to be evacuated. \u201cAs of right now they haven\u2019t resumed water-rescue operations,\u201d she said. The fire department would do so at daylight. She had Wayne\u2019s phone number for them, and they would get to him as soon as possible. \u201cO.K., thank you very much,\u201d Wayne said. But the 911 center did not assign any personnel or resources, and the call-taker once again categorized the incident as a water-rescue call to be sent to the local fire department, not a medical emergency for the E.M.S. agency.The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, was in charge of rescues. But Sheldon owned no boats or high-water vehicles and it had flooded out one of its fire engines. The day before the flooding began, Sheldon personnel responded to five incidents, a typical number. On Sunday the number of calls shot up to more than 170, nearly all of them requests for water rescues as opposed to reports of fires; roughly 40 more calls came in for addresses already in the system \u2014 people who had called for help and then called back after they did not get assistance. The fire desk at the emergency operations center had little it could offer. It gave the cellphone numbers of Sheldon Fire chiefs to civilian volunteers with boats, which was helpful but also added to the logistical burden.On Sunday night, Sheldon Fire and Rescue leaders called the 911 center to say that the service lacked resources to conduct water rescues, especially at night. Instead of dispatching calls one by one to the handful of Sheldon Fire and Rescue crews, the 911 center put those calls into a holding pattern. Fire captains could access the ever-lengthening list on a mobile data terminal in their cars. On Monday, new calls for rescue in the district arrived on average every minute to two minutes. By the time of Wayne\u2019s 911 call that day, Sheldon Fire had already received more than 500 water-rescue calls, not counting duplicates.The triage method was haphazard. Sometimes if a call sounded urgent, a 911 dispatcher would text or phone District Capt. Isaac Pinson, saying, \u201cHey, man, can you get to this?\u201d Pinson said later that whenever possible, he read the dispatchers\u2019 notes and, by radio from his Tahoe truck, prioritized sending fire crews on fishermen\u2019s boats to homes where lives were in danger, or to areas with the greatest concentration of flooding. Sometimes a personal contact helped identify someone needing rescue. One crew went to get family members of a Texas state trooper out of their house.The chaos created considerable wasted effort. Captain Pinson sent personnel to rescue people who became stuck on flooded streets after wading out of homes where they could have stayed safely. His crews lost precious time responding to false alarms, including a report that the roof of the local high school had collapsed with hundreds of people sheltering inside. For the most part, Captain Pinson concluded, people clamoring to get out of their homes were just scared, not at risk of drowning or dying of a medical emergency.\nAt daylight on Tuesday, Wayne saw that the water level outside had dropped slightly. He could barely rouse Casey. He tried calling the Texas Department of Public Safety and, failing to reach someone who could help, called 911 a third time. \u201cI need a medical-emergency rescue,\u201d he said with an edge to his voice he did not have before.The call-taker at the sheriff\u2019s office asked him if it was because of flooding. Wayne said no and explained about Casey\u2019s surgery and the last two days of vomiting. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of unresponsive,\u201d he said. When the call-taker said she would get an ambulance there, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way\u201d and explained that five or six feet of water still lay outside. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for two days to get her out of here,\u201d Wayne said.Emergency workers later reported that 911 dispatchers in Harris County had limited knowledge of impassable roads, including routes to local hospitals. Although dispatchers were kept abreast of major road closures, some could not use their terminals to access potentially useful websites like the state transportation department\u2019s web page showing blocked roads, or even Google Maps. A next-generation 911 system that incorporates layers of multimedia information might help solve that problem in future disasters, perhaps even incorporating information from drone overflights.The communications officer at the sheriff\u2019s office told Wayne that she would get an ambulance to him and instructed him to let the paramedic know the situation when the call transferred.A Harris County Emergency Corps call-taker picked up the call and asked for Wayne\u2019s address. \u201cO.K., we do already have your two calls for service,\u201d the woman said.\u201cMy wife, she\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cShe\u2019s unresponsive, she\u2019s real lethargic, she\u2019s been vomiting. She\u2019s in a lot of pain. And I really, really, really, really need to get her to a hospital A.S.A.P.\u201dShe told Wayne brusquely that there were thousands of calls for service in the area. \u201cThe fire department is working as quickly and safely as they can to get everybody out, O.K.? It\u2019s just going to take some time for them to be able to get everybody, O.K.?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t O.K., but Wayne said, \u201cO.K.\u201dNineteen seconds into the call, the communicator closed the incident as a \u201cduplicate\u201d without assigning any responders, since Wayne\u2019s previous call was already in the queue.Wayne called family members, and his mother commented on Facebook at 10 a.m., asking for help from anyone who could provide it. \u201cCasey\u2019s condition has worsened. She is feverish and unresponsive.\u201d\nWayne tried 911 again. This time, his call ended up in Houston. About one call in seven was misrouted by cell towers during the storm, a higher than normal rate, according to data obtained through a public-records request from the regional 911 network, Greater Harris County 911. Communicators had to stay on the line trying to transfer these misrouted calls, adding to the gridlock.The Houston call-taker rerouted Wayne to the Harris County Emergency Corps. This was now the fourth time Wayne had spoken to this center, and he could not have been clearer with the call-taker on the line when she asked him what he was reporting. \u201cMy wife is in urgent need of medical, medical attention,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019s almost unresponsive.\u201dAt last, the call-taker classified the problem as a \u201c31,\u201d an unconscious party, rather than as someone in need of water rescue. \u201cWe\u2019re getting medical to you as soon as they can get there,\u201d she said.South Lake Houston covered a territory of around 70 square miles, much of it rural or industrial. A rotating staff of five paramedics and emergency medical technicians typically worked two 24-hour shifts per week and supplemented their income with other jobs, including with other ambulance services.Normally, they answered five or six calls a day. On Sunday, they were dispatched to 17 calls. On Monday, it was 39, and because of flooding they only reached two of them. Tuesday was looking to be even worse. The ambulance service had not staffed up before the crisis, and the flooding prevented some personnel from making it in for their shifts. Two paramedics who had worked two days straight in a nearby district drove in on Monday morning to help.From the beginning, the disaster had been harrowing for the paramedics. One crew sped in an ambulance toward a hospital downtown in the midst of the violent storm, with a critically ill patient on a ventilator. Floodwaters stopped them on the roadway. They tried hitching a ride three separate times with three different trucks, but the water was too high. Ultimately the paramedics lifted the woman into a volunteer\u2019s kayak and walked her the last mile. The crew had to be flown by helicopter back to the station.Several times, the paramedics waded through water only to arrive where someone did not really need help. Once, they were dispatched to respond to a reported death and spent an hour canvassing a flooded neighborhood on foot, unable to locate the person. Sometimes they worked with the fishermen and pleasure-craft operators who formed an impromptu rescue network but were not trained or equipped to save lives. In the broader region, volunteers sometimes overturned in rough floodwaters (at least four ultimately drowned).By midday Monday, the E.M.S. service\u2019s leaders concluded that, in the case of callers who were inaccessible by ambulance, it was best to keep track of their conditions and try to reach them only if they became critical. Joe Fress, the director, asked his personnel at the station to write out a list of all the medical calls that were listed as \u201cpending\u201d in the computer system, with locations and phone numbers.On Monday, one of those pending patients was Randy De\u2019Shun Belcher, a 38-year-old man with diabetes who did not have his insulin with him. His fianc\u00e9e, De\u2019Licia Thomas, called 911 after midnight to report he was having difficulty breathing. \u201cI\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now,\u201d the call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps said, and South Lake Houston E.M.S. was dispatched.Thomas called back when the ambulances did not arrive as promised. The call-taker incorrectly assured her that units were en route. \u201cYou gotta understand we\u2019re going through a hurricane,\u201d she said. The apartment complex was just off the Texas State Route 8 Beltway, which was not flooded. But the entrance to the apartment complex was under water, about 100 feet from the beltway\u2019s frontage road, and not navigable by ambulance. Nobody called Thomas to let her know.Just after noon on Monday, Thomas tried 911 again. \u201cHe\u2019s not breathing properly,\u201d she said. She called again 90 minutes later. The call-taker sighed loudly, sounding exasperated as she took down the address. Thomas repeated what was happening, now sounding tired and dejected.At 5 p.m., still waiting, she again called 911 in tears to report that her fianc\u00e9 was barely breathing. \u201cO.K., I\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now,\u201d a communicator again told Thomas. The call was coded in a way that indicated Belcher was getting sicker, which led Fress, finally, to tell his paramedics, \u201cLet\u2019s just try to get there, let\u2019s try to make it.\u201dThey parked on the Beltway and grabbed gear and medications from the ambulance. They crossed the feeder road and entered the complex, the floodwaters rising to their waists in the parking lot. Their rescue equipment was splashed even as they held it aloft on their shoulders. Their boots grew heavy with water, and their hips ached.As they made their way, another 911 call-taker, speaking quickly but patiently, was giving Thomas\u2019s mother, also in the home, instructions on how to start CPR. At 5:50 p.m., the paramedics finally walked into the apartment. Belcher, a father of 12, had been without a pulse and not breathing for at least a half an hour. The paramedics knew they would not get him back, but they also knew, for the sake of the devastated women, they had to try.The medical interventions did not work. The paramedics felt horrible that they could not save him, and that the medical examiner\u2019s staff would not be able to get there to pick up Belcher\u2019s body. They needed to do something they had never done before Harvey \u2014 they left Belcher\u2019s body on the living-room floor with a breathing tube in his mouth and an intravenous catheter in his right arm so the medical examiner would know what they had done. Before they left, they covered Belcher with a bedsheet, knowing that Thomas might be stuck in the apartment with him for days before his body was retrieved.Before noon on Tuesday, Wayne heard the thrum of helicopter rotors and saw a rescue line being lowered behind the trailers two streets over.He burst through the back door, where the grade was higher, sloshed through water that reached his thighs and lifted an extension ladder against the side of the trailer. He climbed to the roof, shouting and waving a flashlight. Luke stood on the front steps signaling with a bright yellow broom. Ronnie hollered for his father from the back door, not knowing where he had gone.The helicopter moved toward them. It hovered overhead. Then it flew away.Wayne swore. He made a decision: He did not want his children to watch their mother die. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring y\u2019all over there,\u201d he told his boys, gesturing to Casey\u2019s parents\u2019 trailer across the street. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to get Mommy out of here.\u201d He carried little Ronnie, with Luke sloshing along beside them.Wayne had no idea for whom the helicopter had come, or how it had been dispatched, but he learned months later. Norma Anderson, 75, had kidney failure and, having missed dialysis, was in bad condition. A 911 communicator told her daughter that ambulances could not reach the neighborhood, and she would have to await fire-rescue crews. Fortunately for Norma, the owner of her trailer had a friend who knew the district\u2019s congressman, Gene Green, and thought to call him. An intern in the representative\u2019s Washington office, Simon Handler, took the call and phoned a federal agency for a helicopter, which soon arrived.Wayne returned from Casey\u2019s parents\u2019 house soaking wet. He changed his clothes and went back to Casey\u2019s side, telling her over and over that help was coming. Shortly before 1 p.m., nearly a day after Wayne\u2019s first 911 call, a paramedic from South Lake Houston E.M.S. called Wayne back. It was the only call Wayne\u2019s cellphone recorded having received from the station, although paramedics later recalled talking with Wayne more than once to keep track of Casey\u2019s condition.Greg Perches, a paramedic who said he spoke with Wayne, arrived at South Lake Houston E.M.S. on Monday night, which allowed the ambulance service to assemble a second crew. Wayne impressed him by saying he thought Casey was becoming septic, using a medical term that indicated a potentially deadly consequence of a severe infection.The county\u2019s systems were supposed to prioritize people like Casey, people who \u201chave a medical situation, even if they\u2019re not in an area where flooding is life-threatening,\u201d Francisco S\u00e1nchez, a deputy emergency-management coordinator for Harris County Homeland Security and Emergency Management, later said.Perches says his director, Joe Fress, phoned the county fire desk to see whether the county had resources to send to Wayne and Casey\u2019s street, but was told it did not. By the logic of the county\u2019s emergency-management plan for health and medical services, the ambulance service should have been able to call for assistance from a regional catastrophic medical operations center, which was in charge of coordinating patient evacuation, transport and placement. But that center did not have its own air or boat resources, and additional ambulances would have been of no use in reaching flooded areas. The ambulance companies had to rely on fire services to help them. But in South Lake Houston\u2019s district, unlike in some other parts of Harris County, including Houston, fire and ambulance services were completely independent agencies. Although they were responsible for largely overlapping districts, Sheldon Fire and South Lake Houston E.M.S. did not follow recommendations to set up a joint command in response to the disaster, in part because there were so few workers available. Also, while personnel were individually friendly and respected each other, there was \u201cbad blood from a long time ago\u201d between the agencies, Sheldon Fire\u2019s Captain Pinson says. \u201cThey don\u2019t work with us that well.\u201d Workers from both agencies would later agree that communications between them during the disaster were poor. Their radios were on different channels, and their calls were dispatched separately by the 911 center. That meant that when someone having a medical emergency was also trapped by floodwaters, the fire department would not necessarily know about it. The paramedics were fatalistic. \u201cWe were fortunate to get what we could get\u201d in terms of outside help, says Billy Slagle, a supervisor at the E.M.S. service. Theirs is a \u201cvery small community,\u201d he says, \u201cwho\u2019s nobody.\u201dPerches told Wayne to flag down any boat he could, both men later recalled. Right after the call, Wayne turned his phone to record Casey as she lay, flushed and barely conscious, on the recliner chair by the front door. He had heard on the news that people were making false reports when they called 911. He wanted to document that this was a true medical emergency, and that Casey needed help, in case anyone ever questioned him.\u201cCasey?\u201d Wayne asked as he recorded her. The feverish eyes of his wife flickered and focused. She made a sound that might have been the beginnings of the word, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming to help us, O.K.? I love you.\u201d She groaned softly and turned her head away from him. \u201cJust keep breathing, O.K.?\u201d he said. Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cJust Breathe\u201d was their special song.It was 12:54 p.m. There was still no power, and light from the open door threw shadows across her reddened face as she lay on the easy chair. Outside, the flooding continued receding, but slowly.After he finished the short recording, Wayne heard a sound that made him look outside. He saw a tiny aluminum boat motoring past the house with two men in it. Wayne stood up and kicked the door open, shouting: \u201cMy wife is dying, man. I got to get her out of here.\u201dThey carried Casey to the boat and motored 300 feet to the drainage ditch at the corner of Enchanted Path Drive and John Ralston Road, where the street was dry. One man took off running to try to flag an airboat, waving his arms and screaming: \u201cWe got a medical emergency! We got a medical emergency!\u201dStephanie Vincent, a 37-year-old respiratory therapist from Kinder, La., was with a group of boat volunteers about a half-mile up the road and saw the man running in their direction. \u201cThey got something over there,\u201d she said, and started running toward the man with several friends.One of the airboats they were with flew ahead of them. About a half-dozen men picked up Casey by her arms and legs and loaded her into the airboat. \u201cBe careful of her left side,\u201d Wayne warned them.Vincent and a medical student whose name nobody could later recall tried to get a history of Casey\u2019s problems, but a glance told them all they needed to know. \u201cThis woman needs critical care right now,\u201d the medical student said. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting for her life, and she looks like she\u2019s losing.\u201dThey headed to a nearby field free of power lines where a helicopter could land. A volunteer from Pasadena, Tex., tried calling a number he had found for the Coast Guard on Facebook or Zello, a walkie-talkie app that citizen rescuers were using. Other volunteers stood on a bridge where the road crossed a swollen channel, waving their brightly colored life jackets to try to flag passing helicopters.Vincent stood beside Casey, holding her hand and trying to talk to her. Casey was able to open her eyes and squeeze Vincent\u2019s hand, but she could not speak aside from moaning. Casey was trembling, and Vincent took off her jackets to make a pillow.For the volunteers, the day to that point had been filled with waiting. They had slept in a Baptist church overnight and followed a member of the Cajun Navy to try to evacuate 275 people from a flooded trailer park. But when they reached the neighborhood, residents did not want to leave. The volunteer boat fleet had not managed to find anyone willing to be rescued until Wayne and Casey.Now Vincent felt there was a reason they were supposed to be there. She wished she had brought a monitor to check Casey\u2019s oxygen level. Wayne kept hold of Casey\u2019s hand and murmured encouragement to her. He repeatedly thanked the volunteers. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Vincent said. She and her friends had waited hours for something useful to do. If they had known about Casey, they would have gone right to her.The man from Pasadena called again to check on the helicopter. There were several operating in the area, but all were fully loaded with passengers and would not be back for the better part of an hour. A half-hour passed, then more, with Vincent growing irritated and panicked. Why were they just sitting there? Casey was going to stop breathing and die if they did not get her somewhere. \u201cPut her on our boat,\u201d she told the others.Her idea was to take Casey back to the meeting point where the boats had launched that morning, at the Houston Motorsports Park, about three miles north off a major parkway. Two Texas Department of Transportation high-water dump-truck crews had been parked there for hours, waiting to transport evacuees.Several volunteers lifted Casey onto a seat of the white bay boat, laying her head back on the bow, where Stephanie arranged life jackets to cushion it in anticipation of a fast, bumpy ride. Vincent and Wayne supported Casey\u2019s head as they took off, speeding west along the swollen canal toward the flooded Greens Bayou.They began twisting along Greens Bayou, taking shortcuts where they could. Vincent sat on the bow facing backward, hair whipping in the wet wind, keeping a finger on Casey\u2019s neck to monitor her carotid pulse. It was extremely fast and irregular, an indication that Casey\u2019s heart was malfunctioning. The skin around Casey\u2019s lips was blue. All of these signs were ominous, and Vincent later said she thought about the possibility she would need to start CPR. She had the sense that Wayne expected it, too.At one point, Vincent\u2019s friend Rachelle McClellan jumped out of the boat to help push them over a sand-choked levee against a current \u2014 she had to be pulled back in on the other side, where the water was deeper. To McClellan, the way Casey\u2019s hands and feet looked reminded her of how her mother\u2019s did the day she died. The entire journey took about 15 minutes. When they arrived, a truck was already backed up deep into the water. McClellan held onto the truck bed to keep it steady, and several men lifted Casey into it, where the gravel normally goes. Wayne and a transportation employee hopped in behind her.They planned to drive to a hospital, but found the roads were closed, and a National Guardsman they passed recommended that they drive to a small shopping center off Beltway 8, about four miles north. There was supposed to be a medical station at a Kroger grocery store, and there was also a 24-hour emergency-care center run by Memorial Hermann, the hospital system where Casey had undergone her surgery.As the truck bumped and jerked along the road, Wayne could not recall a more uncomfortable ride. The motion was beating up Casey. He struggled to keep her covered as the rain started up again. She was wet and filthy and surely cold.They arrived to find no medical clinic outside the Kroger, and the emergency medical center was closed. The two transportation employees in their orange vests cussed and looked scared. \u201cThis woman is dying,\u201d Wayne heard one of them say into a phone or radio. \u201cShe\u2019s going to die right here if we don\u2019t get her an ambulance.\u201dShe said the paramedics would do their best to get there and asked whether he had access to a defibrillator. He did not.The call center dispatched a South Lake Houston E.M.S. ambulance to the far north of its territory. \u201cYou need to bring the patient to the freeway,\u201d the paramedic who took the call, Tyler Cegielski, said. The paramedics were not willing to exit the freeway for fear of swamping their ambulance in high water. They would have to navigate around some areas of flooding and predicted they would be at that part of the freeway in 10 or 15 minutes.The dump truck bumped back out of the parking lot and onto the freeway to await the ambulance. Wayne leaned over Casey, cradling her head in his left arm, and caressing her with his right, her body half in his lap and half in the bed of the dump truck.\u201cJust hang in there, sweetheart. Just breathe. Just breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp is on the way. The ambulance is coming.\u201dIt was taking much longer than 15 minutes. Wayne saw several ambulances pass by, but they seemed to be going other places. The rain picked up again, and the workers let out a tarp over the truck bed to protect them.Casey had been fading in and out of consciousness for hours now. Wayne felt her stir. Her left hand rose to clench his shirt, pulling his face down to her so they were nose to nose. Her eyes were open now, looking at him. \u201cLet me go,\u201d she said, the first clear words he\u2019d heard her say in more than a day. \u201cLet me go.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he said. \u201cHelp is right here.\u201d But Casey did not respond. She vomited something dark and foul-smelling. She stopped breathing.Wayne reached his hand out and beat on the driver\u2019s side window. \u201cMy wife\u2019s dying back here,\u201d he yelled.Milburn climbed into the truck bed with them. Casey had no pulse. He began performing CPR. Wayne saw a constable on the other side of the Beltway and leapt out of the back of the dump truck to run to her, jumping over the central median. She called for help on her radio and, seeing another constable pulling up, she told Wayne, \u201cGet that one.\u201d Wayne ran over and told the second constable the situation. That constable, too, got on his radio. Wayne crossed back over the median and hailed a third constable, who turned on his emergency lights, cut off traffic and pulled up behind the dump truck. Another constable arrived along with passers-by who had been driving on the freeway. One went into the back of the dump truck to help work on Casey.\nAbout three minutes after Wayne returned to the dump truck, at 3:16 p.m., the ambulance finally arrived.Two of the paramedics who had tried to save Randy Belcher the previous day, Jeremy Fuentes and Jason Foster, took over and brought Casey out of the dump truck. They figured it had been about eight minutes since her heart had stopped. They inserted a breathing tube, started an intravenous line in the crook of her right elbow and placed a needle into the tibia of her right leg to deliver fluids. They attached a pistonlike Lucas device that uses a suction cup to compress and recoil the chest, providing automated CPR.The idea that the young woman had been breathing and even speaking just a few minutes earlier made Fuentes think they had a chance to revive her. They went through everything they had on their truck that might restart Casey\u2019s heart \u2014 multiple doses of epinephrine and atropine \u2014 but nothing seemed to work. The monitor showed a flat line, no electrical signal that they could shock back to regular rhythm. To Fuentes, the hardest part was watching Wayne watch Casey.After about 20 minutes, one of the paramedics said, \u201cMr. Dailey, we got to go.\u201d Wayne rode in Ambulance No. 25 with Casey. He supplied her medical history as the ambulance, slowed by the rain, headed to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital in Humble, more than 11 miles away, the only working hospital they knew they could reach.They arrived at 3:54 p.m. Casey\u2019s temperature was high, but her pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure were nonexistent. Her pupils did not react to light, a sign that her brain had not received enough oxygen.For eight minutes, the hospital team pumped Casey\u2019s chest, filled her lungs with oxygen, and gave her additional doses of epinephrine. But at 4:04 p.m., Dr. Christopher Langan concluded nothing could revive her.It was 1 day 2 hours 30 minutes after Wayne\u2019s first call to 911. Wayne reached Casey\u2019s parents on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cCasey\u2019s gone.\u201dWayne responded to the messages. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that my wife passed away on the way to the hospital,\u201d he wrote in a text message to a stranger with a South Carolina area code. \u201cI appreciate your efforts, thank you.\u201d\u201cI am so so sorry for your loss,\u201d the stranger wrote back. \u201cSending prayers your way.\u201dThe next week, Wayne\u2019s and Casey\u2019s parents noticed that she was not named as a victim of the storm. Wayne called the Harris County Medical Examiner\u2019s office, distraught. \u201cHow come my wife is not on the list of people who died as a direct impact of Harvey?\u201d he asked. The investigator explained that \u201cdirect impact\u201d primarily meant drowning. Wayne\u2019s wife, on the other hand, had a medical problem.Wayne said he knew that, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t have died in the back of a dump truck on Beltway 8 after going through three boat rides if there were no floodwaters in front of my house. Because E.M.S. is 10 minutes down my street. She\u2019d be in a hospital right now.\u201d The investigator apologized and offered to talk to her administrator to see if she could get Casey on the list.To this day, Casey\u2019s death is not included in Hurricane Harvey\u2019s official toll. Randy Belcher\u2019s is not either. In interviews, personnel at South Lake Houston E.M.S. said they believed that at least four or five other people in the district who called 911 with medical emergencies died when they were not rescued in time.Local media highlighted deaths of people in other districts as well: Noah Delgado, an 8-year-old who died of an asthma attack in northwest Harris County and whose mother could not get through to 911; Bonnie Parsutt, 69, who died in Galveston County after her oxygen failed when the electricity went out; Mary Avila, 80, also in Galveston County, who died in a nursing home when she could not get dialysis; and a heart-attack victim who died at home in a flooded neighborhood of Montgomery County that emergency workers could not reach.The City of Houston reported to the F.C.C. that many people with disabilities who had entered themselves into the State of Texas Emergency Assistance Registry and had repeatedly called 911 and 211, the city\u2019s non-emergency line, to request help when their homes flooded did not receive assistance.The number of acutely ill people who lost their lives because of delayed rescues has not been tallied. Preliminary data from the state health department\u2019s Center for Health Statistics indicate that 2,498 people died in Harris County in August 2017, nearly 200 more people than died in July of that year. Over the period of 2008-16, deaths in July compared with August typically varied only slightly. August 2017 appears to be an outlier.The Harris County medical examiner lists only 36 deaths as storm-related, all of which were caused directly by drowning, falls in floodwaters and electrocutions. \u201cWe consider only deaths that are a direct consequence of environmental factors,\u201d says Tricia Rudisill Bentley, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner\u2019s office.When they discharged Casey before the storm, doctors at Memorial Hermann did not send her home with this medicine, which is routinely given after removal of a hormone-producing adrenal-gland tumor. Memorial Hermann referred questions about the case to the individual physicians. Dr. Curtis Wray, her surgeon, declined several requests to speak through UTHealth, where he is an associate professor of surgery. The intern who discharged Casey also did not respond to several email and phone inquiries.Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, the head of endocrine surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Casey\u2019s symptoms were consistent with insufficient cortisol. \u201cSomeone forgot to give her steroids,\u201d says the surgeon, whose group has performed close to 3,000 operations of the type Casey had. That failure, and the delay in her transport to the hospital, was all the more tragic, Dr. Thompson added, because the condition she had \u201cis highly curable.\u201dDr. Laurence Katznelson, medical director of the pituitary center at Stanford School of Medicine, agrees. \u201cEverybody gets placed on steroids,\u201d he says.

{"Headline": "Year After Rohingya Massacres, Top Generals Unrepentant and Unpunished", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting a year ago, more than 700,000 Rohingya began fleeing Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh amid a frenzy of massacre, rape and arson by soldiers and Buddhist mobs \u2014 acts of violence that have been widely documented.On Tuesday, while Myanmar\u2019s commander in chief was shopping for weaponry in Russia, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the country\u2019s de facto civilian leader, gave a speech in Singapore in which she made no mention of the bloodletting by the nation\u2019s armed forces. Thousands of Rohingya are believed to have been killed in northern Rakhine State.United Nations officials have raised the prospect that the violence could be considered genocide, and officials at the United States State Department have debated using the term, according to American diplomats.But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, blamed \u201cterrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine.\u201dBut human rights groups have documented how the nation\u2019s military dispatched truckloads of soldiers to northern Rakhine even in the weeks before the Aug. 25 insurgent strike.In a question-and-answer session after her lecture in Singapore, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, whose father founded Myanmar\u2019s modern army, said that she found the generals in her cabinet to be \u201crather sweet.\u201dSidestepping a question about the safety concerns that Rohingya sheltering in Bangladesh had about returning home, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi focused on Rakhine\u2019s tourism potential, calling the state \u201cthe most beautiful region in Myanmar.\u201d\u201cAll of the foreigners I have ever met frequently told me that the beaches in Rakhine State are more attractive than those across the world,\u201d she said.The United States, Canada and the European Union have placed targeted sanctions on Myanmar military officers believed to have directed the violence against the largely stateless Rohingya last year. But General Min Aung Hlaing and other top brass were spared.Others are pushing for Myanmar to be formally investigated for war crimes. On Friday, a group of 132 Southeast Asian lawmakers called on the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, which rules on genocide and mass atrocity crimes.\u201cOne year has passed since the Myanmar military launched its murderous operation in Rakhine State, yet we are no closer to seeing those responsible brought to justice,\u201d said Charles Santiago, a member of the Malaysian Parliament. \u201cAs Myanmar is clearly both unwilling and unable to investigate itself, we are now at a stage where the international community must step in to ensure accountability.\u201dMyanmar is not a signatory to the treaty that established the International Criminal Court, but the Security Council has the power to begin the process of judicial action. On Monday, the Security Council is scheduled to discuss the ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.But China and Russia, two permanent members of the United Nations body, have often shielded Myanmar from formal condemnation. Myanmar purchases military equipment from both countries. China has invested heavily in Myanmar\u2019s natural resources, particularly in areas where ethnic minorities live, such as Rakhine State.Myanmar\u2019s commander in chief thanked Russia for its \u201ccooperation in training and military technology between the two armed forces, cooperation in antiterrorism, support and assistance for Myanmar in solving the problems in northern Rakhine State,\u201d said the Facebook post.On a recent visit by journalists from The New York Times to Myin Hlut, one such village in Rakhine State, tropical foliage had reclaimed what was once a place of human habitation, vines curling up concrete posts and smothering the scorched foundations of homes. The road was lined with charred palm trees and the carcasses of burned-out mosques.\u201cEverything has disappeared,\u201d he said, \u201ceven my dreams.\u201dMyanmar has one of the largest armies in Southeast Asia. A military junta ruled the country for nearly half a century, placing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 years.The current Myanmar government, which is composed of a hybrid military-civilian leadership, has formed half a dozen commissions to look into the violence in northern Rakhine. But apart from one specific case and a handful of firings or demotions, no individuals have been held accountable for mass rapes, killings and village burnings.Two of the Reuters journalists whose reporting was integral to the Inn Din story are in jail, on trial for violating Myanmar\u2019s Official Secrets Act. Their verdict is expected on Monday, and they could face up to 14 years in prison if convicted.Saw Nang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reclaiming Patriotism for the Left ", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurrendering national pride to champions of a blood-and-soil vision abdicates the fight for the soul and meaning of the American project. Mr. Cowie is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Great Exception: The New Deal and the Limits of American Politics.\u201dThe resurgence of blood-and-soil nationalism around the world seems to prove that appeals to nationhood are too racist, too tribal and too dangerous to be of value. Yet surrendering patriotism to champions of the ethno-state abdicates the fight for the soul and meaning of the American project. The American left, from the center of the Democratic Party to its insurgent challengers, needs a dose of national vision. One of the core lessons of Trumpian politics is that Americans are starved for a meaningful politics of what it means to be American. Getting rid of the vainglorious Trump administration is only a partial solution. The causes of his rise remain.In recent decades, progressive forces in the United States have split between two positions, both of which surrender a robust and hopeful sense of national citizenship. On one track can be found a cosmopolitan economic elite that embrace a multicultural world order shaped largely by the politics of corporate globalization. On the other track are radical critics of the racism and imperialism of the American state who often support local community and transnational solidarity but maintain a deep cynicism, even despair, about the American project. Both groups have abdicated the national story to their shared political enemies. What remains is a fervent hybrid of nationalism and anti-statism, an echo of the rebel yell. Globalization has further complicated the problem. In a dizzying world of oppressive economic and political inequality, global trade, immigration and technological disruption, voters seek grounding not in technocratic detail but in place, in time, in tradition and, above all, in the shared fate, history and meaning of the nation. The unhealed wounds of the 2008 financial crisis may have laid the way for Donald Trump, but the full mosaic of the American working class has long been looking desperately for routes to make America great again. As globalization expanded, it pounded foreign cars with sledge hammers, sponsored protective tariffs, promoted \u201cBuy American\u201d campaigns, tried to defeat Nafta, tried to organize unions and fought against undocumented migrant labor. But the plants closed anyway, domestic and foreign capital moved around, mass migrations happened, attacks on worker protections proceeded at a relentless pace, and the increasingly complicated world of national politics seemed more focused on Davos than Peoria. The nation is the only \u201cimagined community,\u201d as Benedict Anderson put, where everything from mass transit to health care to wealth distribution to a green economy can find traction. A rejuvenated national vision would transcend the backward-looking \u2014 and often reactionary \u2014 search for an America in arrested decay that has too often informed politics since Ronald Reagan first promised to make America great again.To be sure, the rhetoric of nationalism can be dangerous in a place with a history of settler colonialism, slavery, anti-immigrant hysteria and territorial expansion. Any civic framing risks fomenting exclusion by drawing lines between those who are in and those who are out \u2014 an especially profound problem in an era of mass migration. Yet when the American left abandons any vision of social patriotism because of the racist ugliness it has come to symbolize, it concedes the American story to the voices of exclusion and avarice. Patriotism may well be the last refuge of the scoundrel, but as a pragmatist like Mr. Rorty would tell you, it is too powerful and too important to leave to the scoundrels. Voters are in search of a place of vision for average Americans, a place of idealism in an age of cynicism, a place of unity in a time of fracture and a place where policy can be embedded in something greater than technocracy. While commentators are getting worked up over the revival of \u201csocialism,\u201d an increasing number of insurgent blue-collar Democrats across the country are looking to recapture a sense of nation. The dark-horse candidate from Kansas, the Army veteran James Thompson, for instance, promises to \u201cFight for America.\u201d As we approach midterm elections, we urgently need to hear these messages in good faith and rise to their challenge.

{"Headline": "Wait, What Did You Just Say About Jews?", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SA bank teller\u2019s derogatory remark leaves a reader wondering whether to speak up or wait for it to happen to someone else.I went to my local bank to cash a check. The teller was new and seemed like a nice lady. She asked for my ID. (It\u2019s bank policy.) I gave it to her gladly, and we exchanged small talk over customers who get angry about the ID requirement. Then she leaned toward me and said in a quiet voice, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly the Jews who get mad.\u201d I am Jewish but don\u2019t have a so-called Jewish sounding name. I didn\u2019t say anything, but this has really stuck with me. Should I go to her boss, or hope she says something similar to someone who will speak up?G.S.B.I\u2019m afraid you have to do something, but I don\u2019t love your proposed options. (I also get that it can be hard to confront people.) So let\u2019s play this out. Hoping for lightning to strike twice \u2014 for the teller to repeat this exact conversation with another customer who is willing to take her on \u2014 seems like lottery-winning odds. Let\u2019s scratch that one.Reporting her to the boss for a clearly anti-Semitic crack would probably be more effective. She may be reprimanded or fired. But this is not the move I\u2019d start with. I\u2019m not saying she doesn\u2019t deserve to be reprimanded or fired, or that you shouldn\u2019t report her. You are 100 percent entitled to do so. But disciplinary action can harden prejudice in people whose hearts we may otherwise soften. (We don\u2019t have to rule it out yet, either.)Over the years, I have been called many nasty names based on my sexuality and ethnicity. But building bridges usually makes me feel better than filing complaints. I\u2019m in charge! Consider going back to the teller: \u201cI enjoyed chatting with you until you made that comment about Jewish people and IDs. I\u2019m Jewish. I gave you my ID gladly, and you hurt my feelings. Please don\u2019t generalize about other people.\u201d Challenge her worldview by giving her a second chance. The manager is right there if you\u2019re not satisfied.I am a 15-year-old girl. I see my grandmother twice a year. Every time, she makes comments about my body: how much I eat, how big I am. I\u2019m not sure if these remarks are intentional or if they just slip out. I am very critical of myself already, and having someone (whose opinion I care about) saying these things is hurtful. It\u2019s hard to enjoy myself around her. I have no idea what to do.ANONYMOUSHere are my first, second and third points: You are amazing just the way you are! You can speak with your parents about this, but it may be empowering to handle it on your own. Take your grandmother aside and say: \u201cI love you, Nana. But you make so many comments about my body and food that it\u2019s hard to be around you. They make me feel bad. Can you stop it, please?\u201dYou may have to remind her a few times. If she\u2019s trying, work with her. But if not, see her as little as possible. The world is hard enough for girls. Let\u2019s not tolerate sabotage from inside your own family. I have a good friend who lives in my town. I\u2019m not sure why, but we became estranged. She just stopped talking to me. After that, I decided I didn\u2019t want her friendship anymore. But it\u2019s uncomfortable to run into her at the pizzeria or the supermarket. I smile, say hello and move on. How do I stop feeling bad about this?ANONYMOUSIf you\u2019ve read Social Q\u2019s before, you know that I often make a pitch for trying to sort out the misunderstanding. \u201cWhat happened between us? Why did you stop speaking to me?\u201d I think the part of you that feels bad wants to do that, too. But if you are committed to estrangement, you\u2019ll have to live with the discomfort. How could you not flash on the good times and the hurtful ending \u2014 mixed feelings incarnate! \u2014 every time you bump into her?When I am a houseguest, how may I ask politely if there is a rubberized tub mat in the house so I don\u2019t risk slipping and falling in the tub? I have been in too many slick-tiled shower stalls and slippery tubs to count \u2014 all without rubberized suction mats. I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful, but I have the usual balance issues that come with age, and I don\u2019t want my husband to have to spot me while I shower.A.O.I love your savvy self-care. But it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that if your hosts have not laid down a rubber mat in the guest shower or tub, they do not count one among their possessions. Why would they hide it away? So, I\u2019d be less inclined to ask for one than to pop down to the hardware store or stash an extra in the trunk of my car. Think of it as a small, additional host gift that you can take or leave behind when you go. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Actually, Curbing Uber Won\u2019t Relieve Heavy Traffic ", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe real factors for congestion are increased freight movement, construction activity and tourism, population and job growth. From 2009 (before ride hailing) through 2015, the study finds that reductions in vehicular speeds began long before ride hailing hit the stage, and the pattern did not change after ride hailing. The primary factors of reductions in vehicular speed, according to the study, are increased freight movement, construction activity and tourism, population and job growth. In short, ride hailing is not responsible for greater road congestion. Critics may dismiss this report by pointing to a 60 percent jump, since 2015, in for-hire vehicles. But according to a recent New York City Department of Transportation study on traffic speeds in Manhattan\u2019s central business district, between 2015 and 2017, traffic speeds fell by about 4 percent. From 2010 to 2014, before ride hailing took off, speeds fell by 12.1 percent. In fact, every year before 2015 the reduction in speed was greater than the yearly reductions in speed after 2015. The sharpest reductions in speed were between 2012-13 and 2014-15 \u2014 i.e., before ride hailing \u201cconquered\u201d Manhattan. News reports from across the country suggest that evidence of ride hailing causing traffic congestion in other cities has been provided by a series of reports produced by Bruce Schaller, a former policy director at the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.This makes it difficult to conclude from Mr. Schaller\u2019s reports if ride hailing is a significant contributor to the speed slowdown. Mr. Schaller seems to be capturing an established pattern of speed reductions that occurred before ride hailing. In other words, even if all ride-hailing services disappeared today, New York City will continue on the path of declining vehicle speeds because of growth in population, tourism, pedestrians, freight movements and construction activity. Before the City Council chooses to limit ride-hailing services to New Yorkers, especially those in the boroughs outside Manhattan, it should test whether claims about those services are well-founded. As it stands today, there is no compelling evidence that ride hailing has been a primary or significant cause of New York\u2019s traffic problems. Advertisement"}

Today he and Alison Ohringer, who\u2019s making her debut, came to play with a bunch of very smart clues and a frothy, multidimensional theme. I found the theme particularly well-executed, as there were three little eurekas involved in solving, yet it wasn\u2019t obscure or frustrating.As far as clues, FLORA, RUSH HOUR, TSARS, YEAGER, HIFI and LIAR were all really good, I thought, and I liked DUET next to EPEE. There were plenty more.29A: This clue \u2014 \u201cExpecting help?\u201d \u2014 was firmly among the puns above, but it really did stump me until I remembered that famous boxing call and got the Z in LAMAZE. 93A: There are myriad ways to euphemize \u201chell\u201d in any company, from heck or huckleberry to anguish, misery or inferno. Informally, you say \u201cwhat in the SAM HILL\u201d is going on?\u201d 118A: A very welcome debut today: hopefully Ms. Ohringer and Mr. Agard (and you!) are fans of APARNA Nancherla, a thoughtful comedian with trenchant, hilarious bits, who kills on Twitter and is actually safe for work. If the selection here doesn\u2019t tickle you, please give her another chance; I just have this penchant for fruit humor and it\u2019s not always easy to come by.There are eight theme entries, each with a circled letter, as well as a revealer at the puzzle\u2019s center, 69A. Each of the theme clues solves to a two-word answer; in each of the two-word answers, the second word is an anagram of the first word, minus one letter \u2014 and that letter is singled out with the circle. Once you\u2019ve solved, reading from top to bottom and left to right, the circled letters spell out a word that defines them, as a group, vis-\u00e0-vis their role in this puzzle. Phew!Let\u2019s take it from the top and look at 24A: \u201cCaterer\u2019s platter\u201d \u2014 PARTY TRAY. You\u2019ll see that the \u201cP\u201d is circled, and the rest of the letters in PARTY rearrange to form TRAY. The \u201cP\u201d is the plucky little ghost in this clue.One more, 95A: \u201cIt might only take seven digits.\u201d You might think of fingers, if you were feeling morbid and weird, but this clue is referring to a phone number \u2014 one where only seven digits are needed, with no area code, is a LOCAL CALL (this reference itself might seem anachronistic to the millennials with their cellular phones, but presumably the notion of local vs. long distance is still with us in spirit, pun intended). So LOCAL - O = CALL and \u201cO\u201d is the circled letter in this case.And the word that\u2019s spelled out? If you take away its H and scramble, you\u2019d get a POSTMAN.ALISON: I am a grad student at UC Berkeley in global health and infectious disease.

On a whim, I started making puzzles a few months ago with a friend after we saw that Rex Parker (Michael Sharp) had offered his help to any aspiring constructors. Rex referred me to the Facebook group called the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory, and I sent my first-ever puzzle to a handful of \u201ctest-solvers,\u201d including Erik. The feedback I got from the dozen or so people who replied was all genuinely kind, supportive and helpful.

Alison noticed that, using only phrases that dropped the letter in the second word, we could spell out PHANTO, which we found to be (most of) an apt description of the disappearing letters. The toughest part was trying to find phrases for the M and the S, since nothing in our word lists would work and we had to search manually. How did people do this stuff before computers?

Mr. Schmitz is a senior editor at First Things.No matter what Francis does now, the Catholic Church has been plunged into all-out civil war. On one side are the traditionalists, who insist that abuse can be prevented only by tighter adherence to church doctrine. On the other side are the liberals, who demand that the church cease condemning homosexual acts and allow gay priests to step out of the closet.Despite their opposing views, the two sides have important things in common. Both believe that a culture of lies has enabled predators to flourish. And both trace this culture back to the church\u2019s hypocritical practice of claiming that homosexual acts are wrong while quietly tolerating them among the clergy.The other rule of the clerical closet is not violating the civil law \u2014 or at least not getting caught. Francis defended Monsignor Ricca by distinguishing between sins and crimes: \u201cThey are not crimes, right? Crimes are something different.\u201d This distinction provides cover for sex abuse.

Dr. Medina is an expert in media studies from Nicaragua. CARSON CITY, Nev. \u2014 I will always remember where I was on July 19, 1979. Six months earlier, my mom and I had arrived in the United States, fleeing the violence of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. I was 8 years old. It was a beautiful summer day in San Francisco. My friends and I were skateboarding on the courtyard of our apartment complex when my friend\u2019s mom came out and said: \u201cSomoza is gone.\u201d I was 9 years old when we returned to Nicaragua. Everything was different. You could still see the war scars in the town I was from. A whole city block was gone after Somoza\u2019s aircraft bombed it. It was never rebuilt. We called it \u201cla manzana bombardeada,\u201d or the bombed city block, and used it as a landmark for directions. Yet despite the destruction, there was a feeling of excitement, of possibility, of freedom.My mom became wary of Sandinismo soon after the Literacy Crusade. While she felt the initial surge of enthusiasm, there were red flags early on. My mom forbade me from joining. She said, \u201cIn this family, we do not spy on our neighbors, our family or our friends.\u201dI am now 47, and I find myself in a familiar situation. I am, again, abroad while my homeland is in chaos. The media must shed light on the systematic violation of human rights and abuses Nicaragua\u2019s citizens are enduring at the hands of the Ortega administration, if only to provide a counterpoint to the regime\u2019s lies, denials and failure to govern and protect all of its citizens. Nicaraguans live in a country where the president and vice president routinely accuse their opposition of attempting a coup while referring to paramilitary groups as \u201cvolunteer police officers.\u201d This is a country where heavily armed Ortega supporters kidnap people from their homes, and where doctors are fired from public hospitals for providing medical care to wounded protesters. Make no mistake, this is a human rights crisis, and it is at our doorstep. Mr. Ortega\u2019s regime must be exposed for what it really is: a return to a dictatorship.Cynara M.

I know you want people who can hide in cramped spaces, and while I cannot do this because I am mildly claustrophobic and prone to screaming, I just want to let you know that I am small. It\u2019s who I am! I can tread water for up to two minutes. I can make it to three minutes on a good day, given that I have not eaten a cheeseburger in the past hour. If you need me to do this to cross a moat into a castle or whatever, let me know ahead of time because there\u2019s always a good chance I\u2019ve eaten a cheeseburger. Though I am not qualified to be the team\u2019s hacker, I did take calculus in high school and passed the AP exam.

I\u2019m great at moving like I\u2019m in a heist. You know \u2014 intentionally but casually. That\u2019s how I walk every morning to the coffee shop where I have a crush on the barista, Tad. If you don\u2019t believe me, come watch me interact with Tad. He has no idea I have a crush on him because I have nailed down this \u201cintentional but casual\u201d thing and because I am terrible at flirting.  You need someone to scope out a museum? A casino? An Equinox gym with too many fitness rooms? I\u2019m your gal.

Buildings with numerous floors are the most difficult because, like in a David Mitchell novel, keeping track of multiple stories is hard. I can maintain a fake identity extremely well. For example, Tad the barista thinks my name is Sandy, which is what I blurted in a panic when I first ordered coffee six months ago. I never had the courage to correct him, so he still thinks my name is Sandy and knows nothing about me because I lose my ability to speak whenever he asks questions. He knows nothing about me, yet I know everything about him (tall; brown hair; works the morning shift on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays). Isn\u2019t that useful?Why do I want in? Not for the money. Nor the glory. Nor the adrenaline. I\u2019m already wealthy and glorified, and have a chemical imbalance that gives me constant adrenaline-based migraines.

{"Headline": "Hundreds of Reindeer Died by Lightning. Their Carcasses Became a Laboratory.", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobites\u201cFrom death comes life,\u201d said researchers who studied how decomposing bodies, with the help of scavengers, might alter plant diversity across a broad landscape.Their bodies soon became a soup of nutrients and a rich feeding ground for scavengers, which dropped feces packed with seeds all around the carcasses.\u201cFrom death comes life,\u201d said Sam Steyaert, a researcher at the University of South-Eastern Norway and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, and an author of the paper. When Dr. Steyaert learned of the reindeer die-off, he saw an opportunity to turn a tragedy into a grand natural experiment. He and a group of collaborators started a self-funded project. They named it REINCAR, which was short for reindeer carcasses, but also the start of the word reincarnation.That October, the scientists set up their field laboratory. Each visit, they arrived to hundreds of ravens and crows, many smaller birds and the occasional circling eagle or buzzard. Their camera traps captured foxes and wolverines, among other visitors. The cadavers still bore plenty of flesh but were ballooned from the gases released during decomposition and contained \u201call kinds of juice \u2014 and thousands and thousands of maggots, of course,\u201d Dr. Steyaert said. There were also piles of feces everywhere. Some droppings, the researchers noticed, were blue and loaded with crowberry seeds.From survey plots, the scientists found that fox and bird feces were most concentrated in carrion-dense areas, supporting their suspicion that carcasses were magnets for scavengers. They confirmed in the lab that a large portion of crowberry seeds found in the feces could grow into seedlings. Incidentally, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what the carcasses are creating,\u201d Dr. Steyaert said, explaining that abrupt shifts in soil nutrients and acidity from rotting carrion kills vegetation. Add a bunch of roaming scavengers that bring in a mix of seeds from a wide area, and you basically have \u201cdirected seed dispersal to the ideal germination spot,\u201d he said. His team suspects the site will become a hot spot of genetic diversity for plants, as well as nutrients and microbes that scavengers help redistribute.Ecologists typically think of carcasses as hyperlocal \u201cdecomposition islands,\u201d said Jennifer Pechal, an assistant entomology professor at Michigan State University who was not involved in the study. The idea that carcasses can alter biodiversity across a wider landscape is \u201cfascinating\u201d and a \u201cnovel perspective,\u201d she said. Over the last couple years, they have watched it evolve. The first spring was the smelliest time, with blowflies swarming everywhere. To deal with the stench, the researchers put menthol cream in their noses.By last fall, it was mostly skin and bones, with almost no vegetation to be seen. This summer, there\u2019s still skin and bones \u2014 but life is starting to return. Sedges and grasses are filling in, including a wavy hairgrass that bears purple flowers and makes the whole patch look pinkish from a distance.And just last week, when the researchers visited the site, they noticed a new addition: plenty of crowberry seedlings.

{"Headline": "How to Have Bullfights in California? Use Velcro.", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensEvery year in the Central Valley, Portuguese-Americans bring bullfighters from overseas and put on huge festivals \u2014 but shed no blood.\u201cI had never experienced anything that was so primal and so raw before,\u201d Ms. Lyttle said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I was really drawn to initially was just, how does that exist in this place that seems so progressive and is leading the pack as far as animal rights?\u201d she said. As a seasoned photographer with experience in photojournalism, sports and more, Ms. Lyttle had to see these California bullrings herself. When she arrived in late 2017 to Artesia, a city in southeast Los Angeles County, she was blown away. Not only was the bullring in the middle of the town, where Portuguese immigrants had initially settled, but the energy was intoxicating. \u201cIt was just all these amazing Portuguese families,\u201d she said. \u201cMultiple generations. There was this little bar up front where the men were sitting in their traditional fedoras and drinking beer and watching soccer.\u201d At one point, just outside the ring, Ms. Lyttle caught one of the lead forcados \u2014 one of the men who grabs the bull\u2019s face, unarmed \u2014 on his way out. She leaned over. \u201cWhat does that feel like?\u201d she asked. Bullfighting was brought to the Central Valley in the 18th and 19th centuries by way of rancho settlements, or land grants issued by Spain and later Mexico to spur settlement. When a wave of Portuguese immigrants arrived in the 1960s and 1970s, bullfights were revived. Portuguese bullfighting differs from the traditions of Spain and Mexico in that its matadors \u2014 or cavaleiros in this case \u2014 do not kill the bull, but pierce it from horseback with bandeirilhas, or javelins. In the Central Valley, the cavaleiros makes contact with the bull through Velcro-tipped bandeirilhas, which then attach to a Velcro pad on the bull, preventing harm. After the cavaleiros are through, a group of eight forcados (who call themselves the \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d) grab the bull\u2019s head without defense. Eric Sakach, the senior law enforcement specialist of the animal rescue team at the Humane Society of the United States, has been monitoring bloodless bullfights since they arrived in California. In addition to his concern about the horses and bulls in the ring, he doesn\u2019t believe that all of these bullfights are tied to religious events. \u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse,\u201d he said. Yet there are religious connections. The history of bullfights in Europe goes back to feasts of saints, most famously in Pamplona, Spain, and the festival of San Ferm\u00edn. \u201cIn southern Europe in particular, every town has a patron saint,\u201d said Dr. Elmano Costa, a professor of teacher education at California State University, Stanislaus, and director of the Center for Portuguese Studies, who immigrated from Portugal 50 years ago. \u201cEvery town has a festival. And part of the town\u2019s festival is bullfighting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo is it tied to religion? Yes, if you trace it back to those medieval feasts of saints. If you looked at it from a modern lens, then the connections to religion seems a bit tenuous.\u201dBut, as animal rights activists continue to fight for the bulls, so too do the Portuguese-Americans for their tradition. \u201cI really do feel like it is sort of one of those dying sports,\u201d said Ms. Lyttle, adding that Mr. Magina has sustained multiple injuries from bullfighting that have made it impossible for him to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of those things you do for love and for some pats on the back and your community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not making money off of this. There\u2019s no glory outside of small-town fame.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s an image of pride, playfulness and promise at the beginning of the Gay Rights movement in North America. Gottschalk holds up a sign that reads: \u201cI am your worst fear / I am your best fantasy.\u201d Its unevenly printed all caps black marker on plain white poster board is deceptively simple. Gottschalk\u2019s slightly raised chin and upturned mouth project an air of unabashed confidence and confrontation.\u201cDonna Gottschalk is the most famous lesbian photographer you\u2019ve never heard of \u2014 until now\u201d said Deborah Bright, the exhibition curator.Ms. Gottschalk\u2019s work documents her closeness with her biological family (poorer-than-working-class N.Y.C. stock) and her involvement with the radical lesbian, sometimes separatist, communities in the late \u201960s and \u201970s. Only a few of these images were published in their time \u2014 in the Gay Liberation Front newspaper, for example. Moving from New York City to San Francisco (where her three siblings eventually joined her and two came out as gay) and back again, Ms. Gottschalk paid the bills by working various jobs, from artist\u2019s model and topless bartender to a driver of horse-drawn carriages and cabs. Later, she became a master technician, becoming one of the owners and the operator of a photo lab in Connecticut. Home is currently a small farm in rural Vermont. The image of women asleep in a single bed in \u201cSleepers, Limerick, Pennsylvania\u201d (1970) illustrates the point: Above the bed, half-visible at the margins of the frame, hangs a political poster declaring \u201cLesbians Unite!\u201d A statement and an imperative, it\u2019s a perfectly cheeky double-entendre. In public and in private, in the streets or between the sheets, Ms. Gottschalk reminds us that the personal is always and necessarily political \u2014 and vice versa.It is surreal to speak on the phone with someone who has existed photographically for me since my own coming out in the 1990s. We talk about queering time and the renewed intensity of activism in the current political climate; the need for yet more Marches on Washington; the sisterhood of the #MeToo movement; the persistence of social and structural indifference, intolerance and violence. We talk about what has changed since she took these photographs and what hasn\u2019t, about the necessity of \u201cwitnessing our own histories.\u201d Ms. Gottschalk\u2019s subjects are friends, family, partners: loved ones, all. I ask her what compelled her to pick up her camera at particular moments. She talks about being drawn to the beauty, bravery and mystery she saw in those around her, especially in an era when coming out came at great cost. Photography was her way of understanding, her \u201cattempt to fathom.\u201d Her photos are personal, domestic and intimate; most are set in interior, domestic spaces, and always in natural light (her friends would not abide flash!). Too many of her loved ones met early, tragic deaths, including two siblings, one of whom is a major protagonist in the exhibition. We see the life of her sibling Alfie as a childhood brother, as a gay man, as the newly transitioned Myla just before her death from an AIDS-related illness in her 40s. The photos are tinged with mourning and mystery. She\u2019s been holding their memory for decades, \u201cfiercely protective\u201d and unwilling to \u201csubject them to scrutiny, judgment and abuse\u201d from the outside world. \u201cThese people were all very dear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they were beautiful.

{"Headline": "Revelation of a Liverpool Soccer Fan", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEASDevotion to this team has taught me to see the value in crushing defeat.Mr. Critchley is a philosopher and the moderator of The Stone.The decision was made instantly. My son Edward was in Rome for the second leg of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League soccer semifinal on May 2. I was at home in Brooklyn, pretending to prepare for a class, but really watching the game. We are devoted fans of the Liverpool Football Club. We texted throughout the game. Although Liverpool lost the match against Roma, we won the tie over two legs, allowing us to advance to the Champions League final on May 26, when we would face the mighty Real Madrid. At the Champions final, Liverpool\u2019s first in 11 years, we would have the chance to win the most important soccer competition in the world \u2014 yes, the world. Although the World Cup would be starting in June, the top European clubs that compete in the Champions League are, as every serious soccer fan knows, much stronger than any of the national teams. The Champions League is the bigger prize. Edward and I had to watch the final together. But where and how? We reviewed the options. The game was in Kiev. We couldn\u2019t get tickets. We tried to score passes to watch the final on a giant screen at Liverpool\u2019s Anfield Stadium, but the event sold out. What about a London pub? Every bar in the city was going to be heaving with bodies, and we needed to focus on the game. So we settled on watching at my son\u2019s place in Brixton in South London. I flew to the city and met Ed in a bar at Brixton\u2019s Ritzy Cinema where we drank our first beer. It was three hours until kickoff. The air in London was rich, summery and humid, with a looming threat of storms. We ate Thai food in Brixton Market surrounded by a hubbub of vape smoke and the pleasant hum of shoppers. Then we picked up some beer at Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket and headed to Edward\u2019s place to watch. We dominated the game for the first 25 minutes. Then Sergio Ramos, Real Madrid\u2019s ever-smiling captain, wrestled our star forward, Mohamed \u201cMo\u201d Salah, to the ground in an arm lock, crushing him with his weight. Ramos knew what he was doing: eliminating Liverpool\u2019s best player from the game. Salah left the pitch in tears with a busted shoulder. It was a deeply cynical move and should have been punished with a red card or possibly life imprisonment. But, unbelievably, no foul was called. After Salah\u2019s exit, we lost our rhythm and never regained it. In the end, we lost calamitously, almost comically, with two inexplicable errors from our otherwise excellent goalkeeper, Loris Karius, and an astonishing goal (courtesy of a bicycle kick) from Real Madrid\u2019s Gareth Bale. But our fans, decked out all in red, were magnificent throughout, massively outnumbering Madrid\u2019s supporters and singing our songs until the bitter end: \u201cMo Salah, Mo Salah, Mo Salah running down the wing \u2026 the Egyptian king.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to describe the feeling after losing a game like this: We felt stunned, empty, with no desire to speak much. Ed and I sat quietly and drank more beer. I suggested feebly that we go to the pub, but Ed declined, saying he wasn\u2019t feeling it. Nor was I, truthfully. At that moment, like a good metaphor, a vast storm broke over South London, sending rivers of rain into the streets. What does being a soccer fan teach us about being human? It provides us with a living, breathing community of fellow fans, and with a sense of identity and belonging, even if that belonging is virtual, circulating across social networks. For Liverpool supporters, fandom also offers a set of values: compassion, internationalism, decency, honor, self- respect and respect for others, even Manchester United fans (well, sometimes). Soccer fandom binds us together in love. It gives us access to a rich, commonly held history that is also intensely personal. My grandmother has a Liverpool Football Club crest on her gravestone. Soccer was the only thing I could talk about sensibly with my father until his death. Eighty percent of my texting and talking with my son is about the team we love. That\u2019s a century and counting of history. Millions of fans all over the world have similar sets of experiences. And these experiences link together into a vast collective that constitutes the cosmos of fandom. The fans are a living archive. Players come and go, but the fans stay, creating Liverpool\u2019s existential memory. Without them, the game is nothing. With them, it is more than a game. But mainly being a fan is about learning to accept failure and bewildering disappointment. To lose to Real Madrid in the way we did was heartbreaking. Yet our fans are closer than ever. Liverpool\u2019s club song is a moving rendition of the Rodgers and Hammerstein show tune \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d In loss, we are still together. My son and I have watched Liverpool lose many times \u2014 to Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final, to A.C. Milan in the 2007 Champions League final. And we will lose again. The important thing is being together when we do. Soccer teaches you the value of solidarity. The only religious commitment I have is to the Liverpool Football Club. I worship the team\u2019s gods, heroes and ancestors, recount its myths, and engage in the often highly elaborate social ritual of watching the club at least once a week on television. But if soccer is a religion, then it is a polytheistic one. Soccer encourages us to believe powerfully in our favorite team \u2014 its gods, myths and legends \u2014 while acknowledging the equally powerful beliefs of other fans. Everything goes wrong with religion when a belief in the exclusivity of one\u2019s local god merges with a universalistic dogma that one\u2019s own god is the only true god. In my humble opinion, polytheism is vastly preferable to monotheism. And speaking of local gods, before saying goodbye to my son in London, we went to see the David Bowie mural outside the Brixton subway station. Bowie spent the first six years of his life close to that spot. We chatted and took photos of each other, and I examined the multiple inscriptions on the mural. Somehow, at that moment, for reasons difficult to piece together, life made sense. Being human is being a fan.

His rent, car payments and electric bills are all past due, he said in a recent interview.While his case and the resulting backlash were extreme, Mr. Storey, 34, instigated the kind of zero-sum political confrontation that breaks out every day all across the country as politics seeps into and disrupts everyday life. To a degree that is unique to this period and this president, disputes over politics have divided Americans\u2019 homes, strained marriages, ruined friendships and invaded the workplace.High tension, raw emotion and occasional violence have always been a feature of American democracy \u2014 in times of war and peace, through presidential impeachments and mass protest movements. But interviews with voters across the country, along with an analysis of recent research by political scientists who specialize in partisan division, suggest that politics is changing how Americans think and behave in new and unsettling ways.Experts point to several reasons. The volume and sheer ubiquity of information about politics, combined with Americans\u2019 ability to instantaneously render public judgment on one another\u2019s views, has made the political conversation much noisier. And for the first time the country is led by someone who inflames that conversation on a nearly daily basis, taunting his adversaries on Twitter and quickly triggering tens of thousands of responses.\u201cThere is a constant obsession with the ups and downs, the tweets, who we\u2019re supposed to be mad at \u2014 and that is different,\u201d said the historian Jon Meacham, who has written a new book, \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d on how the country endured its most traumatic moments, from the Civil War to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan to Vietnam. \u201cTrump has raised the metabolism of division to remarkable levels.\u201dThere is a sense, especially among Democrats who recoil at Mr. Trump\u2019s style of politics, that partisan affiliation reflects more than just a voting preference. Rather, it says something about your character. And where you come down on Mr. Trump is increasingly a decisive factor in whether or not someone wants to associate with you.Savannah Fehling, 23, of Sarasota, Fla., is one of many Americans whose own troubles live out the data. She said her relationship fell apart after she and her ex-boyfriend came to realize that their political differences \u2014 initially something that drew them together \u2014 were driving them apart.

Her ex, she added, was a \u201csweet, smart, thoughtful guy.\u201d But in the end, \u201che was raised by people who thought a certain way, and it was difficult to get through that.\u201dMaryann Meador, 65, of Saint Marys, Ga., said that she and her husband of 23 years always had mild disagreements over politics. She attributed this to their backgrounds: He is from Texas and collects guns; she was born in Brooklyn and got active in local Democratic politics. But something about Mr. Trump\u2019s election, she said, sharpened their differences. \u201cThe Bushes were hard years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we really didn\u2019t get into screaming matches about it.\u201dNow they have given up their tradition of watching the NBC Nightly News together every evening.

In 1,000 interviews, he said, he found one answer especially troubling: Nearly a third said they had stopped talking to a friend or a family member because of disagreements over politics and the 2016 election.\u201cThis is very different,\u201d Mr. Luntz said in an interview. \u201cWith Obama, people hated him or people loved him.

It still wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d\u201cThen 2016 rolls around,\u201d she said.Among the requests for conflict mitigation she has received since: rabbis and pastors whose congregations are at each other\u2019s throats; Fortune 500 companies where productivity is down because employees bicker over politics; and a mother in New England who feared her family\u2019s holiday would be ruined because her two daughters who were returning from college had not spoken to each other since the 2016 election.\u201cThis is now deep in our homes, deep in our neighborhoods, deep in our places of worship and deep in our workplaces,\u201d Ms. Lukensmeyer said. \u201cIt really is a virus.\u201dAt a focus group convened by Mr. Luntz, Joshua Narramore, 34, of Avon Lake, Ohio, described how he was cut off by an old friend \u2014 someone whose children he babysat and whose family would have him over for dinner \u2014 after posting in support of Mr. Trump on Facebook. A number of his posts could have set this friend off, Mr. Narramore acknowledged.

{"Headline": "Report Finds Traces of a Controversial Herbicide in Cheerios and Quaker Oats", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn environmental research and advocacy group has found traces of a controversial herbicide in Cheerios, Quaker Oats and other breakfast foods that it says could increase cancer risk for children.The report comes amid longstanding debate about the safety of the chemical glyphosate, which federal regulators maintain is not likely to cause cancer.In its report, released Wednesday, the Environmental Working Group said that it tested 45 samples of breakfast foods made from oats grown in fields sprayed with herbicides. Then, using a strict standard the group developed, it found elevated levels of glyphosate in 31 of them.\u201cThere are levels above what we could consider safe in very popular breakfast foods,\u201d said Alexis Temkin, the group\u2019s toxicologist who helped with the analysis in the report.Scott Partridge, a vice president at Monsanto, said in an interview on Wednesday that hundreds of studies had validated the safety of glyphosate and that it doesn\u2019t cause cancer. He called the Environmental Working Group an activist group.\u201cThey have an agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are fear mongering. They distort science.\u201dCentral to critiques of the glyphosate, which prevents plants from photosynthesizing, is a 2015 decision by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer to declare glyphosate a probable carcinogen.Monsanto was ordered to pay $289 million in damages. The company says it is facing more than 5,200 similar lawsuits.Some research points to other potential health effects of glyphosate. In a study published last year in Scientific Reports, a journal from the publishers of Nature, rats that consumed very low doses of glyphosate each day showed early signs of fatty liver disease within three months, which worsened over time.But many regulators and researchers say glyphosate is safe.The E.P.A. is currently reviewing public comments on that assessment as part of a standard review, and will decide on whether or not the agency needs any \u201cmitigation measures\u201d by 2019, a spokesman said Wednesday.The United States Food and Drug Administration, which regulates domestic and imported food to make sure it does not exceed levels set by the E.P.A., said that based on 2016 samples, it had not found any violations of E.P.A. standards with glyphosate. More recent samples are still under review, an agency spokeswoman said.The F.D.A. said Wednesday that it would consider the Environmental Working Group\u2019s findings.Both Quaker Oats and General Mills, which makes Cheerios, said that their products were safe and met federal standards.\u201cWhile our products comply with all safety and regulatory requirements, we are happy to be part of the discussion and are interested in collaborating with industry peers, regulators and other interested parties on glyphosate,\u201d a Quaker spokesman said Wednesday.A General Mills spokeswoman said, \u201cOur products are safe and without question they meet regulatory safety levels.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mrs. Fahl, who had never run for office, upset a 61-year-old incumbent in June, Dave DelVecchio, who had been in office since Mrs. Fahl was born and is known to residents simply as Mayor Dave.Mrs. Fahl mounted the first challenge in Mr. DelVecchio\u2019s 27 years as mayor, a contentious race that for 97 days after her announcement to run engrossed this heavily Democratic community.Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Mrs. Fahl had to overcome the support of the county political machine, which had endorsed and thrown its operation behind Mr. DelVecchio, including, she said, blocking her from accessing voter data. And the same energy for a fresh direction among an energized Democratic base was palpable in her victory here, evidence that the desire to upend the establishment extends down to the local level.\u201cI think people are thinking they should have done more in the presidential election, so they\u2019re getting a lot more active now,\u201d Mr. DelVecchio said. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a good time to be a woman running for office and it has been for some time, but now more than ever.\u201dStill, the similarities to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez only go so far.For one, Mrs. Fahl counts herself more in what she calls \u201cthe Clinton wing\u201d of the Democratic Party and her calls for change are rooted in municipal business rather than the national issues animating the Democratic Party (on those, Mrs. Fahl and Mr. DelVecchio share similar views). But when it comes to shade trees, trash and City Hall hours, Mrs. Fahl seized on a growing unrest with how the town was run.\u201cMy argument was that after 27 years in a position, you stop asking why you do things or how you could be doing things better and you just say this is how things are done,\u201d Mrs. Fahl said. \u201cAnd there is a slew of things that are happening in this town that makes absolutely no sense.\u201dShe grew animated describing a municipal government operating on \u201cbankers\u2019 hours,\u201d and added, \u201cBankers don\u2019t even use bankers\u2019 hours anymore. \u201d\u201cIf you want to do something for your house, you have to take a day off work to go to City Hall and pull a permit,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s insane.\u201dHer arguments tapped into a growing sense around this town of 4,000 that City Hall needed a shake-up. The municipal concerns on the minds of many residents during the mayoral campaign may not have been as large in scope as national issues, like immigration or trade wars, but they pushed people to the polls.\u201cI told Julia like how hard it was to get a third bin for composting,\u201d said Lauren Kiernan, 29, who owns a flower shop downtown. \u201cObviously, I create a lot of green garbage and I applied like three different times. I never heard back. They lost my checks. They lost my forms. Even trying to talk to them about issues like parking, I just never heard back. It was just like, everything I said to the city just went into the garbage bin.\u201dBut the population has been shifting. A younger generation who wants some of the spoils of urban life \u2014 like a walkable downtown, trendy places to eat and crafty cocktail bars \u2014 but also seeks the tranquillity and relative affordability of the suburbs has begun to transform Lambertville.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a turnover of people and there are a lot of new people in town and they don\u2019t have all the history,\u201d Mr. DelVecchio said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t do a great job connecting with them. So that was one thing.\u201dThere came to be a simmering unrest between the \u201cold guard\u201d and \u201cnew guard\u201d and the mayor\u2019s race became a proxy for that battle.\u201cChange is hard, and change for the sake of change is something I don\u2019t get,\u201d said Stewart Palilonis, the former Democratic chair for the town and a supporter of Mr. DelVecchio.Sensing the dissatisfaction among neighbors, Mrs. Fahl and Mrs. Osmond had long tried to recruit someone to run, offering to put the full weight of their political expertise \u2014 Mrs. Fahl as a professional fund-raiser and Mrs. Osmond as a state director for a member of Congress \u2014 behind a candidate.\u201cEverybody said \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Fahl recalled. \u201cAnd we were in this position where like I guess we\u2019ll wait another three years and then try again, and that felt unacceptable. So then I ran.\u201dThough Mr. DelVecchio and Mrs. Fahl never engaged in personal attacks, their supporters did. It became so nasty that Mrs. Osmond forbade Mrs. Fahl from looking at Facebook.Though Mrs. Fahl did recall one insult.\u201cThey had the headline from that episode, where it\u2019s like \u2018IceTown\u2019s Ice Clown Loses Town Crown,\u2019\u201d that was all over my Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was truly funny, I\u2019ll admit.\u201dTo rebut concerns about her age and lack of experience, Mrs. Fahl put herself through a self-styled \u201cmunicipal school.\u201d Once a week she would meet with a different former or current New Jersey mayor. Twice a week (but not on mayor day), she hosted a municipal expert \u2014 \u201cso like a flooding expert, paving expert, business admins, budget experts, anyone who would agree to sit down and talk to me. Even weather experts.\u201dSurprisingly, Mrs. Fahl, a seasoned political operative who most recently worked on Gov. Philip D. Murphy\u2019s campaign and had always preferred the behind-the-scenes machinations of a campaign, found she was enthralled by the minutiae of city ordinances.\u201cIt was our constant conversation,\u201d Mrs. Osmond said. \u201cPillow talk was always about municipal waste.\u201dWhile she is running unopposed in the general election, Mrs. Fahl has focused her campaign efforts in support of Tom Malinowski, the Congressional candidate running to unseat the Republican incumbent, Representative Leonard Lance, in her district. It has become one of the races that may help decide control of the House.But Mrs. Fahl\u2019s surprising victory has already started conversations about what comes next.\u201cI made a commitment to Lambertville to see this thing through,\u201d Mrs. Fahl said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be mayor in 20 years. But I did make a commitment to get some serious stuff done. So we\u2019ll see.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Violence Intensifies as Student Protests Spread in Bangladesh", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDhaka, the capital, was in its ninth day of widespread protests, and rights advocates said they feared an increasingly violent response from the government, led by the Awami League, which is due to face elections in December.A prominent photojournalist, Shahidul Alam, was arrested on Sunday night, his wife said, and rights groups including Amnesty International said they were looking into reports of four more arrests of activists that they called unjustified.In a text message on Monday, a student protester at the East West University described seeking refuge inside a classroom after being attacked by police officers with tear gas and rubber bullets. He added that supporters of the government had assaulted them in tandem with the police, throwing rocks and wielding makeshift clubs.A professor at a second university said he was barricaded with students inside a classroom on Monday afternoon, with the smell of tear gas hanging in the air. The professor and student both requested anonymity, fearing arrest.But there was less sign on Monday of the middle school and high school students who along with their parents had previously formed the backbone of the protests. Several students said their teachers had warned them that those missing school would be reported to the authorities, leading to a knock on the door of their family home and possible arrest.\u201cRepression has been a trademark of this government over the past five years,\u201d said Omar Waraich, the deputy director for South Asia at Amnesty International. \u201cWhether it is journalists, the opposition or peaceful protesters, dissent has never been tolerated.\u201dAsaduzzaman Khan, Bangladesh\u2019s minister for home affairs, denied that the police or Awami League members had used violence to quell dissent. He accused opposition parties of infiltrating the protests and \u201ctrying to create a violent situation.\u201d\u201cWe have repeatedly accepted the demands of the school and college students for better road safety conditions, and we have asked them to go back to their homes as we have started to implement their demands,\u201d he said.The catalyst was the death of two teenagers on July 29, when a bus racing a rival to a stop plowed into a crowd of waiting would-be passengers.Students, some accompanied by their parents, responded by erecting checkpoints across the city, forcing motorists \u2014 including police officers and government ministers \u2014 to produce valid drivers licenses and car registrations. Those who could not do so, or who they said they had seen violating other traffic laws, they handed over to the police.The government\u2019s response to the protests was initially cautious, but the police began to use force against protesters on Saturday.For many, the bus crash has come to symbolize larger problems of poor governance, nepotism and corruption. Bangladesh\u2019s transportation sector has long operated above the law, with powerful officials either owning private bus companies or relying on bus and rickshaw drivers for political support. Transportation companies are accused of bribing the police to avoid investigation even of deadly accidents.On Monday, in an effort to contain the protests, the government endorsed a draft law to increase the maximum sentence for fatal road accidents to five years from three. But protesters say the problem is largely about poor implementation of existing laws.Clashes intensified as Monday evening approached.University students largely sat out last week\u2019s protests, but have been protesting for months about a quota system for government jobs and university spots that they claim is plagued by nepotism and corruption. When the police began to use force, the university students decided to link their cause to those of their peers in middle and high schools.Mr. Waraich of Amnesty International suggested that the government\u2019s sudden use of force reflected anxiety about the Awami League\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201cI think they are worried that any protests against the government could bring the opposition out on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to crush these protests immediately \u2014 they see them for not just what they are but what they could be.

{"Headline": "Why David Chang Matters", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "Critic\u2019s NotebookDiners who look for his stamp in every Momofuku restaurant may be missing his rare achievement as an impresario who lets his chefs innovate.Supported byDiners and restaurant writers insist on seeing him as the inventor of every scrap of food sold under the Momofuku name, rather than as a restaurant operator who is very skilled \u2014 maybe singularly skilled \u2014 at creating the conditions other chefs need to come up with food that\u2019s not just novel but relevant to our world.Besides steak, Kojin cooks sweet potatoes and avocados over the fire, along with a shrimp-and-pork sausage that brings dim sum to mind and what is probably the best hot dog I\u2019ve ever eaten in a restaurant: long and smoky and especially compelling when dabbed with green peppercorn mustard made by a celebrated Toronto firm.The most intense flavors in my meal, though, came from Ontario-grown corn. Kojin\u2019s leadoff appetizer is a griddled flatbread that is something like a yeast-raised arepa; you can wrap warm strips of it around Niagara ham and cherries or dunk it into a gleefully middlebrow spinach dip. My dessert was a cobbler by name but was really a low, crunchy, golden corn cake with a dark trench of blueberry sauce running down the middle. This was deeply enjoyable cooking, bending its efforts toward the innate goodness of its Ontario ingredients. Mr. Chang and Ms. Navarrete apparently decided that the menu, rather than running through his hits, should play to her strengths.But early reviews suggest that some customers have been confused, wondering why they aren\u2019t eating typical David Chang food.To some extent, this represents a benign shorthand used by many critics. Menus almost never name the actual cook responsible for a dish, so we attribute everything to the boss. I\u2019ve done it, particularly when it allows me to pin bad news on the famous owner rather than a young chef running a kitchen for the first time.It also has to be said that fading into the wallpaper is not in Mr. Chang\u2019s skill set. We\u2019d talk about the comfort and civility that has quietly slithered into his restaurants to replace the backless seats and argumentative menus of his early years. His entire career has been spent trying to calibrate precisely how much of those two qualities a good restaurant needs. His ideas have been remarkably consistent, down to the playlists. I\u2019ve been listening to Pavement and Yo La Tengo in Mr. Chang\u2019s restaurants for 14 years now, but in the past two I\u2019ve noticed that the volume is finally starting to come down. In the popular imagination, civility is not part of the Momofuku brand. (Some customers may even expect his cooks to curse the way that Mr. Chang does in interviews.) But the level of attentiveness at his restaurants is quietly, unobtrusively superb; I can\u2019t think of any restaurant groups where the service staff \u201cdoes\u201d more for the customer without seeming fussy. Occasionally they get caught trying to be too correct: A server at Majordomo kept surprising a woman at my table by serving from her right, which required an awkward reach. And very rarely they err on the side of being too casual, as when the person who took our order there promised to \u201ccourse that puppy out for you.\u201d Impressive wines almost go without saying in restaurants belonging to a group as large as Mr. Chang\u2019s. But again, anyone who thinks of him first and foremost as a proliferator of pork buns is not going to be prepared for how discerning most of the wine lists are; they have a way of zeroing in on the producers who make wine that\u2019s either exactly what you want out of their region, or exactly what you didn\u2019t expect.What Mr. Chang does with his chefs is something we may not have a term for. We understand chefs who are solo artists, and we understand cooks who uphold the standards of a major chef\u2019s global chain, like the ones at L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon or Nobu. What\u2019s hard to grasp is the middle ground where Mr. Chang has put most of his chefs. They have to fit into the family, but they also have to be individualistic enough to deserve a place in the family.Advertisement"}

His daughter, scrutinizing images on social media, spotted the wreckage of one of his trucks in the rubble. Two of his workers, both Romanians, had been in the truck, moving furniture from France to Italy, but he did not know if they had survived.\u201cI tried to call them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t reach them.\u201dAn hour later, Mr. Lou Lou had a partial answer. He identified the body of one worker, a man with a wife and three children. Then he went with the police to the hospital, in hopes that the other man was alive. \u201cThey say my other worker may be in intensive care,\u201d he said.The bridge collapse has traumatized Italy and exposed the decrepit state of the country\u2019s infrastructure. The worrisome condition of the Morandi Bridge was well known, even as it remained a heavily trafficked thoroughfare through Genoa, and the question of why nothing was done has inflamed the national discussion.But across Genoa, an ancient Ligurian port city tucked between the mountains and the Mediterranean, the shock of the calamity was particularly personal and terrifying.Genoans not only mourned the victims but wondered what would happen to their own lives, now upended by a severed highway that connected one side of the city to the other.Family members of missing travelers waited anxiously for word of loved ones. A man named Antonio Cicala told Sky News that he was seeking the whereabouts of his brother, sister-in-law and their daughter. \u201cThey haven\u2019t responded to phone calls and never made it to their destination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went to the police, but they didn\u2019t tell us anything. We\u2019re just waiting. We want to know.\u201dBy Wednesday afternoon, the Genoa government had released a partial list of Italian victims \u2014 a young couple heading for vacation, truck drivers from Genoa and Naples who had routinely crossed the bridge, a family of three returning from a holiday on the Ligurian coast and a family of four heading to a ferry to start their holiday.As more becomes known about the bridge victims, they are likely to paint a somewhat international mosaic, reflecting Genoa\u2019s location as an intersection for Europe.Genoa had been a usual transit point for the two Romanian truck drivers who lived near Paris, Mr. Lou Lou said. Four French nationals are also among the victims, according to France\u2019s Foreign Ministry. Family members of a 22-year-old Albanian national cried over his body at the morgue on Wednesday morning, all dressed in black. He had lived in the city and crossed the bridge for work, a cousin said.Throughout Wednesday, workers and rescue crews continued searching the bridge debris for more victims or, perhaps, survivors. Witnesses recounted the horror of having watched the collapse.Domenico Infantino, 69, a retired firefighter who lives near the bridge, saw cars and vans flung off the bridge, landing upside down on the railway tracks.\u201cI heard a thunder and then an explosion and the apartment shook,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought a nearby apartment had exploded, then I looked out of my kitchen window and couldn\u2019t see the bridge anymore.\u201dIn the Sampierdarena neighborhood, below what remained of the collapsed span, residents lined up at barricades erected by the police. Evacuated from their apartments after the collapse, they still could not return. Holding identity cards, they waited patiently for firefighters to retrieve their most important belongings \u2014 medicine, documents, pets.\u201cWe\u2019ll get to all of your homes before the sun sets,\u201d one firefighter promised.Amalia Salton, 66, was second in line. Her 16-year-old cat, Pepe, was stranded in her apartment, a few hundred yards from the wreckage.\u201cI\u2019ve always lived here, since I was born,\u201d she said while a firefighter took her details and walked away with her keys. \u201cI was in middle school when they built the bridge, and we thought it was such a masterwork. Now it\u2019s gone.\u201dMs. Salton was staying with family members in another section of Genoa, and like her neighbors, had no idea of when she could re-enter her home, or reconstruct her daily life.\u201cWe walk or drive under the bridge every day,\u201d she said. \u201cHow will we go to the other part of town?\u201dResidents who once thought nothing of walking across the bridge now face basic challenges.\u201cIt\u2019s like having the Berlin Wall in your neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Salton said. \u201cNothing will ever be the same.\u201dShe did get a bit of good news: A firefighter, Elisa Romani, delivered Pepe into her arms.One of her neighbors, Marisa Spiganti, also standing in line, blamed the authorities who she said had done too little over the years to ensure the bridge\u2019s safety.\u201cI wish they would stop making messes like this and start doing things in a better way for the generation that comes after us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are tired of crying for the dead.\u201dGuglielmo Mattioli contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Deletes 39 YouTube Channels Linked to Iranian Influence Operation", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two days after Facebook revealed far-reaching Iranian and Russian disinformation campaigns on its social network, Google said Thursday that it had removed 39 YouTube channels linked to the Iranian state broadcaster.Google terminated those accounts, along with six blogs on its Blogger service and 13 Google+ accounts, for running an influence campaign starting as early as January 2017 while disguising its connection to Iran, said Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs. Google said those accounts had shared \u201cEnglish-language political content in the U.S.,\u201d but it did not provide detail on what types of videos or content.While YouTube is the most popular online video platform, with nearly two billion visitors every month, it has managed to avoid the scrutiny heaped upon Facebook for its involvement in spreading misinformation by foreigners. In part, that is because sharing content to other users across its network is not as easy.Google\u2019s attempts to build a social network to rival Facebook have largely flopped, so fake Google+ accounts reach a limited audience \u2014 making it unpopular among both users and foreign manipulators.Google said Tuesday that it suspended one account linked to an Iranian influence campaign. Google said that \u201crelevant videos\u201d on the 39 now-deleted YouTube channels had 13,466 total views in the United States \u2014 a relatively small number for YouTube. It did not define what constituted a relevant video.Those YouTube channels were terminated over the last few weeks, said Rob Shilkin, a Google spokesman.Google said it had used forensic evidence, such as common internet protocol addresses and website domain information, to conclude that the misinformation campaign was a coordinated attack from Iran\u2019s state broadcaster.\u201cThis finding is consistent with internet activity we\u2019ve warned about in recent years from Iran,\u201d Mr. Walker wrote. He added that Google had warned its users about email \u201cphishing\u201d attempts and security attacks from Iran.A report published by FireEye regarding an Iranian influence campaign aimed at audiences in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East provided a few examples of YouTube accounts that were trying to advance Iran\u2019s interests. One of those channels was called Liberty Front Press \u2014 the account that Google said it had deleted earlier in the week \u2014 featuring videos with titles like \u201cRudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimate\u201d and \u201cNew C.I.A. chief followed the law, served the country.\u201dIn October, Google said it had deleted 18 accounts with links to the Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, that uploaded English-language political content. The channels had uploaded more than 1,100 videos spanning 43 hours.Google said Thursday that it had detected and removed an additional 42 channels from \u201cI.R.A.-related actors\u201d since last year. Those channels had 58 English-language political videos, which had accumulated fewer than 1,800 views.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: An Indictment Reveals a Pitfall in the Top-Two Primary System", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.A good deal of thought went into the top-two nonpartisan primary system that was approved by California voters in 2010. It passed with the support of some high-profile politicians (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and no shortage of academics. The idea was that an open primary in June with the top two finishers \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 facing off in November would take the partisanship out of elections.But if history has shown anything, it\u2019s that it is difficult to predict how so-called electoral reforms might play out. That is especially true if the unexpected happens.In a year when Democrats are making an all-out assault on Republican-held congressional seats in California, Mr. Hunter was viewed as one of the longer-shot targets \u2014 unless he was indicted (it was known that he was under investigation). His opponent is Ammar Campa-Najjar, 28, who worked in Barack Obama\u2019s White House and is making his first bid for major office.In a more traditional political system, the Republican Party would step in, nudge Mr. Hunter out, and replace him with a more palatable candidate.

{"Headline": "Bipartisan Senate Group Pushes \u2018Crushing\u2019 Punishments to Thwart Russia", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For much of the past year, as President Trump has belittled NATO, sought warmer relations with the Kremlin and questioned his own intelligence services about Russia\u2019s election interference campaign, Congress\u2019s response has been little more than rhetorical.A bipartisan group of influential senators is proposing to change that.Led by Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, the group introduced legislation late on Wednesday to impose \u201ccrushing\u201d new punishments on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his associates. The bill would also cut off Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to remove the United States from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without the support of the Senate and write into law new international deterrence programs meant to serve as a governmentwide response to Russian aggression.The legislation, which counts Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and three prominent Democrats among its supporters, is one of the biggest efforts to date by Congress to wrestle back some authority to shape foreign policy. Its authors said senators from both parties were already asking to sponsor the measure.Whether it could actually become law is another question. Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have been averse to intervening too aggressively in Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions. The House\u2019s monthlong recess, a booked legislative agenda for the fall and the impending midterm elections will certainly not help.And there are other sanctions already under consideration. The most frequently discussed \u2014 a measure written by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland \u2014 would in essence put Russia on notice, threatening it with broad-based economic sanctions if it carried out an attack on November\u2019s midterms.\u201cWe acknowledge the threat. It is real. It is continuing,\u201d said Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to have a legitimate election that everyone can have trust in.\u201d\u201cThe current sanctions regime has failed to deter Russia from meddling in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections,\u201d said Mr. Graham, one of the Senate\u2019s leading Russia critics. \u201cOur goal is to change the status quo and impose crushing sanctions and other measures against Putin\u2019s Russia until he ceases and desists meddling in the U.S. electoral process, halts cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, removes Russia from Ukraine and ceases efforts to create chaos in Syria.\u201dThe Republican-led Congress passed a package of withering sanctions targeting Russia a year ago, in part to punish its 2016 efforts. But a debate over how to amp up pressure has blossomed anew in recent weeks, as lawmakers have grappled with new disclosures about continued Russian activity and Mr. Trump\u2019s widely panned meeting last month with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland.Mr. Trump spent the days leading up to the meeting bashing the Atlantic alliance, which is committed to counteracting Russia\u2019s influence. Once there, he appeared to accept Mr. Putin\u2019s denials that Russia did not interfere in 2016 and cast doubt on American intelligence agencies\u2019 findings on the matter.Many Republicans, long uncomfortable with the president\u2019s forgiving stance toward Russia, condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s performance but have been unwilling or unable to take direct action. The possibility of additional sanctions appears to be an exception.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the typically reserved majority leader, called out Mr. Rubio\u2019s bill by name last month and asked the Senate Banking and Foreign Relations Committees to hold hearings on Russia and the imposing of sanctions already on the books. Those hearings are underway, though Democrats fret that Mr. McConnell may not have any intention of actually pushing through legislation.The sanctions package is intended to mount pressure on Russia to stop such activity. It includes a long list of provisions meant to embarrass Mr. Putin, cripple his allies financially and create new criminal vulnerabilities for Russia and other nations participating in cyberattacks. It would mandate that the United States assemble a report on Mr. Putin\u2019s finances and assets \u2014 a move long advocated by Russia hawks who believe it would expose the extent of any financial crimes committed by Mr. Putin. And it penalizes projects involving Russian sovereign debt and state-owned energy companies \u2014 a move that some Republicans, including in the Trump administration, fear could wreak havoc across global markets.The package also includes a provision, written by Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, that would require the State Department to determine whether Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism.Mr. Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said it would fill a void left by Mr. Trump for a clear, governmentwide response to Mr. Putin\u2019s efforts.\u201cPutin\u2019s aggressing will be met with consequences that will shake the regime to its foundation,\u201d Mr. Menendez said in an interview. \u201cAnd that is the only thing Putin understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Weiner is the author of histories of the F.B.I. and C.I.A.In times of crisis, the leaders of the military and intelligence communities try to put aside their differences, often many and sundry, and work together for the good of the country. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening today with a remarkable group of retired generals, admirals and spymasters who have signed up for the resistance, telling the president of the United States, in so many words, that he is not a king. The president aims to rid the government and the airwaves of his real and imagined enemies, especially anyone connected with the Russia investigation. Somewhere Richard Nixon may be looking up and smiling. But aboveground, the special counsel is taking notes. The list of the signatories to the open letter defending Mr. Brennan is striking for the length and breadth of their experience. I never expected to see William H. Webster \u2014 he\u2019s 95 years old, served nine years as F. B.I. director under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, then four more as C.I.A. director under Reagan and President George H. W. Bush \u2014 sign a political petition like this. The same with Robert M. Gates, who entered the C.I.A. under President Lyndon Johnson, ran it under George H. W. Bush and served as Secretary of Defense under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. These are not the kind of men who march on Washington. These are men who were marched upon. The text was equally striking: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with what John Brennan says (and, again, not all of us do) to agree with his right to say it, subject to his obligation to protect classified information,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe have never before seen the approval or removal of security clearances used as a political tool, as was done in this case.\u201d The president sent \u201ca signal to other former and current officials\u201d to refrain from criticizing him, the letter continued, and \u201cthat signal is inappropriate and deeply regrettable.\u201d \u201cDecisions on security clearances should be based on national security concerns and not political views,\u201d they conclude.It\u2019s clear that Mr. Brennan\u2019s fierce political and personal attacks rattled the china in the Oval Office. The president essentially has accused Mr. Brennan of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 \u2014 the crime of criticizing the monarch, tantamount to treason. Remarkably, this relic of the days when kings were deemed divine remains on the books in some European monarchies as well as nations like Saudi Arabia, where a critique of the crown is considered terrorism. It\u2019s not a crime in the United States. That\u2019s why we fought a revolution against a mad king. For nine months now, the president has been ranting about the \u201cDeep State.\u201d He sees it as a coterie of present and former leaders of F.B.I. gumshoes and C.I.A. spooks who are out to get him through leaks and lies. There is no deep state in America \u2014 at least, there hasn\u2019t been the threat of one since J. Edgar Hoover died in 1972, six weeks before the Watergate break-in. But in the mind of Donald Trump, if any group of retired military and intelligence officers could serve as the shadow cabinet for a silent coup, it\u2019s men like Bill McRaven and Bob Gates. They worked for Obama! (Yes, and Reagan, too.) You don\u2019t need a secret decoder ring to see what\u2019s happening here. John Brennan, who knows whereof he speaks, believes that the president is a threat to the security of the United States \u2014 a counterintelligence threat, no less, in thrall to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The president attacks him, severing Mr. Brennan\u2019s access to classified information. The deans of national security rise up to defend him \u2014 and, by implication, intelligence officers and federal investigators who are closing in on the White House. They are sending a message to active-duty generals and admirals, soldiers and spies. Remember your oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Most of the hundreds of fairy gardeners gathered at a nursery near Cleveland were adults who seek a sense of childlike wonder by embracing the fantasy element of miniature gardening with fairies, gnomes and other mythical figurines.But childlike wonder was on display, too. \u201cI knew unicorns and fairies were real!\u201d a 5-year-old girl shrieked to her mother at the first Ohio Fairy Gardening Festival in Perry, Ohio. For some in attendance, what stood before her was a majestic unicorn. For others, it was a miniature horse with a dyed rainbow mane and a horn strapped firmly on its head.To embrace this festival, imagination is required.As we walk through her trail of 15 fairy gardens, she proudly points out one of her favorites: \u201cI found a fairy in a wheelchair this year, she was smiling. I made sure I put her outside the fence to show that she has mobility, that she wasn\u2019t stuck at home.\u201dRita McCroskey, 62, of Painesville, Ohio, started fairy gardening four years ago after her son died in a car crash. Her fairy garden was her sanctuary. \u201cI believe in fairies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re special \u2014 they\u2019re magical. They\u2019re very magical. That\u2019s why I believe in them. You just have to have an imagination.\u201dThe festival grew out of Ms. Cole\u2019s desire to meet the communities of fairy gardeners she oversaw on Facebook. She dismisses the notion that fairies are real, but her members do not seem to mind. \u201cI have people coming into the groups from Dubai, South Africa,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re from all over the world. It crosses gender, race, religion \u2014 everything. We all have this in common, and it does take us away from the real world a little bit. It\u2019s a kinder, gentler place.\u201d \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my calling,\u201d said Ms. Keith, 30, who started her creations two years ago after seeing friends share their fairy creations on Facebook. It has since became a full-fledged business, selling locally in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Ms. Keith prides herself on distancing her family from screen time and embracing nature. She rides into the woods on four-wheelers with her husband and son to gather materials. \u201cPeople like fantasy world more than the real world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe real world is depressing. This is pure.\u201d Art Millican Jr., 63, a former Disney Imagineer and artist involved with creating Michael Jackson\u2019s Neverland Ranch, felt frustrated that the children around Blairsville, Ga., relied on technology for entertainment and did not have an outlet to create and to explore their imaginations. \u201cI never grew up,\u201d he said. With a considerable amount of land at his disposal, Mr. Millican brought the concept for Sleepy Hollow to life.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get kids to use their imaginations again,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieving in something that may or may not be real, to a child, that can stay with them forever.\u201d Strolling through Fairy Lane, a creation of colorful fairy and hobbit houses by Mr. Millican, feels as if you have been catapulted to the Mickey\u2019s ToonTown version of a fairy village. It includes life-size houses that can accommodate children and adults alike. \u201cIt\u2019s what Disney would teach you: to become part of the film,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf everything was so tiny that the kids couldn\u2019t go outside, it starts to lose the magic. If you can go inside the magical houses, it brings it that much more to life.\u201d The community is big, but the business is bigger. Mr. Millican estimates he has sold more than 20,000 fairy houses, with prices ranging from $49 to at least $500. One customer even asked Mr. Millican to create an actual fairy home to live in. He politely declined: \u201cI\u2019m not a contractor.\u201dJulie Breckel, 59, a fairy gardener from Parma Heights, Ohio, who attended Ms. Cole\u2019s workshops so she can begin making her own pieces, says she has spent over $2,000 on her fairy garden. As she has acquired more fairies, she has slowly begun taking over prime real estate in her husband\u2019s garden. \u201cYou could do a separate story on the marital problems caused by fairy gardens,\u201d another workshop attendee chimed in. The price points for materials range from thrift store scores to thousands of dollars for fairy castles on Etsy. It is possible to find fairy gardening supplies in chain stores, but that negates the very ethos for artists like Lori Tanner. \u201cI got frustrated because when you go to Michaels or Hobby Lobby, everything they have is plastic resin,\u201d said Ms. Tanner, who sells under the name Elysium Glen. \u201cThat\u2019s not what the fairies are about.

As he walked around the hotel\u2019s exterior photographing its security cameras, Mr. Bridle \u2014 an artist and writer \u2014 looked, to them, undoubtedly suspect. Who was he, they wanted to know, and what exactly was he doing? They detained him and called the police, who subsequently demanded to see the artist\u2019s ID and threatened him with a charge of \u201cgoing equipped.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s what you threaten a burglar with if they\u2019re carrying a ladder or a crowbar down the street,\u201d Mr. Bridle said. \u201cJust carrying a camera made me suspicious.\u201dMr. Bridle, who had been researching surveillance as part of an art residency, had set out to walk the perimeter of the city\u2019s congestion charge zone \u2014 an area in central London where motorists must pay to drive \u2014 with the goal of documenting as many closed-circuit security cameras as he could find.When he reached the Grosvenor, about halfway along the 12-mile route, he\u2019d recorded 427. That number included not just the cameras that record the license plates of vehicles driving in the zone, but also private cameras, and other public cameras operated by the local authorities. On subsequent walks through the zone, he captured hundreds more. \u201cAs soon as there\u2019s a person with a camera there\u2019s a target for people\u2019s interest and they start asking questions,\u201d Mr. Bridle said. \u201cBecause CCTV cameras are disassociated from human vision, they don\u2019t get people to ask those same questions. But I think they should.\u201dMr. Bridle\u2019s series, \u201cEvery CCTV Camera,\u201d encourages us to interrogate that vast network the same way Mr. Bridle himself was interrogated by the police. Who is watching all these cameras? And why? In 2013, the photographer Andrew Hammerand demonstrated that fact when he gained access to a networked camera in a planned community in the American Midwest. The town\u2019s developer, Mr. Hammerand learned, had installed the camera on a cellphone tower atop a church in the town\u2019s center to monitor the progress of the community\u2019s construction. The live feed was posted on the community\u2019s website to entice prospective residents. But perhaps unknown to the developer, the camera\u2019s control panel was also available to anyone with the right URL. For about 18 months, Mr. Hammerand operated those controls for several hours a day, zooming, panning, tilting and adjusting the exposure to his liking before making a screenshot. He ultimately made tens of thousands of them.The scenes Mr. Hammerand presents in his series, \u201cThe New Town,\u201d are pretty banal. Residents walk their dogs, kids play in the park, people stand in driveways. Through the grainy, long-distance lens of a security camera, however, the views take on subtly nefarious undertones. A man Mr. Hammerand spotted working with a hammer looks, in one photo, like he\u2019s about to commit some terrible crime. \u201cI think that reaches into this idea of paranoia,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are watching something, you almost expect something to happen. But in reality nothing happened.\u201d What started as a matter of curiosity grew, for Mr. Hammerand, into a source of concern. Why should a stranger be able to glimpse so many people\u2019s lives without their knowledge or consent? Sometimes while Mr. Hammerand was scouring the neighborhood, the camera suddenly panned or zoomed wildly. Other online users, he guessed, were fighting to control the device. Mr. Hammerand knew his own intentions with the camera were artistic in nature, but he couldn\u2019t guess the motivations of others.\u201cSomeone easily could have used this in a worse way and looked in people\u2019s windows at night,\u201d he said. Arguably, photographers are ideally positioned to explore the implications of a culture of pervasive monitoring, since art photography itself \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 has often been a part of that culture. Few, if any, of those photographers had mass surveillance on their mind. But many of the photographers involved in today\u2019s \u201cartveillance\u201d world intentionally adopt the voyeuristic gaze of modern surveillance tools to reveal their inner workings. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about their projects is that they\u2019re in part pedagogical,\u201d said Randolph Lewis, professor of American studies at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThey\u2019re showing people that these systems know a lot more than you realize and they do a lot more than you might assume.\u201dIf Mr. Hammerand\u2019s work is a warning about a world in which anyone could be watching you, Esther Hovers\u2019s serves as a warning about a world where no one is watching \u2014 at least, nobody human. As the number of security cameras grows, it isn\u2019t feasible for people to keep watch on them at all times. Software picks up the slack. In her series \u201cFalse Positives,\u201d Ms. Hovers visualizes the capabilities of security cameras in the future, which are programmed to automatically spot unusual movement patterns that may signal a criminal act.\u201cThe systems I\u2019m talking about still very much serve a supportive role,\u201d she said. \u201cFor someone who has to watch like 40 or 50 different monitors at once, this intelligent camera can give a preference and say, \u2018Please watch this screen.\u2019 The future of it is for it to become more autonomous.\u201dMs. Hovers read about such cameras in a newspaper article about Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport, which was experimenting with the technology. While she couldn\u2019t learn much about Schipol\u2019s specific system, researchers explained the underlying technology\u2019s principles. Ms. Hovers used that knowledge to create \u2014 with the help of strangers she enlisted in the spur of the moment \u2014 scenes on the streets of Brussels that demonstrate some of the so-called anomalies an algorithm would likely detect. In some images, the anomaly is easy to spot: Two men sprinting through the middle of the sidewalk, a group of people moving in a coordinated way, a man standing alone in a crowd. In others, however, the anomaly is hard to pinpoint. One wonders, is it the guy running? Or could it be the man walking in the opposite direction from everyone else in the image?\u201cI like to keep that a little bit vague because I actually want to encourage this judgment of what\u2019s normal,\u201d Ms. Hovers said. As Mr. Bridle can attest firsthand, a person that may look suspicious to security personnel can be completely innocent. For that reason, he and his peers argue, the subjects of surveillance \u2014 that is, everyone \u2014 should flip the script and direct their skepticism toward a network that is often accepted as part of modern life. \u201cSurveillance is so often presented as inevitable, as something we have to do, as something that almost the technology itself demands,\u201d Mr. Bridle said. \u201cThat just isn\u2019t the case.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Socialists", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "OpinionWhy the pitch from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders resonates in 2018.Supported byMr. Robin is a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York Graduate Center. Throughout most of American history, the idea of socialism has been a hopeless, often vaguely defined dream. So distant were its prospects at midcentury that the best definition Irving Howe and Lewis Coser, editors of the socialist periodical Dissent, could come up with in 1954 was this: \u201cSocialism is the name of our desire.\u201d What explains this irruption? And what do we mean, in 2018, when we talk about \u201csocialism\u201d?Some part of the story is pure accident. In 2016, Mr. Sanders made a strong bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Far from hurting his candidacy, the \u201csocialism\u201d label helped it. Mr. Sanders wasn\u2019t a liberal, a progressive or even a Democrat. He was untainted by all the words and ways of politics as usual. Ironically, the fact that socialism was so long in exile now shields it from the toxic familiarities of American politics.Another part of the story is less accidental. Since the 1970s, American liberals have taken a right turn on the economy. They used to champion workers and unions, high taxes, redistribution, regulation and public services. Now they lionize billionaires like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, deregulate wherever possible, steer clear of unions except at election time and at least until recently, fight over how much to cut most people\u2019s taxes. Liberals, of course, argue that they are merely using market-friendly tools like tax cuts and deregulation to achieve things like equitable growth, expanded health care and social justice \u2014 the same ends they always have pursued. For decades, left-leaning voters have gone along with that answer, even if they didn\u2019t like the results, for lack of an alternative.It took Mr. Sanders to convince them that if tax credits and insurance exchanges are the best liberals have to offer to men and women struggling to make stagnating wages pay for bills that skyrocket and debt that never dissipates, maybe socialism is worth a try.Socialism means different things to different people. For some, it conjures the Soviet Union and the gulag; for others, Scandinavia and guaranteed income. But neither is the true vision of socialism. What the socialist seeks is freedom.Under capitalism, we\u2019re forced to enter the market just to live. The libertarian sees the market as synonymous with freedom. But socialists hear \u201cthe market\u201d and think of the anxious parent, desperate not to offend the insurance representative on the phone, lest he decree that the policy she paid for doesn\u2019t cover her child\u2019s appendectomy. Under capitalism, we\u2019re forced to submit to the boss. Terrified of getting on his bad side, we bow and scrape, flatter and flirt, or worse \u2014 just to get that raise or make sure we don\u2019t get fired. The socialist argument against capitalism isn\u2019t that it makes us poor. It\u2019s that it makes us unfree. When my well-being depends upon your whim, when the basic needs of life compel submission to the market and subjugation at work, we live not in freedom but in domination. Socialists want to end that domination: to establish freedom from rule by the boss, from the need to smile for the sake of a sale, from the obligation to sell for the sake of survival. Listen to today\u2019s socialists, and you\u2019ll hear less the language of poverty than of power. Mr. Sanders invokes the 1 percent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez speaks to and for the \u201cworking class\u201d \u2014 not \u201cworking people\u201d or \u201cworking families,\u201d homey phrases meant to soften and soothe. The 1 percent and the working class are not economic descriptors. They\u2019re political accusations. They split society in two, declaring one side the illegitimate ruler of the other; one side the taker of the other\u2019s freedom, power and promise. Walk the streets of Bushwick with a canvasser for Julia Salazar, the socialist candidate running to represent North Brooklyn in the New York State Senate. What you\u2019ll hear is that unlike her opponent, Ms. Salazar doesn\u2019t take money from real estate developers. It\u2019s not just that she wants to declare her independence from rich donors. It\u2019s that in her district of cash-strapped renters, landlords are the enemy. Compare that position to the pitch that Shomik Dutta, a Democratic Party fund-raiser, gave to the Obama campaign in 2008: \u201cThe Clinton network is going to take all the establishment\u201d donors. What the campaign needed was someone who understands \u201cthe less established donors, the real-estate-developer folks.\u201d If that was \u201cyes, we can,\u201d the socialist answer is \u201cno, we won\u2019t.\u201d One of the reasons candidates like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Salazar speak the language of class so fluently is that it\u2019s central to their identities. Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton struggled to cobble together a credible self out of the many selves they\u2019d presented over the years, trying to find a personal story to fit the political moment. Today\u2019s young candidates of the left tell a story of personal struggle that meshes with their political vision. Mr. Obama did that \u2014 but where his story reinforced a myth of national identity and inclusion, the socialists\u2019 story is one of capitalism and exclusion: how, as millennials struggling with low wages and high rents and looming debt, they and their generation are denied the promise of freedom. The stories of these candidates are socialist for another reason: They break with the nation-state. The geographic references of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 or Ms. Tlaib, who is running to represent Michigan\u2019s 13th District in Congress \u2014 are local rather than national, invoking the memory and outposts of American and European colonialism rather than the promise of the American dream.Ms. Tlaib speaks of her Palestinian heritage and the cause of Palestine by way of the African-American struggle for civil rights in Detroit, while Ms. Ocasio-Cortez draws circuits of debt linking Puerto Rico, where her mother was born, and the Bronx, where she lives. Mr. Obama\u2019s story also had its Hawaiian (as well as Indonesian and Kenyan) chapters. But where his ended on a note of incorporation, the cosmopolitan wanderer coming home to America, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez aren\u2019t interested in that resolution. That refusal is also part of the socialist heritage.Arguably the biggest boundary today\u2019s socialists are willing to cross is the two-party system. In their campaigns, the message is clear: It\u2019s not enough to criticize Donald Trump or the Republicans; the Democrats are also complicit in the rot of American life. And here the socialism of our moment meets up with the deepest currents of the American past. Like the great transformative presidents, today\u2019s socialist candidates reach beyond the parties to target a malignant social form: for Abraham Lincoln, it was the slavocracy; for Franklin Roosevelt, it was the economic royalists. The great realigners understood that any transformation of society requires a confrontation not just with the opposition but also with the political economy that underpins both parties. That\u2019s why realigners so often opt for a language that neither party speaks. For Lincoln in the 1850s, confronting the Whigs and the Democrats, that language was free labor. For leftists in the 2010s, confronting the Republicans and the Democrats, it\u2019s socialism.To critics in the mainstream and further to the left, that language can seem slippery. With their talk of Medicare for All or increasing the minimum wage, these socialist candidates sound like New Deal or Great Society liberals. There\u2019s not much discussion, yet, of classic socialist tenets like worker control or collective ownership of the means of production. And of course, there\u2019s overlap between what liberals and socialists call for. But even if liberals come to support single-payer health care, free college, more unions and higher wages, the divide between the two will remain. For liberals, these are policies to alleviate economic misery. For socialists, these are measures of emancipation, liberating men and women from the tyranny of the market and autocracy at work. Back in the 1930s, it was said that liberalism was freedom plus groceries. The socialist, by contrast, believes that making things free makes people free.It\u2019s also important to remember that the traffic between socialism and liberalism has always been wide. The 10-point program of Marx and Engels\u2019s \u201cCommunist Manifesto\u201d included demands that are now boilerplate: universal public education, abolition of child labor and a progressive income tax. It can take a lot of socialists to get a little liberalism: It was socialists in Europe, after all, who won the right to vote, freedom of speech and parliamentary democracy. Given how timid and tepid American liberalism has become \u2014 when was the last time a Democratic president even called himself a liberal \u2014 it\u2019s not surprising that a more arresting term helps get the conversation going. Sometimes nudges need a nudge.In magazines and on websites, in reading groups and party chapters, socialists are debating the next steps: state ownership of certain industries, worker councils and economic cooperatives, sovereign wealth funds. Once upon a time, such conversations were the subject of academic satire and science fiction. Now they\u2019re getting out the vote and driving campaigns. It\u2019s too soon to tell whether they\u2019ll spill over into Congress, but events have a way of converting barroom chatter into legislative debate.What ultimately gives shape to socialist desire is less the specific policies in a politician\u2019s head than the men and women marching with their feet. That\u2019s why the two most important utterances of today\u2019s socialists are Ms. Salazar\u2019s demand that New York abolish the law prohibiting strikes of government workers and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call \u201cto occupy all of it.\u201d Both statements reveal what socialists have always understood: Mass action \u2014 sometimes illegal, always confrontational \u2014 will determine socialism\u2019s final form.Socialism is not journalists, intellectuals or politicians armed with a policy agenda. As Marx and Engels understood \u2014 this was one of their core insights, what distinguished them from other socialist thinkers, ever ready with their blueprints \u2014 it is workers who get us there, who decide what and where \u201cthere\u201d is. That, too, is a kind of freedom. Socialist freedom.Corey Robin is a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York Graduate Center.

{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}

This summer, the political and social crisis there has reached new heights. With no solution in sight, Venezuelans are fleeing en masse into neighboring countries. Every day some 2,500 Venezuelans line up in front of the Casa de Paso Divina Providencia in C\u00facuta, just across the Venezuelan border, where we spoke with Carolina, to receive a simple breakfast and lunch. For many, these are their only regular meals.The Venezuelans who are crossing over are in increasingly dire straits, selling off all that they have to escape unbearable conditions. Their country\u2019s hyperinflation has reduced their savings to pocket change, and what little they can gather simply isn\u2019t enough to live. Parents who once provided for their children are resorting to last-gasp measures: We have seen women at the border selling their hair for cash.As the exodus grows, it also threatens to undermine Colombia\u2019s peace process. Colombia has promised to improve badly needed services to marginalized communities as part of an accord with FARC rebels, and the arrival of Venezuelan refugees has complicated the situation. It is in the interest of the United States and international community, as well as the Colombian government, to find a solution to the needs of Venezuelan migrants and refugees that complements the peace process instead of derailing it.Under the new administration of President Ivan Duque, Colombia has an opportunity to turn the tide by showing compassion to Venezuelans escaping hardship. With more help from the United States and the rest of the international community, the Colombian government could lead a regional protection and assistance effort for fleeing Venezuelans. After years of dealing with the human rights and displacement problems stemming from its own internal conflict, Colombia has a wealth of experiences on which to draw from in this effort.Demonstrating leadership in this crisis will not be easy for Colombia, and will require greater funding from the United States, European Union and others in the international community. Colombia must also be prepared to invite civil society and humanitarian organizations to expand operations on the border. In doing so, Colombian authorities and international donors will have to ensure that vital resources earmarked for the peace process are not diverted to these efforts. Support for Venezuelans suffering from a humanitarian emergency is about more than denouncing the conditions they flee. It must entail a commitment to defending and restoring their rights within the country and in the places they flee to. By embracing migrants and refugees, Colombia and the rest of the hemisphere must show Venezuelans that our commitment to them does not end when they leave their homeland.Geoff Ramsey is the assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, where Gimena S\u00e1nchez-Garzoli is the director for the Andes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Make a Crossword Puzzle", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPuzzle makingIn the final part of this series, the New York Times crossword editors reveal their process for evaluating and editing a puzzle submission.DEB AMLEN: The hardest part of submitting your finished crossword puzzle to an editor is the waiting. Once you\u2019ve kissed your work goodbye, time seems to tick by really slowly until you get that email. A rejection can be disappointing and is a sign to try again, but a \u201cYes!\u201d is exhilarating. For most people, the mysterious part is what happens to your puzzle once it\u2019s in the hands of the editors. How do The New York Times editors, Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, decide on which day of the week a puzzle should run? What changes, if any, do they make to your creation?Today we pull back the curtain on their editorial process and look at how Mr. Shortz and Mr. Fagliano approach editing a crossword puzzle. While they typically examine the entire puzzle for editing, to keep this relatively short, they will zero in only on selected entries and clues from our crossword puzzle.We\u2019ve also gathered the resources that were mentioned in this series \u2014 word lists, software, online resources, places to go for questions \u2014 into a single list and included it at the end to assist aspiring constructors. WILL SHORTZ: Typically, when we accept a puzzle, we file it for the day of the week for which we think it is most naturally suited. Monday has an easy theme with easy vocabulary. Thursday tends to have the trickiest themes. Tuesday and Wednesday are in the middle. Friday and Saturday are the hardest, and usually themeless. So we file the puzzles as appropriate. Then when we come to editing, we select a week\u2019s worth of puzzles at a time, trying to vary the themes and the puzzle makers.JOEL FAGLIANO: By varying the themes, what do we mean? Well, if Tuesday\u2019s theme has circles, we might avoid a puzzle with circles on Monday and Wednesday. Or, to use this puzzle as an example, the theme involves puns, so we\u2019d be unlikely to run more than one other puzzle during the same week with puns, if only for variety\u2019s sake.SHORTZ: I think of the Times crossword as being like a three-ring circus. What brings joy and awe is being surprised, and I like every day\u2019s puzzle to have a little surprise.SHORTZ: Well, when I first saw the theme, honestly, I wasn\u2019t sure it was my cup of tea. But I\u2019m liking the theme better now that I\u2019ve seen the clues that Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber wrote to go with it. My least favorite of the theme entries is definitely MACBOOK AIR, because AIR is a rather unusual term for a song.FAGLIANO: Yeah, what I think is done well in the theme is the parallelism. One thing we\u2019re always looking for when we\u2019re reviewing themes is whether or not the idea is handled throughout the puzzle in a consistent and clear way. And here, the synonyms are all placed as the last words, which allows the solver to have some expectation \u2014 O.K., the next theme answer is going to involve some synonym of \u201csong\u201d at the end and another word at the beginning. One other asset of the theme is that they\u2019ve placed their base phrases pretty far from the eventual things they\u2019re cluing. For example, TENURE TRACK has nothing to do with a song, which is good.SHORTZ: In an ideal puzzle, all the key words in the answer are not referred to in the clue. Here, PUZZLE PIECE is still about a PUZZLE, although here it\u2019s changed a little from a jigsaw puzzle to a crossword, so there\u2019s a little twist there. CALL NUMBER is maybe my favorite theme example, because both key words in the answer are used playfully in the clue.FAGLIANO: Whereas MACBOOK and TENURE don\u2019t change at all, for instance.SHORTZ: I still sort of like the TENURE TRACK one, because it makes me smile. As Brad says, the fact that the clue gives a reason for the professor to make it his favorite song makes it amusing.SHORTZ: If we like a theme well enough, then we look at the puzzle\u2019s fill. We ask for submissions on paper rather than by email because it\u2019s easier for us to examine the whole grid at once, and to mark up the manuscript with pluses, minuses and other comments. So as Joel and I look at this grid, we would just go row by row and column by column, checking the entries: CELT, EACH, MODS and the rest.FAGLIANO: Yeah, so we look at all the Across answers first, and then all the Downs, making minus marks for answers we think are subpar, check marks for answers we like, exclamation points for \u201cWow!,\u201d question marks for things to be looked up and sometimes written comments. When we\u2019re done, this helps us to visualize potential issues: \u201cO.K., there are a lot of minus marks in this one corner \u2014 this is an area that needs to be revised.\u201d Or, \u201cThis crossing between two obscurish names \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a problem. Let\u2019s ask the constructor to look at that area again.\u201dFAGLIANO: There\u2019s nothing obscure, not too many proper names, everything seems fair for the solver.SHORTZ: Looking Down \u2026 OIL FUTURES, well, I kind of like that. That\u2019s got color. Also SLEAZEBALL, that\u2019s great. Not the thing, but the answer! ANTE UP \u2026 wasn\u2019t there another answer with UP in the puzzle? Yes, MEET UP. Some bloggers don\u2019t like that. That doesn\u2019t bother me, though. UP is an inconspicuous word.And OLIVIA MUNN ... Well, I\u2019m going to expose my ignorance, but I don\u2019t know who she is. FAGLIANO: She\u2019s an actress. On \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d and other things.SHORTZ: Hmm, and next to it is DANA SCULLY. I do know her, of course, but it does bother me to have two long names running parallel to each other. That could be troublesome for some solvers.FAGLIANO: Yeah, and there\u2019s a third name to the right of it, Sissy SPACEK. In this case, we\u2019d really need to check the crossings to make sure we\u2019re not setting up solvers to get stuck. In that corner we have going Across: MODS, SLAP, GINA (that\u2019s another name), VAC is kind of weird, and LIAISE. But everything else is so clean.SHORTZ: It\u2019s clean enough, and I think people should know enough of these proper names that they can figure this out.FAGLIANO: One thing I\u2019ll mention about our process of reviewing a grid is that if Will doesn\u2019t know a proper name, but I do, then sometimes it can slip by. And the inverse is true \u2014 if I don\u2019t know a proper name but Will does, then he can vouch for its legitimacy and maybe its worthiness for a puzzle. But if neither of us has heard of a name, that\u2019s a bad sign. If it\u2019s not in either of our overlapping spheres of knowledge, then perhaps that\u2019s not something the average solver will know and not something we want to test them on.SHORTZ: Yeah, and two other things. First, we should say our ages: You\u2019re 25 and I\u2019m 65. So we have a nice age range. But it\u2019s not just a matter of whether we personally know something or not. We also have a good sense of what other people know and don\u2019t know. So even if I know something, I might say: \u201cYeah, I know it, but, man, that\u2019s obscure. Younger people are going to have trouble with that.\u201d And you often say the same thing about stuff you know but think older solvers may struggle with. So it comes down to judgment, too.Over all, the fill looks good to me. But I would want to clue the upper right of the grid on the easy side, for solvers who don\u2019t know all those names.SHORTZ: So, this grid has 76 words. The maximum we allow typically in weekday Times crosswords is 78. It\u2019s nice that the word count here is two under our maximum, which means the answers average a little longer than usual, allowing some interesting long answers like OIL FUTURES and HARD LENS. Something else I like about the grid: It has great flow. No corner or section is isolated from the rest, hanging on by a single square, say. Once you start solving, you can keep moving around the grid. If you get stuck, there are several ways to get unstuck.FAGLIANO: One of the next steps we would take if we like the theme and fill, meaning we\u2019re going to accept the puzzle, is to slot it on a day of the week. In this case, something that leaps out right away is that this one is probably not a Monday. The long theme entries have jokes and wordplay. Monday crosswords typically have more straightforward themes. It\u2019s also probably not a Thursday, given the high-ish word count, only two below the maximum. Also, the theme doesn\u2019t seem quite tricky enough for a Thursday \u2014 once you catch on, it\u2019s the same wordplay repeated. In my opinion, it\u2019s more like a Tuesday or Wednesday.SHORTZ: Agreed. Out of all of the days of the week, Tuesday and Wednesday are the most interchangeable.FAGLIANO: So, how would we go about deciding? One thing to push it more toward the Wednesday camp is the chunkiness of the lower-left and upper-right corners. Because they have those long Down answers going through everything, it would make for a bit harder solving, which suggests it\u2019s more of a Wednesday than a Tuesday.SHORTZ: Right. Also, the theme is playful. It involves puns. So it\u2019s just a little harder to solve than a typical Tuesday theme.FAGLIANO: Now that we\u2019ve selected the week\u2019s worth of puzzles, we\u2019ll usually do one more scan of the grid, to see if there are any last little tweaks we want to do to the fill. But at this point, the fill is usually all squared away, so we\u2019ll start to edit the clues.SHORTZ: Often we\u2019ll edit the theme clues first, because those are the most important ones. Then we\u2019ll return to the top. The most important thing is accuracy. It doesn\u2019t matter how interesting, clever or colorful a clue is if it\u2019s wrong. So anything we aren\u2019t 100 percent certain of, we will verify. My desk is surrounded by reference books, which we regularly use. Of course, nowadays virtually all information is online, so we use the internet, too. Besides accuracy, we edit clues for the level of difficulty appropriate to the day of the week on which the puzzle will appear, then for colorfulness, freshness, sense of fun \u2014 all the things that make for a good crossword.FAGLIANO: We\u2019re going to go through Robyn and Brad\u2019s selected clues from Part 4 and make some comments about things we might change, as well as things we think they did a good job on, to give insights into how we edit a puzzle.Brad and Robyn write that the goal is to set the solver up for success, but that\u2019s only partly true. It depends on the solver\u2019s level. A Monday solver probably isn\u2019t going to finish a Wednesday puzzle. And a Wednesday-only solver probably can\u2019t finish a Friday or Saturday. So we\u2019re not trying to give everyone success. We\u2019re trying to give everyone a fair chance at success.They also mention the importance of brevity in clues, and I agree. Partly it\u2019s for reasons of space on the printed page, which is limited. But even online, where space is not a real consideration, it\u2019s still nicer to have generally shorter clues. It\u2019s like that old saying from \u201cHamlet\u201d: \u201cBrevity is the soul of wit.\u201d I think that applies to crossword clues as well.SHORTZ: One thing I\u2019d like to emphasize is how important it is for constructors to write original clues. There have been some noted constructors we\u2019ve noticed who have taken most or all of their clues from a database. That turns me off. Part of the process of making a great crossword is writing original clues. Some of the clues, of course, may repeat old ones. There are only so many ways to clue certain words. But I\u2019d like constructors to make an honest effort to write original clues. That makes for more interesting solving.FAGLIANO: In my experience as a constructor, using a database can become almost a crutch. You can rationalize, \u201cWhy think of a new clue when I can go see the angles other people have taken on the answer?\u201d So I try not to do that.When editing a clue we want to change, Will and I will sit in silence until one of us proposes something \u2014 or multiple things \u2014 and wait to gauge the other person\u2019s reaction. The other person may revise a suggestion or suggest something completely different. We\u2019ll go back and forth until we get a clue we both like.FAGLIANO: Another thing Brad and Robyn addressed is not repeating words that appear in the clues and the grid. They say it\u2019s O.K. for articles and connector words, like THE and AND, to be repeated. Otherwise, they say any sort of word overlap between a clue and the grid is a no-go.Every constructor and editor has his or her own style, but Will and I have a different standard. Our basic rule is that no answer in its entirety should be repeated as a clue, and no clue in its entirety should be repeated as an answer. But if just part of a clue appears as part of an answer, we usually don\u2019t mind.For example, if a clue were \u201cIce cream,\u201d and ICE was also an answer on its own in the grid, we\u2019d avoid that. But if a clue said \u201cEat some ice cream,\u201d and there was also ICE SKATING in the grid, that would be fine. We don\u2019t see how that hurts the puzzle.SHORTZ: Robyn and Brad make a good point that clues shouldn\u2019t have too many waffle words. It\u2019s O.K. to use qualifiers like \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe\u201d and \u201csay,\u201d once in a while, but if they\u2019re used too much, a frustrated solver may think, \u201cJust tell me what the damn thing means!\u201dFAGLIANO: And I would extend that same sentiment to question mark clues. When done well, a clue with a question mark or a joke can brighten a whole corner of a puzzle. But if every single clue is trying to mislead you, even on a Friday or Saturday, that can become annoying. So even on our hardest puzzles, we try to provide plenty of straight definitions for the solver to work with.SHORTZ: Fill-in-the-blank clues should be used sparingly, and they should be interesting. \u201c___ circus\u201d really is not an interesting clue. Also, Joel and I are not big fans of clues like \u201cCircus opener?\u2019 (38A) for FLEA. First, it\u2019s just so easy to write clues like this, so when they\u2019re done, they should be clever. This one is not particularly clever, because what could possibly be an opener for a circus? It\u2019s not like \u201cCan opener?,\u201d which is a thing.SHORTZ: At 47D, the clue was \u201cYou\u2019re pulling my leg, right?\u201d for the answer C\u2019MON. The problem here is that the clue is in the form of a question, while the answer is a statement. I\u2019d probably rephrase the clue to be in the form of a statement as well.SHORTZ: At 1D, the clue is \u201cSleeveless Victoria\u2019s Secret purchase, informally.\u201d Well, I have no problem with commercial names in puzzles, but I don\u2019t include them gratuitously. In this case, there\u2019s no strong reason to mention Victoria\u2019s Secret. I\u2019d probably change the clue to \u201cSleeveless women\u2019s undergarment, informally.\u201dSHORTZ: Brad mentions a desire to avoid evoking anything grim. My feeling is that the crossword should reflect everything in life, and not everything in life is peaches and cream. While I wouldn\u2019t want a whole puzzle theme that\u2019s depressing, a single downbeat word here and there is fine.FAGLIANO: Particularly in the case of the word SERF, where the fact that there aren\u2019t likely to be any serfs doing our crossword, it\u2019s hard to imagine someone taking personal offense at this. That being said, crosswords should entertain and uplift, and generally speaking a light tone in cluing is desirable. If there was the answer MURDER, for example, we might clue it as \u201cGroup of crows,\u201d rather than taking any of the other numerous more grisly ways to clue it.SHORTZ: Or even \u201cTopic for Agatha Christie.\u201d Often putting something in a fictional context can lighten it.SHORTZ: On the whole, Joel and I like this puzzle. We think it\u2019s been a good exercise. And we hope the above comments give both solvers and constructors some insights into our editing process.Crossword Compiler for WindowsCrossfire (for Mac)Crossword Maker for Cruciverbalists (for iPhone/iPad)Onelook.comThesaurus.comJeff Chen\u2019s XWord Info listCruciverb.comMatt Ginsberg\u2019s listCruciverb-L email listRex Parker Does the NY Times Crossword PuzzleHorace and Frances Discuss The New York Times Crossword PuzzleL.

{"Headline": "City Council Approves Inwood Rezoning, Despite Resident Protests", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe proposal is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s plan to rezone up to 15 neighborhoods across the city and create and preserve 300,000 units of affordable housing by 2026. Inwood became the fifth neighborhood, all low-income and largely minority, to be rezoned under the plan.The rezoning will create and preserve 4,100 units of affordable housing, including 925 units on city-owned land and 675 units that will be established in market-rate buildings under housing rules that require developers to build affordable housing in projects made possible by rezoning.\u201cThe approval of the Inwood neighborhood rezoning means a fairer, stronger future for a community that has experienced decades of disinvestment,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cIt means affordability, security and opportunity for residents and new immigrants alike.\u201dBut a coalition of Inwood residents have opposed the plan because they fear that even with new affordable units, an influx of market-rate apartments will increase rents and displace longtime residents.Some of those opponents disrupted the Council meeting before the vote, shouting \u201cshame,\u201d throwing fake money from the balcony and accusing the councilman who represents Inwood, Ydanis Rodriguez, of betraying them.As a part of the negotiations for the rezoning, Mr. Rodriguez and city officials agreed to $200 million worth of neighborhood investments, including a new 20,000-square-foot library with affordable housing; a plan to open up access to the waterfront; and $50 million in improvements at the George Washington Educational Complex, such as a new science, technology, engineering and math curriculum.\u201cThis rezoning is not about pushing tenants out,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said at a news conference before the meeting. \u201cThis rezoning is about millions of dollars in investment.\u201dEarlier, Stephanie Frias, 26, an Inwood resident, stood outside City Hall in the scorching sun, holding a sign that read \u201cSAVE INWOOD.\u201d\u201cIf he wants to help the community of Inwood he could take a different approach without rezoning,\u201d said Ms. Frias, 26. \u201cThis is a loss for the Inwood community.\u201dInwood, on the northern tip of Manhattan, is known for its parks, diversity and affordability. Longtime residents there regard the neighborhood as a closely guarded secret. Nearly 80 percent of units there, which are in five- to eight-story tenements, are under some form of rent regulation.Half of the residents are foreign born, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of Dominicans in the city. Whites, Asians and blacks make up almost a quarter of the neighborhood.The rezoning will have the biggest impact in the industrial area east of 10th Avenue, where the changes will allow for buildings between 18 and 30 stories tall. Buildings of that size, which will contain some affordable housing, will contain many more market-rate units. The higher costs of those units will drive up rents and change the character of the neighborhood, opponents argue.Councilman Jumaane Williams of Brooklyn, who is running for lieutenant governor, abstained from the voting, saying, \u201cWe are not doing as much as we should be for affordable housing.\u201dCity officials say that gentrification is already underway in Inwood. According to the most recent data, rents are rising faster in Community District 12, which includes Inwood, Washington Heights and Marble Hill, than in the rest of the city.A quarter of Inwood residents live below the poverty line, compared with 18 percent citywide. Only 200 new units of housing have been built in the neighborhood of 43,000 residents over the last two decades, versus 67,000 units in the rest of Manhattan. That means the pressure on rents will occur without the rezoning, James Patchett, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, said in a recent interview.\u201cPeople have legitimate fears that rents are going up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we believe we will create a substantial amount of affordable housing.\u201dMr. Rodriguez said he listened closely to residents concerned about the rezoning. A business district known as the \u201cCommercial U,\u201d which stretches along Dyckman Street, Broadway and West 207th Street, was removed from the plan. The maximum density allowed was reduced on blocks with concentrated amounts of rent-regulated housing.As a part of the rezoning, the city will also look to develop affordable housing on the site of a sanitation garage on 215th Street and 10th Avenue that is soon to be relocated, and at the schoolyard at Intermediate School 52 on Vermilyea Avenue.The city will also help Con Edison consolidate facilities that could lead to the sale of land to private developers, who would be required to build affordable housing as part of the mandatory inclusionary housing program.Corey Johnson, the Council speaker, said that Mr. Rodriguez \u201cfought as hard as anyone could have\u201d to get the best deal for his community.One of those attacks took the form of a message that Mr. Rodriguez received on Facebook. The message, shared by Mr. Rodriguez, showed a hooded person cutting the throat of what looks to be a law enforcement officer. Mr. Rodriguez described the image as \u201cISIS like.\u201d\u201cThe N.Y.P.D. received information about social media postings that were concerning,\u201d Detective Sophia Mason said in an email. \u201cAn investigation and threat assessment was carried out by the intelligence bureau.\u201dPolice officials declined to answer further questions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Russian Hacking Targeted Republican Groups, Microsoft Says", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election appears to have a new target: conservative American think tanks that have broken with President Trump and are seeking continued sanctions against Moscow, exposing oligarchs or pressing for human rights.In a report scheduled for release on Tuesday, Microsoft Corporation said that it detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific Senate offices or political campaigns.The shift to attacking conservative think tanks underscores the Russian intelligence agency\u2019s goals: to disrupt any institutions challenging Moscow and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\u201cWe are now seeing another uptick in attacks. What is particular in this instance is the broadening of the type of websites they are going after,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said Monday in an interview.\u201cThese are organizations that are informally tied to Republicans,\u201d he said, \u201cso we see them broadening beyond the sites they have targeted in the past.\u201d\u201cThis is another demonstration of the fact that the Russians aren\u2019t really pursuing partisan attacks, they are pursuing attacks that they perceive in their own national self-interest,\u201d said Eric Rosenbach, the director of the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University, on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s about disrupting and diminishing any group that challenges how Putin\u2019s Russia is operating at home and around the world.\u201dThe State Department has traditionally helped fund both Republican and Democratic groups that engage in promoting democracy.\u201cIt is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime,\u201d Mr. Twining said in a statement.The goal of the Russian hacking attempt was unclear, and Microsoft was able to catch the spoofed websites as they were set up.But Mr. Smith said that \u201cthese attempts are the newest security threats to groups connected with both American political parties\u201d ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\u201cThese attacks are seeking to disrupt and divide,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an asymmetric risk here for democratic societies. The kind of attacks we see from authoritarian regimes are seeking to fracture and splinter groups in our society.\u201dOn Sunday, the current national security adviser, John R. Bolton, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the fall elections. He also named China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 the other most active cyberoperators among state adversaries \u2014 as threats.But so far Microsoft and other firms have not found extensive election-related actions by those nations.Senior United States intelligence officials have also warned that the midterm elections will be targeted by foreign governments looking to influence American voters.Speaking last month at the Aspen Security Forum, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that his agency was seeing information operations \u201caimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in the country.\u201dThe attempt revealed by Microsoft mirrored efforts by Russian state-backed hackers before the 2016 presidential election.A single letter, or even a punctuation mark, was often the only difference between the real and fake websites.The fake websites were used as the conduit for a number of attacks, including persuading victims to download harmful malware or to reveal passwords and other personal information. But for the past year, Microsoft has grown increasingly aggressive in countering them.In 2016, a federal judge in Virginia agreed that the group Microsoft calls \u201cStrontium\u201d and others call \u201cAPT 28,\u201d for \u201cadvanced persistent threat,\u201d would continue its attacks. The judge appointed a \u201cspecial master\u201d with the power to authorize Microsoft to seize fake websites as soon as they are registered. As a result, the hackers have lost control of many of the sites only days after creating them.But it is a constant cat-and-mouse game, as the Russian hackers seek new vectors of attack while Microsoft and others seek to cut them off.\u201cThese attacks keep happening because they work. They are successful again and again,\u201d said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, who doubts whether anyone can stay ahead of the hackers.\u201cMicrosoft is playing whack-a-mole here,\u201d Mr. Rid said. \u201cThese sites are easy to register and bring back up, and so they will keep doing so.\u201dLast month, Microsoft announced that it had detected and helped block similar attacks against two senators who are up for re-election. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces one of the toughest political challenges this year, acknowledged that her campaign was among them after months of keeping the news quiet \u2014 apparently to avoid alienating voters who doubt the Russian role in election interference.Microsoft says it is expanding its effort to help political candidates counter foreign influence. It is starting an initiative it calls \u201cAccountGuard\u201d to bolster protections to candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations.With the midterms less than three months away, Microsoft said greater cooperation was needed between tech companies and the federal government over efforts to interfere in the American elections.\u201cOver the last year, the larger tech companies, in particular, have put into place stronger information-sharing practices where we have seen these threats emerge,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThose agreements, however, are informal.\u201dDavid E. Sanger reported from Boston, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

This is where we are now: building coalitions around causes, often with those to whom we take offense or even despise. The enemy of my enemy is my temporary tool.Hopefully these coalitions will not need to be longstanding. Trump\u2019s fortress of fraudulence is showing cracks.

I have had many friends involved in this stuff. It\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal.\u201dThe use of informants is a central part of how some criminal prosecutions are executed. This is how the justice system works.Trump is a man who has lived a life evading justice, using the legal system and the threat of legal action against people. For him, the justice system is a tool at the disposal of the wealthy and the ruthless, one to be used against anyone of lesser means and lesser fortitude. In his mind, the fact that he may be implicated by the justice system is a blasphemy, a distortion of the American power structure, in which the wealthy almost always win.As he told Fox: \u201cI\u2019ve always had controversy in my life and I\u2019ve always succeeded. I\u2019ve always won. I\u2019ve always won.\u201d\u201cFederal prosecutors in Manhattan struck a deal earlier this summer with Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, granting him immunity for his grand jury testimony about Michael D. Cohen, a person briefed on the arrangement said Friday.\u201dThis wannabe-king\u2019s court is filled with rats and weasels more interested in their own preservation than his. Trump demands loyalty, and loyalty freely given should be honored and revered. When the dishonorable attempt to purchase it, either with money or fear, it will always prove false in the end.No one can outrun the truth forever. Eventually, the truth always catches up.

By then the family had grown to include Derek, whom Marty met in 2003 when he was 17, and David, whom she met in 2013. Both are African-American men in their 30s. Marty had been supervising a teenage pregnancy education program in which high school students taught fifth and sixth graders. She started giving one of the high school students \u2014 Derek \u2014 a ride home, and grew close to him and his mother, Kim.

Also, a bit about Trump\u2019s plan to freeze standards on automobile pollution.One of those niches is the Arctic, where mosquitoes play a bigger role in sustaining the ecosystem but may be threatened by the changing climate, said Lauren E. Culler, a research assistant professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College.\u201cYou can collect pollen off of mosquitoes, indicating they may have a role in pollination,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that they\u2019re also food for other organisms in the food web.\u201dShe is now researching how changes in the Arctic, which is warming twice as fast than the global average, are affecting mosquitoes. \u201cLosing mosquitoes from the Arctic ecosystem could have some unanticipated impacts,\u201d she said.We\u2019re not close to losing them yet, but things are changing fast in the region. In her most recent study Dr. Culler looked at how successfully mosquitoes were reproducing in Greenland. In her earlier work she found that mosquitoes were emerging earlier in the spring and maturing faster courtesy of the Arctic\u2019s warming temperatures. But it was unclear whether this earlier emergence was endangering their survival.Similarly concerning is that the ponds mosquitoes depend on as spots to lay eggs are disappearing in Greenland for unknown reasons.Her study found that with the exception of the coldest ponds closest to Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, female mosquitoes were successfully reproducing above the rate required to sustain the population. At least for now.The draft plan would throttle the Obama-era fuel economy standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 back to 37 miles per gallon, and it would revoke the right of California and other states to set their own, more stringent standards. If the plan is finalized in its current form, California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has said he will lead an 18-state lawsuit against it. That could lead to the creation of two separate mileage standards, effectively splitting the nation\u2019s auto market in two.That\u2019s a nightmare scenario for automakers, parts suppliers and dealerships, who will use the draft plan\u2019s 60-day public comment period to urge the administration to go back to the drawing board and change the plan. The 18 states, as well as environmental, public health and consumer advocacy groups are expected to do the same. While some Republicans cheered the plan, most industry groups \u2014 including the oil industry, the one sector the rollback would clearly benefit \u2014 avoided public statements of support.The analysis forms the legal and technical foundation for the Trump administration\u2019s draft rules. Remarkably, among its biggest critics are senior administration officials, including Andrew Wheeler, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency.Michelle Hicks got a nasty surprise when she emailed to ask for an early check-in at the apartment her family had rented in Florida: A toxic algal bloom had hit the beach.Since last fall, the algal bloom, known as a red tide, has lingered off four counties south of Tampa.

This is how I like to cook at home, topping simple food with whatever fresh soft herbs I have \u2014 parsley, mint, dill, basil \u2014 which I just chop roughly or tear up with my hands. I know some people are reluctant to buy bunches of herbs; they tend to wither in the fridge and land in the trash. That\u2019s why it\u2019s imperative you go wild with them in the moment. The suggestions below use them in abundance.Here are five dishes for the week:I love the combination of flavors and textures in this Alison Roman recipe: rich salmon, salty-sweet marinade and cool herb salad with lightly pickled shallot. I\u2019ve bulked up the salad so it can serve as our veg for the evening, roughly doubling the dressing and using a mix of baby arugula, cilantro and parsley. Serve rice on the side. (Not a bad idea to make extra rice to reheat later in the week, to serve with the larb or meatballs.)I couldn\u2019t stop eating this dish, a simplified version of the Laotian and Thai staple larb moo that combines pan-seared ground pork (or use turkey or chicken instead) with herbs, lime, fish sauce and chiles. If you\u2019re pressed for time, skip Step 1, in which you make rice powder to bring the dish together; that\u2019s more authentic, but if it would keep you from trying the recipe, leave it out. Serve with rice and lettuce leaves for scooping up the larb.This Melissa Clark recipe is one of my favorites, a pasta dish in which the halved tomatoes collapse in the pan to create a very fast sauce. Ingeniously, she tops each serving with a salad\u2019s worth of mint and scallions, a mixture that is bright and bracing. I rarely make this with the pancetta called for in the recipe; it\u2019s delicious, but I like to keep things lighter and more streamlined midweek. (Skipping the pancetta also makes the dish meatless.)Advertisement"}

That was the case on Friday, when an Australian tourist on a bicycle died after she was hit by a garbage truck on Central Park West near West 67th Street around 4:45 p.m.The truck struck the tourist, Madison Jane Lyden, 23, after she swerved in its lane to avoid a livery cab that had cut her off in the northbound bike lane.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who oversaw the creation of more than 66 miles of bike lanes last year under his Vision Zero plan, which aims to eliminate traffic fatalities, visited the scene on Friday and said he was disgusted by what happened.\u201cThis is another example, from my point of view, of the danger of reckless driving, and we\u2019re going to make sure there\u2019s a full investigation and we\u2019re going to make sure that there are real consequences for anything that happened here that was illegal,\u201d he added. \u201cA 23-year-old, that\u2019s very painful.\u201dThe driver of the garbage truck, Felipe Chairez, 44, was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. In a court affidavit, the police said Mr. Chairez had watery and bloodshot eyes, and registered a blood-alcohol level of .04, the legal limit for commercial drivers. He also told a police officer that he drank two beers before the crash, according to the affidavit.Mr. Chairez\u2019s lawyer, Kenneth Ware, said in an interview that his client might also have eaten a chicken salad sandwich.A judge temporarily suspended Mr. Chairez\u2019s license and released him on his own recognizance.Just as Ms. Lyden\u2019s killing mobilized the cycling community in New York, it resonated among activists in Australia, who noted that the perils she faced were not limited to the busy streets of Manhattan.\u201cAll around the world we need to do more to protect people riding bikes,\u201d said Craig Richards, the chief executive of the Bicycle Network, an organization based in Melbourne advocating for cyclists.\u201cTo ride a bike in New York City, especially in Central Park, is a dream come true for many Aussies. It should be something you talk about for the rest of your life, not the end of your life.\u201dThe number of cyclists killed in traffic collisions in the city has held relatively steady since 2000, but as the number of riders has increased, so have calls for the city to step up its efforts to protect them.Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the accident on Friday was \u201ca crash waiting to happen.\u201d\u201cEvery day in this city, bike lanes meant to protect people on bikes are used as drop-off lanes, parking lanes, and idling lanes for lazy and entitled drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a city we should be ashamed, because this death could have been prevented.\u201dAs more people use bicycles to get around, Mr. White called for the city to install protected bike lanes on every major street. About 25 miles, or less than half, of the bike lanes installed last year under Mr. de Blasio have protective barriers.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible tragedy to lose Madison,\u201d Mr. Richards said.Ms. Lyden was traveling from Geelong, Australia, a port city near Melbourne, where she had worked for just over a year as a swimming teacher, lifeguard and receptionist at public recreational facilities, officials said. Ms. Lyden appeared to travel abroad regularly, posting on Facebook a photograph of her plane ticket as she left for Bangkok and a selfie with the Mona Lisa over her shoulder.She had grown up in Tasmania, in a suburb of Hobart, the capital city. Her father runs the family\u2019s prominent construction and design company, which, in 2011, built a house named for Ms. Lyden to raise money for a charity supporting people with diabetes, a condition that she had, according to news reports.She moved to Geelong, along Australia\u2019s southeastern coast, several years ago for college. \u201cIt was not long ago that we celebrated our graduation together,\u201d said one friend, Caity Ashton, who met Ms. Lyden when they were both students at Deakin University, according to The Geelong Advertiser newspaper. \u201cI made a lifelong friend.

{"Headline": "Facing New Russian Hacking, Senators Signal They Are Ready to Act", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in three separate hearings on Capitol Hill, senators prodded the Trump administration to do more with its existing authorities to deter Russia and protect the United States\u2019 political infrastructure.\u201cCongress is going to act; you might as well know that,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, predicted in a meeting of the Banking Committee, which oversees sanctions law. \u201cI\u2019d rather it act in a way that has your insights about what would be helpful, but if you fail to provide insights then we will provide you with a law that ultimately takes place without your insights.\u201dBut administration officials argued that the current sanctions regime provided all the authority they needed, and they dismissed concerns that President Trump\u2019s equivocation on questions of Russian interference had harmed their efforts.\u201cIf you look at the wide range of activities that this administration has undertaken under the direction of the president, including the very significant sanctions that we have been able to launch, including the expulsion of 60 Russians out of our country, including the closing of Russian entities in the United States, what Russia sees is a United States that is very aggressively targeting malign activity,\u201d Sigal P. Mandelker, a senior Treasury Department official, told the Banking Committee.The senators\u2019 pleas took on more urgency after Microsoft Corporation revealed on Monday that it had detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian military intelligence unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the conservative Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.Both institutions have taken aim at Russian corruption, and on Tuesday the Hudson Institute said in a statement that was not the first time an authoritarian government had targeted its work, nor did it expect it to be the last. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific offices or political campaigns.\u201cTo Republicans, if you think the Russians don\u2019t have you in mind, you are making a great mistake,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said as he led a hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee focused on election security. \u201cThey are trying to undermine the democratic process.\u201dBut senators were skeptical of the administration\u2019s actions. They questioned the effectiveness of sanctions passed overwhelmingly last year to target Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors, and tried to solicit input from the officials on how to proceed. And with the latest targets being conservative groups, concern could spread.Mr. Graham said efforts to deter Russia had clearly fallen short and called on party leaders to move quickly.Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he was \u201cpersonally very interested\u201d in additional bipartisan sanctions legislation, but he cautioned that there may not be time to fully consider it before the election.\u201cThe chances of sandwiching that in, honestly, in the month of September with all the other items we have swirling around, is probably pretty slim, but we will be here longer this year,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters. \u201cIt would be high on the list for consideration for floor time.\u201dThe report from Microsoft sharpened the warnings. It said that the company had identified and shut down several websites linked to a Russian military intelligence unit that set out to influence the 2016 American elections.Amid those warnings and the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s July summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, senators from both parties have been anxiously debating how to raise the pressure on Moscow.Two approaches dominate the discussion.Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, have drafted legislation to deter Russia from further interference, putting the Kremlin on notice that the United States will enact broad economic sanctions if it does not stand down before the November elections.The competing bill, written by Mr. Menendez and Mr. Graham, would seek to immediately drop a package of what they call \u201ccrushing\u201d new punishments on the country for actions already underway.The Banking Committee appeared ready to sort through the differences.\u201cIt\u2019s not often that Congress acts together in such a strong manner, as marked by such near-unanimous votes\u201d last year, said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cBut then, Russia is a menace on so many different levels today that Congress can be compelled to act with a single voice to find solutions that will protect America and democratic values across the world.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, was more forceful, calling the latest denial by the Kremlin \u201cnonsense\u201d and insisting that Mr. Trump do the same.\u201cOur government \u2014 the president and Congress together \u2014 must right now send a more powerful and direct message to Putin and those within his circles: We know what you\u2019re doing, it must stop and if you continue, you and your government will pay a dear price,\u201d he said.The hearings were combative at times, with senators venting that administration officials were dodging simple questions.\u201cOne of the things I thought would come from this hearing is a recommendation or a set of recommendations of what Congress might consider legislatively for additional sanctions,\u201d Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said at the Banking Committee hearing. \u201cAm I to take from your unwillingness to answer that kind of question that there is opposition by the administration to additional sanctions?\u201dMs. Mandelker would not give a straight answer, repeatedly telling senators that the Treasury Department had the authority it needed.In the Foreign Relations Committee, senators were clearly frustrated with what they said was a lack of progress in curbing Russian behavior.\u201cWhy, given all the things we are doing, are we not making better progress?\u201d asked Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. \u201cI think sanctions are necessary,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s obviously not working the way we\u2019d like. What would be more effective?\u201dA.

Opinion Columnist\u201cThe president has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, calling it \u201ccallous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle.\u201dThen there was Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea for criminal violations of campaign-finance laws. This was soon followed by the usual casuistry from Donald Trump and his defenders explaining why the offense, as it related to the president, was legally trivial; or that the economy would collapse in the event of impeachment; or that Trump\u2019s critics were mentally deranged; or that the president was entitled to the sort of deference due to kings.It was all vintage Bill: deploying minions to lie about illicit sex (and twist the meaning of words); abusing the powers of the presidency to trash the reputations of others; converting his character flaws into a national convulsion. Clinton did all this, and so has Trump. What the former pioneered, the latter has simply taken to the next level. By the same token, liberals now calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment ought to rethink the excuses so many of them made for Clinton 20 years ago. That it was \u201cjust sex.\u201d Or that \u201clying about sex\u201d doesn\u2019t rise to the level of an impeachable offense (even if it\u2019s lying about sex under oath). Or that \u201ccharacter doesn\u2019t matter\u201d so long as the administration produces peace and prosperity. Or that the motivating animus of the president\u2019s critics is reason enough to dismiss the criticism.These excuses were toxic not because they had no merit, but because they sidestepped the core of the issue: that the survival and ennoblement of democracy depend on holding people in high office to higher, not lower, standards.Then, too, the Clinton machine\u2019s relentless efforts to delegitimize the independent counsel by claiming Starr had gone far beyond his original remit to investigate the Whitewater case mirror the Trump machine\u2019s attacks on Robert Mueller today.Yet what Starr did then is what Mueller and other prosecutors are doing now: uncovering wrongdoing where they find it. That Trump\u2019s hush money to two women has nothing to do with Russia makes the wrongdoing no less contemptible, illegal \u2014 and, because it\u2019s about the president, impeachable.Because the Clinton impeachment saga is still relatively recent, it\u2019s been depressing \u2014 and instructive \u2014 to watch the two sides in that drama conveniently adopt the other\u2019s former rationale for their own partisan convenience. (Lindsey Graham, this means you.)But anyone who now calls for Trump to be judged severely should acknowledge that we would have been in a better place today if Clinton hadn\u2019t been so fervently defended back then. Among other things, it might have dissuaded other sexual predators and congenital liars from running for high office.We can still get it right.

And though I believe his policies would impoverish the country, he and his followers get credit for seeming to understand that the bipartisan ruling class is playing the game for its own benefit. George Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, neatly described the political dilemma faced by the Sanders crowd: \u201cThe inability of mankind to imagine happiness except in the form of relief, either from effort or pain, presents Socialists with a serious problem.\u201dRepublicans have a similar problem to the one Democrats face. How do they re-energize the wages-and-jobs voters who came out for Trump in 2016? Whoever figures out how to persuade them that they have a secure economic future is likely to have a good night.

What was his alleged crime? Performing a Jewish wedding in the Jewish state.In Israel, the ultra-Orthodox chief rabbinate is legally responsible for sanctioning all Jewish weddings and divorces. But Rabbi Hayoun, like hundreds of other rabbis, isn\u2019t recognized by the rabbinate. And so he performs weddings without its blessing. Technically, this makes him a criminal. Under Section 7 of Israel\u2019s Marriage and Divorce Ordinance, any marriage or divorce that isn\u2019t registered with the rabbinate is illegal. The potential punishment: two years in prison. What would Israel\u2019s founders make of this situation? What about our Jewish ancestors?More than 3,000 years ago, Judaism introduced a radical idea into the world: Human beings are all created in the image of God. Unlike other ancient near-Eastern creation narratives, which speak of man as being created out of battles between the gods, the Torah insists that human beings were created out of a divine decision to bring goodness to the world. When God chooses to make a nation of Abraham, God says, \u201cI know that he will command his children to seek justice and righteousness.\u201dWith the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, David Ben-Gurion and others transformed that biblical vision into modern reality. Israel\u2019s Declaration of Independence states that the state \u201cwill be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.\u201d It is a stirring vision worthy of our people\u2019s storied and painful history. But Israel still has a long way to go to realize the vision of the prophets of Israel \u2014 or to address the needs of the world\u2019s 14 million Jews.Recent legislation has reinforced the notion that today\u2019s Israel is succumbing to myopic extremism. The recently passed nation-state law has drawn the justifiable ire of many of Israel\u2019s non-Jewish law-abiding citizens, who say it makes them feel second class. A new law does not allow gay couples to have a child using a surrogate in Israel. And a proposed conversion law would give the chief rabbis unprecedented power over who can join the Jewish people. These are just the latest moves by extremist elements in the government to make life in the Jewish state less welcoming for anyone who doesn\u2019t identify with ultra-Orthodox Judaism. Thanks to the rabbinate\u2019s stranglehold on marriage, approximately one out of every eight Jewish Israeli couples each year choose to marry outside of Israel. (Cyprus is the typical destination of choice.) Tens of thousands more have forgone marriage altogether. More than 425,000 immigrants to Israel \u2014 primarily from the former Soviet Union, where Judaism was outlawed for decades \u2014 are listed in the population registry as \u201cno religion\u201d because no one is willing to help them clarify their Jewish status. The rabbinate won\u2019t perform weddings for them. I know many of these disaffected Jewish Israelis personally. For more than a decade, I have been fighting to break the ultra-Orthodox monopoly over Jewish life in Israel. Through the organization I run, I help more than 5,000 families each year navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. I have the dubious distinction of being an Orthodox rabbi who has sued the chief rabbinate in Israel\u2019s Supreme Court \u2014 six times. Many people are critical of my work. In some parts of the Orthodox Jewish community, I am accused of \u201cgoing too far,\u201d of undermining the Halakhah (traditional Jewish legal corpus) that stands at the cornerstone of my faith. In other circles, I am accused of being \u201ctoo hard on Israel,\u201d of airing the dirty laundry of a young state that has done so much for the Jewish people.Israel should embrace the challenge and the honor of being a homeland for the whole Jewish people. If it does, the words of the prophet Isaiah, \u201cZion will be redeemed in justice, and those who return to her, with righteousness,\u201d will be realized.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Alabama, Challenging Hidden Racial Discrimination ", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA federal appeals court has allowed fast-food workers to contest a state law blocking the city of Birmingham from raising its minimum wage. Mr. Guttentag has litigated civil rights cases throughout the United States.STANFORD, Calif. \u2014 The city of Birmingham, Ala., where some of the civil rights movement\u2019s most consequential struggles took place 50 years ago, is now ground zero in a new 21st-century fight against economic inequality and racial oppression, with implications for communities of color across the country.   While state laws blocking local wage increases have proliferated, the Birmingham case is the first to directly challenge the racially discriminatory nature of the state measures. As the case moves forward, it could provide similar cities with a legal road map for challenging this modern-day tool of racial subjugation. These are the majority-black and -brown localities deprived by majority white state legislatures of the authority to enact local ordinances raising the wages of its residents.   The State of Alabama argued that states frequently regulate the authority of cities and maintained that its actions had nothing to do with race. A district court initially dismissed the fast-food workers\u2019 lawsuit saying the plaintiffs could not prove racial discrimination.  But last month, the Atlanta-based United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit noted the racial history of Alabama, the white-led state action to overturn Birmingham\u2019s ordinance, and the state law\u2019s discriminatory effect on the city\u2019s majority-black population. The court held that Birmingham workers had presented a valid legal claim and compelling allegations of discrimination, and the ruling reinstated the lawsuit to allow the plaintiffs to prove their case, stressing that racial discrimination could take many forms. \u201cToday, racism is no longer pledged from the portico of the Capitol or exclaimed from the floor of the constitutional convention,\u201d the court wrote in its unanimous decision. \u201c[I]t hides, abashed, cloaked beneath ostensibly neutral laws and legitimate bases, steering government power toward no less invidious ends.\u201d Elected leaders in communities of color across the country have taken notice of this case, observing similarly discriminatory effects from state laws that handcuff their cities from raising pay.  Last year, then-Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta signed a legal brief supporting the lawsuit by Birmingham fast-food workers, noting that Georgia lawmakers have similarly prevented his city from raising its minimum wage. Atlanta is 54 percent black and has one of the highest income gaps in the nation.  The court\u2019s ruling is a victory for the more than 40,000 low-wage Birmingham residents who were robbed of a much-needed pay raise and who will now get their day in court. But more profoundly, this case \u2014 originating in a town where America\u2019s history of racial violence faced some of its most pivotal confrontations \u2014 could now open the door for communities of color across the country to challenge racially discriminatory laws that deny localities the power to improve the lives of people of color.

Maybe It\u2019s Not Your Fault", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rise of the new \u201cattention economy.\u201dIn doing so the companies seemed to suggest that spending time on the internet is not a desirable, healthy habit, but a pleasurable vice: one that if left uncontrolled may slip into unappealing addiction. \u201cThe liberation of human attention may be the defining moral and political struggle of our time,\u201d writes James Williams, a technologist turned philosopher and the author of a new book, \u201cStand Out of Our Light.\u201dMr. Williams, 36, should know. During a decade-long tenure at Google, he worked on search advertising, helping perfect a powerful, data-driven advertising model. Gradually, he began to feel that his life story as he knew it was coming unglued, \u201cas though the floor was crumbling under my feet,\u201d he writes.Mr. Williams compares the current design of our technology to \u201can entire army of jets and tanks\u201d aimed at capturing and keeping our attention. And the army is winning. We spend the day transfixed by our screens, thumb twitching in the subways and elevators, glancing at traffic lights.This is us: eyes glazed, mouth open, neck crooked, trapped in dopamine loops and filter bubbles. Our attention is sold to advertisers, along with our data, and handed back to us tattered and piecemeal.  Mr. Williams, 36, was speaking on Skype from his home in Moscow, where his wife, who works for the United Nations, has been posted for the year. Mr. Williams is now concerned with overwired individuals losing their life purpose.He knew that among that his colleagues, he wasn\u2019t the only one feeling this way. Speaking at a technology conference in Amsterdam last year, Mr. Williams asked the designers in the room, some 250 of them, \u201cHow many of you guys want to live in the world that you\u2019re creating? In a world where technology is competing for our attention?\u201d \u201cNot a single hand went up,\u201d he said.Mr. Williams is also far from the only example of a former soldier of big tech (to continue the army metaphor) now working to expose its cultural dangers. In late June, Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google, took the stage at the Aspen Ideas Festival to warn the crowd that what we are facing is no less than an \u201cexistential threat\u201d from our very own gadgets. He likes a chess analogy. When Facebook or Google points their \u201csupercomputers\u201d toward our minds, he said, \u201cit\u2019s checkmate.\u201d Back in the more innocent days of 2013, when Mr. Williams and Mr. Harris both still worked at Google, they\u2019d meet in conference rooms and sketch out their thoughts on whiteboards: a concerned club of two at the epicenter of the attention economy. Since then, both men\u2019s messages have grown in scope and urgency. The constant pull on our attention from technology is no longer just about losing too many hours of our so-called real lives to the diversions of the web. Now, they are telling us, we are at risk of fundamentally losing our moral purpose.\u201cIt\u2019s changing our ability to make sense of what\u2019s true, so we have less and less idea of a shared fabric of truth, of a shared narrative that we all subscribe to,\u201d Mr. Harris said, the day after his Aspen talk. \u201cWithout shared truth or shared facts, you get chaos \u2014 and people can take control.\u201d But many of the biggest questions remain unanswered. At the top of that list, no smaller a mystery remains than \u201cthe relationship between attention and our conscious experience of the world,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, a neuroscientist whose lab at U.C.L.A. studies attention and memory. Also unclear: the consequence of all that screen time on our bedraggled neurons. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how modern technology and changes in our culture impact our ability to sustain our attention on our goals,\u201d Dr. Rissman said.Britt Anderson, a neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, went so far as to write a 2011 paper titled \u201cThere Is No Such Thing as Attention.\u201d Dr. Anderson argued that researchers have used the word to apply to so many different behaviors \u2014 attention span, attention deficit, selective attention and spatial attention, to name a few \u2014 that it has become essentially meaningless, even at the very moment when it\u2019s more relevant than ever. Despite attention\u2019s possible lack of existence, though, many among us mourn its passing \u2014 Ms. LuPone, for example, and others who command an audience, like college professors.Katherine Hayles, an English professor at U.C.L.A., has written about the change she sees in students as one from \u201cdeep attention,\u201d a state of single-minded absorption that can last for hours, to one of \u201chyper attention,\u201d which jumps from target to target, preferring to skim the surface of lots of different things than to probe the depths of just one. At Columbia University, where every student is required to pass a core curriculum with an average of 200 to 300 pages of reading each week, professors have been discussing how to deal with the conspicuous change in students\u2019 ability to get through their assignments. The curriculum has more or less stayed in place, but \u201cwe\u2019re constantly thinking about how we\u2019re teaching when attention spans have changed since 50 years ago,\u201d said Lisa Hollibaugh, a dean of academic planning at Columbia. In the 1990s, 3 to 5 percent of American school-aged children were thought to have what is now called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. By 2013, that number was 11 percent, and rising, according to data from the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health.At Tufts University, Nick Seaver, an anthropology professor, just finished his second year of teaching a class he designed called How to Pay Attention. But rather than offering tips for focusing, as one might expect, he set out to train his students to look at attention as a cultural phenomenon \u2014 \u201cthe way people talk about attention,\u201d Dr. Seaver said, with topics like the \u201cattention economy\u201d or \u201cattention and politics.\u201dAs part of their homework for the \u201ceconomy\u201d week, Dr. Seaver told his students to analyze how an app or website \u201ccaptures\u201d their attention and then profits from it. A classmate, Jake Rochford, who chose Tinder, noted the extreme stickiness of a new \u201csuper-like\u201d button. \u201cOnce the super-like button came into play, I noticed all of the functions as strategies for keeping the app open, instead of strategies for helping me find love,\u201d Mr. Rochford, 21, said. After completing that week\u2019s assignment, he disabled his account. But Dr. Seaver, 32, is no Luddite.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that there are too many things to pay attention to: That doesn\u2019t follow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could be that there are more things that are trying to actively demand your attention.\u201d And there is not only the attention we pay to consider, but also the attention we receive. Sherry Turkle, the M.I.T. sociologist and psychologist, has been writing about our relationship with our technology for decades. Devices that come with us everywhere we go, she argues, introduce a brand new dynamic: Rather than compete with their siblings for their parents\u2019 attention, children are up against iPhones and iPads, Siri and Alexa, Apple watches and computer screens. Every moment they spend with their parents, they are also spending with their parents\u2019 need to be constantly connected. It is the first generation to be so affected \u2014 now 14 to 21 years old \u2014 that Dr. Turkle describes in detail in her most recent book, \u201cReclaiming Conversation.\u201d\u201cA generation has grown up that has lived a very unsatisfying youth and really does not associate their phones with any kind of glamour, but rather with a sense of deprivation,\u201d she said.And yet Dr. Turkle is cautiously optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see people inching their way toward \u2018time well spent,\u2019 Apple inching its way toward a mea culpa,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the culture itself turning toward a recognition that this can\u2019t go on.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Struggling to Get Pregnant Turn to Fertility Apps", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Nicole and Christopher Roberts of North Stonington, Conn., decided to start a family in 2016, Nicole quickly became pregnant, but then miscarried three months later.Getting pregnant a second time became far tougher than they expected. Mrs. Roberts, 32, started taking neonatal vitamins, tracking her menstrual cycle carefully, taking over-the-counterovulation tests, and even trying a few wacky internet suggestions, such as putting her legs up in the air after sex and not moving for half an hour.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the months dragged on, there was a feeling of desperation because we wanted it so badly.\u201dThen she saw an ad for Ava, a Fitbit-like device that\u2019s worn on the wrist at night and uses sensors to identify the five fertile days in a woman\u2019s monthly cycle to improve her odds of conception. \u201cIt almost felt too good to be true,\u201d Mrs. Roberts said. She started using the device in March 2017, was pregnant by June, and gave birth to Amelia this year on March 19.Mrs. Roberts is among a growing number of women who are seeking out fertility apps and wearable devices, like Ava, to help grow their families.Busy lifestyles have made it tougher for working couples to find the time to track menstrual cycles, take ovulation tests, measure their daily temperature, and then make that all-important physical connection at just the right time in the cycle to create a baby.Also, many women, especially among millennials, are focusing on careers and putting off marriage and children until later, which poses additional challenges as conception rates are lower in older women. \u201cFor a 28-year-old woman, roughly 10 of the 12 eggs she releases each year are viable,\u201d Ms. Von Bidder said. \u201cBut for a 38-year old woman, perhaps only two of the 12 eggs will be viable.\u201d So pinpointing those fertile days becomes even more critical.The birthrate among women under 30 has been falling steadily since 2010 while the rate among women in their late 30s, 40s and 50s has been rising, according to National Center for Health statistics.\u201cIn my mind, if you had [unprotected] sex, you got pregnant and that was it,\u201d said Kate Campbell, a 32-year-old Nashville resident, who was measuring her body temperature and taking ovulation tests twice a day for months to try to conceive \u2014 without success. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting any positives. I was really shocked. How do people get pregnant by accident?\u201dAfter purchasing an Ava bracelet in April 2017, she discovered she had been missing her fertility window by about a week because her cycles were longer than normal and regular period-tracking apps didn\u2019t pick that up. By August, she was pregnant, and her son, Canaan James, was born on April 27, 2018.The internet is filled with women on forums, Facebook and videos seeking fertility advice. They say the problem is highly misunderstood and deeply underestimated.The Ava bracelet collects data on nine parameters, including skin temperature, resting pulse rate, breathing, sleep movement, and stress levels, while the woman sleeps. Once the bracelet is synced to the person\u2019s phone in the morning, Ava\u2019s proprietary algorithm achieves an 89 percent accuracy rate at detecting 5.3 fertile days each cycle, according to the company.By measuring temperature and other variables, Ava is able to track changes in both progesterone and estrodial levels, Ms. Von Bidder said.\u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry about peeing on a stick and stressing out,\u201d said Krystal Noon, a 30-year old Branchville, N.J., resident, who struggled for months to conceive before using Ava. \u201cI would just put this bracelet on at night and it does all the work,\u201d said Mrs. Noon, who conceived two months after using Ava.Since its introduction in 2016, Ms. Von Bidder said, 10,000 Ava customers have become pregnant and at least 1,000 have given birth. Sales are on track to triple this year, she added.But Ava isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s limited to women with cycles between 24 and 35 days, and is not for those with PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, who face hormone imbalances and highly irregular cycles.And Ava has some competitors.But none track all of the parameters that Ava does, Ms. Von Bidder said. \u201cBecause we measure more physiological parameters than just temperature, we can actually detect the fertile window earlier and with a higher accuracy.\u201d.One wearable, OvuSense, is worn like a tampon and measures temperature and other factors. Its readings are considered more accurate than those taken by external devices and can even predict ovulation days for people with PCOS. However, the device is more intrusive than wearing an Ava bracelet.\u201cI would be a little bit more leery of it because that sounds a little more invasive,\u201d said Tara Perez, a 34-year-old Cartersville, Ga., resident who used the Ava bracelet to help conceive.A big Ava perk is its wildly popular Facebook groups, where 25,000 registered Ava users ask questions, share experiences and encourage each other. \u201cThat community of women is unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Mrs. Perez, who credits the group with helping her through her fertility struggles. Mrs. Perez said family members had told her she likely would never be able to have children because she was Type 1 diabetic. But the Ava community helped and encouraged her through the loss of one baby to heart failure at 34 weeks and another through a form of early miscarriage, or \u201cchemical pregnancy,\u201d at five weeks \u2014 before giving birth to a healthy baby girl, Selene, on May 30, this year.Still, Ava has its skeptics. On Reddit, some questioned Ava\u2019s efficacy, given that it had been tested on only 41 women in its original trial.Then there\u2019s Ava\u2019s $249 price tag. \u201cWhile it was expensive, it was a whole lot less expensive than trying to look into something like in vitro or trying to ovulate via medication,\u201d Mrs. Perez said.Some critics noted that none of the fertility apps and devices have proven data that shows they significantly shorten the time it takes for a woman to become pregnant. \u201cNone of them have undergone time-to-pregnancy studies,\u201d said Dr. Victoria Jennings, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Reproductive Health. \u201cBut it won\u2019t stop women from using them or the developers from promoting them.\u201dAva has raised $42.3 million in financing.And Pascal Koenig, chief executive and co-founder of Ava, said three studies were underway, including one with more than 430 participants, on expanding Ava\u2019s use to include detecting infections during pregnancy, helping women with highly irregular cycles and helping perimenopausal women.Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility at Columbia University Medical Center, sees value in both fertility apps and wearables. Even a basic app can help a woman see if her cycles are seriously irregular and require medical attention, he said.But he\u2019s particularly interested in Ava.\u201cIt seems pretty sophisticated,\u201d said Dr. Williams, who is in talks with the company about doing a more extensive joint study on the device. \u201cWe have an overarching goal of trying to make fertility treatment easier for women and couples going through it, and if this worked out, it would have the potential to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil Flirts With a Return to the Dark Days", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA top presidential candidate defends the military dictatorship that governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985. And he has an appealing formula for a troubled country: simple solutions to complex problems. Ms. Pires is a political reporter and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol.The political firestorm ignited by a huge anticorruption investigation and the impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff should have generated a new wave of Brazilian political leaders. But instead the two main contenders in this year\u2019s presidential election \u2014 Brazil\u2019s former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and the retired military officer Jair Bolsonaro, a veteran congressman in Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Deputies \u2014 represent the past.Mr. da Silva, who is running his campaign from his jail cell following a conviction on corruption charges, appeals to voters\u2019 nostalgia for the bygone days of political civility and economic boom that are unlikely to return soon. The political landscape and Mr. da Silva\u2019s own reputation are not what they once were. Mr. Bolsonaro has surged in popularity with about 20 percent of voter support, according to the latest polls, a high percentage in a fractured race. A conservative populist, he has defended the deplorable military dictatorship that governed Brazil from 1964 to 1985 and has justified the use of torture.There is a diverse group of presidential contenders along the political spectrum between Mr. da Silva and Mr. Bolsonaro. Though they all have their shortcomings, they by and large share a respect for the country\u2019s young democracy. Mr. Bolsonaro, however, has glorified Brazil\u2019s sinister authoritarian past. He is tempting Brazilians to return to a dark chapter in their history.Whether or not Mr. Bolsonaro is elected president, the fact that he is dominating the race is a huge step backward for Brazil. During any given election season, people tend to say that they will vote for the \u201clesser evil,\u201d but this time around the stakes are higher, given that one of the contenders has engineered his campaign on antidemocratic ideas.In 1997, when the left-wing Senator Eduardo Suplicy was attacked by a dog, Mr. Bolsonaro suggested that the dog receive a medal. In 1999, during the presidency of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he said that the dictatorship should have \u201cexecuted at least 30,000\u201d people, \u201cstarting with the president.\u201d He has also said that he would rather his son die than be homosexual. And in front of television cameras, he told a congresswoman that he would not rape her because she was ugly. Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s list of sexist and racist remarks goes on, but his most memorable moment may have been during the vote to impeach Ms. Rousseff, when he dedicated his vote, in favor of impeachment, to the head of the dictatorship\u2019s torture center. Long before she was president of Brazil, Ms. Rousseff had been a guerrilla fighter and was tortured by the dictatorship.In November 2017, I accompanied Mr. Bolsonaro to a military-cadet graduation. Seeing him in action reminded me of the magic Mr. da Silva once had, with an important difference. On the day he left office in January 2011, Mr. da Silva, in typical fashion, threw himself into the arms of a jubilant crowd as it cheered him on. And when Mr. da Silva surrendered to federal police in April to begin his prison sentence for corruption, the scene was no different: There was Lula, the man of the people, amid a sea of anxious hands hoping for the chance to touch him. This hands-on style of campaigning has been a leitmotif for Lula, as he\u2019s known in Brazil, ever since his days as a union leader in the 1970s. During the graduation ceremony, Mr. Bolsonaro also waded into the crowd of cadets and their families. The echo of Lula\u2019s rallies reminded me that Mr. Bolsonaro has become the politician of the moment, navigating Brazil\u2019s changed political landscape better than anyone. But Mr. Bolsonaro didn\u2019t quite have the Lula touch: The people wanted selfies; they weren\u2019t reaching for hugs. Mr. Bolsonaro has positioned himself as an anti-politician, even though he was a congressman for 27 years. He has managed to project an image as both a conservative leader who wants to bring back \u201cfamily values\u201d and a refreshing figure who is radically opposed to all that is politically correct (60 percent of his followers are young people).He emerged as a front-runner because a significant number of Brazilians \u2014 tired of violence, of the chaos of corrupt politics and of the inroads made by the progressive left \u2014 support his hard-line conservatism and maverick stances. He has an appealing formula for a troubled country: simple solutions to complex problems.Yet he\u2019s full of contradictions. He calls himself the only honest presidential candidate, but recent media reports suggest that he illegally used congressional funds for personal gain. He claims to be the country\u2019s best candidate to stabilize the market, but his track record is that of a statist. And while he is a right-wing politician, he is also known for having celebrated the election of the leftist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela. Like President Trump and other populists today, he has a formula for success based on harassing his adversaries. His incendiary language has left a mark on his followers: Many have said they will claim electoral fraud if he doesn\u2019t win the election. He creates chaos to present himself as its solution. In response to the problem of overcrowded prisons and escalating urban violence, he proposes arming the population to kill criminals. He has insinuated that whoever disagrees with him must be a criminal, too. His war of sound bites has distorted every attempt to engage in reasonable debate. Despite his disturbing declarations, his inefficiency in Congress and his failure to present an economic program, Mr. Bolsonaro is gaining in popularity. But what Brazil needs right now is to strengthen its democracy, not take a step backward. He is a symptom of the widespread discontent in Brazil \u2014 he is certainly not a solution.Ms. Pires is a political reporter and a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol.

He was helping pay Ms. Butina\u2019s bills, said a person familiar with their relationship, and hoped to make her the centerpiece of his own project to improve America\u2019s ties to Russia.In bringing charges against Ms. Butina, 29, last month, federal prosecutors described her activities as part of a campaign, supported by Russian intelligence, to use gun rights as a Trojan horse to make her way into conservative groups and advance Moscow\u2019s interests in the United States.While the charging documents focus on her alleged efforts to infiltrate the National Rifle Association, interviews with more than two dozen people in Russia and the United States show that her attempts at connecting with prominent American conservatives extended beyond making inroads with the gun-rights group. The interviews, along with previously unreported emails obtained by The New York Times, also reveal new details about her ties to the two older American men she relied on to make her way in the United States: Mr. Erickson, with whom she struck up a romance, and Mr. O\u2019Neill.Prosecutors allege that the relationships were nothing more than vehicles for her work on behalf of Russia, citing messages in which she told a Russian official all her activities would be \u201conly incognito! Right now everything has to be quiet and careful.\u201dYet for an alleged Russian agent funded by an oligarch, Ms. Butina hardly lived a life of fake identities, secret communications and hidden allegiances.Ms. Butina\u2019s defenders say she was an idealistic, if na\u00efve, activist, and contend that Russians\u2019 interactions with the N.R.A. were attempts at rapprochement that only appear sinister when viewed through an outdated Cold War lens.\u201cI\u2019m just amazed that in today\u2019s world, if you shake hands with a Russian, you must be an agent of the Kremlin,\u201d said David Keene, a former N.R.A. president, who met with Ms. Butina at conferences in Moscow and the United States.While saying he found \u201cnothing unusual\u201d about her, Mr. Keene suggested that there could have been more to Ms. Butina and her visits to the United States than was apparent. \u201cShe did say that they pressured her occasionally to get information when she went home, which I\u2019m sure was true,\u201d he said in a brief interview, but did not elaborate.\u201cThe government seems to be charging her with establishing relationships,\u201d he added. \u201cShe\u2019s pro-gun, fine. She\u2019s not making the N.R.A. more pro-gun. She\u2019s pro-U.S.-Russia relations \u2014 no surprise, she\u2019s Russian.\u201dThree government officials told The Times that Ms. Butina\u2019s arrest stemmed from a counterintelligence investigation predating the 2016 election that has focused on a Russian government official, Aleksandr P. Torshin, who worked closely with Ms. Butina for years. Mr. Torshin, a former senator close to Christian conservatives in Russia, has been attending N.R.A. conventions in the United States since 2011.In Ms. Butina, Mr. Torshin found someone adept at engaging with powerful conservatives. She snapped pictures with prominent Republicans, including Scott Walker and other former presidential candidates. She had Thanksgiving dinner last year at the country home of Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. She befriended Grover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader, winning an invitation to his weekly gathering of influential conservatives in Washington.She even managed to get a photo with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, whom she met at a 2016 dinner hosted by the N.R.A. in Louisville, Ky. Separately, she helped Mr. Torshin send a message to the Trump campaign proposing that Donald J. Trump meet President Putin (the campaign turned them down).\u201cIt was very clear that she was a networker and a bit of a name-dropper,\u201d said Ms. Eisenhower, who played down her own encounter with Ms. Butina. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person \u2014 and you see them in Washington and all over the place \u2014 people who have to get their picture taken with anybody of any moderate importance.\u201dBut it was Mr. Erickson and Mr. O\u2019Neill \u2014 referred to in the indictment of Ms. Butina as U.S. Persons 1 and 2 \u2014 whom she relied on most.Mr. O\u2019Neill, the Rockefeller heir, who is not accused of wrongdoing and who declined to comment for this article, met Ms. Butina at a convention for big-game hunters in Las Vegas. He has used his wealth to advocate a United States withdrawal from conflicts around the world and for better relations with Russia, as he explained to Ms. Butina in a letter in April 2016.\u201cI have no other agenda,\u201d he wrote.Ms. Butina\u2019s agenda, though, is now in question. Months later, in October 2016, she sent Mr. Torshin a direct message on Twitter, telling him that her work with Mr. O\u2019Neill was \u201ccurrently \u2018underground\u2019 both here and there.\u201dBut, she assured Mr. Torshin, \u201cWe made our bet. I am following our game.\u201dIt was a he-said, she-said scandal that divided a college campus. Ms. Butina claimed harassment by a male professor. He countered that she had offered sex for a passing grade.It happened in 2009 in the Siberian region of Altai where she grew up. The remote region was not an obvious launchpad for a young woman whose ambitions went beyond running her family\u2019s small furniture business.There, she learned to hunt with her father. In a speech years later, she referred vaguely to a childhood incident that made her feel threatened, and implied that having had a gun could have made a difference.In Russian blog posts, Ms. Butina expressed a resolve to overcome being seen as \u201can inferior girl\u201d in a male-dominated rural culture, and make a name for herself in politics.Her encounter with the college professor came after he claimed she had cheated on a test and offered to overlook the infraction if she had sex with him, according to her own writings and local news accounts. She said no and reported the professor to the administration, which fired him, only to rehire him after he sued for reinstatement. For his part, he asserted that Ms. Butina had offered sexual favors.She cited the episode on social media over the years, as evidence that women must empower themselves. Mostly, she expressed anger that many of her classmates took the professor\u2019s side.She had not been out of college long when she announced her intention to campaign for local office with Mr. Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party, prompting some commenters on her blog to accuse her of selling out her ideals. \u201cOf course, I have no illusions about the existing regime in the country and the ruling party,\u201d she responded, \u201cbut if I really want to change something for the better, then I have to try to do it in the only available version today \u2014 from within.\u201dGuns started out low on her platform, after taxes and jobs. But soon they would be all she talked about.By the end of 2011, Ms. Butina had formed an advocacy group, Right to Bear Arms, and was giving speeches and organizing demonstrations. At an event in Moscow, activists brought pots, pans and kitchen knives to show what little they had to defend themselves without guns.Mr. Torshin, 64, showed up with a horse whip. He and Ms. Butina struck up a friendship.In Russia, Mr. Torshin is powerful \u2014 the Treasury Department added him to a list of sanctioned officials in April \u2014 but not a member of Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. A Communist Party functionary in the late Soviet period, he later served as deputy speaker of the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament, and was appointed deputy governor of the Russian central bank in 2015. He has also been accused by the Spanish authorities of laundering money for the Russian mafia, charges he denies.In the senate, Mr. Torshin occasionally championed causes seen as eccentric, such as mandatory chemical castration for convicted pedophiles and legalizing handguns, a non-starter in a country that tightly restricts gun ownership. \u201cThe Kremlin looked at this as his personal exotica,\u201d said Aleksei V. Makarkin, a political analyst in Moscow.Ms. Butina became an unpaid assistant to Mr. Torshin, according to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Mr. Torshin would often bring a bouquet of white lilies to their morning meetings, and he liked to tell people that Ms. Butina shared a birthday with Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, inventor of the AK-47 rifle.Mr. Torshin\u2019s introduction to the N.R.A. came through an unlikely go-between, a Nashville lawyer named G. Kline Preston IV, a Russophile who dabbled in Russian commerce and law. Mr. Preston said he met Mr. Torshin through a Russian embassy official, whom he befriended after inviting the official to a Faberg\u00e9 egg exhibition in Nashville in 2007.Mr. Torshin eventually asked Mr. Preston to connect him with leaders of the N.R.A., although Mr. Preston was not a member. After cold-calling the group\u2019s headquarters, the lawyer finally arranged a meeting at a hotel restaurant between Mr. Torshin and Mr. Keene, then the N.R.A. president, during the group\u2019s national convention in Pittsburgh in April 2011.Later, Mr. Keene sent Mr. Torshin a handwritten note pledging support for his efforts and inviting him to the N.R.A.\u2019s next annual meeting. Mr. Torshin attended the next four.In November 2013, Mr. Keene came to Moscow to speak to Ms. Butina\u2019s fledgling gun-rights group. Joining him was Mr. Erickson, who served with Mr. Keene on the board of the American Conservative Union.Mr. Erickson, 56, had worked on losing campaigns for right-wing candidates including Pat Buchanan. He had also left a trail of fraud lawsuits accusing him of peddling worthless investments in oil fields and medical equipment. Concern about his track record prompted the A.C.U. to ask him to leave the board in 2014, said Matt Schlapp, the group\u2019s chairman.Ms. Butina contacted Mr. Erickson around March 2015, seeking advice on using her gun-rights advocacy to gain access to the Republican Party ahead of the 2016 election, prosecutors say.In an email to Mr. Erickson, Ms. Butina noted that the N.R.A.\u2019s deep pockets made it especially influential in American elections. Mr. Erickson replied with an offer to help arrange meetings with \u201cpotential American contacts\u201d and advised her to get financial backing for travel to the United States.She sent a proposal for $125,000 to cover travel to the United States to a Russian oligarch, Konstantin Y. Nikolayev, a transport magnate whose wife runs a Russian gun company that Ms. Butina visited with an N.R.A. delegation in 2015, according to a person familiar with the proposal. Mr. Nikolayev did not take up that deal, but funded some of Ms. Butina\u2019s travel in support of her gun-rights efforts, the person said. In a statement, Mr. Nikolayev said he had not provided any financial support since 2014.A month later, Ms. Butina was in South Dakota, speaking to college students in Mr. Erickson\u2019s hometown, Vermillion. She justified the need for gun rights in her country with two arguments often advanced by Russian officials: that Western sanctions had weakened Russia\u2019s economy, causing more crime, and that the Ukrainian war posed a threat.She would go on to join the N.R.A., attend at least three of its conventions and get to know board members and three former presidents.During their time together, Mr. Erickson and Ms. Butina began an intimate relationship, and he once referred to her as \u201cMiss Moscow\u201d in an email. The F.B.I. said she viewed the relationship as \u201csimply a necessary aspect of her activities,\u201d citing documents in which she \u201cexpressed disdain\u201d at having to live with Mr. Erickson. The investigators also alleged that she offered to have sex with someone else \u201cin exchange for a position with a special interest organization,\u201d though they did not say when or where the incident occurred.Mr. Driscoll, her lawyer, said at a court hearing last month, \u201cWe have no idea what the government is talking about.\u201dWith Mr. Erickson opening doors, Ms. Butina met with conservatives around Washington. Some of the sessions were organized by Mr. O\u2019Neill, who once compared America\u2019s national security establishment to the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the Soviet Union.In emails with Mr. O\u2019Neill in early 2016, according to federal prosecutors, Ms. Butina mentioned \u201cbuilding this communication channel\u201d for what she termed \u201cour Russian-American project.\u201dOther messages obtained by The Times suggest a familiarity between the two. \u201cAre you coming to Florida at the end of the week?\u201d he wrote on April 11, 2016. \u201cWe just acquired another big tractor, which you will have fun driving.\u201dIn an email with a reporter last year, Mr. O\u2019Neill said \u201cany clear-thinking person\u201d should understand the benefits of better relations with Russia. \u201cOne does not have to be a \u2018useful idiot\u2019 or a \u2018Putin stooge\u2019 to hold this view, nor does one have to approve of all of Russia\u2019s or Putin\u2019s actions, which can sometimes be problematic.\u201dWhen Mr. Trump emerged as the Republican front-runner, Ms. Butina and Mr. Torshin tapped their American contacts, hoping to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.In an interview, Mr. Clay said the proposal was relayed to him by a longtime friend, Johnny Yenason, of the Military Warriors Support Foundation, who had attended a Russian National Prayer Breakfast that year where Mr. Torshin spoke. Mr. Yenason could not be reached for comment.\u201cIt had everything to do with Christian values and putting two peoples together who had the same ideas,\u201d Mr. Clay said. \u201cAt least, we thought that they did at the time.\u201dThe meeting between Mr. Torshin and Mr. Trump never occurred. But that did not dampen Ms. Butina\u2019s enthusiasm for his candidacy.As the November 2016 election results came in, Ms. Butina excitedly posted a message about Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on a Russian social media site: \u201cA supporter of the rights to arms and the restoration of relations with Russia. Congratulate everyone!\u201dPrivately, according to court filings, she messaged Mr. Torshin, saying it was 3 a.m. and she was going to bed.\u201cI\u2019m ready for further orders,\u201d she said.A caption in an earlier version of this article misidentified a man pictured with Maria Butina and Donald Trump Jr. at a 2016 N.R.A. dinner.

{"Headline": "School Administrator \u2018Stunned\u2019 After Being Suspended Because She\u2019s Married to a Woman", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor 15 years, Shelly Fitzgerald has worked as a guidance counselor and administrator at Roncalli High School, a Catholic school in Indianapolis.Last week, it took a 17-minute meeting for school leaders to tell her that her job was at risk. The reason, she said, was that she is married to a woman.\u201cI was stunned,\u201d said Ms. Fitzgerald, 45, in an interview. \u201cThey showed me they had a copy of my marriage certificate, and let me know how it was going to play out.\u201dMs. Fitzgerald and her partner had been together for nearly 18 years when they decided to marry in 2015. They have a daughter who is now 12, and they have created a life together that included dinner parties and weddings with friends and alumni from Roncalli.But while their relationship was no secret, Ms. Fitzgerald said, it was also not openly discussed within the community at the school, whose 1,194 students attend grades nine through 12.\u201cI did not announce it,\u201d she said. \"I never came out one time to a single student and parent.\u201dMs. Fitzgerald said that last Thursday, she received an email from the school requesting a meeting. On Friday, she met with Chuck Weisenbach, the principal, and Joseph D. Hollowell, the superintendent, in a conference room.\u201cI had contacted Chuck to ask him, \u2018Should I be concerned?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe said they wanted to talk.\u201dAt the meeting, she was told that a parishioner at a local church had obtained a copy of her marriage certificate and given it to a priest, who had shared it with school leaders at Roncalli.Ms. Fitzgerald was given four options, she said: resign, dissolve her marriage, \u201ckeep quiet\u201d and work until her contract ended next July, or be fired.But by Sunday night, she had been placed on paid administrative leave. Her lawyer, David T. Page, said she has been barred from the campus.Instead, they emailed a joint statement, calling Catholic school teachers, counselors and administrators \u201cvital ministers\u201d in the church\u2019s mission, an expectation outlined in employment contracts.\u201cAs role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor and administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the Catholic Church,\u201d it said.It said the teachings include \u201cthe belief that all persons are called to respect human sexuality and its expression in the Sacrament of Marriage between a man and a woman as a sign of God\u2019s love and fidelity to His Church.\u201d\u201cWhen the expectations of a contract are not being met, the employee and the school will attempt to reach a resolution so that the contractual requirements are fulfilled,\u201d it said.As news spread of the action taken against Ms. Fitzgerald, groups of alumni and students protested on campus, posted supportive messages on social media and praised her to local news outlets.Madison Aldrich, a junior, said Roncalli\u2019s L.G.B.T. students needed to be reassured after the backlash against Ms. Fitzgerald, who had helped students with family losses, anxiety attacks and navigating social issues. Madison said she believes the archdiocese, not the school, was to blame for Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s suspension.In Indiana, no statewide law protects against discrimination based on sexual orientation, said Steve Sanders, an associate professor at Indiana University\u2019s Maurer School of Law.The city of Indianapolis has an ordinance that prohibits such discrimination, but it exempts religious institutions and their schools.\u201cIt is a patchwork,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Page, Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s lawyer, said he believed the archdiocese had begun taking a tougher stance on L.G.B.T. issues under Archbishop Charles C. Thompson, who was appointed in June 2017 by Pope Francis.He said their next step is to try to \u201copen a dialogue\u201d with the church and school to resolve the matter. But he added that they might pursue legal action, possibly by filing a Title VII discrimination claim in federal court.Supreme Court doctrine has held that the First Amendment prohibits the use of Title VII in cases where the employee\u2019s job involves religious functions, Mr. Sanders said, so the success of such a claim would hinge on the nature of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s actual job duties.\u201cIt is an interesting episode in the ongoing story of greater gay and lesbian acceptance in society,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cSo much of the tenor and coverage is very sympathetic to the teacher.\u201dMs. Fitzgerald said her school email account had been shut down.\u201cI love Roncalli. I have lots of love in my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a really trying time for me and my family. My heart is broken.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the year Ms. Fitzgerald married her partner. It was 2015, not 2014.Advertisement"}

In the six weeks the policy was in effect, more than 2,600 children were taken from their parents, with zero thought or planning for how the families might eventually be reunited. Complicating matters, the administration has decreed that reunifications must take place in the family\u2019s country of origin. Which means that, once contacted, parents face an excruciating choice: give up their children\u2019s asylum claims and have them returned home, or leave the children in the United States to try to navigate the asylum process on their own. No one knows what elements of the injunction, if any, the administration might decide to challenge.

{"Headline": "Our Deepest Condolences", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEAsMs. Adebayo is a novelist. Although most of us will never produce a rhetorical masterpiece that transcends the ordinary as Seneca\u2019s does, we nonetheless try in response to grief to find words, in the moments, months or even a lifetime after a tragedy, that express what we find inexplicable. In the end I couldn\u2019t give him the card, and I mouthed my words of consolation with little conviction. I felt like a fraud, confronting his agony with platitudes when it was clear that anything short of reversing time to return his father to life would prove inadequate. I regurgitated predictions about a future when some as-yet-undefined purpose would overtake the pain he now felt, repeating almost verbatim the hollowed-out assurances I\u2019d been hearing since my own father passed away.Like most who have sat with a bereft friend, relative or even stranger, I wanted to say something that could give solace. Yet what I knew reeked of despair: Grief was a wilderness with no signposts, a desert littered with mirages that made progress impossible to evaluate. I couldn\u2019t write that on a card; it felt more appropriate to pontificate about rainbows appearing at the end of storms. Besides, what I thought to be closer to the truth also felt inordinately personal: Since none of those who had commiserated with me had spoken about the utter bottomlessness of grief, perhaps I was the only one who had yet to see the rainbow, and nothing I\u2019d experienced could be of use to anyone. While much has changed about the world since Seneca\u2019s time, grief and the ways we deal with it, both individually and as communities, remains a vital part of our human experience, inextricably intertwined with the highs of love and affection. In some ways the beloved is also the bereaved-in-waiting, and just as in the course of our lives we wish people well as they graduate, marry or reach some other milestone, eventually we will find ourselves struggling to find the appropriate way to commiserate with loved ones when a member of our community achieves that final, inescapable one. Perhaps it is this well-intended effort to comfort the living that compels us to offer as consolation only hopeful anecdotes that glance off a tragedy, focusing instead on some point beyond it. Writing to Helvia, Seneca reminds her of distant and recent catastrophes, the death of her own mother while giving birth to her, the loss of her grandson and Seneca\u2019s own exile. \u201cI have kept away not one of your misfortunes from you,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut piled them all up in front of you. I have done this courageously for I decided to conquer your grief, not cheat it.\u201d His is an attempt to help his distraught mother find perspective through the adoption of the Stoic principles he lays out. While the idea that grief can be conquered is suspect, the unflinching acknowledgment of devastation that has already occurred, which he appears to view as an essential part of an attempt to conquer grief, remains worthy of consideration.It is understandable that we seek to protect the bereaved by responding with hope when they express despair, giving our assurances of light at the end of the tunnel and rainbows after the storm. Contrary to what Seneca believed, sometimes that very distraction is a necessary part of the process. However while there\u2019s no meteorological guarantee that those who survive a storm will sight a rainbow, they must at least deal with the reality of wet and slippery ground beneath their feet, and the labor of figuring out how to walk the path. Even if we don\u2019t agree with his principles, Seneca shows us in his consolation to Helvia that we can offer a hope that acknowledges the reality of despair. If, to paraphrase a quote attributed to Thomas Mann, a person\u2019s dying is more his family\u2019s affair than his own, the event is for most families cataclysmic and life-altering. Even in offering comfort, there is room to acknowledge that, and a willingness to contemplate this reality with the bereaved can itself be a consolation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pranked by Sacha Baron Cohen, He Was as Shocked as the Rest of Us", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDaniel Roberts was getting ready for bed on Sunday night at his home in Fort Mill, S.C. He had to be up early for his day job, as a truck driver for a construction company based out of Charlotte, N.C.He had no idea. He also had to dig deep to remember who Mr. Cohen was to begin with.Unbeknown to Mr. Roberts, he had taken part in one of the more embarrassing segments of the show thus far. In it, Mr. Cohen posed as Erran Morad, an Israeli antiterrorism expert who was pretending to offer on-camera training segments to help Americans fight Islamic terrorism.In the \u201cWho Is America?\u201d segment, which was filmed in Atlanta, Mr. Roberts told Mr. Cohen, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the culture that we can\u2019t talk about being around guns.\u201d To which Mr. Cohen \u2014 in character \u2014 responded, \u201cIt is crucial to have the guns in the school?\u201d Mr. Roberts said: \u201cYes, absolutely. I absolutely agree with you.\u201dThis was followed by Mr. Roberts\u2019s being coaxed into a shouting match (to ward off terrorists) and into throwing a baby doll into a trash can to thwart a suicide bomb hidden in a diaper. In the segment\u2019s highlight, or lowlight, Mr. Cohen gets Mr. Roberts to bite on a, um, toy used for sexual gratification by telling him that it is a proven tactic for stopping a terrorist.But he\u2019s also taken aim at lesser-known people, if they are known at all, including Mr. Roberts, who was one of the few who didn\u2019t realize he was duped until the episode aired.In a telephone interview on Monday, Mr. Roberts spoke about the experience. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Did you watch the show last night? Did you know this was going to happen?Did you know after the taping that something was off or that you had been pranked?No, absolutely not. There\u2019s going to be a limit to some things I can say because I am actively exploring what legal remedies may be available. (Showtime declined to comment.)How are you coping today? Have you received a lot of calls?Not yet. What can I do? It\u2019s up there. I can\u2019t deny it.When was the taping?Last July. I was contacted by a production company. The way it was explained to me is that there was a group of Israeli special forces soldiers that were going around the United States shooting a show for Israeli television about terrorism and how Americans defend themselves.I\u2019ve always had a great amount of respect for the Israeli military. For me, it sounded like a perfectly legitimate opportunity to take advantage of a situation to be taught by people that I would regard as some of the best in the world with counterterrorism.What was your initial reaction to finding out about the prank?I was absolutely baffled. To be honest about it, probably a couple months ago, I had the random thought, \u201cHey, I guess that show never aired,\u201d still under the impression that this was going to be something for Israeli television. I never thought anything more about it.When the shoot was happening, were you uncomfortable with any of it?There were definitely several moments of being extraordinarily uncomfortable. But at the same time, if you believe yourself to be in the presence of what anyone would rightly describe as experts in their field, and they are telling you that these are techniques or tactics that they themselves have used, and you\u2019re just a rank amateur, would you question it?I think some people might say, \u201cWell, there were cameras rolling.\u201d Did you worry about how you were being portrayed on camera?I don\u2019t know that it ever crossed my mind. The use of the \u2014 what\u2019s the polite way to describe this? \u2014 the use of the sexual device as a prop, in my mind, it made sense. Think about what they\u2019re claiming: a last resort. You have one chance to do something, or you\u2019re certain you\u2019re going to die. That\u2019s the scenario they\u2019ve laid out. I don\u2019t know many people, if they were completely honest, that they would say they wouldn\u2019t take that opportunity to maybe, hopefully, grab one thing to maybe save their lives.So using that item as a prop, sure, you could argue it makes sense because it\u2019s a pretty dangerous thing to do. You could hurt somebody doing it for real, which obviously is the point. It was definitely very uncomfortable. At the very same time, I go back to being completely convinced that these were legitimate I.D.F. special forces soldiers that had trained with these techniques or had actually used them.Had you ever been in training like that before?Not to that degree, absolutely not. But I know enough about the subject to know that sometimes, things are supposed to make you uncomfortable so that you get over being uncomfortable.Have your children seen this?No. If it ever comes up, I will give them the same exact explanation that I just gave to you. This was a malicious, willful and deliberate act on the part of Sacha Baron Cohen, the production company and Showtime, who blatantly lied to me about the purpose of the entire thing, in a deliberate effort to humiliate me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Push for 3-D Weapons by One of the World\u2019s \u2018Most Dangerous People\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 For Cody Wilson, this week had long been in the making. For more than five years, the professed gun-rights and free-speech advocate had sought to publish online his blueprints for a downloadable gun, but had repeatedly been blocked by the federal government.Until Tuesday evening, it looked like he finally would get his way. But hours before the schematics for a 3-D gun called the Liberator were expected to be posted \u2014 so-called for the single-shot handguns that the Allies designed as an insurgency weapon in World War II \u2014 a federal judge granted a temporary nationwide injunction blocking Mr. Wilson and his company, Defense Distributed.Earlier Tuesday, standing in the front room of Defense Distributed\u2019s office in Austin, Tex., Mr. Wilson fielded calls from reporters, conducted television interviews and was ready to celebrate.\u201cIt seems like I\u2019ve crystallized the terms of the debate according to how I wanted it,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, adding that his goal was to protect both the Second and the First amendments.\u201cI still believe in the rights to keep and bear arms, and I believe what I\u2019m doing is a way of protecting them,\u201d he said, while also affirming his adherence to free speech.In one room of the Defense Distributed office hung a framed yellow front page of a newspaper describing the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II. A model of the Liberator, the printer-made pistol, was on a bookshelf. A library in the back had thousands of volumes ranging from technical journals to the works of Shakespeare.No stranger to controversy, Mr. Wilson was listed by Wired magazine as one of the 15 Most Dangerous People in the World in 2012, the year he began Defense Distributed. Included on that list were former President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, both known for involvement in crimes against humanity. In 2017, Mr. Wilson created Hatreon, a crowdfunding site that has often been used by neo-Nazi groups that were kicked off more traditional peer-to-peer websites like Patreon and PayPal. Many of the organizers of a white supremacist rally last year in Charlottesville, Va., for instance, used Hatreon to raise money for the event.Mr. Wilson dismisses the idea that publishing gun blueprints is threatening or illegal.\u201cThe argument that I\u2019m making,\u201d he said, \u201calthough not always very well, is that what I\u2019m doing is actually a pretty mainline American idea.\u201dAsked about his political views, Mr. Wilson said he has voted only once in his life: for then-Representative Ron Paul in a state race in 2008.Born in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Wilson and his family moved to Cabot, Ark., when he was in the first grade. At Cabot High School, Mr. Wilson was elected student body president. He attended the University of Central Arkansas, where he majored in English, and studied abroad in China for a semester. After graduating in 2010, he went to law school at the University of Texas.In his second year there, Mr. Wilson began tinkering with a 3-D printer to design a functional gun. By 2013, he had created his company, Defense Distributed, and published online the blueprints for a gun that were downloaded more than 100,000 times. Dropping out of law school to pursue his new idea full-time, Mr. Wilson received a letter from the State Department in May 2013 ordering him to pull his files from the internet, citing arms export laws.While Mr. Wilson, 30, has described himself as a techno-libertarian, free-speech provocateur and online heretic, his critics have said he is a media hound and a peddler of \u201copen-source terrorism.\u201dCalled \u201cghost guns\u201d because they lack serial numbers and are made almost entirely of plastic, Mr. Wilson\u2019s blueprints would allow for the mass production of untraceable firearms that could be made at home, gun control advocates have warned, including by convicted felons, terrorists or other people currently prohibited from buying them.\u201cThe people who make them will be state actors or well-financed criminal cartels who have the ability to execute well-organized criminal attacks in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.Since starting his company, Mr. Wilson has faced pushback from all sides. YouTube has repeatedly pulled his promotional videos. Once it learned of his plans, Stratasys, the company from which he leased a 3-D printer, forced him to return it. Indiegogo canceled his crowdfunding campaign, forcing him to set up a Bitcoin account to receive donations. A company called Thingiverse, which publishes user-created design files, removed all of his designs.On Monday, attorneys general in eight states filed a joint federal lawsuit in Seattle to block Defense Distributed from publishing the files online.But Tuesday morning, things were looking up. With practiced calm, Mr. Wilson answered questions from reporters while also taking calls from his lawyers and monitoring judicial hearing updates.To him, Mr. Wilson explained, the fight over the publishing of his blueprints was less about guns than it was about renegotiating the relationship between citizens and the state.\u201cI think the state should be as weak as possible relative to the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proper posture of the state is one that at least is in fear of its citizen, not one that lords over it.\u201dWhen asked about the potentially dire consequences of his 3-D printed weapons, Mr. Wilson often responds with a philosophical view. \u201cUnderstanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated,\u201d he said to Popular Science in 2012, shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting.Mr. Wilson\u2019s Twitter handle is @Radomysisky, named after the Russian revolutionary and leader of the Communist International who was executed for trying to kill Stalin. Among his heroes, Mr. Wilson cites Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a Frenchman considered by many to be the \u201cfather of anarchism.\u201dMr. Wilson is also a fan of Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal who is a staunch libertarian and funder of causes such as paying young people not to go to college. Mr. Thiel invited Mr. Wilson to a private Wyoming retreat, where the two men discussed the future of Bitcoin. Mr. Wilson was inspired by the potential of Bitcoin, an encrypted, digital currency that forgoes more traditional routes and works person to person online.The cryptocurrency\u2019s potential, he said, is to disrupt the ability of governments to raise taxes. This was partly his motivation for starting Dark Wallet in 2014, a secure online means of storing currency. With Dark Wallet, Mr. Wilson hopes to simplify Bitcoin, which can be tech-intensive and difficult to use.Mr. Wilson has said that the goal of Defense Distributed is to promote decentralized solutions in an ever-centralizing world. In recent media appearances, he said that companies like Google, Facebook and YouTube have tried to exert more control over public discourse, particularly after racial unrest last summer in Charlottesville.\u201cThey can decide at will who isn\u2019t able to participate,\u201d he told Reason magazine in April, adding that he hates Silicon Valley almost as much as he hates Washington, D.C. In the push to democratize information, Mr. Wilson has said, 3-D printers will only become revolutionary tools when they are used not for useless things like trinkets or lawn gnomes, but medical devices, drugs or guns.Mr. Wilson said that the Allies\u2019 efforts to liberate Europe in World War II partly inspired the development of the 3-D printed firearm. Before the invasion, he said, they contemplated dropping guns behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory.\u201cInstead of dropping the gun on Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cwe dropped it on the internet.\u201dSusan C.

So far, the aftermath of the elections that gave Mr. Mnangagwa and the governing ZANU-PF party at least five more years in power has given little reason for celebration.Mr. Mnangagwa has pledged to investigate the violence, and it may be that he and his party did win roughly what the official vote count claimed. But victory was only one of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s goals in the elections. The other, potentially more important, was to offer free and fair elections as convincing proof to the international community that Zimbabwe was ready to start anew.That was a tough sell from the outset. Mr. Mnangagwa had been Mr. Mugabe\u2019s enforcer (hence his nickname, \u201cCrocodile\u201d) and lieutenant for decades and so shared responsibility for many of the disastrous and brutal policies that had decimated Zimbabwe\u2019s economy, despite its mineral riches and well-educated work force.Mr. Mnangagwa, ZANU-PF and the military have not yet struck out. They still benefit from the hope that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s fall turned the page for Zimbabwe, and the country can finally reclaim the stability and prosperity its natural resources and educated population should have.To keep what remains of that hope alive, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s successors must urgently lift the questions and doubts that the elections only intensified. If he is to have any credibility, President Mnangagwa must urgently rein in the military, condemn and halt the harassment of his opponents and make the election tabulations publicly available.Advertisement"}

Some among the crowd threw bottles and rocks at the police, and tensions grew as the night wore on.The protests came about 18 months after protesters staged the largest demonstration in Romania since the revolution that overthrew communism in 1989.In February 2017, a half-million people took to the streets to oppose an emergency decree that effectively decriminalized low-level corruption. Since then, the Social Democrat-led government has continued to push through legislation that critics believe will undo anticorruption steps taken after Romania joined the European Union in 2007.Antigovernment demonstrations have become a regular occurrence in Romania, but in recent months numbers have dropped significantly as fatigue has set it. Friday\u2019s protests were the largest in months.Previous demonstrations had passed with few incidents of violence. The use of tear gas by security forces stationed outside the main government building angered many in the crowd, and as the night wore on they refused to disperse.Shortly after 11 p.m., security forces began to forcibly clear the square of protesters.Klaus Iohannis, who holds the largely ceremonial post of president and has been an opposition leader in the past, denounced the violence in a statement on Facebook.\u201cI strongly condemn the brutal intervention of the gendarmerie, strongly disproportionate to the manifestations of most people in Piata Victoriei,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTrying to break people\u2019s will through a violent reaction of law enforcement is a reprehensible solution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As the conflict has dragged on, the rebels have also been accused of atrocities, but the United Nations body and human rights groups say it is the Saudi-led air war that has done the most to turn an already impoverished country into a humanitarian nightmare and an indiscriminate killing field.It was the bluntest critique of several that have been voiced by senior American officials. But words are not enough. It\u2019s time for the United States and its Western allies to stop selling arms or giving any military assistance to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners.The horror in Yemen has gone way past any discussion of who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, and it has become clear that only a negotiated peace agreement can bring the killings to an end. Saudi Arabia and its allies seem to have little compunction about slaughtering children as long as more bombs can be bought, so it\u2019s up to the enablers to call a halt.President Trump, alas, is not likely to lean on Saudi Arabia, but military officers have begun to speak out and Congress has begun to act.

Shouting \u201cblack dollars matter,\u201d the protesters said their immediate goal was to see the salon permanently closed. Many also said they wanted to raise attention about what they said was the mistreatment of black people in the community, specifically tensions between the black and Asian communities.It is unclear how the brawl started, but police arrested two people on Friday. Huiyue Zheng, 32, an employee, was charged with felony assault, and three misdemeanor charges of menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.

WASHINGTON \u2014 The world is turning its eyes toward Colombia as the new president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, takes office. Rights groups and peace activists are calling on the government to ensure that both the peace process and the country\u2019s social leaders are protected. But neither leader has called this for what it is: the systematic killings of political activists. Without an accurate diagnosis of the problem, we will remain paralyzed in bloodshed. Mr. Duque has to make peace \u2014 and safety for all Colombians \u2014 a priority for his government.Like many Colombians, I have lived most of my life amid cycles of armed conflict and attempts at peace. I grew up listening to stories of violence from my family and witnessing the myriad ways it devastated groups across the country. Those who are poorest and living in rural areas have always been among the most affected by the violence.One of the most inspiring parts of the peace process was to witness populations long silenced by decades of violence finally able to exercise their rights as citizens. But now, these very leaders who have been constructing peace from their territories are being targeted. But the execution of the peace accord is being threatened by a new iteration of the conflict, one that is targeting those brave enough to assert their political voices and lead the process of land restitution and social change. Insecure property rights exacerbate this competition for land and how it is used. The protection of these leaders \u2014 and the insignificant effort to bring their assassins to justice \u2014 is linked to the protection and recognition of their communities\u2019 rights. This includes not only the protection of their physical security, but also the legal recognition of the lands and resources they have relied on for their livelihoods.The outrage of government officials in response to these killings has been shockingly absent. After the murder of Bernardo Cuero Bravo \u2014 leader of the Association of Internally Displaced Afro-Colombians \u2014 officials downplayed the threats he was facing. But Mr. Cuero Bravo had requested protection from the government and was denied. All of us wanting peace welcome President Duque\u2019s commitments. But specific actions to protect rural communities are needed, as words alone will not stop the bullets. Fully implementing the peace process will repair the injustices and violence that indigenous, Afro-descendant and peasant populations have experienced in the past half-century, and before.Most important, all these groups must have their rights and livelihoods protected. For Colombia, the roots of a lasting peace are intertwined with the land.Omaira Bola\u00f1os is an anthropologist and the Latin America program director for the Rights and Resources Initiative.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.From the start of the Russia investigation, President Trump has been working to discredit the work and the integrity of the special counsel, Robert Mueller; praising men who are blatant grifters, cons and crooks; insisting that he\u2019s personally done nothing wrong; and reminding us that he hires only the best people. Let that sink in: Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyer has now accused him, under oath, of committing a felony.The conviction of Paul Manafort, who ran the Trump campaign for three months in 2016, was a win for prosecutors even though jurors were unable to reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts against him. On the other eight, which included bank fraud, tax fraud and a failure to report a foreign bank account, the jury agreed unanimously that Mr. Manafort was guilty. He is scheduled to go on trial in a separate case next month in Washington, D.C., on charges including money laundering, witness tampering, lying to authorities and failing to register as a foreign agent. Mr. Manafort faces many decades behind bars, although he will probably serve less than that under federal sentencing guidelines. But back to Tuesday\u2019s news. Mr. Manafort was not an original target of the inquiry by Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May of last year to look into possible ties between the Trump campaign and efforts by Russian government officials to interfere in the election. But Mr. Mueller\u2019s mandate authorized him to investigate any other crimes that arose in the course of his work. It didn\u2019t take long. As soon as he and his lawyers started sniffing around, the stench of Mr. Manafort\u2019s illegality was overpowering.He also enriched himself by working for some of the world\u2019s most notorious thugs and autocrats, including Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of Congo). He helped elect the pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych as president of Ukraine, a job that earned him millions until Mr. Yanukovych was ousted from power in 2014. Despite this mercenary history \u2014 or perhaps, more disturbingly, because of it \u2014 Donald Trump, while running on promises to clean up Washington, hired Mr. Manafort to run his presidential campaign, a job he may well have kept but for news reports that he was receiving and hiding millions of dollars from his work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych.What does it tell you about Mr. Trump that he would choose to lead his campaign someone like Mr. Manafort, whom even on Tuesday he called a \u201cgood man\u201d? It tells you that Mr. Trump is consistent, and consistently contemptuous of honesty and ethics, because he has surrounded himself with people of weak, if not criminal, character throughout his career. Also remember we still don\u2019t know anything about the ultimate fate of several other Trump associates who have been under Mr. Mueller\u2019s microscope, including Roger Stone, Carter Page and Donald Trump Jr. (\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer\u201d). For a witch hunt, Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has already bagged a remarkable number of witches. Only the best witches, you might say. Advertisement"}

Contributing Opinion Writer If anger were a volcano, and you let loose all the rage felt by people over the daily assaults on public land by the Trump administration, you\u2019d have an eruption with the fury of Mount St. Helens. A Green Wave is coming this November, the pent-up force of the most overlooked constituency in America. These independents, Teddy Roosevelt Republicans and Democrats on the sideline have been largely silent as the Trump administration has tried to destroy a century of bipartisan love of the land.That\u2019s more than mining, oil, gas and logging combined. And yet, the centerpiece of a clean and growing industry is under attack by a president with a robber baron view of the natural world. I write from the smoke-choked West, where the air quality in major cities has been worse than Beijing this month. While Trump spends his days comparing women to dogs, and tweets nonsense about rivers flowing to the sea, the biggest wildfire in California history blazes away. After the four warmest years ever recorded, scientists have now warned that the next five will be \u201canomalously warm.\u201d But Trump doesn\u2019t even understand time zones, let alone atmospheric upheaval.In the face of these life-altering changes, Trump is drafting rules to make it easier for major polluters to drive up the earth\u2019s temperature. While the orcas of Puget Sound are starving, Trump is trying to weaken the law that protects endangered species. And while lovers of the outdoors break visitation records at national parks and forests, Trump is removing land from protection.This is not green goo-goo or fantasy projection. You can see and feel the energy in places ignored by the national political press. \u201cIf D.C. comes for our public land, water or monuments again, they\u2019ll have to come through me,\u201d says Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat with an even chance of taking a longtime Republican seat in New Mexico, in an ad showing off her political chops. The revolt started after Trump shrunk several national monuments in the West last year \u2014 the largest rollback of public land protection in our history. The outdoor retailer Patagonia responded with a blank screen on its web page with the statement, \u201cThe President Stole Your Land.\u201d It was the first shot in a battle that has been raging all summer. At the big, boisterous outdoor industry\u2019s national trade show in Denver last month, retailers who sell to the 144 million Americans who participated in an outdoor activity last year, or the 344 million overall visitors to national parks, vowed to flex some muscle in the coming midterm elections.  \u201cWe hunt and fish,\u201d said Land Tawney, a Montanan who leads the fast-growing Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. \u201cAnd we vote public lands and water.\u201d You will see it in Minnesota, where the 140,000 people who work in outdoor recreation are furious at Trump\u2019s attempt to open a sulfide-ore copper mine near Boundary Waters Wilderness. You will see it in a half-dozen tossup congressional races in California, where the administration is mounting the biggest assault yet on public health, with its attack on emission rules.If it\u2019s self-interest powering the wave, such is the nature of politics. At a time of real peril for the things that most Americans love, the silent green majority has had enough. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marine Mammals Have Lost a Gene That Now They May Desperately Need", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterDolphins, manatees, sea lions, elephant seals and other animals no longer produce an enzyme that protects land mammals against harmful chemicals, including some pesticides. About 50 million years ago, dog-like mammals returned to the seas, eventually evolving into whales and dolphins. Around then, too, an early cousin of elephants took the plunge, giving rise to manatees and dugongs. About 20 million years later, bearlike mammals also waded back into the sea, evolving into seals, sea lions and walruses. Whales and dolphins have made the most radical adaptations, including blowholes, baleen and echolocation.But a study published on Thursday reveals a common bond: In all three groups of mammals, many species stopped making the same enzyme. Now that loss may come back to haunt them. \u201cIt\u2019s too important not to pay attention to,\u201d said Nathan L. Clark, a co-author of the new study and an evolutionary biologist at the University of Pittsburgh. Charles Darwin was the first to recognize that marine mammals evolved from ancestors on land. The clues were in their anatomy: Seal flippers are just modified feet. The whale\u2019s blowhole is a nose that has migrated. More recently, the DNA of marine mammals has revealed more details about their adaptations. Some genes evolved to do new things, but others simply stopped working, scientists have found. Dr. Clark and his colleagues recently developed a new way to search for these genes and looked for those more likely to be broken in marine mammals than in terrestrial ones. The scientists ended up with a short list of genes that were repeatedly shut down in marine mammals. Most were involved in smelling, which supported earlier studies showing that marine mammals have little or no sense of smell. But at the top of the list was a gene that had nothing to do with smell, called PON1. Wynn K. Meyer, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and co-author of the new study, said she was taken aback when she found out what the gene is best known for: a defense against some toxic chemicals.These chemicals are called organophosphates, a class of compounds that includes certain pesticides as well as nerve agents like sarin gas. PON1 encodes an enzyme called paraoxonase that can quickly break down organophosphates. Mice genetically engineered without paraoxonase die quickly when they\u2019re exposed to the chemicals. Dr. Meyer and her colleagues found that all marine mammals have broken copies of the PON1 gene, with a few exceptions: walruses, fur seals and spotted seals. To see if the gene were truly kaput, the researchers gathered blood plasma from a range of mammal species. They then added pesticides to the plasma. The plasma from land mammals quickly broke down the chemicals. But plasma from dolphins, manatees, sea lions and elephant seals failed to clear the pesticides.Mammals didn\u2019t evolve the paraoxonase enzyme to fight the pesticides humans have invented over the past century. After all, the animals have had the adaptation for millions of years.But paraoxonase breaks down other harmful molecules that our own bodies naturally produce. These oxygen-bearing molecules can damage our cells, causing a variety of problems like a buildup of plaque on the walls of blood vessels. People who make low levels of paraoxonase run a greater risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease.So why did marine mammals lose such an important gene? One possibility is that their bodies abandoned paraoxonase when they started taking long dives. In preparation, the animals suck in tremendous amounts of oxygen, which may create a lot of damaging oxygen-bearing molecules. Marine mammals may have evolved a new, more powerful way to defend against oxygen-bearing molecules, making PON1 unnecessary, Dr. Meyer and her colleagues speculated.They are carrying out more research to pin down the reason, and they\u2019re also investigating what this legacy means today with the introduction of organophosphates as pesticides.In Florida, for example, manatees swim up canals that run straight through farmland. Bottlenose dolphins spend a lot of time in bays where farm runoff ends up.Marine mammals may be slowly accumulating the pesticides in their bodies. Or exposure may take the form of a sudden influx if a hard rain comes down right after farmers spray their fields. Dr. Clark and his colleagues plan to examine manatees and dolphins for a buildup of organophosphates with a test now given to farm workers.\u201cI don\u2019t have any foregone conclusions,\u201d said Dr. Clark. \u201cI just want to get some answers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Between Sound and Silence", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsFor a generation of people with cochlear implants, technology is transforming the experience of deafness.Ms. Taylor Brodsky is an independent filmmaker and the parent of a deaf child.A lot can happen in two generations. I was born to deaf parents and now I\u2019m the mother of a deaf son. He was sitting on my lap in diapers when the audiologist first detected he couldn\u2019t hear everything. By the age of 4, he heard nothing.I grew up in the 1970s around lots of deaf people. In deaf time, it was the prehistoric era, before modern TTYs (teletypewriters) were common, and before the Americans With Disabilities Act and smartphones even existed. Scientists and surgeons were working on a device to improve hearing. The hope was that the device, called a cochlear implant, might eventually enable even profoundly deaf people to understand speech and to articulate a typical human voice.Around that time, I was in Nepal, documenting the lives of deaf people and learning their signed languages. I saw no assistive communication devices, and as in many impoverished countries, discrimination against deaf people was rampant. Deaf children couldn\u2019t get a basic education. No one was complaining about the opportunity to hear better there. Whether to get a cochlear implant was, and still is, a first-world debate.As a daughter and a filmmaker, I felt certain that technology was making things easier for deaf people. But now, as a mother, I mostly felt anguish. All the decisions involving the raising of a deaf kid in the 21st century really came down to one: Do his father and I ask surgeons to drill into my son\u2019s head and thread an electrode array into his cochlea, all for the sake of sound? We weren\u2019t asking political questions. We were asking human ones.\u201cImplant him early in life,\u201d one of our son\u2019s doctors, Jane Madell, advised us, \u201cand I promise, the brain will do the rest.\u201d A renowned pediatric audiologist, Dr. Madell was researching the same questions I had: How does augmenting a sense fundamentally shift the human experience, particularly in deaf kids?Our search for the answers became this film. We interviewed 14 of Dr. Madell\u2019s former patients, those young enough to be born after cochlear implantation was viable yet old enough to have insight into the experience. They had navigated the frontiers of deafness, disability and the human experience. They spoke to us about identity, sexual intimacy and coming of age somewhere between sound and silence.Advertisement"}

Hospital officials said he had no injuries requiring hospitalization.Mr. Alam was among the journalists beaten by the youth league members, according to his own account supported by video of the attacks posted online. After narrowly escaping them on Sunday, he took refuge in a guesthouse and went on Facebook Live to recount what had happened.A short time later, he was interviewed on Al Jazeera television by Skype and repeated his criticisms. Within hours, the police arrested him at his home, seizing any closed-circuit camera footage from his home and disabling the cameras.\u201cThe press is free, but sometimes journalists are victimized, but it\u2019s not part of the government plan,\u201d he said.Mr. Inu said that he did not believe Mr. Alam\u2019s allegations of torture, but that any police officer proved to have done so would be punished.Mr. Alam started the Pathshala South Asian Media Institute \u2014 a school for photographers \u2014 as well as a Dhaka photo festival.

Arguing at a hearing on Mr. Alam\u2019s detention on Tuesday, a government prosecutor said that police who were questioning Mr. Alam had asked him how long he planned to keep criticizing the government.\u201cUntil the government falls,\u201d the prosecutor quoted him as saying.The demonstrations paralyzed Dhaka, the capital city of 19 million, and the police began fighting back with rubber bullets. The protests later widened as university students joined them, but then petered out as teachers said the government had ordered them to report student absences.Calling for better enforcement of traffic laws, the protesters have stopped cars, including those of prominent officials, and demanded to see driver\u2019s licenses and other documents.At Mr. Alam\u2019s Dhaka gallery and photo agency, Drik, the manager and curator, Rezaur Rahman, said support had poured in from around the world.\u201cThis is very shocking,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cHe did look better today.

The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added.Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google\u2019s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available.Google\u2019s work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership.Amnesty International said it would be a \u201cdark day for internet freedom\u201d and would constitute \u201ca gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom\u201d if the tech giant accepted China\u2019s censorship terms.One internal posting that was viewed by The New York Times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so, opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company. Some employees said the work was a violation of Google\u2019s previous statements about its stance on Chinese censorship, as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights.\u201cWe provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,\u201d said Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman. \u201cBut we don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201dIn the years since Google\u2019s exit, local competitors have risen up, including China\u2019s dominant search engine, Baidu. Beyond search, the vast majority of Google\u2019s services, including its app store, email service and YouTube, remain inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country\u2019s system of internet controls is known.Talks between Google and the Chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the United States and China, one of the people said. The talks were not going well, this person added.But the Chinese government could nonetheless use Google as a chip in its negotiations with the American government, which has been critical of the way China limits market access for United States technology companies. By letting Google\u2019s search engine back into China, the Chinese government could give President Trump a political victory, earning some good will.For Google, China is an increasingly difficult market to navigate. The Chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since President Xi Jinping came into power five years ago. Companies need a great deal of resources to meet the censorship demands imposed by the government, and failing to do so can be serious. In the first half of 2018, China\u2019s national internet regulator shut down or revoked the license of more than 3,000 websites.Google is a household brand in much of the world, but its name may draw blank stares from China\u2019s younger generation who are growing up in the post-Google Chinese internet. Winning these people will be an uphill battle for Google, especially if it cannot differentiate itself much from Baidu.Others questioned whether a heavily censored Google might be useful.\u201cWe welcome a normal Google but not a neutered Google,\u201d said Liu Xingliang, head of research at the Beijing-based analytics firm Data Center of the China Internet. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a second Baidu.\u201dLi Yuan reported from Hong Kong, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.

The officer, who is also black, was off duty and working a security detail for the Kroger grocery store where the incident happened, Mr. Pastor said.\u201cAs a father, I could never imagine a scenario where it is acceptable to Tase an 11-year-old child,\u201d he said. \u201cEver.

He also asked for a \u201ccomprehensive look at all of the Tasing episodes involving minor children\u201d over the last two years and a \u201ccomplete review of all Tasing policies.\u201dDuring the episode on Monday, the 11-year-old girl was accompanied by several young women who were all \u201callegedly stealing items from the store,\u201d a spokesman for the Cincinnati police said in a statement.A police report identified the officer as Kevin D. Brown, 55. He has been placed on desk duty, Mr. Smitherman said.When the officer approached one of the girls, she continued to walk away, \u201cignoring several commands to stop,\u201d the statement said. At that point, the officer shot the 11-year-old in the back with his stun gun, the police said. She was taken to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and later released.

Each police department is responsible for coming up with its own policy, she said.Mr. Smitherman said he was not aware of any other Tasing incidents in Cincinnati involving children, and called this case an \u201coutlier.\u201dWhen asked if race might have played a role in the Tasering at Kroger on Monday, Mr. Smitherman noted that both the officer and the girl were black, adding, \u201cI can give you a dissertation on that, but it probably wouldn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201dReaction to the news was swift in Cincinnati and on social media.\u201cNo one concerned about why an 11 year old is stealing food?\u201d one woman wrote on Facebook. \u201cJust concerned about appropriate punishment.\u201dAnother wrote: \u201cI am generally a supporter of the police.

{"Headline": "3 Morgons to Drink Right Now", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolOf the many exciting developments in American wine, one of the most interesting for me is the arrival of good gamays, primarily in Oregon and California.It would be wonderful to survey some of these wines, but sadly there simply are not enough to go around. I have gamay on the brain, though, and as it is the grape of Beaujolais, I thought it would be interesting to take an in-depth look at Morgon, one of the best and most widely available of the best Beaujolais areas, or crus.Beaujolais has a modest hierarchy for ranking the potential quality of its wines. At the base is plain Beaujolais, which can come from anywhere in the region. One step up is Beaujolais-Villages, from areas with theoretically more potential. And at the top are 10 villages thought to offer distinctive enough terroirs to warrant using their names as appellations.In addition to Morgon, they include Brouilly, Ch\u00e9nas, Chiroubles, C\u00f4te de Brouilly, Fleurie, Juli\u00e9nas, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, R\u00e9gni\u00e9 and St.-Amour. We could have examined any of them, but Morgon seems to have more producers distributed more widely than the others.I would like to focus on the 2016 vintage, which is considered a classically styled year. The 2016s are not as ripe and powerful, for example, as the 2015s, and more approachable. At the same time, Beaujolais suffered hail damage in 2016, so if you can\u2019t find these Morgons, better by all means to get another year than to sit it out.Here are the three bottles I recommend:If you can\u2019t find these precise bottles, you should have many other options. Mr. Foillard makes other Morgon cuv\u00e9es, as does Mr. Brun. Other names to look for include Jean-Marc Burgaud, Guy Breton, Damien Coquelet, Daniel Bouland, Domaine Ruet, Georges Descombes, Julien Sunier, Louis-Claude Desvignes, Jean-Paul Thevenet and Antoine Sunier. And I\u2019m sure you can find more.While Beaujolais has a reputation for easygoing, jolly wines, these bottles deserve care and attention. The wines should be served cool (but not cold), and in generous glasses, if available, so they can breathe and evolve. But if all you have are juice glasses, they will not kill the wine.Beaujolais is thought to be versatile with food. My advice: Think of classic bistro dishes \u2014 roast chicken, hanger steak and the like. Straightforward flavors will go well with these wines. Then again, if you are the adventurous sort, explore away.Advertisement"}

Greenberg, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said in a statement.According to court records, Mr. Symonds messaged the girls on Facebook, asking them repeatedly if they belonged to him and requesting that they send him nude photos of themselves. When the girls sent him partly nude photos, he responded, \u201cNo clothes, my God,\u201d urging them to strip further. Mr. Symonds also sent the girls seminude photos of themselves from past visits, including one showing him and one of the girls lying down together, both partly clothed, according to the court documents.Some of the most revealing messages were not sent to the girls but instead to a person who appeared to be a worried male friend of his in the Dominican Republic, whose initials are A.R. Facebook messages between the men were confiscated by the authorities. Following is a partial text of them, translated from Spanish:Mr. Symonds went on to tell A.R. that it was O.K. that the girl was 13 because he was friends with police officers and her family. His friend informed him that everyone was saying Mr. Symonds was the 13-year-old girl\u2019s first sexual encounter. Mr. Symonds responded that her mother knew about their relationship and that everything was O.K. His friend continued to warn him to be careful.At one point, the 15-year-old girl asked Mr. Symonds if they could use protection when they met up and Mr. Symonds questioned her, telling her he did not want any problems with his penis.Mr. Symonds later acknowledged to the authorities that he had a relationship with the girls, saying that he knew they were underage but that he never had sexual contact with them.Anthony Natale, a lawyer for Mr. Symonds, did not respond to an email message or return a phone call seeking comment. The authorities said that Mr. Symonds traveled frequently to the Dominican Republic, but it is not clear where he lives in the United States.The Dominican authorities apprehended him in March 2017 and alerted the United States government, which started its investigation.Mr. Symonds told the American authorities that had he known what he did in the Dominican Republic would subject him to punishment in the United States, he would not have returned.Advertisement"}

But the beachgoers are holding not surfboards, but wooden coffins.The ad offers a \u201cone-way\u201d trip with \u201croasting temperatures\u201d for 1,195 pounds, or about $1,570. But this is for cremation, not vacation.It is the work of a company called Beyond, which offers funeral price comparisons. It says it deliberately made the edgy ads in an effort to start a national conversation about death and burial costs.But when it comes to the business of burying or cremating people, the company learned, it can push the envelope only so far.Transport for London, which runs and regulates transport in the British capital, rejected the ads, citing concerns that they would cause \u201cserious and widespread offense.\u201d The regulator, known as TfL, said that it did not actually see the four ads for Beyond, but was advised by a partner that they were likely to cause offense.\u201cAll advertising campaigns running on the TfL estate need to comply with both TfL\u2019s and wider national advertising policies,\u201d the authority said in a statement.But Beyond, which says it wants to break taboos about death, continues to push its advertising campaign online and around the city.\u201cIn the U.K. we are not comfortable talking about or engaging with death, and it\u2019s not healthy, and something we want to meet head on,\u201d said Ian Strang, the company\u2019s co-founder.\u201cOur reluctance to talk about death is the reason funeral costs continue to spiral and why you pay far too much for writing a will or settling an estate,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we seek to change.\u201dCremations cost, on average, \u00a33,311, while burials run \u00a34,257, according to the Royal London National Funeral Cost Index Report 2017.Mr. Strang noted that the ads were appearing as Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority is investigating funeral costs and trying to bring transparency to the industry.\u201cThis is a recognition that it has never been more important to be engaging in conversation about death, not shutting it down,\u201d he added.One ad proposed for the London Underground looks like something that would sell flu medicine: \u201cHeadaches? Aches and pains? Sore throat?\u201d it asks. \u201cBetter write your will then,\u201d it says, with an image of a box of pills.Beyond has revised those ads for the Tube.

Many see it as a symbol of the South\u2019s heroism, a way to celebrate the bravery of their ancestors.However, this viewpoint did nothing to convince me that the monuments should stay. While pro-Confederates may hail the statues as a testament of the South\u2019s bravery, this is purposefully ignoring the uglier side of history. The side of history in which slavery was commonplace, glorified, and defended ferociously.The fact that Confederate flags are waved at white supremacist gatherings is a clear representation of what it symbolizes to the American people: racism. The Confederacy is a symbol of hate; it is the embodiment and blatant promotion of discrimination.With politics polarizing the nation, it is increasingly important to strive for unity. This can not be achieved by promoting a symbol of violence and oppression. We must stop touting a past where inequality was rampant, and instead build a future that everyone can celebrate._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big ideasMr. Ai is an artist based in Berlin.Many of the problems in the world today, when one reflects upon them, call for an answer to an ancient question: What is it to be human?There is no such thing as a human being in the abstract. Only when we see people as embedded in their experiences \u2014 their own social positions, their educations and memories, in pursuit of their own ideals \u2014 can the question \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d fully make sense. Everyone seems to agree that we live today in a completely distinctive time. We may use different labels for it \u2014 the era of globalization, of the internet, of late capitalism, of the collapse of Cold War ideology \u2014 but all such terms seek to describe the world\u2019s new situation. The most striking feature of that situation is that we are much freer than ever before in our access to information, knowledge and the assistance of technology. At the same time, the forces that tend to constrict our personal freedoms \u2014 states, religions, ethnic identities, economic interest groups and others \u2014 are both dissolving and reorganizing. Some are dying while others are growing extraordinarily strong. Such changes can be mind-boggling. They can make it hard to remember where home is, to recognize language and customs that we once took for granted and to figure out where we now belong. The question \u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d or \u201cWhat does it mean to be human?\u201d gets an entirely new face. The answers today will have to be different from the answers of the past. Simply to avoid the question is a terrible mistake. We must ask it, and we must do so repeatedly. The debates and judgments that led to human wisdom in the past were responses, each in its time, to essentially the same question, asked in the political and social context of that time, and it is relevant at every social level: individual, community, family and nation. Many of the political and cultural disagreements that we see in the world today arise from a reluctance to face this key question squarely, and to arrive at clear definitions with regard to it. Everything hangs on how we define ourselves and how we treat those with whom we share our surroundings, which are teeming with different ethnicities, religions and cultures. We are doomed if we lose independent thinking, lose the ability to freely evaluate and define ourselves. In my view, self-definition must be each individual\u2019s final and most sturdy principle. It is the iron undergirding of morality, aesthetics and practical philosophy. If it slips away, even for a moment, then the answer to the question \u201cWhat does it mean to be human?\u201d will be: \u201cNothing.\u201d Ai Weiwei is an artist based in Berlin.Advertisement"}

Your subway station is closed for repairs. Your grocery bags are too heavy to carry home.You pull out your phone, and within minutes, an Uber driver comes to the rescue.Uber and other ride-hail apps have become a vital tool for many New Yorkers, alongside their MetroCards.Now, as New York City considers capping most for-hire vehicles for a year, Uber has a message for its customers: Your trip could get more expensive, and you might have to wait longer for a ride.Many New Yorkers came to Uber\u2019s defense. Connor Duffy, who lives in Brooklyn, said: \u201cUber and Lyft are really convenient in the boroughs! Enforcing minimum wages or other driver-protection measures would be better than capping service.\u201d\u201cI feel that it would be better to deploy this political capital elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Horner said of the cap, \u201cwhile continuing to pressure the State Legislature to enact congestion pricing next session.\u201dCity Council members say the regulations are needed to halt an influx of vehicles clogging streets and to raise driver wages.

{"Headline": "Oh, the Humanities!", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew data on college majors confirms an old trend. Technocracy is crushing the life out of humanism.Opinion ColumnistThese two factions, Auden suggested, could ideally coexist: The Apollonian genius is for government and rule, and \u201cthe earth would soon, did Hermes run it,/Be like the Balkans.\u201d But the Apollonian spirit, ever ambitious, cannot bear to leave the humanists to their poems and ideas and arguments, and so it seeks to expand its empire outward:But jealous of our god of dreams,His common-sense in secret schemesTo rule the heart;Unable to invent the lyre, Creates with simulated fire Official art. And when he occupies a college, Truth is replaced by Useful Knowledge;He pays particular Attention to Commercial Thought,Public Relations, Hygiene, Sport,In his curricula.During his visit, Auden met James Conant, then the president of Harvard and a man associated with the Apollonian transformation of the modern university, its remaking as a scientific-technical powerhouse with its old religious and humanistic purposes hollowed out. \u201c \u2018This is the real enemy,\u2019 I thought to myself,\u201d Auden wrote of the encounter. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he had the same impression about me.\u201dJacobs also depicts their attempt as a failure, because in the end neither a Christian humanism nor any other has been able to withstand the spirit of Conant, the spirit of technocratic ambition, the spirit of truth-replaced-by-useful-knowledge, that rules today not just in Washington and Silicon Valley but in much of academia as well. The analyst is a historian named Ben Schmidt, who just five years ago wrote an essay arguing that the decline of the humanities was overstated, that enrollment in humanistic majors had declined in the 1970s, mostly as women\u2019s employment opportunities began switching to more pre-professional tracks, but that since then there has been a basic stability, at best a soft declension.But now he\u2019s revised his argument, because the years since the Great Recession have been \u201cbrutal for almost every major in the humanities.\u201d They\u2019ve also been bad for \u201csocial science fields that most closely resemble humanistic ones \u2014 sociology, anthropology, international relations and political science.\u201d Meanwhile the sciences and engineering have gained at the expense of humanism, and with them sports management and exercise studies \u2014 the \u201chygiene\u201d and \u201csport,\u201d if you will, from Auden\u2019s list of Apollonian concerns.Notably this trend is sharper among elite liberal arts colleges, the top thirty in the US News and World Report rankings, where in the early 2000s the humanities still attracted about a third of all students, but lately only get about a fifth. So it\u2019s not just a matter of the post-Great Recession middle class seeking more practical degrees to make sure their student loans get repaid quickly; the slice of the American elite that\u2019s privileged enough and intellectually-minded enough to choose Swarthmore or Haverford or Amherst over a state school or a research university is abandoning Hermes for Apollo at the fastest clip.Even this acceleration is no doubt partially driven by economic concerns: Elite college grads are by no means immune to feelings of precarity. But as with another, more literally humanistic pursuit \u2014 childbearing \u2014 that had seemed to stabilize after a post-1960s collapse but now is in decline again, the absence of a post-Great Recession bounce-back for the humanities suggests that the economic calamity of 2008 was a precondition but not the only cause, and that other cultural shifts had left the humanities ripe for another era of collapse.In explaining those shifts many conservatives blame the humanists themselves, for being politicized and marching lock step to the left and for pursuing postmodernist obscurantism in their scholarship and prose. But I think it\u2019s more useful to step back a bit and recognize both politicization and postmodern jargon as attempted solutions to a pre-existing problem, not the taproot of the crisis.That problem is the one that Auden identified seventy years ago: In an Apollonian culture, eager for \u201cUseful Knowledge\u201d and technical mastery and increasingly indifferent to memory and allergic to tradition, the poet and the novelist and the theologian struggle to find an official justification for their arts. And both the turn toward radical politics and the turn toward high theory are attempts by humanists in the academy to supply that justification \u2014 to rebrand the humanities as the seat of social justice and a font of political reform, or to assume a pseudoscientific mantle that lets academics claim to be interrogating literature with the rigor and precision of a lab tech doing dissection.At the moment both efforts look like failed attempts. But is there an alternative? Here I would dissent a little from the sternness of Jacobs\u2019s pessimism, since I think the Christian humanists that he describes \u2014 and their secular and Jewish counterparts \u2014 had a little more short-run success than he suggests. There was real growth in humanities majors beginning in the 1950s (stronger among women than men, but present among both), and that indicator corresponded to a genuine mass interest, mediated by journalists and popularizers as well as academia, in pursuits that now seem esoteric and strictly elitist \u2014 poetry and public theology, classical music and abstract impressionism, the Great American novel and the high theory of French cinema and more.Second, there was the example of a rival civilization, totalitarian Communism, in which the Apollonian model had been pushed to its materialist-utopian conclusion and discovered only a ruthless, inhuman dead end. And third, forged in response to the Communist threat, there was a sense of Western identity, Western historical tradition, that could be glib and propagandistic in a from-Plato-to-NATO style, but at its best let people escape the worst of late modern afflictions, the crippling chauvinism of the now.This precise combination is not recoverable: Communism is dead (I think), the religious landscape of the 1950s is even deader, and the humanistic history of midcentury was Eurocentric in a way that a more globalized and multiracial society could neither embrace nor sustain.But a hopeful road map to humanism\u2019s recovery might include variations on those older themes. First, a return of serious academic interest in the possible (I would say likely) truth of religious claims. Second, a regained sense of history as a repository of wisdom and example rather than just a litany of crimes and wrongthink. Finally, a cultural recoil from the tyranny of the digital and the virtual and the Very Online, today\u2019s version of the technocratic, technological, potentially totalitarian Machine that Jacobs\u2019s Christian humanists opposed.Imagine \u201csocial media\u201d where \u201cadvertising\u201d sits in the stanza and imagine an intellectual climate where the last piece of advice doesn\u2019t seem like a contradiction in terms, and you\u2019ve imagined the beginnings of humanism\u2019s revival. May we live to see the day.Advertisement"}

How do we disagree with our neighbors about guns?The shop\u2019s name stems from a term of derision for the teetotaling, lecture-friendly Congregationalists who settled the town in the 1850s. Those days are long over. Grinnellians now tend to keep any impulse to hector one of their neighbors under wraps.Pete Brownell, a well-known and well-liked local philanthropist, sometimes stops by Saints Rest for coffee on his way to work. He and his wife, Helen Redmond, have supported many projects in town, including a public library renovation and a residency program run by a local artists\u2019 collective. He is also the third-generation C.E.O. of Brownells, a major firearms company whose headquarters are here, which calls itself the country\u2019s \u201cleading supplier of firearm accessories, gun parts, and gunsmithing tools.\u201d Brownells sells and manufactures guns and ammunition. For much of the last year, Mr. Brownell also served as chairman of the board of the National Rifle Association.Grinnell is both progressive bastion and gun town, a place urbane and rural. It is home to an influential liberal arts college with an endowment of more than $1 billion, and also a Monsanto plant. Usually, these juxtapositions are a point of pride, if they are noteworthy at all.The first thing most everyone says is that the Brownells are good, generous people. Their children all go to school together. Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond care very much about making Grinnell a good place to live for everyone. The second thing people say is that they want to protect the family\u2019s privacy. Mr. Brownell\u2019s family did not choose his occupation, people point out. Besides, Ms. Redmond, who is president of the board of the Grinnell-Newburg Community School District, votes Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She has donated to the progressive state-level political action committee her neighbors created last year. Everyone is clear that Pete Brownell\u2019s politics are his own.And while Ms. Abrahamson quietly resigned from the board of a community arts center when she realized that the group has accepted money from the Brownells, she did not say so at the time. Then, in 2016, Brownells opened a massive new warehouse, office and retail complex on the outskirts of town. It looms over Interstate 80. In May 2017, Mr. Brownell became the president of the N.R.A.\u2019s board. \u201cEach of these things were pushing people toward discomfort,\u201d Mr. Dobe said. \u201cLas Vegas broke it open.\u201dThis disquiet eventually bubbled up online. \u201cIt was clear that people had been holding back their feelings,\u201d said Eliza Willis, a professor of political science at Grinnell. A local Facebook group gave them the space to express their feelings. \u201cAll these people came out of the community making comments and expressing unhappiness about the facility and about his election to the presidency of the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Willis said.Others expressed their disagreement and their concern for the Brownell family\u2019s privacy. \u201cIt got quite active and a little heated,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a unified feeling about this.\u201dThe fracas also underscored the fact that no one seemed to have talked to Mr. Brownell about any of it directly. A day or two after the Las Vegas shooting, Ms. Abrahamson said, she phoned his office to invite him to meet with her and another pastor, Cameron Barr, to discuss ways they might \u201cwork together to increase gun safety.\u201d She said that her overture, which she repeated in a Facebook message, received no response.A week later, other members of the Grinnellians for Change Facebook group sent a letter asking for Mr. Brownell\u2019s attention. It was signed by 170 people and published in the Grinnell Herald-Register. The group wrote: \u201cNowhere are mutuality and reciprocity more important than in a small town such as ours.\u201d Mr. Dobe characterized their message this way: \u201cNow that you\u2019re the president of the N.R.A., we think you kind of owe us a conversation.\u201dAgain, Mr. Brownell did not answer. \u201cPete Brownell did not respond as a neighbor,\u201d said Kesho Scott, an associate professor of sociology and American studies at Grinnell. Ms. Scott\u2019s and Mr. Brownell\u2019s daughters are friends and sleep over at each other\u2019s houses. The parents see each other at the bank. \u201cAll of a sudden he wasn\u2019t responding to his neighbors,\u201d Ms. Scott said. Friends of the Brownells, including the Grinnell city manager, Russ Behrens, say that neighborliness is a two-way street. Members of his family had seen the Facebook group\u2019s angry, frustrated posts and comments, a couple of which suggested confronting Mr. Brownell with a vigil at his home. \u201cThere were people that could have sat in a room and had a conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. He and other friends have talked privately in the past with Mr. Brownell about his views on gun safety. He felt things got out of hand online. \u201cBy that time Pete almost had to go to his corner because they had already kind of set the message in and made their attacks. Nothing good was going to happen from that point on.\u201d \u201cIt really prevented any type of conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said.Mr. Brownell did meet with George Drake, a former president of the college who has been working with Ms. Abrahamson and others, on the condition that Mr. Drake keep the conversation confidential. Mr. Brownell\u2019s neighbors say they want to build on whatever common ground they share with him on gun politics. First, they have to know what that might be. (He also declined to speak with me.)His public remarks have been unsurprising in the national conversation, but also strike some as unneighborly. He echoes the N.R.A.\u2019s talking points on the Second Amendment, repeating that people he characterizes as \u201canti-American\u201d are trying to take away guns, which are our national heritage. He has a familiar mix of gun politic signifiers about ecological preservation, wildlife restoration, respect for military veterans, police and emergency medical workers. He has also said that he wants the N.R.A. to be an inclusive organization that supports L.G.B.T.Q. gun owners and other marginalized groups.Mr. Brownell\u2019s tone never fully matched the most aggressive rhetoric stemming from the N.R.A., like that of Dana Loesch, of its spokeswomen. Ms. Abrahamson and others said that they had hoped Mr. Brownell was going to use his role to modulate the N.R.A.\u2019s tone over what was supposed to be a two-year term. Nothing he has said in public suggests that he did. His neighbors may want to believe that his so-called real views, the ones he would share in private, are different from what he has said publicly. They also suspect it may not really matter. Like it or not \u2014 and many do like it \u2014 gun money does a lot for Grinnell.They have also supported a robotics team at Grinnell-Newburg High School. They have contributed to the Grinnell Area Arts Council and the Poweshiek County Community Fund.Brownells Inc., the gun company, has become an integral part of the economic health of the city. Alongside the college, Grinnell Mutual Insurance Company and the Grinnell Regional Medical Center, it is among Poweshiek County\u2019s largest employers. Founded in nearby Montezuma in 1939, where its headquarters were until 2016, Brownells was a relatively small and specialized business for its first 60 years. Since Mr. Brownell joined the company as an executive vice president in 1997, Brownells has acquired three other firearms companies, become a military defense contractor, secured a patent for its online ordering system, opened a retail store and undergone two expansions, the first of which the company almost immediately outgrew upon its completion in 2011. Reversing the trend, Mr. Behrens said, was the city\u2019s primary consideration in courting the relocation. The Brownells expansion was expected to create at least 162 new jobs in Grinnell and stimulate the city\u2019s housing market. There was almost no public opposition to the Brownells project. Records say that no one appeared for the scheduled public comment session held immediately before the City Council signed an initial development agreement in November 2012. With the exception of one letter to the editor of the Grinnell Herald-Register, Mr. Behrens said, \u201cThere was no pushback from the community at all,\u201d in part because there was great value in keeping a three-generation family business \u2014 \u201chopefully soon to be fourth,\u201d he added \u2014 in Poweshiek County. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we went out and recruited some random gun manufacturer,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. \u201cThis was about the expansion of an existing industry. We today have no reservations about doing it, and we would do it again.\u201dThis, says Kirsten Klepfer, the pastor of Grinnell\u2019s First Presbyterian Church, \u201cwoke me up.\u201d A week after the shooting, she preached an uncomfortable sermon at the Sunday morning service. \u201cIf we think there\u2019s no connection between Orlando and Brownells, we\u2019re probably not thinking hard enough,\u201d she said. Ms. Klepfer told her congregation that, the day before the store opened, she had approached Brownells seeking financial support for a new behavioral health program that was having a cash flow crisis. She subsequently withdrew the request. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d she told her congregants. It had become clear to her that \u201cwe like them when they pump our community full of money, we turn our eyes when they pump our communities full of guns.\u201d She has since told another mental health organization she works with that she believes they should not take donations from Brownells.Ms. Klepfer, the church\u2019s leader for over a decade, may be the person with the strongest principled objection to what she sees as the community\u2019s complicity in the firearms industry. She may also be the person who struggles least with the moral complexity and social risk of raising such objections. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019re not a big church,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s mostly me.\u201d The Pulse shooting also moved Janet Carl, the recently retired director of the college\u2019s writing center, to action. Ms. Carl, who represented Grinnell in the Iowa Assembly for six years in the 1980s, said that the shooting prompted her to submit a letter to the Grinnell Herald-Register, the first she had ever written. After it ran, she was contacted by three other people who wanted to become more active on gun safety, colleagues who had had no idea that they shared her concerns. This was the origin of an ad hoc organizing group, which grew after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The group planned several weeks of protests and educational events to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, including a silent walk to the Brownells facility. The \u201cNewtown\u201d screening took place on the college campus but was not a school-sponsored event, and the college has largely stayed out of local politics. Every faculty or staff member I spoke to was careful to say their efforts do not represent their employer. And the students, whatever their reputation for rabble-rousing, have not participated much in this off-campus effort. It was Grinnell alumni who brought the debate to campus. Shortly after Mr. Brownell became president of the N.R.A., Alana K. Smart, a 1968 Grinnell graduate, raised the question of whether the school, founded by an abolitionist, ought to accept money from the family. Ms. Smart, a chairwoman of Colorado Faith Communities United to End Gun Violence, discovered that the Brownells had made a named gift in to the college in 2014. Their gift helped create the Ignite Program, a community engagement effort that brings local elementary and high school students to campus. Ms. Smart and her classmates formed a group called Concerned Alumni of Grinnell College and set about expressing their concerns to the school. In October, members of the campus community learned about the alumni reaction through reporting in the student newspaper. This caught the attention of some faculty members. In June 2018, representatives of the Concerned Alumni group, on campus for their 50th reunion, delivered a petition to the college on behalf of 500 signatories. They asked the college to reject further gifts from Mr. Brownell, because he represents the N.R.A.\u2019s \u201cdeleterious impacts on the quality of American life.\u201d At the meeting, Raynard S. Kington, the president of Grinnell College, declined this prospect of vetting individual donors\u2019 affiliations before accepting gifts, calling it logistically onerous and ethically murky. Mr. Kington, appointed in 2011, has previously suggested that the disagreement over the donation is part of the college\u2019s educational commitment to facilitating civil debate over conflicting viewpoints. (\u201cGrinnellians,\u201d campus marketing copy reads, \u201cask hard questions and question easy answers.\u201d) She was chastised by members of the administration during a break in the meeting, she said, for her reporting. She was approached by Angela Voos, the vice president for strategic planning and Mr. Kington\u2019s chief of staff. \u201c\u2018Really? Again?\u2019\u201d Ms. Herman said Ms. Voos said, as she waved a copy of the newspaper. Ms. Voos complained that the story\u2019s characterization of Mr. Brownell as \u201c\u2018a major benefactor of college and community programs and organizations\u2019\u201d was \u201c\u2018misleading.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kington, Ms. Herman said, joined the conversation to agree. Ms. Voos told The New York Times that her memory of the episode is different, but that \u201cthe basis of the interaction is correct.\u201d Ms. Herman, she said, \u201cchose to combine a donor\u2019s philanthropy to the college with his philanthropy to the local community and then to conclude that he is a \u2018major benefactor\u2019 of the college.\u201d (Ms. Voos added that the Ignite program also had other internal funding sources.)In any event, the college says it cannot legally disclose the details of individual contributions without permission from the donor. It is possible that Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond have made or will make additional gifts under different disclosure conditions.Ms. Willis argued that accepting Brownell\u2019s money is effectively an endorsement of the N.R.A. \u201cThe college confers legitimacy by taking that donation,\u201d she said, contravening the institution\u2019s professed commitment to social justice. (Mr. Rebelsky and many other faculty members said they disagreed.) Ms. Willis also noted that the college, committed to improved town-gown relations, had much to gain by accepting a donation to start a program \u201caiming to educate kids in this community that aren\u2019t the children of college professors.\u201dThe college, Ms. Voos said, is proud of the program: \u201cWe see it as an extension of our mission to our local public schools.\u201d She notes that about a third of local elementary and high school students live in households that are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and few have had much exposure to \u201cthe college experience,\u201d even in this college town. The program has just finished its fourth year. In other ways, the college and Brownells Inc. share similar goals as stewards of the local economy. City administrators have pinned their hopes for a revitalized downtown on both. In 2014, the city and the Brownells company jointly applied for funds from the Iowa Economic Development Authority. They were unsuccessful, but the city and the college received joint funding the following year, which was partly to support what the school calls its \u201cZone of Confluence\u201d project. A two-lane highway that divides the campus and the downtown area has long been a physical manifestation of the town-gown divide. The college and city government hope that investing in this area will connect the campus to the community and bring more money downtown. Here, it seems, everyone agrees.While he has not accepted \u2014 or rejected \u2014 invitations to speak with his neighbors, Mr. Brownell has, in his public role, spoken about them. Many of his remarks to N.R.A. members have traded on stereotypes about liberals. To the considerable anger of these neighbors, he positioned himself as the bemused and indulgent teacher of big-city professor types. In a 2010 profile that appeared on an N.R.A. website, Mr. Brownell took credit for creating what he called \u201ca gun culture\u201d at the college and for educating Grinnell students and faculty members about firearms. \u201cPrevious anti-gun sentiment at the college has been offset by an open-mindedness that never would have existed without a little push from Pete,\u201d the story said. In a 2011 interview posted on the N.R.A. YouTube channel, Mr. Brownell said that the students \u201chave never really broken through those things that somebody told them at a young age, and they\u2019ve never really experimented with changing their thoughts about just a larger picture.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, he had turned \u201ca couple of New York City professors\u201d into gun enthusiasts who visit shooting ranges when they travel. \u201cThese trips are \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Metropolitan Opera and on the way let\u2019s take our pistols.\u2019\u201d Few people had even seen these remarks until Ms. Smart unearthed them last year. Mr. Kington, the college president, agreed in June to denounce Mr. Brownell\u2019s statements about taking giddy Grinnell faculty members to the shooting range.No one I spoke to had any idea who he might have been talking about, nor did they remember Mr. Brownell ever coming to campus to discuss these issues. But they would not necessarily object if he did. Lecturing about \u201csomething he has expertise on,\u201d like the Second Amendment, Ms. Willis said, \u201cwould be completely keeping within an academic institution, the idea of critical thinking, all of that.\u201d All paths actually don\u2019t cross at Saints Rest. Anyone in Grinnell will tell you that there are three kinds of people in town: the college students, the \u201cCollege people\u201d \u2014 faculty, staff and the white-collar professionals in that orbit, which even includes clergy like Ms. Klepfer and Ms. Abrahamson \u2014 and \u201ceveryone else.\u201d There\u2019s another early-morning kaffeeklatsch at the Hardees across Highway 146, just outside of downtown. At lunchtime, farm-to-table Prairie Canary is a popular Main Street lunch spot, but lots of people head to the West Side Family Restaurant a mile away.\u201cCollege people\u201d have been the most involved in these debates. They recognize that they need to bring \u201ceveryone else\u201d into the conversation \u2014 Grinnell natives, farmers, blue-collar workers, Brownells employees, hospital staff \u2014 but have so far struggled to connect. \u201cThere are certainly people on both extremes that want to make an issue out of this,\u201d said Mr. Behrens, the city manager. But \u201cmost people in Grinnell go about their daily business. They\u2019re glad Brownells is here, they\u2019re glad the college is here.\u201d Whatever political conflict there might be \u201cnever really surfaces.\u201dSome people do cut cross all the cultures. Molly Miller\u2019s maternal grandparents owned both a farm in Poweshiek County and a diner downtown. She grew up in Iowa City, but she and her sister attended Grinnell College, and she lives and works in town. Ms. Miller, too, likes the Brownells. She also says their family\u2019s comfort comes at the expense of her family\u2019s own. In November 1991, her mother, Ann Rhodes, was a vice president at the University of Iowa when a physics graduate student shot and killed three department faculty members and a postdoctoral researcher and injured two administrators in another building, before killing himself. Ms. Rhodes, who was also the university\u2019s spokeswoman and tasked with handling the aftermath, was among the first to come upon a wounded colleague, who died the following day. Ms. Miller was just an infant at the time. She grew up knowing that the shooting had a lasting effect on her mother\u2019s physical and mental health, and on her family. \u201cI\u2019m going to inherit my family\u2019s farm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if my family\u2019s farm was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year, I think I would find a different livelihood.\u201d At the Fraternal Order of the Eagles club, I settled in for a beer ($1.75 a pint, frosted mug!) next to Steve Hardeman and his friends Teresa Coon and Roger Van Donselaar. Dr. Coon is a family physician, and engaged to Mr. Van Donselaar, a Grinnell native who has owned a farm for over 30 years. Mr. Hardeman, too, is a native who works in farming. Mr. Hardeman and Mr. Van Donselaar both grew up around firearms. Dr. Coon only recently relocated to Grinnell after more than two decades in the Quad Cities region of northwest Illinois and southeastern Iowa, a metropolitan area of nearly 400,000 people, where she ran a women\u2019s health medical practice for 25 years. Mr. Van Donselaar was pleasantly surprised when she managed to get him to have dinner at Prairie Canary. Ms. Coon does not share their views on firearms, which she cheerfully contested while jabbing Mr. Hardeman on the arm for emphasis. He was quite patient with this, up to a point.No one at the bar made fun of me when I timidly mentioned bump-fire stocks. (These accessories modify a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the firing rate of an automatic.) Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting, where a dozen bump stocks were found in the gunman\u2019s hotel room, retailers like Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stopped carrying them. Pages cached by the internet Archive and Google show that Brownells also removed the products from their online inventory sometime after Sept. 29, 2017; a company representative did not respond to a request to confirm the products\u2019 removal.For gun control advocates, this seems like a victory, and it may be \u2014 or it may not. State and local bump stock bans face legal challenges, and local ordinances banning the devices in Ohio have been overturned. More to the point, Mr. Hardeman said that he or most anyone at the bar could rig a semiautomatic firearm to simulate an automatic fire rate in 15 minutes, no bump stock needed. Brownells continues to carry parts and accessories that achieve similar results, including binary trigger modification parts, which ship to 44 states.Mr. Hardeman told me a familiar story. He is proud that he was able to contribute to his impoverished household in his boyhood by hunting small game. When he hears that gun owners are irresponsible, he tells me, he\u2019s affronted. To him, his neighbors are lumping him and his friends in with a group to which they don\u2019t belong. He said it seems impossible to talk with them. \u201cLiberals want to take my guns,\u201d he said. Virtually everyone in Grinnell has taken great care to say that they do not want to take anyone\u2019s guns. This includes Ms. Abrahamson and Ms. Scott, who says that the distinction between gun control and gun safety matters. \u201cMany of us are gun owners,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to challenge the Second Amendment. We just want to know if there\u2019s safety where there are guns. This is not an anti-movement.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s what I hear all the time,\u201d Mr. Hardeman said, throwing up his hands. Before I could ask, the bartender set another frosted mug in front of me. \u201cNo, someone else got it for you,\u201d she said when I tried to pay.After all this not talking, few people seem to have thought about what they might actually say to Pete Brownell. \u201cPeople keep telling me they want to have a conversation,\u201d said Don A. Smith, an emeritus professor of history, emphasizing the last three words. \u201cWhen I ask them what they wish to have a conversation about, they say they don\u2019t know!\u201dMany people I spoke to brought up the concept of \u201cIowa nice\u201d in our conversations. During my visit, I ferried four hardy senior ladies back downtown after a protest across the highway from Brownells. I asked them whether there\u2019s any difference between Iowa, Midwestern and Minnesota nice. Everyone laughed, and someone piped up from the back seat, \u201cNo, but ours is better!\u201d \u201cIowa nice\u201d could be the solution or the problem. The social contracts of small-town life seem rather less sturdy these days. No amount of moral clarity or urgency has made it possible to overcome the hurdle of getting people \u201con all sides\u201d to talk to one another, even as they talk to one another about dozens of other things every day. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want his family hurt \u2014 and I mean in their spirit. I don\u2019t even know if we have that kind of effect on them or not. But I just think in a small town you just have to be more careful with each other.\u201dThe person who circulates among and across all these local tribes with the most ease is Mr. Brownell \u2014 certainly because of his wealth, if not also because of his fluency in the cultures that collide or coexist here. Our cultural ideas about civility and respect incline his neighbors to accept his silence. While many debate their right to carry big guns or their complicity in the gun epidemic, Mr. Brownell is, it seems, the only one who does not need to answer.Ms. Willis, a fifth-generation Iowan, calls the phenomenon \u201cIowa polite.\u201d And she said it had been tested. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of hard to maintain, because there\u2019s a sense of frustration that he won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have maintained it.\u201d Surely it can\u2019t last. In May, Mr. Brownell declined to serve a second year as N.R.A. president and was replaced by Oliver North. He remains a member of the organization\u2019s board of directors. His work is not over. Last month, a group of Senate Democrats asked Mr. Brownell and six other N.R.A. leaders for details about a 2015 trip to Moscow. There, the delegation met Maria Butina, who was charged last month with being a covert Russian agent in an investigation unrelated to the probe by Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel.After the Parkland, Fla., shooting in February, stickers with the Brownells logo and the text \u201cBrownells, where school shootings are good for business\u201d appeared on walls and fixtures across downtown Grinnell. No one would say who was responsible for them. It was a strong breach of the oppressive contract of niceness. But it wasn\u2019t the only speech taking place in the public sphere. On my way out of town, I heard a radio spot advertising the can\u2019t-miss Brownells Second Amendment Sale that weekend.Advertisement"}

Someone Should Hit the Brakes.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhy do people say the craziest things on Twitter?What is it about social media that makes powerful, accomplished individuals say things that they later need to recant, walk back or at least explain?This isn\u2019t about President Trump (although it could be). It is about chief executives.For years, companies and their executives were limited to disclosing market-moving information in news releases that were widely distributed over services like Business Wire or in interviews with media outlets. That is, until Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, broke ranks in 2012 and wrote on his Facebook page that the company\u2019s video-streaming service had \u201cexceeded 1 billion hours for the first time.\u201dThat, in turn, led to what\u2019s known as the Reed Hastings Rule, when the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted such use of social media. \u201cMost social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors,\u201d said George S. Canellos, the agency\u2019s acting enforcement chief at the time.But given the brevity Twitter requires \u2014 its character limit was doubled to 280 characters last year \u2014 it is perhaps inevitable that people will be misunderstood, even when they tweet with the best of intentions.\u201cAll tweets are misleading with such a short character limit,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be encouraging the use of Twitter for its executives. They should forbid it.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld said such a prohibition should be a company guideline, not a legislative requirement, adding he did not believe the government should get involved in what constitutes a news release.But still, regulators could at least encourage companies to remind their executives that Twitter is better used as a place to offer idle musings rather than corporate missives.Individuals are responsible for their own behavior \u2014 or what comes out of their mouth or keystrokes. Still, all too often, boldface-name executives, politicians and celebrities have needed to \u201cclarify\u201d their comments on Twitter. (I\u2019ve had to do it myself.)Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, once tweeted about \u201cscumbag celebrities\u201d only to return to Twitter with a clarification: \u201cI never referred to any particular people, just some \u2018dodgy\u2019 self promoting celebrities. Repeat apology for language.\u201dRob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, defended the company on Twitter over the role that Russia-linked advertisements played in the 2016 United States presidential election. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal,\u201d he wrote. The company ended up issuing a clarification.For reasons that remain inexplicable, Twitter seems to create an impulse control problem for too many \u2014 and when billions of dollars of investors\u2019 money is on the line and the credibility of the markets are at stake, that seems like a risk not worth taking.Regulators may end up not having a problem with Mr. Musk\u2019s message, but the existing rule has an important caveat that involves the audience it reached.In discussing enforcement of the Reed Hastings Rule, Mr. Canellos said social media was not an appropriate vehicle for announcements \u201cif the access is restricted or if investors don\u2019t know that\u2019s where they need to turn to get the latest news.\u201dThat means if companies and their executives want to use Twitter to disseminate news, they should not be allowed to block people from following their accounts, including those who manage to get under their skin. Mr. Musk has repeatedly blocked such trolls on Twitter.This issue is a variation of a theme that emerged in a court case this year in which a judge found it inappropriate for Mr. Trump to block users, given his public role.Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter has illustrated the danger of disclosing market-moving information, exemplified by his tweet before the employment report in which he seemed to hint the numbers were going to be good.It is perhaps an irresistible temptation, but one that companies have seen fit to punish in the past. Gene Morphis, chief financial officer for the specialty women\u2019s retailer Francesca\u2019s, was fired in 2012 for his use of social media posts like, \u201cBoard meeting. Good numbers=Happy Board.\u201dPerhaps the original executive maverick on Twitter was Alan Meckler, chief executive of WebMediaBrands. He started sending tweets in 2011 that would regularly move his company\u2019s stock.\u201cGood chance we will be making a few acquisitions by middle of March,\u201d he would write. Or he would send a tweet pointing out that the company\u2019s earnings report would be out in a week, with a winking reference to promising revenue numbers: \u201cRev. Growth big.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission inquired about Mr. Meckler\u2019s use of Twitter, but eventually closed the case.It shouldn\u2019t have, or at least it could have sent a warning. Maybe Mr. Musk would have heard it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Golden Statue of Erdogan Is Removed in German City", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has the ability to provoke in art as well as in life.Less than 28 hours after the Biennale art festival in the western German city of Wiesbaden set up a statue of the Turkish leader in a public square bearing the name \u201cGerman Unity Place,\u201d the mayor had it pulled down late Tuesday night, citing security concerns.Sven Gerich, the mayor of Wiesbaden, a German city of about 275,000 people just west of Frankfurt, said on Wednesday that he and the city authorities valued freedom of art and sought to protect it, but that the statue \u2014 standing nearly four meters, or 13 feet \u2014 had crossed a line.After the Weisebaden authorities allowed the artist \u2014 the installation\u2019s creator has not been identified by the Biennale organizers \u2014 to raise the statue, that was followed by a statement from the city on Tuesday. It expressed support for freedom of expression through art but warned that officials would intervene if they believed that the statue posed a threat to public safety.Maria Magdalena Ludewig, a curator for the Biennale, which is running under the motto \u201cBad News,\u201d had sought works and installations like the statue, hoping to foster the kind of open political debate that has become increasingly rare.\u201cWe were aware that public room for consensus has become increasingly difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cEach camp has become very hardened, as have the lines of conflict when they butt up against one another.\u201dUwe Eric Laufenberg, director of the Hessen state theater in Wiesbaden and of the Biennale, said opposing viewpoints were evident on Monday as people reacted to the statue.Some people placed a candle traditionally used on graves beside a small sign reading, \u201cPress freedom\u201d next to the statue\u2019s foot. Some people spat on it; others posed proudly beside the statue of the Turkish leader, taking selfies.\u201cThe conflicts were visible on the square,\u201d Mr. Laufenberg said of the opposing views toward the Turkish leader. \u201cBut for the majority of the time it stood, the discussion was peaceful. Emotional, but peaceful.\u201dMany seemed unaware that it was a temporary art installation, and news of the statue\u2019s appearance also caused confusion in Turkey. The Karar newspaper ran an article on the work under the headline \u201cA weird Erdogan statue in Germany.\u201d It explained that \u201cTurks who suddenly found the statue in front of them couldn\u2019t make sense of it.\u201dAs the day continued, supporters and opponents of Mr. Erdogan gathered around the statue, which was been guarded by members of a security service and police officers from a nearby station.A group of Kurdish women began singing their national hymn, and a group of Turkish men countered with their own national anthem. Soon after, the two sides began scuffling and the police called in about 100 officers as reinforcements.They were soon able to restore calm, and both Mr. Laufenberg and Ms. Ludewig said they believed it would have remained that way. But the mayor, Mr. Gerich, after consulting with the police, decided that the only way to ensure safety was to keep a large police contingent on the scene or to remove the installation.Shortly before midnight, Mr. Gerich called in the Fire Department. It brought a crane to hoist up the golden likeness of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 with his right arm raised, evoking the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled by American forces in Iraq \u2014 and hauled it away.\u201cThey defended their decision by arguing the cost factor,\u201d said Martin Hammer, a curator. \u201cBut if you think of what the country is willing to pay for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s upcoming state visit or the average soccer game that takes place every weekend, then it seems that political debate in public spaces is not considered as valuable.\u201dMr. Erdogan is regarded with suspicion across Germany as a whole, but he remains popular among many of the more than three million Turks, and their descendants, who call Germany home.Even if organizers would have preferred to see the statue remain in place, the community\u2019s brief encounter with the work will be integrated in the remaining events and performances of the festival, Ms. Ludewig said.\u201cWe will continue to debate and discuss in places throughout the city in the context of our main theme, \u2018Bad News,\u2019 or what was unthinkable yesterday is reality today,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Here are excerpts from his speech, annotated. Tim Soutphommasane, Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner, will end his five-year term this month and issued a blistering assessment on Monday of the country\u2019s politics and its commitment to racial equality.Here are highlights and analysis of Dr. Soutphommasane\u2019s speech, which he delivered Monday night in western Sydney as his last public address. Race politics is back. I take no pleasure in saying this but, right now, it feels like there has never been a more exciting time to be a dog-whistling politician or race-baiting commentator in Australia. Five years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have said it was likely that we would see the resurgence of far-right politics. I wouldn\u2019t have expected that the biggest threats to racial harmony would come from within our parliaments and from sections of our media. Yet here we are.Dr. Soutphommasane, a political philosopher with a Ph.D. from Oxford University, opened his speech with a damning, if obvious, diagnosis: Race relations in Australia are getting worse. His comments came in response to what he later describes as a wave of offensive comments involving race, dominated by conservative commentators and politicians. But his speech also follows a recent burst of activity by his office that included several data-heavy reports showing the wide gap between Australia\u2019s ethnically diverse population and the mostly white elites running government and business.Before that, he introduced an even more comprehensive look at the lack of diversity in government, large corporations and academia.The specter of history never lurks far away from our public debates. Consider the debate about foreign influence. Notable commentators have suggested there is a \u2018silent invasion\u2019 of Australia being conducted by China, with the Chinese party-state planting \u2018fifth column\u2019 operatives within our public institutions. It goes without saying that we must protect our democratic institutions from foreign interference. This should give no excuse, though, for some to rerun old fears about the Yellow Peril.He went on to cite specific examples of the trickle-down impact of the discussion, including an incident involving Jenny Leong, a Greens party lawmaker in the New South Wales Parliament, who was harangued by a woman who said: \u201cYou are taking over. I know your plan. We are all now second-class citizens because you Chinese are taking over.\u201dIt\u2019s not just politics that is behind this. Alongside the politicization of racial fear, we are also seeing the monetization of racism. Sections of a fracturing media industry, under the strain of technological disruption, seem to be using racism as part of their business model. The Australian media landscape is one of the most highly concentrated in the world, and Dr. Soutphommasane is arguing that some media outlets are using racism to attract eyeballs. These tend to be outlets owned by Rupert Murdoch. Sky News Australia, a Murdoch-owned cable news channel, faced withering criticism for airing an interview with Blair Cottrell, the former leader of an anti-Islam, far-right group who has expressed pro-Nazi views. Take multiculturalism. There is simply no compelling evidence that Australian multiculturalism is in danger of veering towards ethnic separatism. The evidence shows that we continue to conduct integration extremely well. The children of migrants, on average, outperform the children of Australian-born parents on education and employment. Our social mobility remains high by international standards. Many of those areas which people slander as ethnic ghettos are dynamic and vibrant communities, where no one single ethnic or racial group predominates, and where property prices have been on the rise \u2014 hardly signs of ghettos.Dr. Soutphommasane grew up in Fairfield, an area of Sydney that has long been the first stop for immigrant families like his own \u2014 and here he is arguing that those who fear such areas do not understand how they work. On the so-called Sudanese crime crisis in Melbourne, if we turn to the facts, we know that in Victoria Sudanese-born people aren\u2019t the only ones overrepresented in crime statistics. It is also the case that those born in Australia and in New Zealand are also overrepresented in Victorian crime statistics. But why, then, all the attention on crimes committed by those from Sudanese backgrounds, but so little on Australian- or New Zealand-born offenders? Conversations about race and crime tend to follow a historical pattern: In Australia and elsewhere, crimes committed by newly arrived immigrants or minorities tend to be attributed to problems with an entire group, rather than individual criminals.This has been especially true for the Sudanese-Australian community, which has come under unwelcome \u2014 and some say, unwarranted \u2014 attention after Australia\u2019s most senior politicians have pointed to its members as a cause of crime and violence in Melbourne. We\u2019re talking about an identity politics that is about reinforcing a hierarchy of voice and power in Australian society. Complaints about anti-racism stifling free speech are about a resentment of minorities being able to speak up. They\u2019re the complaints of snowflakes who can\u2019t hack it when people challenge racism.This is as aggressive as the generally mild-mannered Dr. Soutphommasane gets. Using the \u201csnowflake\u201d insult often deployed by the right to condemn liberal college students for their sensitivity, he called white Australians who are angry about assessments of racism weak and unwilling to confront reality.The sobering reality is that many in our society struggle with even talking about racism. The real political correctness on this doesn\u2019t come from the Racial Discrimination Act but from a parochial fragility. It\u2019s a fragility that explains why when racism is called out, the real offense in some people\u2019s eyes is not that an act of discrimination occurred, but rather that someone was subjected to being called racist. People should look at it another way: if you don\u2019t want to be called racist, you can start by not doing something racist.More tough talk from Dr. Soutphommasane \u2014 especially on the point that some people are less offended by a racist act than by someone calling it what it is. But more broadly, what was interesting is that he spent more time in his speech calling out these kinds of individual actions than he does focusing on systems of structural racism. He acknowledged at one point that \u201cprejudice and discrimination are like the permanent stains of our humanity,\u201d but phrases like \u201cimplicit bias\u201d or \u201cunconscious bias\u201d \u2014 schools of thought explaining that racist outcomes are often tied to historical and unseen influences that shape us all, regardless of background \u2014 do not appear in Dr. Soutphommasane\u2019s speech. The impression he left, after five years, is one that leans heavily on personal accountability and responsibility: He has done his job to combat racism in Australia. What will others do?Advertisement"}

Apparently to get away from the belligerent human who was taunting it.On Tuesday, the man, identified by the authorities as Raymond Reinke, 55, was captured on video goading and lunging at the bison on a paved road in Yellowstone. The massive brown animal crossed the road and turned its back away from him, until the man gestured at the animal as if trying to coax it into a fight. He flexed his arms and then pointed \u2014 which sent the animal charging toward him.The man did not stop there.He tested the bison again with an animalistic grunt, balling up his fists and hunching over. The bison charged, horns lowered.\u201cOh God, no, no \u2014 I can\u2019t watch anymore!\u201d said the woman who took a video of the action.But the man ran away, and, luckily for him, the bison seemed to decide it had better things to do that day than prove its dominance over a tourist. The human left Yellowstone unscathed, but he still had the park\u2019s staff to contend with.Mr. Reinke, who is from Pendleton, Ore., was arrested on Thursday night at Glacier National Park in Montana after a warrant was issued for his arrest, according to a news release from Yellowstone.Rangers were called to a hotel in the park because Mr. Reinke was causing a disturbance by arguing with another guest in the dining room, the news release said, before they realized it was the same man wanted by Yellowstone law enforcement. By this time, the hotel bar had already stopped serving Mr. Reinke, said Lauren Alley, a spokeswoman for Glacier National Park.On July 28, rangers arrested Mr. Reinke at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming for drunk and disorderly conduct, according to the news release. He spent the night in jail and was released on bond.On Tuesday, rangers at Yellowstone stopped the vehicle Mr. Reinke was in for a traffic violation and cited him for failing to wear a seatbelt. Mr. Reinke appeared \u201cintoxicated and argumentative,\u201d the news release said.Later, Mr. Reinke decided to tease the bison, prompting several reports of wildlife harassment from other visitors. Mr. Reinke was issued a citation, but after rangers saw the viral video and connected him to the earlier debauchery in Wyoming, a warrant was issued for his arrest on Thursday. He was arrested that night at the hotel and was booked into a Yellowstone jail in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyo.In addition to disturbing wildlife, Mr. Reinke faces several other charges, including being intoxicated to a degree that endangers himself or others, unreasonable noise and keeping an open container of alcohol in a vehicle, according to court documents.Efforts to reach him for comment on Friday night were unsuccessful.At Mr. Reinke\u2019s court appearance on Friday, a judge ordered that he be held in jail until his next court appearance, which is set for Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018What\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u2019 Is Now Weekly. STEM Teachers Explain Why It\u2019s a Powerful Activity.", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat's Going On in This Graph?Updated, Feb. 26, 2019_________Graphs pop up everywhere these days \u2014 not just in old media like textbooks, state exams and newspapers, but also on YouTube, Facebook and Pinterest. Yet they still serve the same age-old purposes: to inform and persuade \u2014 and, occasionally, to misinform. That means students are likely interacting with statistics and visualized data, not just in school, but in their everyday lives as well. Do they have the tools to understand these graphs, evaluate their reliability and draw logical conclusions?Making sense of statistics and graphs \u2014 whether displayed in a graph, chart or map \u2014 often requires patience, careful observation and lots of practice. It also necessitates a willingness to put together pieces of a puzzle to figure out what story or stories a graph might tell.Last year \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d was monthly, but this school year, we\u2019ll be publishing the feature weekly, most Wednesdays from September to April (calendar below). We hope you\u2019ll join us.Each week we\u2019ll select an engaging Times graph and pair it with a simple set of questions \u2014 asking students what they notice, what they wonder, and what they think is going on in the graph. As students comment, we provide live moderation by statistics teachers (on Wednesdays). Then, at the end of the week, we post an end-of-activity \u201creveal\u201d which shares the original article containing the graph, highlights from the moderation, related statistical concepts and helpful vocabulary.Here\u2019s the weekly schedule:Thursday afternoons: We publish a new graph and update the previous week\u2019s graph with the \u201creveal.\u201dWednesdays: Teachers provide live moderation of student comments from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Time.The philosophy behind our approach is to let students begin analyzing graphs with the skills they will most naturally and successfully use \u2014 simple noticing and wondering. From there, students can simultaneously build confidence and acquire new conceptual understanding. Over time, as their critical thinking skills develop and their vocabulary grows, students\u2019 analyses become more sophisticated.Why do this weekly? Because we thought this new schedule would enable teachers to more easily incorporate \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d into their classroom routines. Also The Times publishes scores of engaging graphs we wanted to take advantage of. And, perhaps most of all, because teachers told us how powerful this feature was in their curriculum, and how much students enjoyed it.This summer we spoke to several STEM teachers who used \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d in their classrooms. Here is what they told us:1. \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d fits easily into the curriculum.What I really appreciate about this feature is that it\u2019s scalable; if you have 10 minutes in class, you can catch a few basic statistical ideas. \u2026 But sometimes I can actually use a particular graph throughout a whole lesson that I\u2019m teaching, like scatterplots. In those cases, this feature can scale to a longer time and bigger statistical concepts.I wondered myself what would happen with this graph; how long could I have my students work on this? In years past my students have struggled with putting together their thoughts and thinking critically.I tried it, we took the whole period, and it was amazing to see how thoughtful they were and the questions they came up with. It got students who don\u2019t normally participate to participate and be excited about an activity.2. It inspires rich discussion, which yields deeper understanding.Last year we explored \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d in my AP Statistics classes. First I had students talk with a partner about the following: what they noticed about the graph, what they wondered about the graph and what they thought the author was trying to communicate with the graph.When we debriefed as a class, students became aware of the perspectives of other students, and we used the combined thoughts of all students to create a class post. After we created our post, we looked at other posts in the discussion forum. The next day we were able to read what the moderator said about our thoughts and this made us think even more deeply about how graphs can communicate a message.3. The activity begins with safe questions.4. \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d encourages students to see statistics in a different way \u2014 as a way of telling stories.When I begin my Stats unit with ninth graders, I open with the prompt \u201cWhat do you think Statistics is about?\u201d. The usual answers are often concrete concepts: numbers, graphs, mean, median \u2026 ideas they may have encountered in middle school. By the end of the conversation, I try to sway the students in a different direction \u2014 that statistics is about storytelling.\u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d is useful in causing students to think about the story being told, and I use it often as a class opener, even if the graph does not connect directly to our daily material.5. It makes math relevant.Every Monday in each of my classes for the past few years, I have shown the class a graph or graphic of some kind and we talk about it. I like using the NYTimes \u201cWGOITGraph?\u201d feature sometimes, but obviously I\u2019m doing this more often than you are publishing, so I am supplementing with material from various places online.I try to get at the idea of thinking critically about information from the internet, rather than simply trying to understand how to read a graphic.He consistently asks students a series of questions, including:He added:Ideally, what I would like students to take away from these lessons is not only an ability to read and interact with graphics, but also an ability to think critically about information and become better internet citizens. So far, it seems like it\u2019s been fairly successful; the high point for me was when a student emailed me a link to a graphic on our own school\u2019s website that misleadingly portrayed our test scores as being much higher than those in the rest of the country.My goal is to engage my students and keep them interested; that\u2019s probably 50 percent of the work I do. If I can help my students see that this is math I can use right now, and even better that it will help increase their awareness of the world around them \u2026 if I can get them involved in current news in any way, that\u2019s a big bonus.Did you teach with \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d last school year? Are you thinking about using the feature this year? We\u2019d love to hear from you.

{"Headline": "Worried About Turkey\u2019s Economic Problems? China\u2019s Could Be Worse", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates a weakening currency and capital flight.Mr. Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Many emerging markets make themselves vulnerable to financial crisis by spending more than they can afford, and relying on foreign lenders to fund these profligate habits, but Turkey was an extreme case even before Mr. Erdogan took power in 2002. Of late, his reckless economic policies \u2014 including setting interest rates at artificially low levels, and driving up debts, deficits and inflation \u2014 have only made matters worse. Many wealthy Turks saw another crisis coming and were fleeing the country well before foreigners joined the recent rush, accelerating the fall of the Turkish lira over the past few days.Turkey\u2019s troubles are homegrown, and the economic war against it is a figment of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s conspiratorial imagination. But he does have a point about the impact of a surging dollar, which has a long history of inflicting damage on developing nations.Like many emerging world currency crises before it, this one comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, pushing up the value of the dollar. As the dollar strengthens, developing countries like Turkey have a harder time paying back their dollar debts, and eventually investors start to flee.Now the question is whether Turkey is poised to trigger a wider global crisis, the way the fall of the Thai baht did in 1997. The answer is not clear. The fall of the Turkish lira has had a negative effect on other emerging market currencies, but few of those countries share Turkey\u2019s dual problem of having large foreign debt and government policies that fuel inflation. But there is an even bigger question looming: The strong dollar that is weakening Turkey\u2019s economy may also be undermining the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China. China is vulnerable to the strong dollar for different reasons. At one level, China is far less dependent on imports than Turkey, which has to buy virtually all its raw materials, including oil from abroad. Unlike Turkey, China does not run a chronic trade deficit and does not have to borrow heavily in dollars to finance its purchases abroad. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, however, Beijing tried to keep its economy humming by ordering state banks to pump out new loans. More than half the increase in global debt over the past decade was issued as domestic loans inside China. There is now much more money circulating in China than in the United States, much of it in the hands of Chinese who are constantly on the watch for higher returns.So China also faces a serious risk of capital flight. The last bout began in 2015, amid early indications that the Federal Reserve was going to start raising interest rates. China stopped that exodus by tightening its currency controls, but controls rarely work for long. Savvy locals find creative ways to get their money out. This year, the Fed\u2019s tightening has further strengthened the dollar, while Beijing\u2019s easy money policies have further weakened the renminbi \u2014 increasing the incentive for Chinese investors to dump China\u2019s currency for dollars. Right now Chinese can earn the same interest rates in the United States for a lot less risk, so the motivation to flee is high, and will grow more intense as the Fed raises rates further. Beijing could also diminish the allure of the strong dollar by trying to raise the value of its own currency. But that would mean tightening the supply of renminbi, which is likely to derail the economy at a time when growth in China is already slowing under the burden of too much debt. More than 60 percent of the foreign currency held in reserve by central banks around the world is in dollars, and China\u2019s ambition to make the renminbi a reserve currency has attracted hardly any takers. Global central banks and investors are still wary of holding a currency that Communist authorities may slap controls on at any time \u2014 as they did in 2016.So China is in a tough spot. The strengthening dollar threatens to provoke more capital flight out of China, but any effort to shore up the renminbi in response could further slow the Chinese economy. For years Beijing has responded to signs of weakness in the economy by printing more renminbi, which worked fine when the United States was also running a very loose monetary policy. Now that the United States is raising interest rates, lowering rates in China will only give Chinese investors more reason to leave the country. The fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates this dilemma. Its $14 trillion economy is more than 15 times larger than Turkey\u2019s, representing about 16 percent of the global economy. It is pivotal. For the rest of the world, the collapse of the lira may prove to be a passing event, and China is likely to decide which way this crisis goes. Advertisement"}
