{"Headline": "Americans Are Terrible at Small Talk", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne Irish woman\u2019s unscientific investigation.Contributing Opinion WriterAmericans are good at a great many things: normalizing drone warfare, making cherry-flavored jellies taste more like cherries than cherries themselves, optimism. But they struggle with small talk. In Ireland, small talk is just that \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s tiny.What the seemingly meaningless exchange means is we can relax. The person we\u2019re inches away from for the afternoon is not dangerous. At the end of the trip we\u2019ll nod and smile, and I won\u2019t be left wondering why his father said that one thing in 1994 that meant he never had the confidence to pursue a career in architecture.The last kids\u2019 birthday party I attended was in Brooklyn, where the adults stick around and it kind of blends into the evening. I was chatting with this one cool-guy dad with a pale ale in his hand, and he opened up within 30 seconds. \u201cSomething people don\u2019t talk about enough is how hard parenting really is, and sometimes you\u2019re just not going to like your kids,\u201d he said. All I\u2019d asked was whether he was in line for the bouncy castle. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him that, actually, two other people at the same party had said more or less the same thing to me just minutes earlier. Was this disgruntled trio just unlucky, with a slew of particularly unlikable children between them? No. They were simply saying what was on their minds. You see, there\u2019s nothing Americans don\u2019t talk about. That should come as a relief to me, growing up in a repressed, Catholic country where my mother explained rape to us as \u201cwhen someone loves you, but you don\u2019t want them to.\u201d In truth, this extraordinary level of openness I find here is a relief, but it also feels a little like a loss. I understand that openness beats secrecy and that taboos should be challenged. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t always want to dive right in. Time and energy are resources, and New Yorkers never have enough of either because of capitalism and self-absorption. Their technique is to get straight to it, and that can be off-putting. Besides, believing and acting on this no-nonsense \u201cwho exactly are you?\u201d school of conversation neglects the fact that small talk, when done correctly, is actually an extremely efficient way of getting acquainted with people. You may not find out where they work, or who they know, or how their relationship is with their family, but you\u2019ll get some idea of that odd-shaped part of a human being that\u2019s invisible to the eye and impossible to articulate. Are they kind, hurting, silly or bad? Some combination of all of those? You can find out, if you ask them about the party food, or tell them about your blouse, or bring up the oddly cloudless sky outside, and simply take it from there.In one fateful 20-minute Google session a few years ago, I applied for and was accepted into both a yoga teacher-training course and a mentoring program for girls. The same week in September saw the first day of both courses, yoga on Saturday mornings, mentoring on Saturday afternoons. It was all falling into place; soon I\u2019d be some kind of supple superhero flanked by a bevy of intellectually powerful young women who would look upon me favorably after they\u2019d taken over the world. That first Saturday, I noticed the same woman in both courses, a serene-looking person with a resting saint face. I was struck by what I thought was an incredible coincidence \u2014 can you even imagine two nice, helpful white writer ladies who are also interested in deepening their yoga practice?That is how it came to pass that, instead of some small talk leading to an easy quietness, Warrior One sat beside Warrior Two in tense silence as they both scrolled through their phones. My reluctant companion believed that conversation had to be all or nothing, either teetering on ice or plunging into the unknown waters beneath. She didn\u2019t know she just had to pull on a pair of skates and twirl around for a while. That elegance was not accessible to her, I thought, as I spied a dog in a bag under the seat opposite us. His little black eyes shone. I get it; words are laughably inadequate when it comes time to express ourselves. My brain is so close to my mouth, yet in the time it takes for a thought to travel between the two and become a sentence, the meaning is diluted and fudged to something I don\u2019t really mean at all. But words are all we have when it comes to telling someone who we are, so we are duty-bound to at least try. I didn\u2019t want a vapid exchange, and in-depth conversation wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate either, and I had no intention of launching into either. The perfect in-between connection was small talk, but we missed that connection, so I was just a woman alone on the subway, smiling at a schnauzer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google: Which Can Carry on a Conversation Best?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Advertisement\nDigital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can carry on a good conversation.We explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments \u2014 even in the moments when the assistants screwed up \u2014 showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.Because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how.Right away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called \u201cthese things\u201d to a shopping list.If your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said \u201cguacamole, chips, tortillas,\u201d he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn\u2019t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it.Alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren\u2019t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.A digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.When you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you\u2019ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.Engineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time \u2014 a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.In some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.Even if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with.When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.When you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.After recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.Engineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It\u2019s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.All of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don\u2019t change anything.Machine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\u201cIf you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,\u201d said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. \u201cThe technology operates by different rules than people do.\u201dIn the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don\u2019t use a pronoun?The devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That\u2019s likely because each device is using a different \u201cknowledge graph,\u201d a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp.Amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was \u201csluggish.\u201dA neural network also drives Google\u2019s new \u201cconversational mode.\u201dIn the past, you couldn\u2019t talk to the device without saying \u201cHey, Google.\u201d Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command \u2014 and when you\u2019re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with the interactions other people have had with their devices. Basically, Google\u2019s customers are helping Google build a smarter product.Don\u2019t expect these devices to tell you what they think \u2014 or even what other people think. It\u2019s easier to build technology that sticks to the facts. After asking these devices to identify the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which they all did correctly, we asked for their opinion of his work. None of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question, and Google eventually lost the context altogether.Engineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do, but conversation is such a complex task, even machine learning approaches will need years \u2014 or perhaps decades \u2014 to completely solve the problem.These devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self-reflection or complex analysis.This is an incredibly difficult question for a computer to answer, unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it. Many times, these devices will just reply with canned responses, as Google did with the Muffin Man bit.For now, you will have to make do with the Muffin Man.Note: The devices tested were the Apple HomePod, the Amazon Echo Plus and the Google Home. They were each tested separately. The phrases used to trigger the devices \u2014 \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey, Google,\u201d respectively \u2014 were used before each interaction, and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity.Audio production by Brad FisherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gatekeepers or Censors? How Tech Manages Online Speech", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple, Google and Facebook this week erased from their services many \u2014 but not all \u2014 videos, podcasts and posts from the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars site. And Twitter left Mr. Jones\u2019s posts untouched.The differing approaches to Mr. Jones exposed how unevenly tech companies enforce their rules on hate speech and offensive content. There are only a few cases in which the companies appear to consistently apply their policies, such as their ban on child pornography and instances in which the law required them to remove content, like Nazi imagery in Germany.When left to make their own decisions, the tech companies often struggle with their roles as the arbiters of speech and leave false information, upset users and confusing decisions in their wake. Here is a look at what the companies, which control the world\u2019s most popular public forums, allow and ban.Of all the tech companies, Facebook has faced the biggest public outcry over what it allows on its platform.Whenever the social media company has been pressed to explain its decision-making, it has referred to its community standards, a public document that outlines Facebook\u2019s rules for users. The company has outright bans against violent content, nudity and terrorist recruitment propaganda. The rules on other types of content, including hate speech and false news, are more ambiguous.Now, less than a month later, Facebook has banned Mr. Jones and removed four pages belonging to him \u2014 including one with nearly 1.7 million followers \u2014 for violating its policies. The ban means that while Mr. Jones still has an account and can view content on Facebook, he is suspended from posting anything to the platform, including to his personal page or any pages on which he is an administrator.The company has refused to say how many strikes is too many, however. It has also not answered questions on how long Mr. Jones will be banned or whether Facebook will be reviewing similar content posted by other right-wing conspiracy theorists.It\u2019s unclear whether the actions Facebook has taken against Mr. Jones signal a new approach by the company against hate speech or whether they are, once again, responding to an isolated case because of public pressure.\u2014 Sheera FrenkelUsers can flag videos that they believe violate those guidelines, which include bans on videos with nudity or sexual content or incite violence. YouTube will then review those flagged videos for potential violations. In addition, YouTube\u2019s computer systems also comb the site for videos that violate its rules.But many videos operate in a gray area. Even in YouTube\u2019s own explanation of \u201chateful content,\u201d the company calls it is a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d between free expression and protecting YouTube users.YouTube still hosts videos of Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich., whose sermons were viewed by one of the knife-wielding attackers in the terror attack on London Bridge last year. His sermons posed a quandary for the video service because the cleric does not directly call for violent jihad and is, therefore, not in clear violation of community guidelines. YouTube now presents Mr. Jibril\u2019s sermons behind a warning that the video has been deemed \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d by part of the YouTube community.Mr. Jones incurred two content violations from YouTube over the last year. In February, YouTube said he had violated its policies regarding harassment and bullying when a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201dIn Mr. Jones\u2019s most recent violation last month, YouTube took down four of his videos that included hate speech against Muslim and transgender people as well as footage of a child being shoved to the ground. YouTube said the videos had violated its policies pertaining to hate speech, harassment and child endangerment.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiTwitter\u2019s approach has provoked plenty of criticism, particularly around its lax handling of harassment. Celebrities like the actress Leslie Jones have been temporarily driven off the platform by swarms of abusers.Although the parents of several Sandy Hook shooting victims are suing Mr. Jones for defamation, a Twitter spokesman said that neither Mr. Jones\u2019s personal account nor his Infowars account are currently in violation of Twitter\u2019s policies. Tweets questioning the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., remain live on both accounts.The simultaneous takedowns across YouTube, Spotify and Facebook are troubling, said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. The number of bans in quick succession from multiple companies raised the specter that this could have been influenced by outside political pressure rather than a straightforward application of company policies, he said.Twitter\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Jones and Infowars to stay on its platform may reflect a commitment to consistent policy enforcement, Mr. Bankston said.\u201cA Twitter that\u2019s not accountable to its own rules is not accountable to anybody,\u201d he said.In a series of tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Dorsey suggested that other tech companies had caved to political pressure in their decision to remove Mr. Jones from their platforms and argued that journalists \u2014 not Twitter \u2014 were better suited to fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019 claims.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t violated our rules,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.\u201d\u2014 Kate CongerWithout a social-media platform, Apple typically avoids the content controversies that ensnare its peers. Yet the iPhone maker still makes many decisions about what apps, podcasts, songs and videos it will make available on its popular services.Apple\u2019s decision to ban the Infowars podcasts was surprising partly because an app that Infowars introduced last month was gaining steam on Apple\u2019s App Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 33rd most popular news app on the app store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones\u2019s bans spread, the Infowars app was Apple\u2019s fourth most popular news app, outranking every mainstream news organization.How Apple decides which apps violate those policies is more vague, however. Apple said in its policy: \u201cWe will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, \u2018I\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u2019 And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\u201d\u2014 Jack NicasAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Block and Report Spam Calls and Text Messages ", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnwanted calls and spam texts are annoying, but you can do something about them. Here\u2019s how to block and report them so they won\u2019t bother you again.Telemarketers have been a thorn in the side of humankind for decades. And while technology offers more options for blocking unwanted calls, it also makes spammers more agile than ever before. Here\u2019s what to do when you get a spam call or text message, and how to avoid them.First thing\u2019s first: There\u2019s a difference between spammers and scammers. Sometimes, you may get unwanted calls and messages from a company you\u2019ve done business with or a charity you\u2019ve donated to. If you know the call is coming from a legitimate entity, feel free to ask to be taken off the list. Good companies will (hopefully) abide by your wishes.If the caller is a company that refuses to take you off its list or is a full-on scammer you can\u2019t get rid of, you can block the number and report it, in an effort to prevent more calls or texts of that nature.Reporting text messages is a little bit easier: No matter what phone you have, just forward the text message to SPAM (7726). Most carriers participate in a service that will use this information to try and block future spammers. (Android users can also report text messages by going to the menu, then People & Options, then Block and checking Report as Spam. This sends the message to Google as well as your carrier, so Google can improve their spam blocking filters as well.) Users of iPhones can report blue-bubble iMessages as spam with the Report Junk link that appears below messages from unknown users.None of these steps guarantee that the calls will stop, however. Scammers are getting smart, and they may just call from another number \u2014 but this process will help the F.T.C., Google and the cellphone carriers combat the problem in the long run.By reporting the call or text, you\u2019ve done your part to fight the scourge of telemarketers and spammers. But if you\u2019re still getting truckloads of spam calls, you can take your call-blocking to the next level.Android users can enable Google\u2019s built-in spam filtering from the Phone app. Tap the three dots in the corner and choose Settings, then head to Caller ID & Spam. Enable the option to filter suspected spam calls. From then on, instead of merely warning you that a call might be spam, Google will prevent that call from ringing your phone entirely.The iPhone doesn\u2019t have an option to filter these calls, but both Android and iPhone users can filter spammers and scammers at the carrier level, too. All four of the major carriers in the United States have apps and services to help you do so:The main difference is in how they block calls: Third-party apps can stop your phone from ringing, but your carrier can block the call earlier in the chain, sending the spammers a busy signal that will hopefully make them think your number is disconnected. Unfortunately, carrier services aren\u2019t always available on prepaid plans, so third-party apps may be some people\u2019s only choice.Lastly, if all that sounds like too much hassle, you have one more option. It\u2019s much easier, though far more intense: Just turn on Do Not Disturb for anyone not in your contacts list.This option guarantees that your phone won\u2019t ring for any spammers or scammers, which makes it incredibly appealing. Of course, some legitimate calls will get blocked as well, if you don\u2019t have the caller\u2019s number in your address book \u2014 but voice mail will always be there to catch those people, and you can call them back promptly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gaza and Google Translate: Covering the Conflict When You Don\u2019t Speak the Language", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David M. Halbfinger, bureau chief for The Times in Jerusalem, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.My electronic gear is fairly simple. I carry two iPhones, each with an Apple case that doubles the phone\u2019s battery life (I\u2019m not that happy with these because they disintegrate after about a year, but I haven\u2019t shopped around); a MacBook Pro; battery backups; Bluetooth headsets, keyboard and mouse; and a small bag jammed full of cables, plugs and cigarette-lighter adapters.I sometimes also carry an Iridium satellite phone, and I always travel with a power strip in case there aren\u2019t enough outlets where I am. I try to keep my backpack light in Gaza. Other items \u2014 armor-plated flak jacket, Kevlar helmet, gas mask and spare filters, and a trauma kit \u2014 add lots of weight to my load.Probably the most vital tech tool I carry is the lightest: a paper clip to switch SIM cards. I\u2019ve been here less than a year and finally got a local number from the Palestinian provider Jawwal, which has good coverage across Gaza and can be quickly replenished at countless retail shops. For months I was managing with Israeli cell service near the border and a New York number that had decent coverage in Gaza City over the Wataniya network. But now I juggle the Gaza and New York phones depending on which has the stronger signal.What tech tools do you use to navigate the language barrier in Hebrew and Arabic?My wife and I feel like captives of Google Translate in making sense of Hebrew-language messages on local WhatsApp groups, bank statements, utility bills and so on, but it is adequate, and it continues to improve \u2014 in particular through its camera interface. As iPhone, not Android, users, we look forward to the day when WhatsApp will let us translate within the app, rather than copying and pasting into the Translate app.In part because of the confusion of the language barrier, but also because of the complexity of the beat, I record more phone calls in this job than I have in other assignments. TapeACall Pro makes that as simple as making a three-way call, and produces a recording seconds after I hang up. I also use TurboScan to send documents from my phone, and CamCard to scan the business cards of new contacts.What about just plain navigating?To get around in Gaza, I work with an experienced driver, but in Israel and the West Bank I drive myself using a combination of Waze and Google Maps.Waze is excellent in Israel, where it was invented. Almost everyone uses it, vastly enhancing the quality of real-time traffic information. But it is pretty much useless in Palestinian territory: If you plug in a location in Ramallah, it will warn you that your destination \u201cis in a high risk area or is prohibited to Israelis by law,\u201d and then take you to the point on the map where you cross into Palestinian-controlled territory, but no farther. Google Maps at least will navigate you all the way to your destination, but its routes often don\u2019t account for one-way streets going the wrong way.A bigger problem in getting around in Gaza and the West Bank is the dearth of Western-style street addresses. Many streets have no names, let alone house numbers. The most reliable way to get somewhere is to have someone at that location share the map coordinates and then get there with Google Maps, allowing extra time for wrong turns. Maps.me, a crowdsourced app that allows you to download maps and use them without cell service, also looks promising.Waze is great at flagging radar traps, speed cameras and traffic jams, and my kids took over the voice prompts, so I hear them giving me turn-by-turn directions. What none of these apps has yet mastered, though, is the ability to pinpoint the location of the creeping student drivers who seem to clog traffic on every block of my neighborhood in Jerusalem. There needs to be an app for that.What steps do you take to secure your communications given the often sensitive nature of your reporting?How do Israelis use tech differently than people in the United States?Americans don\u2019t have to worry about rockets being fired from Canada or Mexico. But Israelis who live near Gaza or in the Golan Heights need to know the instant that the military detects incoming rockets; as a rule, civilians have about 15 seconds to get to a bomb shelter. Several apps, including one in English \u2014 called, simply, Red Alert \u2014 instantly convey alerts about incoming fire to users based on their locations. I get alerted to all of them.More innocuously, I\u2019ve used parking meter apps in the United States, but none of them was as easy to use as Pango \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something, since it only works in Hebrew and I have to translate the alerts it sends me. It bills me once a month, it doesn\u2019t charge me when it shouldn\u2019t, and it usually knows when I have driven away from my parking spot but forgotten to turn off the meter.What tech do you use a lot in your personal life or that your family uses a lot at home that you don\u2019t at work?Israel doesn\u2019t have Yelp, sadly, but it does have TripAdvisor, which is a decent substitute for restaurants and hotels. My family uses Moovit to get around town by city bus.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google-Facebook Dominance Hurts Ad Tech Firms, Speeding Consolidation", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingOnline advertising companies have struggled for several years as Google and Facebook solidified their grip on digital dollars, slowing revenue for the others.Now, many ad tech companies and their investors are throwing up their hands.Venture capital money going into ad tech start-ups is falling sharply, helping push a wave of consolidation. Financing reached a high of $2.92 billion in 2015, but this year, it is on pace to be less than half that, according to CB Insights, a financial research firm.The number of independent ad tech companies has fallen 21 percent since 2013, to 185 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to LUMA Partners, which analyzes digital media and marketing.\u201cWhile all industries go through a maturation curve, this one faces a particular need for consolidation,\u201d said Terry Kawaja, the chief executive of LUMA Partners. \u201cSo many of these companies were not profitable.\u201dAlthough many consumers have never heard of ad tech firms, people\u2019s online activity is influenced every day by these companies as they battle for a share of ad impressions on phones, tablets and laptops. The \u201cMad Men\u201d style of advertising workers has been replaced by the \u201cmath men\u201d of ad tech start-ups, which specialize in gathering data on consumer preferences.Advertising, the economic juice behind the internet, has long been an attractive area for start-ups. During the last 10 years, the ease of forming companies and the availability of cheap venture capital led to a flood of ad tech start-ups, pushing boundaries on where and how ads were delivered. They introduced technologies like the automation of ad buying \u2014 called programmatic advertising \u2014 and header bidding, in which many ad exchanges bid on publishers\u2019 space simultaneously.Ari Paparo, chief executive of the ad tech start-up Beeswax, said he had noticed a distinct decline in venture capital funding for ad tech firms just in the last two years. \u201cThe private market is influenced by the public market, and you saw so many fail as publicly traded entities,\u201d he said.There were 260 deals between ad tech companies and venture capital firms in 2014 but only 122 in 2017, according to PitchBook. In the first half of 2018, there have been 53 deals.The fear is that when investment dries up, innovation will die.Small start-ups are crucial to the industry because they often serve as catalysts for technological advances, said Doug Knopper, one of the founders of the ad tech platform FreeWheel, which was sold to Comcast in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s still more innovation to come, but if V.C.s don\u2019t put money into it because they don\u2019t see a path to exit, does innovation stall?\u201d he said, referring to venture capitalists.Some are hoping a third big competitor could help the industry. Eric Adelman, president and one of the founders of Three Pillars Recruiting, said while the AT&T acquisition consolidates power in fewer places, the deal could help make AT&T a rival to Google and Facebook.\u201cHaving three giants in the industry is much better than having two giants,\u201d he said.In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cThe dynamics of the market may be changing, but it\u2019s stemming more from people\u2019s shifting consumption habits than one platform\u2019s popularity.\u201dNot all smaller players are giving up. Kevin Hunt, senior vice president of global marketing for the ad platform SpotX, is betting that his company\u2019s focus on video advertising will set it apart.\u201cIt\u2019s important for companies who are in this space to be technically flexible, to make sure they have built a solid foundation that allows them to move as technology moves,\u201d he said.Eric Franchi, one of the founders and a former executive at the digital advertising company Undertone, isn\u2019t giving up on ad tech. After the software company Perion acquired Undertone in 2015, Mr. Franchi teamed up with Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, to fund an ad tech-focused venture-capital fund called MathCapital that helps the little guys.\u201cWe want the best entrepreneurs that want to build ad tech companies to come to us,\u201d Mr. Franchi said. \u201cOver time, hopefully we can be a force for good in the space to help these companies get started.\u201dAnd even after Ben Barokas sold his company Admeld to Google in 2011, he decided to stay in the ad tech industry, creating a content compensation platform called Sourcepoint.\u201cI think certainly Facebook and Google are hoovering up the vast majority of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I believe in independent content creation. Those who invest appropriately are going to also win and attract advertising dollars.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Robot Walks Into a Bar. But Can It Do Comedy?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 One recent evening at a London pub, Piotr Mirowski, 39, stood in front of several dozen comedy fans to prove that an artificially intelligent computer program could perform improvised comedy.In one hand, he held a bug-eyed toy robot, its lines voiced by the program. With the other, he pretended to grip a steering wheel. The robot was playing Mr. Mirowski\u2019s partner; they were taking a scenic drive together.\u201cI am not trying to be angry,\u201d the robot said, suddenly breaking the mood.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be angry \u2014 this is our quality time,\u201d Mr. Mirowski replied.\u201cI\u2019m sure that you will find love,\u201d the robot said after an awkward pause, drawing a firm end to the couple\u2019s relationship, and prompting laughter from the audience. \u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d it added. Mr. Mirowski made a final attempt to save things, but the robot would not listen. \u201cYou are not me. You\u2019re my friend,\u201d it said, emotionless.For someone who had just been dumped in front of a paying audience, Mr. Mirowski looked happy. Why? Because the A.I. he created had worked, and stuck to the topic at hand \u2014 a rare event, he said later in an interview.Today, around a dozen people in Europe and North America are working on similar projects, mainly in their spare time from A.I.-related jobs, Mr. Mirowski said. (He is a senior research scientist working on artificial intelligence at Google DeepMind, but said his work there was not related to comedy.)Mr. Mirowski was born in Poland, but spent most of his childhood in France, playing role-playing and video games, he said. He fell in love with improv at college, both the challenge and playfulness of it, and kept doing it after he graduated and started working in A.I.He long thought of combining his passions, but said he had only realized it was possible in 2014, partly because of systems that could quickly analyze large volumes of text, spot patterns and then produce sentences in response. Mr. Mirowski decided to apply that to improv skits.The system he built was remarkably simple. A.L.Ex (which stands for Artificial Language Experiment) has been fed the subtitles from more than 100,000 films, from action movies like \u201cDeep Impact\u201d to the pornographic film \u201cDeep Throat.\u201d When someone talks to it, the system uses a tool called a neural network, vaguely modeled on the brain, to analyze similar exchanges in its database and compose its own response.Mr. Mirowski made his stage debut with A.L.Ex in July 2016. It did not go to plan. \u201cThere was a moment where it didn\u2019t say anything as the speech recognition crashed,\u201d Mr. Mirowski said, \u201cso I had to say, \u2018I see you want to stay silent.\u2019 That is something you can only really do once.\u201dAround that time, Mr. Mirowski met Kory Mathewson, an A.I. researcher at the University of Alberta in Canada who had developed a comedy chatbot he was trying to use in live improv, and the two began collaborating. They have made numerous improvements to A.L.Ex, including tweaks to its code to make it better at sticking to a topic. (If a sketch is set on a pirate ship, you don\u2019t want it to suddenly talk about space.)A.L.Ex is now at the point where the pair are happy for other improvisers to work with it. In recent shows in London, Mr. Mirowski also used the system to feed a performer lines through a headset.Despite all the improvements, Mr. Mirowski said working with an A.I. was still like having a \u201ccompletely drunk comedian\u201d on stage, who was only \u201caccidentally funny,\u201d by saying things that were totally inappropriate, overly emotional or plain odd.\u201cRobots are in a way the antithesis of theater and comedy,\u201d he said. \u201cTheatre is about the human expression on stage, and it\u2019s about the communication and empathy between the actors and the audience. Robots do not have the sensors to perceive any of that.\u201dWhat A.I. is good at, Mr. Mirowski said, is saying unusual things that challenge the human improviser to work harder, which can increase satisfaction when they manage to make a scene work. \u201cImprov is like intellectual and mental tightrope walking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe robot is kind of making the tightrope longer.\u201dIn a Skype interview, Mr. Mathewson agreed that the joy of working with an A.I. system came when you managed to do a show that didn\u2019t just rely on the randomness of the responses for humor, but which kept a story going.His early shows were failures in that respect, he said. In one, he swore in exasperation, and the machine replied, \u201cSwearing is often cathartic.\u201d Now he has improvised with it publicly more than 50 times. When shows are a success, they are more celebrations of human creativity than anything to do with A.I., he added.The audience had to guess which actor was controlled by the A.I. The answer became clear soon after the cleaner took to the stage. \u201cI\u2019m a communist!\u201d she said, completely out of the blue. Later, she performed a U-turn. \u201cI\u2019m not a communist!\u201d she said. Then, out of nowhere she asked another member of the troupe, \u201cLook, do you wanna buy a knife?\u201dMr. Mirowski watched behind several laptops from the side of the stage. He was smiling. His A.I. was making no sense. But it was getting laughs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Lost the Fianc\u00e9 but Won the Honeymoon", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern Love\u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d people kept asking. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here?\u201dIn the preceding months, I had been in the fateful state of being both bored and in love, completing my Ph.D. in London while the man I was going to marry worked in Boston. In the rare books reading room at the British Library (where I went to write), I spent a lot of time entering online contests, filling out form after form in the hope of winning vacations, designer clothes and theater tickets.I didn\u2019t care what. All I wanted was distraction and to indulge the fantasy that my life was about to change with little effort from me. I was so indiscriminate and prolific that I lost track of what I had entered. But in my loved-up, idle state, it was quite likely I had tried my luck at winning a luxury honeymoon to India.I replied with probing questions, wary of falling for a scam. A response arrived that was reassuring and convincing. An itinerary was fixed upon. Flight dates were set. At no point were my credit card details or passport demanded.It was real. I was going to India.\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d I crowed to friends, family, anyone who would listen. \u201cCan you believe I actually won?\u201d It felt miraculous, this random gift from the universe.Friends looked at their shoes; my mother cleared her throat. Nobody wanted to ask, but somehow they managed: \u201cWho are you going to take with you?\u201dBecause 11 days before I\u2019d won, the man in Boston whom I loved, who I thought was going to marry me in a year, had Skyped to say he didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. The distance was exhausting. He needed to focus on his own life. He thought it would be best for both of us. He was sorry.I don\u2019t remember the call as it happened, but I recall the aftermath, when I was crying too hard to stay upright and crawled under my coffee table, howling like an injured animal. Friends arrived, peeled me off the floor, fed me and eased my path into the wilderness of heartbreak.Everywhere I looked, I saw question marks: What happened? What did I do wrong? Who will come with me on my honeymoon? What, really, have I won?The prize wasn\u2019t a gift from the universe so much as a cruel joke.Three months later, when I arrived at Delhi\u2019s Indira Gandhi International Airport with my best friend in tow (passed off as my \u201cmaid of honor\u201d to the company handling the travel arrangements, along with an implausible series of lies about why my husband was unable to come), a driver met us with a sign that read, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Stevens.\u201dWhen we got to the hotel, a man delivered cocktails to our room with a note congratulating the \u201chappy couple.\u201d He looked confusedly at the two of us and said, \u201cWhere is Mr. Stevens?\u201dAt breakfast the next day, the manager came to greet us as honored guests. \u201cOur lucky winners,\u201d he said, beaming, and then, \u201cMrs. Stevens, I am so sorry Mr. Stevens is not here.\u201dAround us: the happy murmuring of other people\u2019s conversations, cutlery scrapes, eruptions of laughter from distant tables. A brief silence, and then what could I say in response? Yes, me too? I too was sorry my husband wasn\u2019t there \u2014 sorrier than the hotel manager was, I bet. But the honeymoon went on, and so did the confusion of our hosts, at every stop on our itinerary. Rose petals on the beds, champagne chilled for our arrival, chocolates arranged in heart shapes on the pillows. My friend and I were careful to acknowledge and thank the hotels for these flourishes, and each time our awkwardness was reflected back on us tenfold by our hosts.They were baffled at the sight of two apparently unattached women sharing the honeymoon suite. The question that had been filling my brain before I arrived \u2014 \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201d \u2014 was now being posed, politely and persistently, on a balcony in Agra with a view of tiered swimming pools and the Taj Mahal, on the back of an elephant climbing to Jaipur\u2019s Amber Fort, on a boat gliding across Lake Pichola beneath a bat-filled sky.We got back from excursions to find the trappings of romance spirited away from our room and replaced by other, more platonic gifts: jewelry, scarves and once, unnervingly, a pair of dolls, nestled between the pillows. Then we\u2019d arrive at the next leg of the tour and it would happen all over again: \u201cWhere is your husband?\u201dI repeated this refrain, along with variations, to my best friend: \u201cWhere is he? Why isn\u2019t he here?\u201d The price she paid for this luxury vacation was having to endure the most miserable travel companion of all time. She swam and sunbathed, wore a succession of very good hats and bought a Kashmiri rug; I huddled in the corner of our room and called the man who had chosen not to be there, leaving voice mail messages: \u201cWhere are you? Why aren\u2019t you here?\u201d I was the most self-pitying of lucky winners, having won the honeymoon but lost the fianc\u00e9.Here\u2019s the lesson I was learning about winning: It is impermanent, unstable, transient. It isn\u2019t a happy ending, just punctuation between sentences, a triumphant pause before life rolls onward in uncontrollable directions.If you win one race but lose 15 others, have you won at all? If you earn someone\u2019s respect, attention and love, and then lose it again, what did you win? Winning can be lost. You can lose at winning.\u201cI\u2019m going to get him back,\u201d I said to my friend as we lounged by the pool, doused in dark yellow sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m going to win back his love.\u201dHer face in response: a perfect composite of pity, skepticism and restraint. She knew it wouldn\u2019t go that way, and knew, too, that I wasn\u2019t ready to hear it.Of course, I did not win him back. But here\u2019s another lesson I have learned about winning: not just how unstable it is or the way it can shift to loss, but how it can eventually transform into triumph all over again. How would it have been, I think now, if that trip had really been the beginning of my married life to the man in Boston? It would have been delirious, ecstatic. Ten days of happiness, followed by a month, or two months, or a year of contentment.And then, one by one, the problems the man predicted on that Skype call would have come to the fore: he needed to focus on his career and decide for himself what he wanted to do.And didn\u2019t I, really, prefer women to men? And didn\u2019t I, really, have an aversion to the straight and strait-laced married life I would have signed up for in the giddiness of love? My mood swings and impulsiveness would have frustrated him. His caution and risk aversion would have made me feel stifled. One of us would have been driven crazy by the way the other chewed or swallowed or breathed. In short, it would not have worked out. That win was never going to last.I am in love with someone else now, a woman, and happier than I have ever been. When I think back to the honeymoon, to the hotels and the good food, the gifts and the lovely, dusty luxury of it, I don\u2019t feel any loss at all. Those days my best friend and I spent in India, wandering through a choreographed, red-rose, moonlit version of romance without knowing the routine, was a premonition of queerness before my own queer life got underway.I could not have foreseen, on that lovelorn journey, that I would look back on it as one of the greatest examples of having it all. I want to crow to my heartbroken former self: \u201cYou got the honeymoon, but you didn\u2019t have to have the husband.\u201d What a coup! What a win! Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018Searching\u2019 Uses Tech Devices as Narrative Devices", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA thriller that takes place entirely on computer screens and apps required rethinking everything. The filmmakers explain \u2014 by text, Google Hangout and other platforms. Skype was on the fritz. I was trying to do a call with the filmmakers of \u201cSearching,\u201d a thriller that unfolds on computer screens and digital devices, but mine were not cooperating. The audio was clear but the filmmakers weren\u2019t showing up onscreen, and the clock was ticking. I didn\u2019t want to take time away to download an update to the app (and yes, I did that thing in which you deactivate and reactivate the camera button), so after some more fiddling, we decided to move the conversation to Google Hangouts instead. Trying to figure out the best way to communicate through constantly changing technology is the story of my life right now, probably yours as well. And using tech to solve problems is pretty much a daily task. \u201cSearching\u201d takes these ideas to the most urgent of places: How well could we navigate a sea of technology if someone\u2019s life depended on it? Much like those earlier films, \u201cSearching\u201d takes an unconventional approach to storytelling, which meant even the screenplay was written in an unconventional way. I asked Mr. Chaganty via iMessage about the difference. He texted, \u201cWhat we ended up writing was a scriptment \u2014 a creative mix of a screenplay and a treatment that factored in the mouse movement, text messages and browser windows.\u201dAnd yet, with all these forms of expression, sometimes they pull us away from those closest to us. That becomes clear when David realizes he doesn\u2019t know where his daughter has been spending her time. (In one scene, someone tells David that Margot has a Tumblr account. He Googles \u201ctumbler.\u201d) To visualize that difference, the filmmakers created a look for each character\u2019s computer. David\u2019s is more private, with less on his desktop and a sense of order. Margot\u2019s is a social world that keeps opening up further, forcing David to figure out how to navigate it. From her Facebook and Tumblr to a live-blogging site she uses called YouCast, Margot has crafted a life that is exposed and open to the world but completely hidden from her own father.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201dTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Traveling to the Ends of the Earth to Document Climate Change", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the 75-foot sailboat pulled up to the island near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, George Steinmetz looked through a pair of binoculars and just didn\u2019t see that many penguins.This was a problem. He had chartered the boat, or at least a berth and two days of its time during his 24 days on board, expressly for the opportunity to photograph this penguin colony.Then again, the fact that there were few birds was the very reason Mr. Steinmetz was there, camera in hand.\u201cThat was part of the story,\u201d he said.The penguins at Baily Head are one of nine subjects of a photo essay scattered throughout the pages of Sunday\u2019s magazine, with captions by the writer and researcher Jaime Lowe, which is otherwise devoted entirely to one article by Nathaniel Rich, a writer at large for the magazine. Mr. Rich\u2019s story takes place from 1979 to 1989, a decade during which, he writes, everyone was on board to do something about global warming. We came very close, but didn\u2019t take action.\u201cA lot of what we do when we talk about climate change is think about what\u2019s happening right now and what should be happening in the near future,\u201d Jake Silverstein, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said about Mr. Rich\u2019s story. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk a lot about the past, and how we got here; and that was the idea for this project.\u201dIn contrast, Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s photos serve as a reminder of what is nevertheless happening now. They depict \u201cthe consequences of the inaction\u201d outlined in Mr. Rich\u2019s story, Mr. Silverstein said.In most cases, Mr. Steinmetz researched and proposed the locations and what he wanted to shoot, then editors and researchers with the magazine talked to scientists to confirm that climate change had affected them.But then he had to get there and get the photo, and even for Mr. Steinmetz \u2014 a longtime contributor to the magazine and onetime National Geographic Adventurer of the Year \u2014 that proved stressful. When possible, he called around, did research and made good use of Google Earth to figure out specifically where and what he wanted to shoot, then used a drone to get the picture. But it wasn\u2019t always clear, or easy.When he got to Texas, he followed the forecast and the news that the rain was heading to Beaumont, Tex., a city near the Louisiana border that suffered extensive flooding. From the ground, the message from the air traffic control tower was that the airspace above Beaumont was closed. But he boarded a helicopter in Austin that took off at sunrise to see what was possible. In the air, with an experienced pilot who knew the area, he found that officials were more flexible.What he saw in Beaumont was devastating. In his photograph, suburban homes sit soaking in water for as far as the eye can see.\u201cThey were just drowned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no place for the water to go.\u201dGetting to Antarctica and photographing the penguins presented its own challenges. Conversations with scientists and wildlife photographer friends steered him toward Baily Head, but he was told there were no planes or helicopters that would get him there. After many disappointing replies, Mr. Steinmetz was able to negotiate two days of shooting as the only passenger on a boat hauling freight to resupply scientific bases.When they got to the island, he and the ship\u2019s first mate spent hours scouting the area to determine that the beach, where the remains of icebergs still hulked along the black volcanic sand, would be the best place to photograph.But how to get an aerial picture? Drone use is strictly controlled on the continent, and a flight over the penguin colony was a no-go.So Mr. Steinmetz turned to plan B: a 30-foot aluminum pole with a professional camera at the top. He and the first mate did their best to steady the camera in the wind while Mr. Steinmetz pushed the trigger via a wireless connection to his iPhone.The bleak view through the binoculars earlier was in part a matter of the time of day, and just before dark, penguins began assembling on the beach, waiting for a lull in the surf to waddle out and dive into the water in search of food for their mates.\u201cIt was really quite particular,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything\u2019s black and white with these penguins out there in little tuxedos.\u201dHe shot until the batteries went dead.Advertisement"}

Our tech columnist explains how the industry got here and what we can do.The web is in a dark place, as I plan to examine in the next several columns. If you need proof, look no further than autoplay videos, the first example.You\u2019re probably familiar with this horrendous experience: You are perusing a website, and suddenly an annoying voice or unfamiliar music blasts through your speakers. You wonder, where is this coming from? You scroll up and down the webpage only to realize that a video is playing without your consent. And the noise polluting your ears is coming from an ad preceding a video you had never clicked to watch.Autoplay videos are all over the web and inside apps. They are prominent in your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Some major news sites embed them into features and news articles. Nobody seems to likes autoplay videos \u2014 not even people I\u2019ve talked to in the ad industry. The indiscreet videos demand your attention while burning through your mobile data plan and sucking up your batteries. Yet they have become a necessary evil for many media publishers trying to survive in the digital age.\u201cI think we\u2019ve ended up in a really crappy user experience right now with video advertising,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads. \u201cVideo has been pushed into every user experience whether or not it fits, because it\u2019s a way to make more money.\u201d\u201cSight, sound and motion can make people laugh, make people cry, make them hug somebody,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cIt can make them love a brand. It can make them whistle a brand\u2019s theme song when they\u2019re walking a dog.\u201dYet publishers faced technical hurdles, like slow internet connections, that made video ads untenable. Instead, publishers served ads that were static images, which eventually evolved to become graphics with some animations and sound. Over the last decade, fast wired and wireless connections spread, as did computers and smartphones. Consumers also became acclimated to streaming video services like Netflix and YouTube. Serving an online video became easy. So advertising firms like BrightRoll and Tremor Video, along with tech companies like Facebook, began testing video ads.As annoying as they may be, autoplay videos are here to stay \u2014 largely because the ads generate so much money. But they are thankfully becoming less obnoxious.\u201cAutoplay with sound on is just going to go extinct,\u201d Mr. Wiegert said. \u201cIt\u2019s been deemed as a poor quality experience for users. Even I\u2019ve gotten annoyed when I\u2019ve been on a webpage and all of a sudden I hear sound coming through my speakers.\u201dYet Mr. Morgan of Simulmedia believes video ads will be forced to change more radically to give people fuller control over what they see. That\u2019s because autoplay videos still satisfy publishers, not the consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re putting those ads in those places because we can \u2014 not because it is the best for the user,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But I recently completed the one-day tour by bike with friends, and if you can stomach nine scoops and at least 40 miles (plus any pedaling to and from home), this might be the best day of your entire summer. Or at least, the most memorable.The bike ride, which includes a ferry ride to and from the newish location in Jersey City, should take at least four hours (but most likely several more, depending on where you live), so start by noon if you want to finish before nightfall.My crew began our ride at Jacob Riis, since the beach location closes earliest, picking up our punch cards (available at all locations, and to be stamped at each) and picking out our first flavors (Summer of Love, chock-full of cupcake pieces).Then we biked north, hitting the shops in Gowanus, the DeKalb Market Hall, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Jersey City, Bubby\u2019s, Gotham West Market and Astoria, occasionally making stops in between for some savory bites. We finished, sticky and exhausted, at the original shop in Prospect Heights after dusk (I went with strawberry and vanilla, trying for palate cleansers).No matter where you cap off your journey, you\u2019ll receive some deep admiration and a free last scoop from the staff, who also give each new Hillionaire Extraordinaire an Ample Hills-branded sticker, pin, tote bag, Frisbee, water bottle, cookbook and $5 toward future trips to Ample Hills.You\u2019ll have all of that nice merch, but also a story of an excellent summer day spent in New York.Tejal\u2019s Recommendations for Before You Bike: Gowanus EditionTejal\u2019s Recommendations for After You Bike: Gowanus EditionNearbyRequired ReadingMargot, What\u2019s the Plan?

{"Headline": "Charles Hamlen, Classical Music Manager With a Cause, Dies at 75", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles Hamlen, who co-founded one of classical music\u2019s leading management agencies, helped build the careers of young stars, including the violinist Joshua Bell, and then left the business to raise money to help people with AIDS, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.His death was announced by a close friend, David Landay. The cause was leukemia, he said.Mr. Hamlen\u2019s rise to the zenith of the classical music world \u2014 as a co-founder of IMG Artists, which represented many of the biggest stars in the field \u2014 was improbable, as he was the first to admit.He was a high school French teacher and playing piano on the side when he moved to New York in 1977 to try to make it as an artists\u2019 manager. He founded a small firm with Edna Landau and began building a roster of musicians and winning the respect of the industry \u2014 even as he and Ms. Landau struggled, often having to borrow, to make ends meet.He developed a reputation as a talent spotter who could forge good, open relationships with both artists and presenters. Mr. Bell recalled that soon after he made his debut, at 14, with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Mr. Hamlen visited and persuaded him \u2014 and his parents \u2014 to sign with his firm, which was still quite small in those days.\u201cHe kind of assured them that he wasn\u2019t a money-hungry manager trying to exploit a young person,\u201d Mr. Bell said in a telephone interview. He said that early on Mr. Hamlen had taken pains not to push him to play too much too soon, and would sometimes encourage him to take less lucrative chamber music gigs \u2014 with smaller fees, and smaller commissions \u2014 because he believed they would help him develop.\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m still in the business now, after many years, without having burned out \u2014 I think a lot of that has to do with him,\u201d Mr. Bell said.But with a small, not-very-well-known roster, the firm never seemed to have enough money to grow, Ms. Landau said in an interview. It began looking for investors.Lightning struck in 1984, when the firm was acquired by the International Management Group, a sports agency behemoth looking to expand into the performing arts. It was the classical music equivalent of a small start-up being bought by Google.(Over a round of golf, the soprano Kiri Te Kanawa had schooled the sports group\u2019s president, Mark McCormack, in the rarefied ways of high culture: \u201cThe first thing you have to know is it\u2019s intermission, not halftime.\u201d)Over the years Mr. Hamlen personally managed \u2014 or \u201clooked after,\u201d in the genteel phrase preferred by the industry \u2014 the flutist James Galway; the pianists Stephen Hough, Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Andr\u00e9 Watts, in addition to Mr. Kissin; and, besides Mr. Bell, violinists like Leila Josefowicz. More stars flocked to IMG as it grew.But within a few years a personal tragedy, the death of his partner, Carlos Flor, from AIDS in 1988, set him on a new path. As many of his friends became sick in those years, he reassessed his life.\u201cI remember thinking then that, as well as I do artist management, others do it as well and better,\u201d Mr. Hamlen told The New York Times. \u201cBut I was the only one who could be there for my friends. How this might connect to my professional life in music I didn\u2019t see at first.\u201dCharles Ewing Hamlen was born on July 9, 1943, in Schenectady, N.Y., the youngest of four children. His father, Richard, worked at General Electric and his mother, Caroline, was a librarian. He studied piano and cello as a child, graduated from Harvard College, where he majored in French language and literature, in 1965, and started out as a high school French teacher. A marriage in 1969 ended in divorce; he said it was later he understood that he was gay.He is survived by two sisters, Ann Goldsmith, a poet, and Katherine Reed, as well as nieces and nephews.Mr. Hamlen led Classical Action for 16 years, sometimes raising money with intimate concerts in private homes with some of classical music\u2019s biggest stars. He cut overhead costs by merging with Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, his original inspiration for the group.When he left, he became artistic adviser to the Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s in New York.While he took great pride in the money he had raised to address the AIDS crisis, Mr. Hamlen recalled that it had not been easy to walk away from the successful business he had helped build.\u201cI remember grappling with the possibility of changing my life and taking this on,\u201d he said. \u201cOne moment you think, What a great thing; the next you think, You are out of your mind.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Bailout Is Ending. The Pain Is Far From Over.", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 When Dimitris Zafiriou landed a coveted full-time job two months ago, the salary was only half what he earned before Greece\u2019s debt crisis. Yet after years of struggling, it was a step up.\u201cNow, our family has zero money left over at the end of the month,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou, 47, a specialist in metal building infrastructure, said with a grim laugh. \u201cBut zero is better than what we had before, when we couldn\u2019t pay the bills at all.\u201d\u201cAny society that lost a quarter of its economy will have severe social problems,\u201d Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview. \u201cBut things are improving, and people can see that they are improving.\u201dA newly stable economy has prompted a return to hiring at the Greek construction company where Mr. Zafiriou recently landed work. But his monthly pay of \u20ac800 is far below the \u20ac1,500 he used to earn, at a construction firm where he was employed for 20 years. When the crisis hit, that firm delayed paying employees, first by two months, then four \u2014 a practice that became common at many businesses.His wife, Sotiria, went unpaid for almost a year in 2013, after the Greek supermarket chain where she worked declared bankruptcy. Another company bought it, and her monthly salary of \u20ac1,100 was cut to \u20ac800. She was eventually paid about half of what she was owed. But Mr. Zafiriou said he never received nearly \u20ac13,000 in back pay from his old firm.The family\u2019s bills quickly became insurmountable. They could no longer pay for electricity or a loan on their modest two-bedroom apartment in Keratsini, a working-class suburb of Piraeus, near Athens. The only thing shielding them from eviction \u2014 along with thousands of Greeks in similar straits \u2014 was a law forbidding banks from repossessing most borrowers\u2019 primary homes.The family slashed spending on clothing and groceries, and halted therapy for their daughter, Anamaria, 13, who has dyslexia. Low on cash, Mr. Zafiriou sold all of their gold jewelry, except for the cross used at Anamaria\u2019s christening.With his new job, things are looking up. The couple has rehired a tutor for Anamaria, and Mrs. Zafiriou no longer needs to shop for the very cheapest produce or meat. The primary aim is to pay down all the family\u2019s debts as quickly as possible, even if that leaves nothing at the end of the month.\u201cGreece is getting better,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean things have turned around.\u201dThat outlook has lent a sense that the crisis may at last be fading.Other jobs are being created as manufacturers shift sales outside the Greek market, stoking a rise in exports, which now make up a third of economic activity, up from a quarter before the crisis.Mr. Vasiliou said he turned a profit last year for the first time since the crisis, and added 25 employees to his 143-person work force. All but 10 are on permanent contracts, averaging \u20ac1,100 a month \u2014 a decent salary in today\u2019s economy.Yet for the vast majority of workers, Greece\u2019s labor market remains a rough-and-tumble landscape.Today, a growing share of jobs are minimum wage. At least half involve temporary or part-time contracts. While that helps lower unemployment figures, many private-sector employees now earn less-than-poverty wages, according to the O.E.C.D., as do nearly half of Greek households with two children. Others work even more precariously with no contract at all, as employers seek to evade paying overtime and social security charges.It is a sign of the uneasy nature of Greece\u2019s recovery that, even with a coveted full-time contract, Mr. Zafiriou, the construction worker, remains wary. He has been working since June, but many companies have shed employees just before their one-year work anniversary, after which they would have become harder to fire.For those who fell further during the crisis, even getting to that point seems out of reach.Mrs. Pavlioti, a former supervisor at a Greek polling company, never dreamed she would need social assistance. Her daughter was born at the start of the crisis, but by the time her maternity leave ended, the company had downsized and she could not find other work. Her husband lost his job as a security guard. The financial loss strained their marriage, and she filed for divorce \u2014 something increasing numbers of Greeks are resorting to since the crisis began.Eventually, she found informal work cleaning houses and caring for the elderly, including changing their adult diapers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I had fallen so far,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said, fighting back tears. \u201cIt shook my self-image and confidence.\u201dPraksis offers job counseling, as well as psychological and financial support. It still is not enough. As a single mother, Mrs. Pavlioti needs state-financed child care, but does not qualify because her divorce is pending.The longer she stays out of the formal job market, the harder it is to get back in. Recently she took a job as a babysitter with flexible hours, earning \u20ac450 a month \u2014 enough to pay the rent and bills, though not much else.\u201cThe end of the bailout makes no difference in our lives,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said. \u201cWe are just surviving, not living.\u201dMaria Louka and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anonymous+Pro');\nFar from the oft-criticized homogeneity of Silicon Valley, New York\u2019s very identity is a reflection of its eclectic mix of races and cultures. That puts the Big Apple in a unique position to address a diversity problem that plagues the tech industry on the opposite coast.\n \nFrom fashion to finance, New York tech is a melting pot of startups, established companies and industries. And the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program channels the variety of backgrounds, perspectives and professions to foster multidisciplinary thinkers who can diversify an overwhelmingly white and male tech industry in the United States.A focus on diversity attracts tech talent to the city, according to a 2018 survey by the nonprofit Tech: NYC, with 89 percent of respondents citing the diverse population as a draw and 74 percent citing the variety of industries to choose from as a lure.\n \n\u201cDiversity is very important for innovation, as people with different perspectives, training, backgrounds and cultures come together to look at the same problem differently,\u201d said Erik Grimmelmann, president of the nonprofit NY Tech Alliance.In New York\u2019s tech sector, gender, ethnic and racial diversity start in the classroom. The Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management and Cornell Tech started the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program in 2014, taking up temporary residence in Google office space in New York and officially relocating to Cornell Tech\u2019s 12-acre campus on Manhattan\u2019s Roosevelt Island in fall 2017. The program has since attracted women, minorities and international students with resumes and interests from an array of backgrounds.\u201cThe amazing thing about building an [academic program] from scratch is that you can be really deliberate about important things like diversity,\u201d said Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, which supports the city\u2019s tech sector.The Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was built around the concept that the best leaders and innovators have a variety of skill sets, and that they seek out unique perspectives in others. That\u2019s evident in the way student teams in the program\u2019s Studio curriculum mimic the most successful tech companies, said Mukti Khaire, the Girish and Jaidev Reddy Professor of Practice at Cornell Tech and the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.Some projects might see a computer scientist paired with, say, a market expert and a designer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than to show students that diversity is important in these teams for really creative problem solving,\u201d Khaire said.John Quinn, who graduated in spring 2018, said he had to up his game academically and creatively because of the mix of races, ages and backgrounds. Quinn\u2019s career was on track, with him working in digital payments at MasterCard in Dublin, his hometown. But he realized tech expertise alone wasn\u2019t enough to continue advancing at the company. Now, with a Johnson Cornell Tech MBA, he\u2019s starting a new role at MasterCard\u2019s NYC Technology Hub.For Quinn, diversity and inclusion workshops on campus were also eye openers.\u201cIt was amazing how honest people could be,\u201d he said, referring to sessions in which women and minorities spoke about the challenges they face in tech. \u201cIt will make me a better co-worker and a better manager to be aware of these things.\u201dNew York\u2019s large and diverse network of students, workers and entrepreneurs attracts tech professionals who might otherwise have headed to Silicon Valley. On the West Coast, \u201cYou get a lot of homogeneity in thought and how people approach problems,\u201d said David Cheng, a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad.That\u2019s a big reason Cheng, a former software engineer and consultant in Washington, chose New York to start a mobile speech therapy app he developed with classmates. Just last year, Speech Up won Cornell Tech\u2019s Startup Award, which included workspace at its Tata Innovation Center, where students and companies work to bring new ideas to market.Cheng, who attended speech therapy sessions as a child, said he was drawn to New York because so many of its industries are reinventing themselves through tech. \u201cBeing part of the community that is doing that is something that really appealed to me,\u201d he said.Kendall Jakes, also a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad, said the program\u2019s multicultural and multidisciplinary approach attracted her as well. She worked for a Chicago food company in a role that combined technology and business. But as she looked into M.B.A. programs to help with her next career, she found most wanted to put her in either a tech or a business \u201cbucket.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t how the world works. Why should we be siloed?\u201d said Jakes, now a technical solutions specialist at Microsoft\u2019s New York office, adding that the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was a place where she was totally accepted.Jakes also said she loved that her class was 40 percent female, a contrast to the broader U.S. tech workforce, which is 76 percent male. \u201cWe were a force to be reckoned with,\u201d she said.New York\u2019s thriving tech industry is no Silicon Valley, and that\u2019s just fine, said Grimmelmann, the NY Tech Alliance president.\u201cOut West, it\u2019s all tech, all the time,\u201d he said. Conversely, New York mixes tech with other disciplines and radically changes them. FinTech, EdTech and HealthTech, for example, are flourishing in the city.Diversity in industries, cultures and backgrounds creates the best innovators and leaders, said Samuels, Tech:NYC's executive director. \u201cThe most successful employees,\u201d she said, \u201care the ones who are really good at problem solving and can navigate a fast-growing company \u2014 versus stay in your lane and do your own job.\u201dJakes agrees.

{"Headline": "A Labor Day Thank You for the Arts", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis holiday weekend we tip our hats to those performers and others who work days, nights and weekends to enrich your cultural experiences.Mike Seaman has worked at Storm King Art Center for almost 20 years. These days he oversees a team of seven that maintains the art, buildings and landscape at the 500-acre sculpture park in New Windsor, N.Y., about an hour north of New York City. With his wide range of responsibilities, he is particularly aware of how the property\u2019s pieces all fit together. \u201cThe sculptures at Storm King are surrounded by nature, and the landscape plays an active role in how you view a work of art,\u201d he said. \u201cI would encourage visitors to be mindful of how the landscape has been sculpted and tended specifically to display art.\u201dMr. Seaman\u2019s expert recommendation: Check out the view from the park\u2019s Museum Hill, standing near Isamu Noguchi\u2019s \u201cMomo Taro,\u201d facing north toward Alexander Liberman\u2019s \u201cAdam\u201d and Alice Aycock\u2019s \u201cThree-Fold Manifestation II.\u201d You\u2019ll see the monumental sculptures framed by lush lawns and the Hudson Valley\u2019s rolling hills. \u201cThis\u2019ll be the first time I\u2019m playing at Warm Up, but I\u2019ve been to so many over the years. I love playing at institutions like museums because people come with a really open mind. At PS1, every time I\u2019m there it feels like the audience is really a wild card: It\u2019s such a mix of different people and backgrounds. I love being in places like that because you never know how people will interact.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research that goes into my sets. I do a lot of digging on YouTube. I really like to tell a story so there are different arcs and peaks and valleys. But at the end of the day, when I get into the space, I don\u2019t always go as planned. I\u2019ll vibe off the audience.\u201cI became artistic and executive director in 2003, and that gave me a little more freedom. I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t this be fun, to have a festival all by living composers.\u2019 And things just started to happen.\u201cIt takes over a year of planning, or more than that. You\u2019re looking for pieces, and sometimes they\u2019re ready and sometimes they\u2019re not. Peri Mauer has written for contrabass flute and cello, which I thought was very neat, because I didn\u2019t know anything like that. And I had lots of fun with guys like [the saxophonist] Daniel Schnyder and [the trombonist] David Taylor. They just did a duo album, and Daniel wanted to write something that I could play with them. So he wrote some interesting trios for the three of us.\u201cYou have to stay open, read a lot, listen a lot, Google a lot. People keep in touch; they send their scores; they send their recordings. I already have ideas about performers I want to invite next year, and some pieces I want to ask people to write.\u201cAs a comedian myself, I recognize that I am very fortunate to be getting paid to be around such a community of comedians who encourage art and look out for one another \u2014 I\u2019ve never really experienced that anywhere else. I feel as if I am doing something important, and I appreciate every time I walk through that glass door.\u201d\u201cI found out about Aloha Nights through my halau hula [hula school]. I love it. There are so many amazing groups who have been performing. It\u2019s not only about hula, it\u2019s also about other Hawaiian art, such as lei making, and other cultural traditions. I wish I could be there every weekend.\u201cWe start off the evening by welcoming the visitors and then we perform about a 20-minute routine \u2014 all hula auana, meaning modern hula,\u201d she said last weekend before a performance. \u201cThen I will be sharing a hula that I choreographed myself, and I will be teaching the hula basics as well as the full choreography.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been performing for 26 years. I\u2019ve taught many, many beginners. Some people pick it up easily and some people, it takes years for them to refine their technique. So it is challenging.\u201cSo many people just think hula is a form of entertainment, but it\u2019s very much deeply rooted to spirituality as well. There are some dances that are solely for ritual, and there are also dances for procreation. And then there are some songs that elicit romance.\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed the 1920s and \u201930s,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I lived back then, I would have loved to have worked with someone like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd or Laurel and Hardy. This is fulfilling a fantasy, because in a way I am working with them.\u201dHis Labor Day weekend selection, Frank Borzage\u2019s 1920 film \u201cHumoresque,\u201d is a rarity he wishes to share with more viewers. For the first time in his decades-long career, Mr. Sterner will be presenting his score with another musician, the violinist Maria Im. \u201cOur audience is very diverse \u2014 Yiddish speakers, people who don\u2019t speak Yiddish but have some connection to Jewish culture \u2014 and we do have a number of older audience members, who do sometimes require a little bit of help. Of course one of the main challenges that arises is that our audience is very excited to be watching the show, and occasionally we\u2019ll have someone who wants to remember the moment by taking a picture. Just the other day someone was about to film in the back row, and I just went up to him and gently got his attention and he very quickly put his phone away. When phones ring, we do the same thing, but we do occasionally have to manually show people \u2014 people will hand us their phones so we can turn them off for them.\u201d\u201cA lot of the programming that I try to pursue tends to be, if not straight up works of nonfiction, then works that kind of play around with notions of nonfiction. Though there\u2019s great programming of that throughout the city, for this community in Queens, I hadn\u2019t seen that approach yet.\u201cHaving worked weekends that are holiday weekends before, I actually think that probably the best part of my job is being present with an audience. This is who you do it for. You do all that work during the week to put on a show \u2014 you want to be there for the show. Advertisement"}

Obama officials and Congress clearly made a big mistake early in the recession by focusing more intently on saving banks \u2014 and, thus, bankers and investors \u2014 and much less on directly helping families facing foreclosures and layoffs. Later in the recovery, the decision by Republican leaders in Congress to oppose every Obama proposal prevented the government from doing much to help people regain what they had lost or to heat up the tepid recovery with infrastructure spending and other stimulus measures. This is because as workers\u2019 incomes have stalled, corporate profits have shot up, especially for a small number of what some experts call \u201csuperstar firms,\u201d including technology giants like Apple; Alphabet, which owns Google; and Facebook.

{"Headline": "Demystifying Online Privacy, Through the Story of the Man Who Took On Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI usually think of myself as a politics reporter, the job I\u2019ve had, on and off, for most of my career. But in the last year or so, I\u2019ve had to add another title, one I never thought I\u2019d have: tech reporter.My colleagues and I have reported extensively over the last year on the enormous power wielded by tech companies over politics and commerce and on the ways in which that power can be abused. Our reporting has shed light on how poorly tech companies protect the integrity of their platforms and of the data you hand them for free, with profound consequences.Yet both Facebook and Google, and the broader tech industry of which they are a part, have escaped any major regulation or seriously punitive government action in the United States. (In Europe, Google was recently hit with a $5 billion fine for antitrust violations.) Even after a cascade of scandals, Washington had done almost nothing. Why?Mr. Mactaggart, who last year began organizing to pass a California ballot initiative restricting the abuse of personal data, turned out to be an ideal way to answer the question. For one thing, his campaign was happening in real time, and as a political neophyte, he was encountering Silicon Valley\u2019s political machine for the first time, much as most readers would be. Mr. Mactaggart was not an expert on privacy when he started; he was a wealthy real estate developer from Oakland, whose main interaction with people in the tech world was at Bay Area birthday parties and his neighborhood dog run. He more or less fell into a rabbit hole and became a little obsessed. That journey allowed me to turn an arcane and often boring subject into a compelling yarn; his education \u2014 as a political campaigner and as a consumer \u2014 becomes the reader\u2019s.That was important for me, too, as a reporter. I often write about complex policy issues, and questions surrounding data collection, advertising and privacy can be challenging to unspool in a compelling, accessible way.I used to write about campaign finance; that\u2019s a complicated topic, too, and it was easy to lose readers\u2019 attention. But writing about data and privacy is harder. Presidential campaigns lend a certain innate drama to stories about donors and fund-raising. Tech and social media, while in one sense nearer to people\u2019s daily lives, can seem distant and abstract. For those who have no background in programming or data science, the industry they animate can seem impenetrable.This is no accident. One reason Big Tech faces so little resistance from policymakers is that Silicon Valley\u2019s business seems so daunting. I find that Big Tech\u2019s lobbyists and \u201cthought leaders\u201d \u2014 and some journalists \u2014 implicitly and sometimes explicitly promote the idea that policymakers are too dumb, slow or unsophisticated to understand how it all works, let alone regulate something like data collection practices. This notion also helps insulate the industry from accountability.The story of how Mr. Mactaggart forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law is, in part, a story of the power of this idea \u2014 and also of its flimsiness. The law he helped pass is not a panacea, and won\u2019t solve every problem raised by the encroaching powers of Big Tech. Some critics believe the law doesn\u2019t go far enough. (And many in the industry believe it goes way too far.) But the fact of it \u2014 the political proof of concept \u2014 has already stirred intense debate and pressure to produce even more protections for consumers, not only in other states but in Washington.That matters not only for consumers, but also for readers. Mr. Mactaggart is a smart guy, and he had time and resources most people don\u2019t. But he\u2019s not an expert on politics or technology. If he can figure it out, so can you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Enquirer Had Decades of Trump Dirt. He Wanted to Buy It All.", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal investigators have provided ample evidence that President Trump was involved in deals to pay two women to keep them from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about affairs that they said they had with him.But it turns out that Mr. Trump wanted to go even further.He and his lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, devised a plan to buy up all the dirt on Mr. Trump that the National Enquirer and its parent company had collected on him, dating back to the 1980s, according to several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.The existence of the plan, which was never finalized, has not been reported before. But it was strongly hinted at in a recording that Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer released last month of a conversation about payoffs that Mr. Cohen had with Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s all the stuff \u2014 all the stuff, because you never know,\u201d Mr. Cohen said on the recording.The move by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen indicated just how concerned they were about all the information amassed by the company, American Media, and its chairman, David Pecker, a loyal Trump ally of two decades who has cooperated with investigators.The people who knew about the discussions would speak about them only on condition of anonymity, given that they are now the potential subject of a federal investigation that did not end with Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea.Lawyers for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen declined to comment for this article as did American Media.It is not known how much of the material on Mr. Trump is still in American Media\u2019s possession or whether American Media destroyed any of it after the campaign. Prosecutors have not said whether they have obtained any of the material beyond that which pertains to Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford and the discussions about their arrangements.For the better part of two decades, Mr. Pecker had ordered his staff at American Media to protect Mr. Trump from troublesome stories, in some cases by buying up stories about him and filing them away.In 2016, he kept his staff from going back through the old Trump tip and story files that dated to before Mr. Pecker became company chairman in 1999, several former staff members said in interviews with The New York Times.That meant that American Media, the nation\u2019s largest gossip publisher, did not play a role during the election year in vetting a presidential candidacy \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 made for the tabloids.In August 2016, American Media acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her career as a fitness specialist. But American Media never published her allegations about a relationship with Mr. Trump.Shortly after American Media completed the arrangement with Ms. McDougal at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest, a troubling question began to nag at Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, according to several people who knew about the discussions at the time: What would happen to America Media\u2019s sensitive Trump files if Mr. Pecker were to leave the company?Mr. Cohen, those people said, was hearing rumors that Mr. Pecker might leave American Media for Time magazine \u2014 a title Mr. Pecker is known to have dreams of running.There was perennial talk about American Media\u2019s business troubles. And Mr. Trump appeared to take a world-wearier view of the wisdom of leaving his sensitive personal secrets in someone else\u2019s hands:\u201cMaybe he gets hit by a truck,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Pecker in a conversation with Mr. Cohen, musing about an unfortunate mishap befalling his good friend.When The Times first reported that the recording had been discovered by the F.B.I., people close to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump initially described it in the narrow context of Ms. McDougal\u2019s deal.But Mr. Cohen, in fact, indicates in the audio that he and Mr. Trump are speaking about an arrangement involving far more.\u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info, regarding our friend David,\u201d Mr. Cohen says in reference to Mr. Pecker.The plan got far enough along that Mr. Cohen relays in the recorded conversation that he had discussed paying for all the information from American Media with the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,\u201d he says, adding about Mr. Pecker, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay him something.\u201dIn the end, the deal never came together.When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty, prosecutors said in court documents that Mr. Cohen and American Media did enter into a deal in which Mr. Cohen agreed to pay the company $125,000 for the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story.After the deal was signed but before Mr. Cohen paid, prosecutors said, American Media backed out of the arrangement and warned Mr. Cohen to shred the paperwork (he did not).Prosecutors said there had been discussions between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen in which Mr. Cohen said American Media would be reimbursed for the payment to Ms. McDougal.The notoriously frugal Mr. Trump balked at doing so, causing Mr. Pecker anxiety about explaining the payout to his board, according to a person briefed on the discussions. It was unclear whether Mr. Trump ever provided a reimbursement.Mr. Weisselberg ultimately provided information about Mr. Cohen under a deal that protected him from self-incrimination. As prosecutors continue in their investigation, Mr. Weisselberg could serve as a particularly helpful guide through the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.Mr. Pecker, whose company is expected to be of continued interest in the investigation, has a similar arrangement with prosecutors. Potentially as worrisome for Mr. Trump and his advisers, Mr. Pecker could be a particularly knowing guide through any other potentially illegal efforts made to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy from his own less savory exploits.He added, \u201cLook to whom the government is reportedly giving immunity to. Those individuals are the ones who would have knowledge about what, if anything, the campaign at the highest, or lowest, or any level in between had on this issue.\u201dPeople with knowledge of American Media\u2019s operations, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, described the files on Mr. Trump as mostly older National Enquirer stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s marital woes and lawsuits; related story notes and lists of sensitive sources; some tips about alleged affairs; and minutia, like allegations of unscrupulous golfing.Many of the older National Enquirer stories are often not accessible through Google or databases like Nexis.Several former American Media staff members said that at the very least, the material the company had on Mr. Trump would have put its flagship, The Enquirer, in a prime position to dominate on coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s scandalous past.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Artificial Intelligence Is Now a Pentagon Priority. Will Silicon Valley Help?", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In a May memo to President Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis implored him to create a national strategy for artificial intelligence.Mr. Mattis\u2019s memo, which has not been reported before and was viewed by The New York Times, reflected a growing sense of urgency among defense officials about artificial intelligence. The consultants and planners who try to forecast threats think A.I. could be the next technological game changer in warfare.The Chinese government has raised the stakes with its own national strategy. Academic and commercial organizations in China have been open about working closely with the military on A.I. projects. They call it \u201cmilitary-civil fusion.\u201dNonetheless, the Pentagon appears to be pushing ahead on its own, looking for ways to strengthen its ties with A.I. researchers, particularly in Silicon Valley, where there is considerable wariness about working with the military and intelligence agencies.The Defense Department wants to shift $75 million of its annual budget into the new office and a total of $1.7 billion over five years, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not allowed to speak about it publicly.Known as \u201cthe Jake,\u201d the center is billed as a way of facilitating dozens of A.I. projects across the Defense Department. This includes Project Maven, an effort to build technology to identify people and things in video captured by drones that has come to symbolize the ideological gap between the government and Silicon Valley.But in the eyes of some researchers, creating robotic vehicles and developing robotic weapons are very different. And they fear that autonomous weapons pose an unusual threat to humans.\u201cThis is a unique moment, with so much activism coming out of Silicon Valley,\u201d said Elsa Kania, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that explores policy related to national security and defense. \u201cSome of it is informed by the political situation, but it also reflects deep concern over the militarization of these technologies as well as their application to surveillance.\u201dThe Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, officials hope, will help close that gap.\u201cOne of our greatest national strengths is the innovation and talent found in our private sector and academic institutions, enabled by free and open society,\u201d Brendan McCord, a former Navy submarine officer and an A.I. start-up veteran who will lead the center, said during a public meeting in Silicon Valley last month. \u201cThe JAIC will help evolve our partnerships with industry, academia, allies.\u201dThe center, he added, will work with \u201ctraditional and nontraditional innovators alike,\u201d meaning longtime government contractors like Lockheed Martin as well as newer Silicon Valley companies. The Pentagon has worked with more than 20 companies on Project Maven so far, but it hopes to expand this work and overcome the reluctance among workers.This summer, a Pentagon researcher worked alongside a small but influential Silicon Valley artificial intelligence lab, Fast.ai, on a public effort to build technology capable of accelerating the development of A.I. systems.Autonomous systems are based on algorithms that can learn to do things like recognize objects by analyzing vast amounts of data. The Fast.ai project would improve the speed of that A.I. \u201ctraining.\u201dThe Pentagon is also offering an olive branch to its Silicon Valley critics. While unveiling the JAIC, Mr. McCord said its focus would include \u201cethics, humanitarian considerations, and both short-term and long-term A.I. safety.\u201dIt was an important step toward reaching d\u00e9tente with A.I. researchers, said Sophie-Charlotte Fischer, a researcher at Center of Security Studies at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland who specializes in the relationship between the tech industry and government. \u201cThere needs to be a clear understanding of what it means to develop and deploy these A.I. technologies,\u201d she said.Will it be enough? Skeptics want to see the details. \u201cSo far, the plans remain very abstract,\u201d Ms. Fischer said. \u201cWhat kind of systems do they want to allow? Do they want to attach weapons systems to A.I.?\u201dRobert Work, the former deputy secretary of defense who founded Project Maven, worries that the Google protest has skewed the perception of the project, which does not yet involve lethal weapons, and stunted public discussion of how military technology should evolve.\u201cWe need to have an open debate about A.I. and its consequences and hear arguments from all sides,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Advertisement"}

(Al Jazeera and The Post said the workers were not authorized to make such purchases and were no longer employed there.)Multiple musicians bought views to appear more popular: YouTube views factor into metrics from the ratings company Nielsen and song charts including Billboard\u2019s Hot 100.Some companies bought views for clients with the promise of social media promotion that would result in real people watching their videos.Dr. Judith Oppenheimer, 78, paid a company $5,000 to promote a book she had self-published in hopes of securing a mainstream deal. Her video soon had over 58,000 views, delivered through Devumi.\u201cThere was no increase in sales and no book deal,\u201d she said. \u201cSoon after I signed the contract I thought, \u2018I\u2019ll have no proof of what they do or don\u2019t do.\u2019 Now it begins to make sense. They can do it in a day.\u201dPurveyors depend on constantly evolving tactics to deliver views, including automated or \u201cbot\u201d traffic and pop-under videos on unsuspecting users\u2019 computers, but YouTube says it has effective processes to defend against these approaches.\u201cThis has been a problem we have been working on for many, many years,\u201d said Jennifer Flannery O\u2019Connor, YouTube\u2019s director of product management. The company\u2019s systems continuously monitor a video\u2019s activity, and the anti-fraud team often buys views to understand better how these sites operate, she said. \u201cOur anomaly detection systems are really good.\u201dStill, the challenges are significant. At one point in 2013, YouTube had as much traffic from bots masquerading as people as it did from real human visitors, according to the company. Some employees feared this would cause the fraud detection system to flip, classifying fake traffic as real and vice versa \u2014 a prospect engineers called \u201cthe Inversion.\u201d\u201cThe problem itself was extraordinary,\u201d said Blake Livingston, a member of YouTube\u2019s fraud and abuse team at the time who has since left the company.But fixes were made that relieved the fake-traffic surge, which YouTube said resulted from an attack against the website.\u201cView count manipulation will be a problem as long as views and the popularity they signal are the currency of YouTube,\u201d Mr. Livingston said.It took Mr. Vassilev about 18 months to go from being on welfare and living with his father in Canada to buying a white BMW 328i and a house of his own.By late 2014, his website was on the first page of Google search results for buying YouTube views, fulfilling 150 to 200 orders a day and bringing in more than $30,000 a month, he said. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t believe you could make that much money online,\u201d he said. The Times reporter\u2019s order on his site, for 25,000 views, was fulfilled one day later.A spokeswoman for Google, which is owned by the same company as YouTube, said that sites selling views appeared in search results because they were relevant, but that there was \u201croom for improvement\u201d in warning users.Mr. Vassilev declined to name his clients but said that many orders came from public relations or marketing firms.Today, he fills most orders through SMMKings.com, a wholesale supplier run by Sean Tamir, 29. Mr. Tamir charges him about a dollar for a thousand views, which Mr. Vassilev resells for $13.99, throwing in 100 free likes.One purveyor, Carlton E. Bynum II, 24, uses advertising to attract customers. He collected more than $191,000 in revenue this year but spent over $109,000 in ads that appeared at the top of Google, according to financial records. His site, GetLikes.click, run from a home office in Houston, sells YouTube views as well as Instagram and Twitter followers, Facebook likes and SoundCloud plays.Google does not allow ads with terms like \u201cbuy YouTube views.\u201d But Mr. Bynum said one workaround was to misspell the words and submit an ad multiple times if it was denied at first. When asked about advertising for paid YouTube views, Google removed some of the ads, including Mr. Bynum\u2019s, but similar ones returned after two weeks.Before Mr. Bynum sold views, he was buying them for himself. After he was discharged from the Marine Corps last year, he began posting product reviews on YouTube and taking a cut when visitors made purchases using his links. The views he bought would often cause his videos to rank higher than his competitors\u2019 in search, he said. The effect would snowball: His videos would gain traffic through search, and he would make more money. (A YouTube spokeswoman said views were just one factor among many that affected search rankings.)\u201cIt worked great,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get views within a day. I can get likes within hours.\u201dMr. Bynum said he believed real people were watching his videos. \u201cBut let\u2019s say there\u2019s a small chance I\u2019m wrong and it is bots,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir videos are still getting ranked.\u201dMr. Vassilev, who also said he used fake views to increase the search ranking of videos promoting his website, makes no pretense that what he is selling is authentic viewership. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.The salesman on the phone said it would be simple: Elizabeth Clayton, a retired English and psychology professor, could pay Hancock Press $4,200 to publicize her self-published works of poetry. The company said online promotion, including 40,000 guaranteed YouTube views, would translate into sales, emails show.Ms. Clayton, 77, was optimistic. She had been publishing for seven years but had not sold much. One royalty check came to $1.47, another to $0.75. She signed up for Hancock to promote two videos, costing her $8,400, records show.\u201cThey told me if I got a certain number of hits I would sell a certain amount,\u201d she said.Instead of traditional marketing, Hancock paid $270 for 55,000 views from Devumi for each video, the records show. The views eventually reached about 60,000, where they remain. But there was no increase in sales. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t tell me anything about the people that were watching the video,\u201d Ms. Clayton said. \u201cI suspected something, but I couldn\u2019t get any information.\u201dWayne Hancock, the 92-year-old chief executive of the Arkansas-based company, said he believed real people were watching the videos. That\u2019s how Devumi marketed its views. Mr. Hancock\u2019s daughter, K. C. Shay, who helps run the business, dismissed Ms. Clayton\u2019s documents and the Devumi receipts as fakes.But Devumi records show that Hancock Press spent about $26,000 over three years, obtaining more than five million views for 75 or so authors. Interviews with six other Hancock clients are consistent with Ms. Clayton\u2019s experience.Many Devumi clients came from the music industry, where buying views is common and often seen as necessary. \u201cYouTube is one of the premier sources of music consumption and an important indicator of musical trends and popularity,\u201d said Silvio Pietroluongo, a vice president at Billboard.As a new artist, Aleem Khalid hired Crowd Surf, a promotion company, in 2014. Without his knowledge, he said, the firm bought 10,000 views each on three of his videos. They now have between 11,000 and 42,000 views. \u201cThe beautiful thing about these social media platforms is when they came out it was genuine. But now I feel it\u2019s all fake,\u201d said Mr. Khalid, 25. (Cassie Petrey, a co-founder of Crowd Surf, said she thought Devumi was producing real views, based on statements on its website.)Others who relied on Devumi said they were similarly surprised at the company\u2019s tactics. Ami Horowitz, the conservative filmmaker, bought 10,000 views for a video he appeared in \u2014 \u201cWhat We Learned at the People\u2019s Climate March\u201d \u2014 on the YouTube channel for Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 political influence group. Mr. Horowitz, who is often a guest on Fox News, also bought views for a video about the protests in Ferguson, Mo.In a statement, he said he had believed Devumi worked like traditional web advertising. But \u201cit wasn\u2019t what we expected,\u201d he said, adding that he never used Devumi or similar services again. A spokeswoman for Americans for Prosperity called the behavior unethical and said the group would \u201cnot knowingly engage\u201d in it.YouTube\u2019s engineers, statisticians and data scientists are constantly improving in their ability to fight what Ms. O\u2019Connor calls a \u201cvery hard problem,\u201d but the attacks have \u201ccontinually gotten stronger and more sophisticated,\u201d she said.After the Times reporter presented YouTube with the videos for which he had bought views, the company said sellers had exploited two vulnerabilities that had already been fixed. Later that day, the reporter bought more views from six of the same vendors. The view count rose again, though more slowly. A week later, all but two of the vendors had delivered the full amount.By Michael H. Keller | Source: New York TimesEven when it looks closely, YouTube can miss videos with fake views. A 2017 Google public report on disinformation during the 2016 election looked at RT\u2019s YouTube channels, concluding that there was \u201cno evidence of manipulation of our platform or policy violations.\u201d Yet The Times recently found that an RT employee bought fake views for videos in 2016, which YouTube acknowledged it did not detect.James Brown, a correspondent for RT, had purchased 30,000 views and 300 likes across three videos that focused on problems involving homelessness and immigration in Europe. Mr. Brown said he took Devumi at its word that the views would be real people. An RT spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the purchases and was conducting an internal review.\u201cIt concerns me that while Twitter and Facebook appear to have made some credible progress in this area, YouTube still struggles to identify inauthentic and coordinated activity on its platform,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cThe only way YouTube could eliminate this is if they removed the view counter altogether,\u201d said Mr. Vassilev, the fake-view seller. \u201cBut that would defeat the purpose of YouTube.\u201dTo test the effectiveness of websites selling fake YouTube views, a New York Times reporter created 13 videos using clips from presidential speeches. The reporter uploaded the videos onto a new channel under his first name and last initial and did not share or post them.Views were bought through nine vendors, sometimes with varying specifications. On one site, for example, the reporter purchased United States-targeted views, so-called high-retention views and generic ones. Aug. 6, 2018July 11, 2018April 23, 2018Jan. 27, 2018Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Is the Id of Tech", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet me answer the question many are thinking: Is he crazy? Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Not crazy like a fox, but crazy as a loon.So let me answer that question: Is he crazy? No, he\u2019s not. Not, at least, in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades \u2014 including recently \u2014 in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling, obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with, always on, outspoken to a fault even when he might be at fault, angry, charming, intense and also strikingly confident. Which is a long way of saying deeply human, with all the positive and negative characteristics that suggests. And that is why, to me, Elon Musk has become the id of tech. But his desires and needs are never unconscious or hidden; they are all out there in the brightest Technicolor for all to see. In the oddest of ways, he is transparent, so utterly direct that it is unsettling and even painful at times to those around him.This week I have talked to a lot of people who know Mr. Musk, including those who adore him and those who have had it with his brusque intensity. And what I found among his current and former colleagues is that they really have the exact same story about an impulsive and driven boss who runs a very hot and messy kitchen and does not spend a lot of time apologizing for it. Some grew weary of this and left, while others thrive under the withering lights. Still others left and then came back, drawn in by the glow.This is not a new phenomenon in tech, and especially in Silicon Valley, a place that needs its complicated gods.Too much? Sure, but it was a pretty good myth and even better since it was largely true. Over the ensuing years, Mr. Jobs used his famous reality distortion field to bend the news media and investors and everyone else to his will. He also warred many times with some journalists and investors, but no one remembers that anymore. His death, much too early and so very tragic, sealed his epic tale for eternity. And so it was Mr. Musk who became the obvious choice, although the comparison to Mr. Jobs is certainly not a perfect one. Mr. Jobs was elegant and spare and even quiet; Mr. Musk is all pomp and circumstance. Mr. Jobs traveled in his mind; Mr. Musk wants to die on Mars (just not on landing, as he told me in an interview a few years ago).What they do share is a proclivity for what is perhaps the most important element of all truly legendary makers of important things: Creative destruction.For Mr. Jobs, it was a bet-the-company approach that ushered in a whole new way of computing. For Mr. Musk it is a lot of big notions, any one of which would be hard to do alone, from electric self-driving cars to ubiquitous solar energy to landing a spent rocket ship on a platform in the ocean. Yeah, he did that, too.This is not to say I am an Elon fanboy, as I find the hagiography around him tiresome and even toxic when it comes to some of his acolytes, who cannot take one valid criticism of their leader without descending into madness. (And Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t do himself any favors by whipping them up \u2014 it\u2019s indulgent and irresponsible.) But I will say that this whole debate brings to mind something that an angel investor named Pejman Nozad said to me offhand many years ago, when he was bemoaning all the stupid start-up ideas that he saw littering the landscape. Silly social networks, dumb photo filter apps, yet another delivery service for millennials. \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d he said, \u201cis a lot of big minds chasing small ideas.\u201dMake no mistake, Mr. Musk\u2019s mind and ideas are big ones. He has said publicly, and others agree, that he is simply exhausted and under intense pressure, and these recent mistakes will soon be forgotten. But he has been careless, and fewer people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has tarnished his reputation by going after imagined enemies, fair critics and those who don\u2019t wish him well with the same tweet daggers. It\u2019s a huge waste of time, when what he has to do to seal his status is actually to build a strong and stable company that is not just revolving around his aura, and a team that does its best work with or without him.And, of course, delete that Twitter app off his phone. After all, can you imagine Steve Jobs tweeting? No, neither can I.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, Infowars was the No. 1 overall \u201ctrending\u201d app on the Google Play store, a metric that reflects its sudden momentum. Among news apps, Infowars was No. 3 on Apple and No. 5 on Google, above all mainstream news organizations. And the app stood at No. 66 overall on Google, excluding game apps, while on Apple it reached No. 49, above popular apps like LinkedIn, Google Docs and eBay.The Infowars app, which includes news articles and the shows of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, had likely been downloaded a few hundred to a few thousand times a day on average after its introduction last month, said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, which tracks app data. Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.The surge suggests the tech industry\u2019s recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles.\u201cThis is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,\u201d said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s gone from being niche to being mainstream.\u201dApple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed.The Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d \u201cWar Room with Owen Shroyer,\u201d and \u201cReal News with David Knight.\u201d Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News.An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store.\u201cWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines.\u201dGoogle said it deleted Mr. Jones\u2019s channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment \u2014 not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones\u2019s podcast and his Infowars app.Google said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, \u201cIf an app violates our policies, we take action.\u201dFrom July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app\u2019s rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days.Researchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula.The Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a \u201cyou\u201d tab for saved articles.)On the tab that led to the outlet\u2019s news articles, a sampling of the app\u2019s stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (\u201cDemocrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!\u201d) to sensationalist (\u201cShock: FDA Acquiring \u2018Fresh\u2019 Aborted Baby Parts to Make \u2018Humanized Mice\u2019\u201d) to humdrum (\u201cCalorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years \u2014 Study\u201d).Many of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley\u2019s removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category \u201cInfowars Exclusives\u201d on the app included no stories.The merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills.One ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with \u201ccensored\u201d tape over his mouth and said: \u201cFight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special. Shop now!\u201dThe app has earned a nearly perfect rating on Apple after 5,500 reviews. \u201cGood to have IW on the go, able to keep up with what the Democrat globalist Luciferian communist are up to at all times,\u201d one recent review said.Advertisement"}

Each time he walked back into the room, he pointed out the improved visibility: \u201cBoy, do those windows shine!\u201dI should have laughed at him, but I was too tired to think anything was funny, so I said, \u201cWho do you think filled the dishwasher, did two loads of laundry, car-pooled, cleaned the mustard spill in the refrigerator and billed a seven-hour day?\u201dMy husband didn\u2019t respond; he just started talking about the windows again.I have heard him tell clients: \u201cIf you fail to define your brand, your competition will.\u201d It took me a while to realize that he was applying the principles of branding to our marriage.Christopher and I both have jobs, sharing household duties and responsibilities for our two children. In our sane moments, we appreciate each other\u2019s contributions and our ability to forge a modern relationship. But when the chaos of our life gets to be too much, we turn on each other.It wasn\u2019t always like this. In the beginning of our relationship, living together in a tiny apartment on East 11th Street in Manhattan, Christopher and I rarely disagreed. We both loved the same spicy food and had grown up in the \u201970s as latchkey kids who watched \u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d and ran feral while our feminist mothers changed the workplace.Together we supported each other\u2019s passions and compulsions, living in the moment with little regard for social norms or the future. Household tasks were divided up by aptitude or preference, not gender. Making the bed made Christopher feel organized and ready to start the day; I liked to vacuum. On weekends, we walked our dog around Chinatown in search of hot bean paste or wakame for the elaborate meals we cooked together. Always on the lookout for ways to crack each other up, we took pride in getting the other person to laugh so hard they spit coffee.Not until I was pregnant with our first child did we find ourselves on opposite sides of key issues. At first, we took turns on who got to make decisions: He followed my lead when I wanted to take a yearlong maternity leave, and I conceded to him on store-bought diapers.After our son was born, there was so much to do and so little time that everything turned into a negotiation: whose turn it was to sleep in, who got a night out with friends, whose dreams were more realistic and who got the full-time job with health insurance.We continued to divvy up tasks randomly as we always had, but the negotiations grew increasingly contentious. We had evolved enough to shed traditional roles and aspire to an egalitarian relationship, but that didn\u2019t solve the problem of nobody liking the drudgery of household chores, particularly the never-ending laundry and dishwashing. Without any division of labor or set roles, we each thought we were doing everything (because we were).While I just dug in without talking about it, Christopher would announce each completed task like a CNN correspondent dramatically reporting breaking household news: \u201cTrash has left the building!\u201dAfter our second child was born, his announcements grew more brazen. He would claim, for example, that he had \u201cdone the laundry\u201d after moving one load of wash to the dryer. But whenever I called him out on it, he wouldn\u2019t back down. The busier our lives became, the more his habit angered me and kept me on the defensive. But maybe that was the point.A pattern was starting. Christopher\u2019s announcements seemed to be a way of building a case for what he wanted to do \u2014 organizing the barn or launching the boat \u2014 rather than what had to be done, such as scheduling dentist appointments and ordering heating oil.His messages were strategic and part of a larger campaign. Christopher had spent his career developing identity management strategies for corporations, and he was now applying these skills to our relationship to build a more successful brand for himself.While he never actually came out and said, \u201cI do more than you,\u201d he didn\u2019t need to. By consistently claiming credit for everything he did, he was dominating the dialogue in our new domestic world order and positioning himself as the winner in the \u201cwho is doing more\u201d fight.By the time I figured this out, he had already captured a significant amount of brand mind share. Whose day was harder, whose parenting technique was better, who was responsible for cleaning the flotsam at the bottom of the garbage can \u2014 all of these conflicts could be branded or rebranded to his advantage. If I allowed Christopher\u2019s brand to take over our household, I would be in danger of becoming the AOL to his Google.Public relations is what I do for a living, so I was going to have to use my skills at home too. As soon as his car pulled into the driveway, I met Christopher at the back door and started firing off my own announcements: \u201cCleaned up vomit and poop today\u201d and \u201cWrote an article with a child climbing on my back.\u201dBut instead of conceding or validating my clearly more difficult day working from home with no child care, Christopher grabbed the broom and started sweeping Cheddar Bunnies off the kitchen floor in an overly theatrical way, as if he were trying out for the role of janitor in a community theater production. In one swift move, he shifted the conversation, drawing attention to what I hadn\u2019t done that day instead of what I had, making our messy kitchen the story and putting me on the defensive again.Social media has taught everyone to build personal platforms, so my problem wasn\u2019t unique. My friends \u2014 men and women \u2014 shared similar stories about how branding had invaded their marriages.One friend told me her husband had branded her \u201cthe expert\u201d (because she is a psychologist) to justify deferring to her with decisions involving their children\u2019s education or developmental needs. \u201cI finally realized he was just citing my Ph.D. to get out of the drudgery of dealing with school issues or having to read a parenting book,\u201d she said.Another friend said: \u201cAfter my husband cleans the garage or the pool, he makes each person in the family come for a separate \u2018viewing\u2019 so he can solicit praise and bask in his accomplishment.\u201dWith us, branding was even at the foundation of Christopher\u2019s parenting style. He introduced lofty public service campaigns about the importance of consistent bedtimes that lasted until it was my night to go out with friends. On those evenings, he\u2019d host movie dinners where nobody got to bed on time or brushed their teeth as he cultivated his \u201cDad is more fun\u201d sub-brand, distinguishing himself from my more practical brand of routines, eating your vegetables and \u201cHow do you know until you\u2019ve tried it?\u201d slogans.In the morning, when it was my shift again, I had to rouse our tired, cranky children and get them to school while hearing real-time testimonials from his new \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d: \u201cDad let us watch a movie you said we couldn\u2019t.\u201dThankfully the \u201cDad is more fun\u201d brand collapsed on its own after I went to visit a friend for a week and Christopher had to get the children to school every morning on his own.When we entered the most recent phase of our marriage, with both of us having full-time office jobs, I thought the \u201cWho does more?\u201d fight would end. But Christopher still manages to drive the conversation by complaining about how his longer commute that \u201ccrosses two state lines\u201d gets him home late, even though sitting on a Wi-Fi-equipped bus while sipping coffee and binge-watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d sounds a lot easier to me than handling all of the car-pooling, after-school activities and homework.Finally I confronted the issue head-on: \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. Stop branding in our house.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re busier than me?\u201d I said.\u201cI never said that.\u201d\u201cWell, maybe you should,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t you send a news release to The Portland Press Herald. The headline could read: \u2018How Does This Man Do It All?\u2019\u201d\u201cI really think it\u2019s more of a national news story,\u201d Christopher said with a smile.I laughed, but actually he\u2019s right. It is a national news story. From coast to coast, husbands are announcing, \u201cThe trash is out!\u201d and \u201cThe floor is swept!\u201d \u2014 constantly trying to seize the upper hand in the domestic chore branding war.Time to change the narrative.Brooke Williams is a writer and communications professional in Kittery, Me.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tech Billionaires Hack Their Taxes With a Philanthropic Loophole", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate in 2014, Nicholas Woodman, the founder and chief executive of GoPro, announced what appeared to be an extraordinary act of generosity.Mr. Woodman, then 39, had just taken his camera company public, and was suddenly worth about $3 billion. Now he was giving away much of that wealth \u2014 some $500 million worth of GoPro stock \u2014 to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, an organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that would house the assets of the newly formed Jill and Nicholas Woodman Foundation.The executive basked in prestige and gratitude. The Chronicle of Philanthropy named Mr. Woodman one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s most generous donors\u201d that year, placing him alongside established philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg.But four years on, there is almost no trace of the Woodman Foundation, or that $500 million. The foundation has no website and has not listed its areas of focus, and it is not known what \u2014 if any \u2014 significant grants it has made to nonprofits. An extensive search of public records turned up just one beneficiary: the Bonny Doon Art, Wine and Brew Festival, a benefit for an elementary school in California.Instead, the Woodman Foundation essentially exists as an account within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is not required to disclose details about how, if at all, individual donors spend their charitable dollars. Mr. Woodman, GoPro and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation all declined to discuss the Woodman Foundation.If the benefit to the needy is difficult to see, the benefit to Mr. Woodman is clear. After GoPro\u2019s initial public offering, he faced an enormous tax bill in 2014. But by donating via the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, he eased his tax burden in two ways. First, Mr. Woodman avoided paying capital gains taxes on that $500 million worth of stock, a figure that most likely would have been in the tens of millions of dollars. He was also able to claim a charitable deduction that most likely saved millions of dollars more, and probably reduced his personal tax bill for years to come.Mr. Woodman achieved this enticing combination of tax efficiency and secrecy by using a donor-advised fund \u2014 a sort of charitable checking account with serious tax benefits and little or no accountability.Donor-advised funds, or D.A.F.s, allow wealthy individuals like Mr. Woodman to give assets \u2014 usually cash and stock, but also real estate, art and cryptocurrencies \u2014 to a sponsoring organization like the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Fidelity Charitable or Vanguard Charitable. But while donors part ways with their money, they don\u2019t give up control. The sponsoring organizations make grants to hospitals, schools and the like only at a donor\u2019s request. So while donors enjoy immediate tax benefits, charities can wait for funds indefinitely, and maybe forever.For these reasons and more, D.A.F.s have become one of the most controversial issues in the charitable world.Proponents say D.A.F.s have democratized giving, because they are simple to create and the individuals who use them are more generous than those who establish family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d said Greg Avis, interim president of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \u201cThe donor has a tax benefit, and the beneficiaries are the nonprofits.\u201dBut to critics, D.A.F.s represent the worst of philanthropy today \u2014 a system of guaranteed perks for the rich and uncertainty for the rest.Unlike family foundations, which are required to distribute 5 percent of their assets each year and have historically been the way wealthy donors disbursed their philanthropic firepower, D.A.F.s have no distribution requirements, meaning that billions of dollars earmarked for charity can sit idle for decades. And because organizations that manage D.A.F.s are not required to report which funds give money to which causes, it is impossible to know how much money individual donors are giving away to nonprofit organizations.That D.A.F.s have become so popular with Silicon Valley billionaires has only added to their intrigue. Society is still reckoning with the dark sides of social media and online privacy, and there is concern that D.A.F.s \u2014 a dream vehicle for the overnight wealthy \u2014 may prove to be another instance of techno-optimists disrupting a system with unintended consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re a fraud on the American taxpayer,\u201d said Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey\u2019re a way for the affluent to have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dApproaching the Silicon Valley Community Foundation after a tech windfall has become a familiar pattern. In December 2012, just months after Facebook went public, Mr. Zuckerberg donated $500 million of Facebook shares to the group. In 2014, soon after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton donated a combined $846 million to the foundation. In both cases, the establishment of D.A.F.s allowed the men to reap a substantial tax advantage just when they needed it most.Some of this money is put to swift use. Mr. Zuckerberg has used his D.A.F. to give away tens of millions to schools and hospitals in the San Francisco area. Mr. Hastings has used his D.A.F. to give to the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley and the United Negro College Fund. In each case, the donors voluntarily publicized their gifts.Organizations that manage D.A.F.s say most of their account holders, anonymous though they may be, are similarly generous. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation distributed $1.3 billion during the last fiscal year to groups including the South San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Schwab Charitable, another big sponsor of D.A.F.s, said it distributed nearly $2 billion during the last fiscal year, making some 420,000 grants to nonprofits including Feeding America, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.Yet in the case of Mr. Woodman, there is reason to question how much money was made available for charity. He established his D.A.F. the day after GoPro stock approached its highest-ever price, about $95 per share. From a financial perspective, Mr. Woodman could not have timed his gift more perfectly.News of his donation sent GoPro shares tumbling as much as 14 percent the next day, as investors interpreted the move as a lack of confidence in the stock. By the end of the year, GoPro had lost more than a third of its value. By the end of 2015, the stock traded near $18 a share. Today, GoPro stock is worth less than $6 a share.\u201cSmart donors have been playing timing games with the charitable deduction for a long time,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a tax professor at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Columbus School of Law. \u201cIn this case, he potentially gets a very large deduction and gives nothing away. That\u2019s a disturbing public policy issue.\u201dOn Reddit, Mr. Woodman suggested that his wealth was reaching charities: \u201cThe Foundation has gone on to fund causes supporting women and children and will continue to do so!!!!\u201d Just how much money has gone to which organizations, of course, remains a mystery.When it comes to D.A.F.s, the United States tax code rewards the promise of good intentions. Wealthy donors \u2014 including many of the Silicon Valley billionaires who have asked the public to trust them with their digital lives \u2014 pledge to distribute their funds to charity once they get their tax break. But in the absence of rules requiring donors to give their money away, it is hard to know what public good comes in exchange for those lucrative write-offs.Skeptics see a system ripe for abuse. Donors might wait years to engage in meaningful philanthropic activity, or decide to simply leave the fund for their children to manage.\u201cWe\u2019ve put this rule in place that says you get maximum tax benefits when you make a donation,\u201d said Ray Madoff, a professor at the Boston College Law School and a vocal critic of donor-advised funds. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do anything with it.\u201dMs. Norley of Fidelity Charitable argues that on balance, account holders are generous. At her organization, roughly a quarter of the assets held in D.A.F.s have been distributed to nonprofits in each of the past two years. Other sponsor organizations report similar distribution rates.Yet such statistics can be skewed. In many instances, these figures include transfers from one D.A.F. to another. In the most recent fiscal year, for instance, Vanguard Charitable sent more than $15 million from its D.A.F.s to Fidelity Charitable. Sponsor organizations say this is simply a matter of wealthy donors adjusting their accounts. But it also creates the illusion of meaningful philanthropic activity where there is none.And while the overall payout rate at an organization that manages D.A.F.s may be substantial, the numbers could be warped by a few donors who give away huge sums, while a majority of donors give away virtually nothing at all.Critics argue that some sponsor organizations even have an incentive to keep funds undisbursed to charities. That is because D.A.F.s have emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for financial firms.For example, Fidelity Charitable, which is structured as an independent public charity, pays millions in annual fees to Fidelity Management, the big asset manager. Fidelity Management then invests the billions of dollars held in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s D.A.F.s, making money there as well. Vanguard, Schwab and Goldman Sachs all get millions in fees from their affiliated public charities. The more money held in D.A.F.s, the greater the potential earnings for the financial groups.The fact that D.A.F.s have become a profit center for Wall Street firms is a perversion of the philanthropic system, critics say.\u201cThe charitable deduction is not meant to give tax breaks to very wealthy people. It\u2019s meant to encourage giving to worthy nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, an attorney who worked for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, when Mr. Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got instead is a huge warehousing of funds with massive amount of fees being extracted by Wall Street.\u201dFidelity and Goldman brush off such criticism as misinformed, arguing that they are simply providing a valuable service to their clients by streamlining their charitable giving and offering them legal tax benefits. Some D.A.F. sponsors have rules in place that require accounts to disburse at least some money every few years.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Karey Dye, president of the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund, where Laurene Powell Jobs and the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer recently established D.A.F.s. \u201cPeople have irrevocably given money away to charity. Most often they are wanting to give money away to things that are meaningful to them and make a difference.\u201dAt the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the drive to accumulate assets appears to have been particularly intense. Former and current employees said the former chief executive, Emmett Carson, wanted to make the organization one of the largest sponsors of D.A.F.s in the country, and engaged in an arms race of sorts to woo big donors.In spite of his ouster, Mr. Carson appears to have succeeded in his goal. Thanks to big gifts from tech billionaires like Mr. Woodman and Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and the relatively new practice of accepting highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation is now one of the largest such groups in the country, with more than $13 billion in assets.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Washington has tried to take action. The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, was the first law to specifically address D.A.F.s. It established some basic rules that barred self-dealing, but stopped short of more fundamental changes, such as mandated distribution requirements or less generous tax breaks.\u201cWe were basically trying to undo a giveaway by the government,\u201d said Mr. Zerbe, who worked on that bill while he was at the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I\u2019m never convinced we can totally keep the weasels down the hole.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I was in 10th grade, and my world literature teacher, Ms. Joe, had assigned us the poem \u201cThose Winter Sundays\u201d by Robert Hayden. I read the poem and at once found myself engrossed in my own memory. I, too, recalled the coldness of my childhood home and the \u201caustere and lonely offices\u201d of my father\u2019s love. In his verses, Hayden made me feel seen. The poem provided a kind of relief, to know that my childhood was not a complete anomaly, and that others had grown up in similar spaces where love was convoluted by anger and loneliness. That day Robert Hayden became my favorite poet. I held on to this particular poem for years, memorizing it not only for the comfort it provided, but also as a reminder of what good art could do. Though admittedly it was a funny coincidence that we were both black, this hardly mattered at all. Hayden\u2019s work had always felt like an apt representation of myself, but for reasons far beyond our shared complexion.Over the past few years, the word \u201crepresentation\u201d has stormed popular discourse. It began in 2015 with April Reign\u2019s hashtag campaign #OscarsSoWhite, which indicted the Academy Awards for a lack of nominations for actors of color. Since then, creative figures across industries \u2014 film producers, gallery curators, print advertisers \u2014 have been called upon to ramp up inclusivity in their respective fields in hopes of advancing popular culture away from white, male dominance toward gender and racial equality.And who could argue with such a worthy goal? The need for representation of marginalized identities in art is evident, especially when considering a larger fight against racist patriarchal social and political institutions. However, when considering our current fixation on representation, I have to wonder if we have overlooked other meaningful ways of being represented, those that can be pinpointed only in life experiences and emotional phenomena beyond the visible self. When I think of all the \u201cblack art\u201d being ushered in by this new era, I feel conflicted. As a black person, I enjoy seeing artists whose careers are finally being given due praise and whose voices are at last being amplified. However, a question arises of what it means to be truly represented. Is it enough to look like the artist if you do not recognize yourself in the art?When the film \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was released in theaters, it was regarded as a historic moment for black representation in the comic book world. During the premiere weekend and for months after, my social media feeds were flooded with family members, colleagues and strangers affirming the importance of the film. \u201cI saw myself in this film,\u201d many of them claimed. When I finally saw the film, I did not recognize much of myself in it. Sure, I saw my old neighborhood in Oakland, Calif. I saw black people who looked like me, dressed like me and spoke like me. However, the film did not reflect my experience as a black American, my relationship to slavery or my interactions with other members of the African diaspora. I walked away feeling wholly unrepresented. However, while representation may be a praiseworthy standard for creative industries, it cannot be the benchmark against which we measure good art. Good art must do more than reflect our own images back at us. It must move us to a place beyond our obsession with identity, sense of tribalism and fear of others. When I imagine the happy medium between representation and good art, I am reminded of my favorite author, James Baldwin, who once put it this way:I think of these words and am at once transported back into my high school literature class. I read Hayden\u2019s verse, and at once I recognize myself \u2014 not in the poet but in the poem. Beyond my blackness, he sees me clearly for who I am. In this moment I am connected to him and all those ever engrossed in the \u201caustere and lonely offices of love.\u201d Bianca Vivion-Brooks is a writer based in Harlem.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Plans for a China Comeback Go Beyond Google Search", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world\u2019s largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Self-Care: A Working Definition", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AUGUST 11, 2018By THE NEW YORK TIMESSelf-care  /self /ker/The practice of taking action to \u201cpreserve or improve one\u2019s own health,\u201d according to Oxford Dictionaries. Self-care is for anyone who wants it. It can be as easy \u2014 and as free \u2014 as taking a walk, or as complex as learning a trade. Self-care can include, but is not limited to: saying no; buying things; refusing to buy things; taking a long walk; helping others; exercising; crafting; stockpiling and organizing things like coins and arranging them meticulously into Ziploc bags; stretching; listening to disco; spending time alone; singing karaoke (sometimes, alone); intending to one day start meditating.If face masks are involved, it\u2019s probably self-care.Taking care of oneself.Q: Can you go out today?A: No, I am self-caring.When I was growing up, my dad made spaghetti. It wasn\u2019t fancy. It was basic and chunky, a meat sauce spooned over coils of pasta with blocks of butter tossed in.Not all of my dad\u2019s dinners were good. He had a penchant for celeriac boiled in water and liverwurst with onions. But the spaghetti was always the same, and it was always good.At home, as the meat browns in a cast iron pot, the slicing and dicing begins. I don\u2019t need background noise. I don\u2019t need music. I certainly don\u2019t need conversation. It\u2019s just me and a good chef\u2019s knife and the sizzle of olive oil in the pan. After the meat is browned, it\u2019s removed from the pan. Then I start afresh with more olive oil followed by garlic, carrots, mushrooms. Back in goes the meat. Tomato paste. Canned plum tomatoes. Salt, pepper. Maybe some butter. The parsley goes in last, a fluttering of leaves that sink down into the sauce, taking my stress with it.Cooking is a funny form of self care because it is so much in service of others. But while others may eat my spaghetti, the sauce is definitely for me.I\u2019m like a working dog who sometimes forgets it. I spend a lot of time bringing tennis balls to people who didn\u2019t ever ask for them and then I stare at everyone and wonder why they\u2019re not throwing the tennis ball for me. The \u201ctennis ball\u201d is usually a memo of some kind. Then when no one throws my ball I go to lay down for a while and then I become sad. Soon I become a confused prissy toy dog pouting on a pillow.The only way I ever feel better is through sheer brute accomplishment or doing something for someone who isn\u2019t me so I can forget about how dumb I feel.What kind of dog are you? I\u2019m mostly attracted to herding dogs. I\u2019m a loner who likes to get rounded up. Shove me around, I\u2019m there for it! I like hounds too, they make good novelists and songwriters and painters, they always smell something weird far away and then they wander off towards it then I have to help them bring it back. They are always all muddy and I get to complain about it.I also like terriers because they dig out rats and their secrets. They make good reporters and publicists. The yapping is excruciating though. You know who you are.Also if you don\u2019t know what kind of dog you are then you\u2019re missing out, or you are a cat which is okay, but not great, and I say that with a whole lot of respect. But cats will never have the fulfillment of a job. Please read my memos.My mom has a friend who is a reiki healer, and for well over a decade she's been the highlight of our family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinners. Each year, over plates piled high with stuffing, she begins belching: burping up our \"negative energy\" before we can stick our forks into the food. It\u2019s like saying grace, but also nothing like that.I never believed this release of negative energy through belching was real \u2014 until I suddenly had my own negative energy to burp up. A terrible breakup had left my body reeling in all sorts of crazy ways, including... yes, burping. The kind that I couldn't stop, until I was physically sick.Half a dozen medical professionals told me the problem was psychosomatic. One suggested I was simply chewing too much gum. It seemed destined that a reiki therapist would be the one to heal me.At Thanksgiving last year, my brothers and I still snickered quietly at the annual burping \u2014 this time, as my mother's friend performed a healing ritual on my dog. The difference: I'm a believer.Have you ever tried hanging upside-down like a bat? I swear by it.Nothing has ever been quite as effective at improving my physical and mental well-being \u2014 so much so that when I moved away from the aerial yoga studio where I used to take classes and into my own house, I had an aerial hammock mounted from the ceiling. (Have a professional do this; it needs to be structurally sound enough to handle a body in motion.)When I\u2019m stressed out or in any kind of pain, I climb into my hammock as if it were a cocoon and dangle upside down in various positions until I feel, you know, mellow.I\u2019ve done a lot of sports in my life that have taken a toll on my body, particularly boxing, skateboarding and snowboarding. These days, I hunch over a desk for hours at least five days a week, which is almost as physically brutal.Being inverted helps by elongating my spine (take that, computer neck), rehydrating the vertebrae along the way, and it allows me to stretch more deeply into every muscle, from my jaw to my toes, than I\u2019ve ever been able to.It has the mental restorative properties that other types of yoga offer, with an anti-gravity twist. It gives me a new perspective on the world around me.Meditation is one of the most incredible and transformative things you can do for yourself. Or so I\u2019ve heard.That\u2019s why, for me, self-care means planning to meditate someday but never actually getting around to it. It is in the intention.There are apps: I\u2019ve downloaded them.There are books: I\u2019ve bought them.There are free guided meditations online: I\u2019ve bookmarked them.I deployed a similar logic in my 20s when I was a daily smoker: I read somewhere that quitting smoking was the healthiest choice any human being could make, other than never smoking to begin with. \u201cWell,\u201d I thought as I dragged on a cigarette, \u201cafter I quit, I won\u2019t be able to make the healthiest choice ever again, so might as well keep this Ace up my sleeve as long as possible.\u201dEventually I quit smoking, so maybe eventually I\u2019ll meditate.Using my hands has always brought me back to center. Whether it\u2019s D.I.Y.-ing a nightstand I found on Craigslist for $5, reupholstering furniture or working on my bicycle, taking something apart and putting it back together helps me focus my thoughts and temper the noise of the news cycle. It gives me permission to get out of my head.To concentrate on the task at hand, I have to quiet my internal dialogue. My mind has to be fixated on parts, order and rebuilding. Anyone who has moved with Ikea furniture knows this to be true, but while some find it frustrating, I relish it.It is lavish to work on a project with no set time frame. To know that my work does not have to begin or end on a deadline is freeing. I can start whenever I want and finish when the work is done.Sometimes, I listen to music while I work. I prefer to listen to disco. Artists like Donna Summer, the Bee Gees and Chic, because I don\u2019t think about the words to the music the way I do with rap or love songs. Disco allows my body to relax and move with the rhythm.On weekends I try to stretch out my solitude for hours. I\u2019ll often take the Q across the Manhattan Bridge to Canal Street and walk up Broadway, stopping in stores that are mostly very familiar but deliver occasional surprises. A big part of self-care, I think, is habit, or replicability, which the hobbyist shopper can easily find in SoHo, even as the storefronts regularly shutter and spring up again. They\u2019re always new versions of the same thing.Usually I\u2019ll go into Bloomingdale\u2019s and speed walk through the first-floor cosmetics booths toward the escalator, up to women\u2019s shoes, and contemporary dresses, and Forty Carrots, which serves the only truly great frozen yogurt on this planet. It\u2019s not the most graceful thing, but I like to walk through the store with my froyo in one hand and the other free to touch\u2026 everything with a price tag. The buttery leather handbags, the silky cocktail dresses, the jersey cotton pajamas, the socklike athletic sneakers. I call it \u201cmarket research,\u201d but that\u2019s a not-great joke used to disguise a leisure activity best completed by myself.Then I\u2019ll wander in either direction on Prince Street, toward Camper (weird-good shoes!) or Sandro (cute!) or Everlane (affordable linen!) or lululemon (supportive sports bras!). Or I\u2019ll turn on Mercer and browse the lacy racks at Journelle. The experience is more about sensing and feeling the objects, luxuriating in the aromas of mood-setting perfumes and essential oils and incense and candles (the reason every Club Monaco smells the same), and friend-flirting with the sales associates than making a purchase. But sometimes I do that too.Earlier this year, a friend of mine reintroduced me to rock climbing. My only prior experience with scaling rock walls was at birthday parties, where I clung terrified to the lowest set of plastic holds and refused to move. In this case, my friend did not tell me that she planned to make me top rope, which is to say, climb up a high wall in a harness attached to a rope that was attached to her. But suddenly, I was doing it. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve continued to climb, enjoying it more and more every time. It\u2019s brought back that feeling of increased control over my body that I first discovered when I was 14. Because the activity rewards grace and balance less than it does strength and speed, I\u2019ve been compelled to think more about the way I move. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve taken with me outside the gym. Now, when walking, I find myself standing up on my toes; when sitting, I lower myself slowly through the air into my swivel chair, as if I were in a harness and any careless motion might throw me, unexpectedly, to the floor.Although I was not technically raised during America\u2019s Great Depression, I was born on a day closer to the 1930s than to the Byzantine Era, and for this reason I feel the Great Depression in my bones. Anything less than too much of something (notebook paper; tattered T-shirt scraps I have turned into cleaning rags) makes me feel anxious, and ill-prepared for the chaos of the world. So, I stockpile.I pick up change off the street \u2014 part of my concurrent life mission to acquire items at fantastic deals \u2014 and combine it with the coins I get back from financial transactions conducted in cash. All of that money goes into a huge Ziploc bag in my apartment. This is Step 1 of my routine: slowly adding change to a plastic bag, over the course of many weeks.Guess what I didn\u2019t tell you about the Ziploc bag? It\u2019s filled with other Ziploc bags (I have plenty) containing change that has already been sorted by denomination. These bags are the product of Step 2 of the routine, which is the best part: sorting the change.Here\u2019s how I do it: I gather my sack of filthy coins and situate myself before the TV (which is on). I set aside a pile of the tubular paper wrappers I got for free from the bank several years ago (incredible deal). I transplant coins from the large bag into the smaller bags. Once the smaller bags seem full enough to stock multiple rolls (for the uninitiated, pennies are rolled in groups of 50), I begin to count them out.Counting out coins is a good TV-watching activity because it involves trance-inducing repetitive motions and requires almost no focus. It also makes me feel like I\u2019m being paid to tidying up my home, which is false. I arrange the coins in rows and funnel them into the fiddly tubes. Leftover coins go back into the smaller Ziplocs.I put the rolls in a small zippered bag I have labeled COINS to remind myself which of the 10,000 bags in my home contains my coins, as opposed to other objects. I wash my disgustingly filthy (dirty, dusty, borderline muddy \u2014 specifically from handling coins) hands, looking forward to the day when they will exchange a bag of heavy paper tubes for more than $11 in cash. I have found peace.Credit: Shutterstock (water droplets, smoke)Advertisement"}

Both had ancestors who had been active in populist state politics in the late 19th century, and they wondered if the two men had known each other.\u201cI was just bouncing from name to name,\u201d he said.It was from Dec. 20, 1901 \u2014 the year before Hughes, who spent his early years in Topeka and Lawrence, Kan., was supposedly born.\u201cI was wondering if I should wake up my wife to tell her,\u201d Mr. McHenry recalled. \u201cI really struggled to fall asleep.\u201d It was possible that the item referred to another person with the same name. But the next morning, Mr. McHenry did a more targeted search, and found an item from May 17, 1901, listing some recent visitors to town, including \u201cMrs. Carrie Hughes and little son Langston,\u201d who had been on their way to Buffalo: Hughes\u2019s mother\u2019s name was Carrie. And biographers had already established that James Hughes, Langston\u2019s father, who had left the family shortly after his son\u2019s birth, was living in Buffalo. \u201cThat\u2019s when I thought, \u2018I got it, it has to be the same Langston Hughes,\u2019\u201d Mr. McHenry said.He later then found a third item, from Jan. 17, 1902, referring to a visit by \u201cMrs. C.M. Hugnes and son.\u201d (Yes, early newspapers had a lot of typos.) That gave him a total of three references to Hughes before his supposed Feb. 1, 1902, birthday. Mr. McHenry, who freely admits he is not a Hughes expert, shared his finds with Hughes scholars in Kansas and beyond. Mr. McHenry also contacted Dr. Rampersad, a retired professor at Stanford, who called the newly unearthed evidence compelling, even if it doesn\u2019t upend our understanding of Hughes.\u201cIt is on the one hand unimportant, but on the other hand quite important,\u201d said Mr. Rampersad, whose own research was done well before the era of digitization. \u201cYou want to know when your subject was born.\u201dHughes was born into a distinguished family. His grandmother\u2019s first husband was a comrade of John Brown and died in the 1859 raid at Harpers Ferry. One of his great-uncles was the first black congressman from Virginia.His mother, Carrie, worked for a time as a traveling agent for The Plaindealer. As with many newspapers at the time, its society page served as a kind of proto-Facebook, chronicling the minutest doings of a community that was often ignored by the white press.\u201cDo you want to know where your friends are, who they visit, what they are doing? What the race is doing in general? Read the Plaindealer,\u201d went a sales pitch just below the first item Mr. McHenry found. So far, Mr. McHenry has discovered more than a dozen published references to Hughes from his infant and toddler years. One item from 1907 reported that he had injured himself falling into a rosebush; a week later, another noted that he was better.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that many other major literary figures got into the paper so frequently before they were even school-age,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.Initially, Mr. McHenry wondered if Hughes\u2019s mother, who sent him to the white elementary school in Topeka, rather than the \u201ccolored\u201d school across the tracks, hadn\u2019t waited an extra year to enroll him in first grade, to provide some protection against racism. \u201cMaybe his mother deemed it advantageous for him to be older, and for them not to know,\u201d Mr. McHenry said.Even if the change in Hughes\u2019s birth year came from his mother, \u201csuch reinvention does connect with other kinds of black improvisation,\u201d Mr. Young said.So will the birth year on the mosaic at the Schomburg itself need revising? Not necessarily, Mr. Young said. \u201cI keep thinking about how the archive is still alive,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning things about people we already know a lot about.\u201d An earlier version of this article misstated Langston Hughes's possible ages at the time of his birthday in 1991. He would have been 89 or 90, not 79 or 80. An earlier version of this article also misstated the month of Louis Armstrong's birth date, as listed in Baptismal records. It was Aug. 4, 1901, not April 4, 1901.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Money for Sale, Heroin-Injected Lasagna: How One Artist Is Defining Our Era", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs playful as he is provocative, Darren Bader interrogates the meaning of art itself. Plus, four works he created exclusively for T.These kinds of works don\u2019t obviously place Bader in the realm of the European artistic tradition that was all around us in Palermo, but I was surprised by his concerns with the disappearance of the religious context that once gave artists meaning. \u201cContemporary art is by its very nature kind of a tenuous proposition and category,\u201d he told me, as we Google-mapped ourselves from the Chiesa di San Cataldo, a clean, cool, symmetrical Arab-Norman domed construction, to the Gothic mess of the main cathedral. \u201cI always sense these fault lines, and perhaps I\u2019m overly sensitive to it \u2014 perhaps paranoid, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He said he is always looking for where meaning can be found and how to define it, but he often comes to the realization that this attempt is \u201ckind of a fool\u2019s errand.\u201dBADER AND I WALKED through the Albergheria neighborhood, where the cramped streets were shaded with carapaces of laundry, and where some buildings had not been reconstructed since they were bombed in World War II. On the exposed side of one building, a graffiti artist had reproduced a giant version of the logo for the condom brand Durex. It was a work \u2014 ridiculous and profound, close to but not quite a punch line or a philosophical lament \u2014 that was worthy of the artist himself. Bader, impressed, snapped a photo with his phone.*Humane treatment of the cow(s) is of the essence.\u201cI\u2019m a writer, first and foremost,\u201d Bader said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell a story at all, so I never went into fiction writing. But I love images of all sorts, however you want to define an image. My work\u2019s really about how word and image can interact and compromise one another.\u201dThe pitches in \u201cJames Earl Scones,\u201d scabrous in an occasionally juvenile way, eventually gave way to more serious attempts to realize his projects: \u201chow to make this abstraction concrete?\u201d as Bader put it to me, by way of describing his method. The artist is occasionally compared to Duchamp, in the way that he also seems to exploit ready-mades, but it is a comparison he largely rejects. One reason, he pointed out to me earlier in the day, as we clambered over the roots of an enormous, ancient ficus tree in a garden in the Piazza Marina, was that Duchamp seemed disinterested in beauty. It was the sort of strangely earnest statement that the otherwise relentlessly common-sense skewering Bader was more likely to make. The guy who parked his aunt\u2019s SUV in front of a museum cares about beauty? And yet that was his line of inquiry: as he put it, the question of \u201chow to make religious work in a post-religious society \u2014 however ridiculous and grandiose that sounds.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwhat is art if not a spiritual kind of pursuit?\u201dThe artist sent us a list of instructions for a set of works he created exclusively for T. We executed them as best we could.A \u201cLou Reed memorial sculpture,\u201d in the artist\u2019s words, \u201cin which someone named Stephanie, someone named Candy, someone named Caroline and someone named Lisa are in a space together (public or private doesn\u2019t matter) and converse. This might be more effective as video, but still photography gets the point across fine, too.\u201dBader\u2019s instructions for this work were: \u201cHave someone make and sell their own Darren Bader and I\u2019ll issue a certificate of authenticity to the purchaser.\u201d We asked the installation artist Urs Fischer, who obliged with this work of a smoothie made of honey, milk and cut-up money.Bader sent us instructions for works involving guns: \u201cFilling up a revolver\u2019s chambers with fish roe inside a vitamin capsule rather than bullets. Filling up an emptied pistol magazine with polenta and tuna salad \u2026 Filling up shotgun shells with fingernail clippings instead of shot.\u201d5 PhotosBader has said he will issue a certificate of authenticity to the first person to realize this work, in which a house is placed into an enormous bag (and could later be transported via helicopter so that you could \u201ctravel without leaving home\u201d).

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why You Should Take Time to Mourn During Career Transitions", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrief is common when you leave a job you love. On my last day in the newsroom at a North Carolina alt-weekly, I found myself choking back tears. For the first time in almost a decade, my desk was completely clean. All of my old reporter notebooks, past newspaper editions and sticky notes with scribbled writing on them were in the trash. But feelings of grief are common when you leave a workplace you love, said Kim Scott, author of \u201cRadical Candor.\u201d\u201cEven if you\u2019re moving on to something that you really want to do and it\u2019s the right decision, change is really hard,\u201d Ms. Scott said.She said it\u2019s important to take time, both before you leave a job and after you\u2019ve started a new one, to process these transitions. Dealing with bouts of grief instead of ignoring them can help you better navigate the complex emotions of leaving a job you love and starting fresh somewhere new.But it\u2019s important to figure out whether you identify with your professional occupation or with the organization you work at.\u201cIf you\u2019re a technology person and you leave Google, you\u2019re still a technology person,\u201d said Amy Wrzesniewski, a professor at the Yale School of Management. But if you identify much more with being an employee of Google, she said, \u201cyou\u2019re in a different boat than someone who sees themselves as a programmer who creates things and could do that anywhere.\u201d In either case, what informs that connection to work is the human need for a sense of belonging, said Beth Humberd, an assistant professor of management at UMass Lowell.\u201cWe want to be a part of something, and we want to be seen as needed in an area,\u201d she said. Dr. Wrzesniewski added that for many people, what they do professionally is symbolic of other things. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of the things you care about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of your talents. It\u2019s symbolic of your offering to the world.\u201d There\u2019s also the realization of who we\u2019re leaving behind. Colleagues can serve as \u201cpseudo-family,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Orb\u00e9-Austin, a psychologist in New York, and you might not recognize that until after you\u2019ve moved on. \u201cWhile we work, our lives happen \u2014 births, deaths, breakups \u2014 and our colleagues are often there to mourn with us and to celebrate the new transitions in our personal lives,\u201d Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said. \u201cWe share our lives in the workplace often in very intimate ways. All of these things provide deepening connections, support, and built-in social opportunities that we sometimes take for granted.\u201dRemember that grief might come, perhaps unexpectedly.\u201cPart of it is just not getting caught off-guard by the fact that it\u2019s normal to have those feelings,\u201d said Ms. Scott, who used to work at Google in sales and operations. On her last day at the company, Ms. Scott said she started \u201csobbing\u201d when a member of human resources came to take her identification badge.\u201cHe was shocked, and I was shocked,\u201d she said. Lynn Berger, a New York-based career coach, suggested taking time to ponder what work means to you and what you get out of it. Do you go to work solely for practical reasons (e.g., financial security)? Do you enjoy being challenged at your job? Is work the primary place you socialize with other people? When you understand what it is about your job that fulfills you the most, Ms. Berger said, you may be able to prepare yourself if that\u2019s lacking in your new position. \u201cThe more time you prepare yourself for this, the easier it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she added.Molly Barker, the founder of the nonprofit Girls on the Run in Charlotte, N.C., said she was \u201cvery intentional\u201d about preparing for her departure as she retired in 2013 after 17 years at the organization. It took her about three years to figure out how to exit in a positive way, and she talked through everything with a small group of people she trusted. Another concrete step to take when leaving, Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said, is to have a succession plan. This can mean creating a list of all your responsibilities, or a putting together a list of important contacts, or something else altogether. This can help your successor, but it\u2019s also a way for you to reflect on everything you\u2019ve done at that job.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like processing your experience there very proactively in a very classy way,\u201d Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said.That\u2019s totally normal, and everyone processes career transitions differently. Some people might not be fazed when they leave behind a role they considered profound. Others might feel sadness or a sense of loss they don\u2019t understand. Anger, frustration and anxiety can also crop up from time to time. Further still, you might feel a confusing mix of all of those emotions \u2014 or none of them at all. Shana Wilson Anderson, 42, is a senior manager of training and delivery at Capital One, but in March, she said goodbye to the company she spent 18 years at. She started at T-Mobile in Georgia as a customer service representative and made her way up to senior manager of operations. Ms. Anderson said she still hasn\u2019t gotten over the grief of leaving, adding that on her last day, there wasn\u2019t \u201ca dry eye\u201d in the call center. \u201cI am an organized person, a planner, a strategic thinker,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I did not plan for was how I would really feel when I left the company.\u201dThis is what grief looks like, Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said, and it\u2019s O.K. to allow yourself to feel it. But if you\u2019re having trouble letting go, it can be helpful to identify exactly what you miss about the old workplace so you can address that loss head-on. \u201cIf it\u2019s the relationships, you can plan regular happy hours so that you can stay in touch,\u201d Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said. \u201cIf it\u2019s identity loss, then you can work on formulating a new sense of identity that helps repair the loss and connecting more thoughtfully to your new work identity or your new workplace.\u201dWork is more than simply what we do, she added.\u201cIt\u2019s really important to value the complexity of what goes on at work. It isn\u2019t this experience where you just execute tasks,\u201d Dr. Orb\u00e9-Austin said. \u201cThere are really complex, dynamic growth experiences that are occurring, and when you experience loss, you\u2019re acknowledging the full breadth of all you experienced at that workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJ. Lo has been serving fierce, bold looks since 1986. Including the green Versace dress. Where were you the first time Jennifer Lopez came into your life? Was it while she was dancing on \u201cIn Living Color\u201d in the \u201980s? Or perhaps when she played Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez in the 1997 biopic of the artist\u2019s life? Maybe it was when \u201cWaiting for Tonight\u201d hit the charts in 1999? Or when Ms. Lopez stole rom-com lovers\u2019 hearts in the early aughts as the leading lady in \u201cThe Wedding Planner\u201d and \u201cMaid in Manhattan?\u201d Jennifer Lopez has been icon for more than three decades. She is also the first Latina actor to earn over $1 million for a film and the first woman to have a No. 1 album and a No. 1 movie in the same week. And don\u2019t forget about her Golden Globe nomination. So it\u2019s fitting that Ms. Lopez just received this year\u2019s Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, which recognizes career-spanning accomplishments in music and film. When she took the stage tonight at the VMAs, she reminded everyone that she has staying power. She began the medley of her biggest hits in a flowing blue and gold Versace cape over a gold leotard with thigh straps. She later donned a floor-length white fur coat and ended the performance in baggy gold pants \u2014 the same outfit she accepted her award in. To honor her, let\u2019s remember some of her looks. In the same year at the VMAs, J. Lo gave us this white and silver Sean John ensemble, and she earned a silver Moon Man to match. Nineteen years ago, also at the VMAs, Ms. Lopez blessed us with this shimmery, tasseled halter top and a leather skirt. She and Sean Combs, a.k.a P. Diddy at the time, were an item from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, J. Lo launched a perfume called Glow, and it was aptly named. Here she is at the 2004 Golden Globes, glowing, in Michael Kors.J. Lo is more than a triple threat. She can sing, act, dance, design and of course, judge many talent shows. Ms. Lopez is a judge and executive producer on \u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d so it only makes sense that earlier this summer she looked like a boss in this leopard print dress that most of us could never rock at our day jobs. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a clothing brand. It is Sean John, not Sean Jean.Advertisement"}

The child of an expat family, my adolescence has fragmented across continents. In each place I live, I leave a version of myself molded by geographical context. As a result, vestiges of my person are bound to cities oceans away: distinct realities so far apart they feel mutually exclusive.I also experienced this feeling reading about Potemkin villages: architectural facades often simulating faraway places, like a Harlem in western Sweden. Photos of fake conflict-zones far from any foreign fire reminded me of how contingent our internal realities are upon our physical realities, and how discordant these realities can be. As I struggle to reconcile the truths of my past selves, it strikes me that the experience of third-culture kids shares some ground with unreal places. Like us, they are at odds with their surroundings, as anomalous aesthetically as we are culturally. Like our old homes, they seem insulated from the societies in which they are situated. And, like my sense of universe-hopping, the actuality of a Potemkin village is false. Wallpaper curls on the edge of a fake brick, you\u2019re visited by friends from what you thought was a different world; the pines behind your cardboard Harlem make sense, and the sequence of your life is laid out in lopsided unity.Chris Lee on \u201cJapanese Students Use VR to Recreate Hiroshima Bombing\u201d_________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Expensive Education of Mark Zuckerberg and Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey have weaponized social media, and we are all paying the price.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. But let me also say that he and Facebook, the huge social network that he started in college, have been working humanity\u2019s last nerve for far too long now. Every week, it\u2019s something, and that something is never good.This comes as no surprise to anyone at this point, except for maybe President Trump. I suppose we should be grateful that this time it was Facebook\u2019s management that revealed the news, in a departure from the company\u2019s previous stance of stubbornly resisting pressure from the government and the media to be more transparent. (Over the past months, it has copped to trouble in Brazil, Mexico and Russia, which is a good sign, although a report on Sunday from Britain\u2019s Parliament rebuked the company for being \u201cunwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee\u2019s questions.\u201d)The arms race metaphor is a good one, but not for the reasons Facebook intended. Here\u2019s how I see it: Facebook, as well as Twitter and Google\u2019s YouTube, have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age. All these companies began with a gauzy credo to change the world. But they have done that in ways they did not imagine \u2014 by weaponizing pretty much everything that could be weaponized. They have mutated human communication, so that connecting people has too often become about pitting them against one another, and turbocharged that discord to an unprecedented and damaging volume. They have weaponized social media. They have weaponized the First Amendment. They have weaponized civic discourse. And they have weaponized, most of all, politics.Which is why malevolent actors continue to game the platforms and why there\u2019s still no real solution in sight anytime soon, because they were built to work exactly this way. And ever since, they have grown like some very pernicious kudzu and overtaken their inventors\u2019 best efforts at control. Simply put, the inventors became overwhelmed by their own creations, which led to what I can only describe as a casual negligence, which led to where we are now. At a recent employee Q. and A. I did at YouTube, for example, one staffer told me that their jobs used to be about wrangling cat videos and now they had degenerated into a daily hell of ethics debates about the fate of humanity.At least Mr. Zuckerberg has traveled a long way in admitting the problem and has said more than any other digital C.E.O. that he regrets that he had not taken action sooner. I certainly did not see it coming, either, when I first met him, in the fall of 2005, although in hindsight the signs that he would get it really wrong were right there in front of me. He was just a hair over 21, as gangly as you\u2019d imagine he would be, when he slipped quietly into the cramped room at Facebook\u2019s shabby then-headquarters in downtown Palo Alto, Calif.The start-up was hot, well funded and interesting, but Mr. Zuckerberg had already gotten a reputation as arrogant, in part for putting \u201cA Mark Zuckerberg production\u201d on the bottom of the site and for a business card he had that read, \u201cI\u2019m the C.E.O., bitch.\u201dOn that forced stroll, there was one word that he kept coming back to: Facebook was a \u201cutility.\u201dIt was a curious metaphor to choose, because it was not the effortlessly hip image of his rival back then, Myspace, nor the multicolored everlasting Willy Wonka party that was going on over at Google. It was a dull, blue, helpful, we-keep-the-lights-on-ma\u2019am concept that was, thinking back on it, quite telling. That\u2019s because it was based in the idea that Facebook was essentially benign. Worse: Mr. Zuckerberg stuck with this mix of extreme earnestness and willful na\u00efvet\u00e9 for far too long. Because what he never managed to grok then was that the company he created was destined to become a template for all of humanity, the digital reflection of masses of people across the globe. Including \u2014 and especially \u2014 the bad ones. Not so much. Unfortunately, the conversation soon turned into a late-night freshman-year dorm-room debate, as he stumbled into a controversy of his own making by using Holocaust deniers and their appalling falsehoods as an example of how much dreck should be allowed on the platform. While that statement ate up all the news, I was more struck by something else. I kept pressing Mr. Zuckerberg on how he personally felt about the damage his creation had done. Was he beginning to understand the power that he held, and that the world that he controlled was not such a rosy place? Facebook was \u201cprobably,\u201d he admitted, \u201ctoo focused on just the positives and not focused enough on some of the negatives.\u201d Fair enough. But it was impossible to get him to acknowledge any personal pain as both the creator and the destroyer.\u201cI mean, my emotion is feeling a deep sense of responsibility to try to fix the problem,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg. \u201cIn running a company, if you want to be innovative and advance things forward, I think you have to be willing to get some things wrong. But I don\u2019t think it is acceptable to get the same things wrong over and over again.\u201dIt was a classic Silicon Valley engineer\u2019s roll-up-your-sleeves answer, which leaves many cold when it comes to, say, the manipulation of democracy. Fending off bad actors like the Russians has been and will be increasingly expensive; it may even be impossible. But Facebook could have done much more than it did, and it certainly needs to do more than it\u2019s doing. Mr. Zuckerberg is now trying to fend off talk in Washington of regulating his company like the thing he once told me it was: a utility. He has also spent the last month meeting over dinners with a range of academic experts on free speech, propaganda and more to try to understand where to go from here.Call it the education of Mark Zuckerberg and Silicon Valley, but on the world\u2019s dime. How much that has \u2014 and will \u2014 cost is probably immeasurable.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When School Gets Real: Teachers Connect Classroom Lessons to Current Events", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCurrent EventsHow do you connect what you\u2019re learning in the classroom with what\u2019s going on in the world outside of school?_________Jeff Baird, Brooklyn, N.Y., Middle SchoolEvery year, my eighth-grade students choose a modern-day issue of injustice that they would like to learn about, and take action toward solving. This has resulted in everything from Instagram accounts about our society\u2019s racist beauty standards, to Musical.ly fund-raisers for L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights groups, to creative writing pieces, artwork and political letters that urge others to help victims of police brutality, mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline.The project culminates in a TEDx Talk. They share what they\u2019ve learned about their issues, talk about the forms of action they\u2019ve already taken toward making a difference, and get see themselves in the vein of the activist leaders we\u2019ve studied in preparation for this, like Bryan Stevenson, Malala Yousafzai and Emma Gonzalez.Kristen Kalenowicz, Milwaukee, High SchoolTwo years ago I introduced the lens of mental health to discuss \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d and \u201cThe Bell Jar.\u201dPart of me wondered if this was overstepping, if mental illness should be saved for health class. Yet over the past year, my belief that young people need to explore mental health across all disciplines has been reaffirmed. With the recent suicides of public figures, the bullying of L.G.B.T.Q.+ individuals, and society\u2019s discussion surrounding school shooters and mental illness, this is a topic that we cannot afford to leave out.Kellyn McNamara, Charlotte, N.C., Middle and High SchoolI am designing an Earth and environmental science class in which students will connect a current event or issue to each unit\u2019s content. For instance, for Unit 1, Earth as a Planet, students will explore the history of space exploration (and its funding), and prepare for a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate in which they will argue either for federal funding of space exploration, or for privatized space exploration.Heidi Echternacht, Princeton, N.J., Elementary SchoolOur second-grade class explored community all year last year. First, we interviewed and drew portraits of each other in class. Then we interviewed people who worked at school and drew their portraits for a community art show. Next, we expanded into Princeton and toured the town, interviewing chefs, firefighters and the mayor, and had an art show in the town library featuring our interviews and portraits.After that, the kids decided to invent their own town they called 2ndton. They wanted to have stores, use money and hold court to solve problems, so we did. They wanted to pay taxes, so we did that, too. We were going to have an election for mayor, but they decided against it in case people\u2019s feelings got hurt. Finally, we started our own newspaper and wrote about topics ranging from biographies of people in the New Jersey Hall of Fame to national news about Donald Trump and the Women\u2019s March. We reported world news, primarily through covering the Olympics. We had subscribers and delivery routes that were coordinated by students and charged 10 cents for a subscription and a penny per paper. We put out a paper twice a week for six weeks. At the end, each student wrote an essay on community, citizenship and democracy.Tricia Ebarvia, Berwyn, Penn., High SchoolAs devastating details about the migrant crisis and family separation policies emerge \u2014 and with continued hate crimes against Muslim Americans and anti-immigrant rhetoric \u2014 I believe it is imperative to help students think critically and responsibly about how language is often used as a weapon to dehumanize others, particularly communities of color. I start this fall teaching two Vietnam War novels, \u201cFallen Angels\u201d by Walter Dean Myers and \u201cThe Things They Carried\u201d by Tim O\u2019Brien. By examining how language in both texts characterizes the enemy in dehumanizing ways, we can draw a connection to the ways in which language today is used to marginalize immigrants and refugees \u2014 and what this means for us as diverse citizens in \u201cthe land of the free and home of the brave.\u201dKenny, Philadelphia, High SchoolDuring our reading of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d I ask students to observe their own relationships as citizens to their government. We also discuss contemporary examples of surveillance and the complexities of living in a world Orwell would have never predicted: one where we the citizens are the ones wielding the cameras and creating a society that challenges the boundaries between public and private life. Often, I will remind students of topics in our text and ask them to search for related articles in the news.When we read \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d I ask students to research and discuss contemporary science issues such as cloning, stem cell research and technology. They also delve into existentialism, parenting, prejudice and identity. All of these universal concepts seem to make their way into discussions about current events. Discussing the \u201coutsider\u201d persona of the Creature can lead to rich and meaningful conversations about civility, diversity and acceptance.Chris Cerrone, Hamburg, N.Y., Middle SchoolAs a seventh-grade social studies teacher, I have done congressional civics simulations about how a bill becomes a law for many years. Students research and prepare their bill for two days and then we spend two days as members of Congress.Whitney Lawrence, Dallas, Elementary SchoolLast year I had my fourth and fifth graders read current-event articles and decide what our world needed more of. The students made Brave Bots and Hope Bots to place in the community. They gave one bot to a person in need, kept one as a reminder to be hopeful or brave, and put the other two out into the community.As the midterm elections approach, my students will create Action Bots, Voter Bots and Voice Bots, encouraging the community to get out and vote. Students will design their bots on the back of a domino, using multicolored Sharpies. Attached to the bot will be a letter written or typed by the students, informing citizens what is at stake in their state elections and encouraging citizens to use their voices by voting. In the letters, students will encourage others to make bots and place them around the community or move the bot they found to a new location.Our children may not be able to vote, but the results of these fall elections will have a great impact on their lives. Thus, they deserve to have a voice in the coming elections.Susan Barber, Atlanta, High SchoolAs a literature teacher, I can choose all types of texts to teach reading skills, but I love bringing in modern voices to help students explore current issues. Many told me they had never read anything like \u201cCounting Descent\u201d in school and it offered them, predominantly upper-middle-class white teenagers, an avenue to consider a different perspective on race and coming of age than what they are typically exposed to in suburban Atlanta.Aimee Alexander, Newport, Vt., High SchoolLast school year was a tremendous time in Vermont for discussing Second Amendment issues. After Parkland, my students were interested in learning more about gun rights and gun-safety regulations, so I invited local state senators from both parties to come speak to my students. They prepared for both visits by doing research so that they could support their own points of view with facts and could question specifics from each senator\u2019s voting record. Then, we went on a field trip to the Edward Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston, where my students participated in a mock congressional session working on immigration reform. This certainly made the issues on the news much more relevant to them.Elizabeth Misiewicz, Ridgefield, Conn., Middle SchoolLast year, my students wrote speeches on topics they were passionate about that they could tie to the Constitution and Bill of Rights. They delivered these five- to six-minute speeches while also managing a Google slide presentation (like a true TED Talk!) before an audience of around 100 people made up of parents, teachers, staff and administrators.As middle schoolers, my students are growing into their identities and trying to find their places in the world. This project essentially said to them, \u201cYour opinions are important, and you deserve to be heard.\u201dMeg Arbeiter, Chicago, High School\u2022What do borders mean to you?\u2022How do you reimagine borders?These questions will provide a framework for our study of a wide range of texts (novels, literary nonfiction, essays and poems) by a multitude of authors, and I will invite students to recommend writers, texts, places and cultures to expand our curriculum and ensure representation.Larry Bowler Jr., Warrington, Pa., High SchoolI hope to start the coming school year by letting my students know that the new normal of meanness and disrespect, from the president on down, is not, in fact, normal. Civility must be demonstrated in the classroom, if nowhere else.Todd M. Mealy, Millersville, Pa., High SchoolBecause of the Trump administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy and policy of separating migrant families, I am thinking of doing something new with my unit on Latinx studies for my seminar on race, ethnicity, and gender class.The Latinx study unit is preceded by a unit on Asian-American studies and the myth of the model minority. I see value in having students compare the experiences of Asian and Latino immigration into the United States, since both groups have endured fluctuating periods of citizenship.Laura L. Jones, Baltimore, Elementary SchoolWe have a community meeting every morning in my fourth-grade class to discuss what happened over the weekend, share our \u201cvirtue of the week\u201d or discuss anything on our minds. A weekly current-events assignment asks students to watch the news, read the newspaper or go to kid-friendly news sites to find something that interests them. I do not allow entertainment news or sports news to be discussed for this assignment. I also use Scholastic News magazines for reading comprehension as well as connecting our classroom community to what is happening outside our sphere.Hayley Breden, Denver, High SchoolSomething I try to emphasize in my classes is that the more I\u2019ve learned about issues and events in our nation\u2019s past, the more questions I have about our present.Over the past few years, and especially since November 2016, I have noticed that my students have an urgent interest in learning about how we got to now in our culture, country, and world. This coming year, I\u2019ll be placing a renewed emphasis on these essential questions that apply broadly to all of American history. We will address these questions throughout the school year:\u2022 To what extent have definitions of what it means to be \u201cAmerican\u201d changed or stayed the same since 1492?\u2022 In what ways do power and privilege dynamics shape who is included and excluded by American laws and policies?\u2022 In what ways does our society still hurt from oppression, and what can we do now and in the future to live up to the American ideals of freedom, equality and opportunity?\u2022 In what ways are economic, political and social power intertwined throughout American history?\u2022 How can hearing from multiple voices give us a better understanding of what has happened in the past and is currently happening today?Jon Resendez, Irvine, Calif., High SchoolCurrent events are the practical examples we use to apply the conceptual learning we do. My social studies students and I engage in regular discussions and debates on what is happening in the country and beyond.In these discussions, I model effective questioning techniques to probe and challenge my students\u2019 assumptions about various topics. From there, students practice their inquiry techniques through the application of various thinking routines inspired by provocative current-event-based videos, music, quotes and articles that allow them to brainstorm their own questions for research. Then I allow them to spend time in the classroom finding and sharing answers to those questions.Heathre Palige, Federal Heights, Colo., Elementary SchoolDo our students understand the advantages to consciously putting money into their savings for their futures? Are they discovering how to use a spreadsheet to see their expenditures and budget their incoming cash? Do they understand money market accounts and the stock market? In school, is anyone showing children the importance of financial literacy: debt-to-income ratios, types of mortgage rates, keeping track of monthly payments, the importance of saving for retirement, how to balance a checkbook?Michelle Lugo, Puerto Rico, High SchoolMake your lessons pertinent to life, and to your students\u2019 life decisions. Twelfth graders heading to college, not knowing which path to choose, can learn with Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cThe Road Not Taken.\u201d Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cStill I Rise\u201d and \u201cPhenomenal Woman\u201d can be connected to current issues around immigration and feminism. Make your students feel a part of the world. Their favorite athletes, musicians and celebrities can be can be connected to anything you\u2019re teaching.Claudine James, Malvern, Ark., Middle School In my English language arts lessons each spring, my students construct a tolerance-themed four-day exhibition hosted by the local community college and attended by district students and the community. In 2018, we created one called \u201cWe the People: Our Stories.\u201dThe exhibit highlighted various thematic stories: overcoming genocide, fighting for civil rights, women\u2019s fight for equality, immigrants\u2019 struggles, equality in education and achieving the American dream. Throughout the year, students were assigned multicultural novels, short stories, picture books and informational texts to read that related to the different themes.Lou Frederick, Brooklyn, N.Y., High SchoolI\u2019m going to spend the summer looking at ways to tackle two essential questions for my 10th grade humanities class: How do individuals define themselves and how are they defined? How does power or the lack of it affect individuals, groups and societies?One work we read is \u201cWoman Warrior\u201d by Maxine Hong Kingston. Through this novel, I want to address issues of ethnicity, immigration and gender. My plan is to have them read and analyze articles on the diversity of the Asian community in New York City. I also want to look at recent developments in the United States border policy that directly affect many of my students. Related to this, we will look ahead to what questions and racial categories will be on the 2020 census. I also plan to have my students look at the novel through the lenses of recent developments in the #MeToo movement, the latest Supreme Court pick and women\u2019s reproductive rights. I also plan to have them look at current media portrayals of female superheroes: Wonder Woman; Black Widow; Okoye, Shuri and Nakia from \u201cBlack Panther\u201d; and the Wasp in the latest Marvel offering.Mark Drago, Summerville, Mass., Middle and High SchoolDespite news reports like this one, and the fact that heat records keep being broken, every year I have some students say they do not think the climate is changing. I do not try to silence my student\u2019s ideas. Instead, I want to take the tools we use in class to address these current issues. Mathematics can help us understand the world around us and what is happening.Estella Owoimaha-Church, Los Angeles, High School1. students self-selecting relevant issues or events to their age group and community2. researching the issue at length3. interviewing stakeholders4. working together to compose a play5. getting the play out into the communityJarred Amato, Nashville, High SchoolOver time, we have focused our efforts on increasing access to high-quality, culturally relevant books, so that all students can develop authentic reading identities. We believe wholeheartedly in empowering our students as readers and leaders, and providing our young people with the time and space to read, discuss and celebrate books that affirm and value their identities and lived experiences.Our community now includes 400 Project LIT chapters in more than 40 states, and together we will continue to support and inspire one another, advocate policies and practices that challenge the status quo, and amplify the voices and stories of students and educators of color.Courtne Thomas, Newark, Middle SchoolAs English language arts educators, a colleague and I noticed our students\u2019 disengagement from the curriculum we were given. Simply put, it was not culturally relevant to their experiences, and the outcome was low achievement on benchmark testing. And yet, these same African-American and Latino young people would provide in-depth lyrical analysis of hip-hop songs by J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar and Wale. Central to hip-hop is storytelling about the political, social and economic challenges faced by people living in poor communities.My colleague and I tapped into the power of musical language to reach disaffected readers, and discovered that hip-hop can be used as a vehicle to promote literacy and academic achievement. We took a type of language and used it to reach a specific population that was never motivated to read via the five-week curriculum we created, \u201cThe Message: Using Hip-Hop Pedagogy as a Literacy-Building Tool.\u201dWhile investigating topics such as poverty, food insecurity and homelessness, as well as more positive topics such as determination, perseverance and resilience, our students have been able to make connections to the fields of economics, management and communications.Mirah Anti, Chicago, High SchoolOur civics curriculum is two semester-long courses, one a version of an introduction to civics and the other a deeper dive into what some refer to as the fourth branch of government or the fourth estate: media.I worked with my students to understand the role of the media through both the historic lens of the Pentagon Papers and the contemporary lens of the probe into the connection between the Trump campaign and Russia. Our research and processing are documented in the \u201cdetective web\u201d in the photo above.Barbara Gottschalk, Warren, Mich., Elementary SchoolI teach elementary E.S.L., and I work closely with general-education teachers to support English-language learners, the majority of whom are Christian Iraqis.Julie Mann, Queens, N.Y., High SchoolMy human rights class for E.S.L. students has always been built around current events; I never know what I\u2019m going to teach until life happens.Since the new administration took over, our class has been very focused on immigrant rights: travel bans, ICE raids, DACA, the myth of the criminal immigrant, and now the separation of families. This is the first time we\u2019ve ever made our own population the focus of the human rights class and I am guessing this is going to continue into next year.Savannah Lodge-Scharff, Roxbury, Mass., High SchoolBrett Vogelsinger, Central Bucks County, Penn., Middle SchoolConnecting current events to our study of literature and our independent-reading books makes the point that \u201ctheme\u201d is not some hidden picture or message in invisible ink within a text. Rather, themes in literature extend beyond the text and apply to real-life situations. We can find a theme from \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d that surfaces on the New York Times home page or in an Op-Ed. Jessica Kaiser, Lebanon, Ohio, Middle School Along with several choice novels, eighth graders in my school read three core texts: \u201cThe Giver\u201d by Lois Lowry; \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d by Mildred Taylor; and \u201cNight\u201d by Elie Wiesel. We often make connections to current events and how conflicts of the past are still prevalent today. In addition, these texts raise students\u2019 awareness of themselves, and of the people, ideologies and experiences that shape a person\u2019s identity.The latter two novels, \u201cNight\u201d and \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry,\u201d provide a common theme: Social injustices are often based on a single aspect of one\u2019s story. This theme allows connections to a plethora of modern-day literature and current events. Students choose from several different young-adult titles incorporating the common theme, social injustice. Students connect with and compare the plight of their character in their new book with that of the protagonists in the books we\u2019ve studied together, and to themselves.Mary Van Ellis, Central Bucks County, Pa., High SchoolThese videos are good to spur creative thinking and show what kind of out-of-the-box research is being done. After showing these videos, I may ask for discussion with a partner, then a class share, and ask for students to jot down ideas and thoughts about what they learned. Why do this? To show how we as humans have a lot to learn about how other creatures (even ones as lowly as a spider) figure out ways to survive, flourish and evolve, to pass on their genes!TSAT, New York, N.Y., CollegeI teach English-language learners at the college level through content-based language teaching or instruction, often using current events. My go-to sources are The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. I also rely on Flipboard, an app that has helped identify relatively obscure but interesting sources such as blogs and foreign media organizations.While my students are adults, some of the recent current events have been challenging to tackle, like the #MeToo movement and sexual harassment, the racial and ethnic tension behind the immigration debate and the latest in the L.G.B.T.Q. movement. Since my students are international, it requires special attention and sensitivity to navigate their cultural backgrounds, gender identities and religious beliefs. I find it interesting that a lot of time is often devoted to helping students understand and decode the culturally specific nature and dynamics that undergird many of the current events in the popular discourse.Brian Melton, Carol Stream, Ill., High SchoolKathleen Palmieri, New York, Elementary SchoolThe fifth-grade curriculum includes exploring governments in the Western Hemisphere in regard to differences in structure, as well as exploring relationships between countries globally.Rather than being textbook-driven, I plan to use current events to provide students with an understanding of our standing as a nation and the relationships we have throughout the world. As our president meets with the various leaders, it is important to remain neutral in any personal political beliefs, but instead continuously make connections to the curriculum.Jill Yamasawa Fletcher, Kapolei, Hawaii, Middle SchoolWe read the poems together and we discuss the ideas the poems bring up. From there we may research questions we have about what the poem references. When I introduce the poem, I tell students I\u2019m reading the poem with them for only the second time and I\u2019m learning and thinking about the poem with them. We are actually learning together.Jacqueline Fitzgerald, Portland, Ore., High SchoolIf I teach students that current events and issues are immediate and very present here in Oregon, if I support them in seeing their own lives reflected in everything going on \u201cout there,\u201d I hope they won\u2019t feel so overwhelmed by it all.My students were eager learners for this unit, digging into the texts and discussion opportunities with a fervor that communicated their hunger for wanting to understand race and racism in their own community, even if they\u2019d experienced racism firsthand.Debra Greene, Norwell, Mass., High SchoolI always try to help my students understand how the material we read is relevant to their lives. For example, with my freshmen, I pair Homer\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d with Margaret Atwood\u2019s feminist reimagining of that classic, \u201cThe Penelopiad.\u201d As part of that unit, I teach my students about the history of feminism as well as current issues such as #MeToo, the wage gap and rape culture.My freshmen also read Julia Alvarez\u2019s novel \u201cHow the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents.\u201d I have students examine statistics and stories about immigrants, and they have to interview a family member about their own family\u2019s story of coming to the United States. Then, we do a jigsaw of articles about different immigrant groups who have been targeted and stereotyped at various times in our country\u2019s history, such as the Irish and Italians. These groups were accused of such things as being terrorists and taking the jobs of Americans. My students recognize that these same accusations are hurled at Hispanic and Muslim immigrants today.Valente Gibson, Columbia, S.C., Elementary SchoolNext year, I plan to focus my teaching around helping my students bridge the gap between historic and current events, especially issues that largely affect students of color. For example, Rosa Parks\u2019s role in the Montgomery bus boycott can be associated with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality.Kalil Kantara, Humboldt County, Calif., Middle SchoolMy middle school students struggle to connect history to current events and often lack context for the latest headlines. This year, I found a lot of success in teaching early American history through the lens of the environmental movement. Students were incredulous at the shortsighted and callous ways in which European settlers polluted their own waterways, clear cut forests and destroyed ecosystems. To students living in a rural area, environmental degradation has a clear and significant impact on their lives, from lower spring water flows available during California\u2019s droughts to the diminished salmon populations due to overfishing and the pollution of the ocean. All year long we worked to connect the worldviews that could lead to such opportunistic and shortsighted thinking 100 years ago with those we are seeing in the world today.Melody Mullis, Central Bucks County, Pa., High SchoolFor students to get the most out of any piece of literature, I encourage them to make connections to text, self and world.In class, we read and discuss at least one article a week that is a current event but also connects to the text we are reading at the time. I also share TED Talks that are somehow related to the literature, even if it\u2019s not readily obvious to them how at first. The goal is to keep driving that point home \u2014 that connections can, and should, be made. By the second month of class, students naturally make the connections in discussions without being prompted.Megan Allen, Columbia, S.C., Elementary SchoolAs a white counselor working with mostly minority students, I am sensitive to the stories, needs and fears of my elementary students. It became clear last year that there was a heightened sense of fear because of current events such as police brutality, immigration issues, presidential tweets and comments, and government policy. Students are listening and watching, but schools rarely directly tackle these topics because of to their sensitive nature.As the only school counselor, I saw a need to address the issue of race and allow students the opportunity to express their thoughts, feelings and concerns in a safe environment at school. With the support of administration and classroom teachers, I led a class activity about prejudices which transformed into an open discussion about race. It was a wonderful way to allow children to process the world around them with the support of their peers.Advertisement"}

Jesting aside, Wickham explains why Australia is an ideal gateway to Asia: \u201cYou can run a follow-the-sun model, which means we can service our customers with global operations 24 hours a day.\u201dThe cloud computing giant employs around 300 people in the city. \u201cAccess to talent is important,\u201d Wickham adds. \u201cAnd you have that in Melbourne.\u201d More than 52 percent of residents have a tertiary education, and the city\u2019s world-class institutes boast a competitive edge in software engineering, cybersecurity and data sciences. Melbourne produces 38 percent of the nation\u2019s tech graduates, more than any other Australian state. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a state that supports our knowledge capital,\u201d says Philip Dalidakis, Victoria\u2019s Minister for Innovation and the Digital Economy.\nMelbourne\u2019s skilled work force, coupled with the affordable cost of doing business, also makes it attractive for the regional operations of multinationals to perform more sophisticated functions. In addition to customer service, sales and marketing, Google\u2019s Melbourne outfit is taking on software engineering work in cloud-based solutions and geo-mapping capabilities. \u201cWe have a cross-functional team represented by a dozen different parts of the business,\u201d says Sean McDonell, the company\u2019s site lead here. Meanwhile, the cloud-based customer services company Zendesk and mobile payment provider Square both picked Melbourne to open their first engineering labs outside the Valley.\nEven as Melbourne comes into its own as an international tech hub, it has had to create its own model. \u201cWe can\u2019t replicate the Silicon Valley model, nor should we try,\u201d says Dalidakis. Wickham, who also sits on the Innovation Expert Panel of the Victoria State Government, sees an opportunity for Melbourne to play to its strengths and deepen relationships between the government, universities and the private sector. \u201cWe need to bring in density and be intentional about getting the different parts of the ecosystem to work in unison,\u201d he says, citing the example of the Melbourne Innovation District, a partnership among the city of Melbourne, Melbourne University and RMIT to activate the Carlton Connect precinct.Spun off a decade ago from its parent tech company, SitePoint, 99designs is a global creative platform that makes it easy for designers and clients to work together on projects.As CEO, Llewellyn heads up a 120-strong team spread across Melbourne, Oakland, Calif., and Berlin. After joining the company in 2009, he moved to San Francisco to better service the company\u2019s  customer base in the U.S. and to be closer to the investment community in the Valley. The company received $35 million in financial backing from Accel, the venture capital firm that supported Dropbox, Etsy and Facebook. To date, the company has fulfilled almost one million projects and has 10,000 active designers on its network at any given time.A meeting with Victoria\u2019s Premier, Daniel Andrews, two years ago persuaded Llewellyn to run the global business from his home city. \u201cI could see how much he cared about the sector,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government is very progressive, and the ecosystem has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. An influx of accelerators and incubators and the creation of high-quality local VC funds have transformed Melbourne into a city that can compete internationally. I see crowds building at start-up conferences, and there is a new wave of founders benefiting from this increased investment and supportive infrastructure.\u201d Elzinga says that Melbourne is an excellent place from which to launch a global business. \u201cI wanted to build a business that was global from day one,\u201d he says, adding that he chose Melbourne over Sydney for the former\u2019s superior quality of life. Besides offering excellent coffee, international cuisine and a host of accessible sporting amenities, the government has invested heavily in smart city infrastructure and has dedicated a $60 million fund to the sector. Many civic spaces have Wi-Fi, making it possible to work outdoors and still be connected to the internet. Everywhere you look, people are using their phones to pay, find their way around or hail a cab.\nTo Bhargava, increased global attention is a natural outcome of his city\u2019s tech maturation: \u201cMelbourne is also the cultural and creative heart of Australia, which means that our entrepreneurs approach things very differently when it comes to finding solutions.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "Simple Desk Improvements That Make an Open Office Easier to Bear", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting in an open floor plan office or having flexible, unassigned seating at work is a challenge to be sure, but these tips can make your work space a bit more bearable.If you\u2019re stuck with an open floor plan, there are a few things you can do to block out the noise, focus and make your work space a bit more inviting every day. \u201cWe do this so that people can measure their time,\u201d Mr. Mann said, \u201cunderstand how long meetings take, and assess how much time they\u2019re spending on projects.\u201dIf you don\u2019t have an assigned desk but do have storage like a closet, locker or cabinet, make sure your effects are also portable enough to store. You may even consider bringing a small tote bag, so you can pack up your stuff at the end of the day and grab it when you arrive in the morning. Whatever you do, make sure the plants will thrive in your specific desk environment. Even if the plant you buy doesn\u2019t need a lot of water, it may not do well in fluorescent lighting, far from the windows. Others might be fine without direct light, but a chilly office will stunt their growth. At my last job, I had a set of succulents that were too close to a cold, uninsulated window, so they didn\u2019t grow until I moved them away from it. Not all headphones are equal, and not all headphones are great for the office. So-called open-back headphones offer more expansive, rich sound, but the open back means everyone around you can hear a little of what you\u2019re listening to. Closed-back headphones, on the other hand, offer a little more isolation, which means sound quality can feel more closed in and tight, but you won\u2019t treat the person next to you to an impromptu concert. Not everyone likes music while they work, but I find an upbeat, instrumental playlist helps me tune out the rest of the world and focus. You probably have a favorite streaming music service already, or even a killer playlist you listen to when you\u2019re in the zone, but consider trying one of those services\u2019 mood-based stations as well. Mr. Mann endorsed this idea. \u201cSometimes, you just need a few minutes of privacy or a room to to focus and not be disturbed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller rooms are essential to success in an open work space as it gives people an opportunity to work privately or quietly together. An open space also allows for large public areas to be built for gathering and socializing. For an open space to be effective, people also need to have the ability to sit alone or with someone else in private.\u201dAdvertisement"}

According to Ms. Brennan-Jobs, her father, the towering archetype of the tech founder, was trying to instill in her a tougher character, and she forgives him.

And when it turned out to be Mr. Yrigoyen, fans immediately began to wonder: Had the bachelorette made a choice she might now be regretting?Didn\u2019t see the finale? Didn\u2019t see any of the episodes? Not sure what the fuss was all about? Here\u2019s a helpful guide:\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d is a spinoff of ABC\u2019s popular \u201cBachelor\u201d romance competition series, which first aired in 2002. In a process that lasts around two months, the main love interest goes through a speed-dating process with pool of 25 to 30 romantic prospects.Ms. Sutter was the runner-up in the first season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d ABC frequently recycles contestants (usually the runners-up) from \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d to star in the \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d and vice versa.There are always hometown dates with the finalists. Blake Horstmann, the runner-up to Mr. Yrigoyen this season, took Ms. Kufrin to Bailey, Colo., where she met his family and heard about the school shooting that took place when he was in high school. Mr. Yrigoyen \u2014 who had liked an Instagram post calling a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d \u2014 took Ms. Kufrin to Manteca, Calif., where he grew up.The bachelor or bachelorette also goes with one or more of the suitors to the \u201cfantasy suite,\u201d the destination for the show\u2019s only private moments.Hence why Ms. Kufrin, a 28-year-old publicist from the Twin Cities area, ended up this season\u2019s \u201cBachelorette.\u201dIn the season premiere, Ms. Kufrin gave the \u201cfirst impression\u201d rose \u2014 signifying immediate interest \u2014 to Mr. Yrigoyen, a 29-year-old medical sales representative. Soon after it aired, insensitive Instagram posts he \u201cliked\u201d came to light. The posts mocked transgender people, undocumented immigrants, and left-wing feminists.\u201cI am sorry to those who I offended, and I also take full responsibility for my \u2018likes\u2019 on Instagram that were hurtful and offensive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI do not want my social media to define who I am, and I will take better care moving forward to support all walks of life.\u201dIn June, Warner Bros., which produces the show, said that it had not known of Mr. Adim\u2019s arrest when it cast him and that a \u201cwell-respected and highly experienced\u201d third party entrusted with the show\u2019s background checks had made no mention of it.The network had no need to deal with Mr. Adim\u2019s past because he was eliminated in week 6. He did not appear in last week\u2019s \u201cMen Tell All\u201d episode, in which men who have been eliminated gather to rehash the juicy events of the season.But Ms. Kufrin had remained smitten with Mr. Yrigoyen since the first impression rose. At one point, she said he reminded her of her deceased father. He admitted to her that he had been previously married for two months. In Episode 7, the two explored the Bahamas by seaplane and Mr. Yrigoyen told Ms. Kufrin he was starting to fall in love with her.Warner Bros. declined to comment on Mr. Yrigoyen\u2019s behavior or about any possible changes to its vetting process.On Monday night, she addressed the matter during a live portion of the broadcast.\u201cThe Instagram situation, I don\u2019t condone that,\u201d Ms. Kufrin said. \u201cI know he stands by his apology. He feels so bad for everyone that he did offend. He didn\u2019t mean it. I want to move forward and to learn and to grow and to continue to educate ourselves.\u201dAnd Mr. Yrigoyen apologized again: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d\u201cI was really worried about it, that I might lose her for that,\u201d he continued. The whole experience, he added, \u201cmade us stronger as a couple.\u201dInterest in Mr. Yrigoyen had been high, though not necessarily because of his social media activity.Mr. Yrigoyen consistently got more searches on Google than Mr. Horstmann, the other finalist.Many expressed anger about Mr. Yrigoyen\u2019s behavior on social media.Others stood up for his political views, or at least thought too much was being made of them. One tweet in support received 1,000 likes.And others simply expressed excitement over him and did not acknowledge his views at all.Ms. Kufrin and Mr. Yrigoyen appeared Monday night on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d but Mr. Kimmel did not bring up the topic. It did come up Tuesday morning on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d where Ms. Kufrin said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest but we\u2019ve gotten through it.\u201dIn Episode 4, Ms. Kufrin had compared relationships to the sport of bobsledding, so she might already be prepared to deal with any future disagreements.\u201cYou have to be fast, you have to be precise, you have to be ready for the curves,\u201d Ms. Kufrin says. \u201cAnd hopefully it\u2019s all worth it in the end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "You Wrote the Play. Can You Let It Go?", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis was staging Matthew Lopez\u2019s \u201cThe Legend of Georgia McBride\u201d this summer when a national brouhaha erupted that could have affected the production.The theater went to Mr. Lopez with a request: Would he agree to substitute another corporate pizza chain so as not to be distracting? Mr. Lopez readily agreed. Problem solved. (He declined to discuss the decision.)But for many playwrights, the productions that follow a play\u2019s premiere \u2014 when it is handed over to theaters around the country and the world \u2014 can be fraught. And more than the purveyor of pepperoni is at stake.First and foremost, casting can become an issue, especially when characters are written to be played by specific genders or ethnic groups. But for living playwrights, other ways directors and actors interpret (or tamper with?) their writing can be nerve-racking, too.But at that point in his career, Mr. Joseph didn\u2019t completely buy in to the opinion of a playwright known for exerting extreme authorial control. \u201cI felt actors\u2019 artistic choices were helping my writing so I didn\u2019t want to be too prescriptive,\u201d he said.The character of Kev, whom Mr. Joseph called an \u201cextremely immature and not very bright soldier\u201d who later becomes \u201cintrospective and intelligent as a ghost,\u201d was developed with the actor Brad Fleischer. Mr. Joseph left him room to interpret the writing.But later productions revealed that other actors could not provide the same nuance and texture \u201cso the character comes across underwritten and as a stereotype that might be offensive to soldiers,\u201d Mr. Joseph said.\u201cThat started me thinking that I can\u2019t be writing just for the brilliant actors you are developing the roles for,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t actor-proof your script, but I\u2019d have written that character slightly differently to prevent those problems.\u201dMany playwrights willingly entrust their words to directors and actors of secondary productions, expecting most professional theaters in America to respect the licensing contracts they signed. Oftentimes, requests for changes are fairly minor, and many writers say they learn to step back.If a play is like an author\u2019s child, said David Henry Hwang (\u201cM. Butterfly\u201d) \u201cyou can\u2019t helicopter parent them forever.\u201d\u201cAt some point you have to cede control,\u201d added Lynn Nottage (\u201cRuined,\u201d \u201cSweat\u201d). \u201cAnd there\u2019s some beauty in creating a piece of art that has a life beyond me, for other people to build on my ideas.\u201dSarah Ruhl (\u201cIn the Next Room, or the vibrator play\u201d) said a playwright must be trusting to survive. \u201cOne of the joys of theater is the collaboration,\u201d Ms. Ruhl said. \u201cI make stage directions more about intention than instructions.\u201dWhile few playwrights go as far as Albee and Samuel Beckett in controlling their texts, Mr. Joseph said he sometimes feels the need to include more explication of character, motivation and tone to ensure his play will remain his. And like Mr. Joseph, Ms. Nottage acknowledged that she is more prescriptive now than when she was younger.Still, she said, even when she thinks she has \u201claid out enough clues\u201d some directors require explicit instructions. The love between Esther and Mr. Marks in her 2003 \u201cIntimate Apparel\u201d should remain unconsummated as written. Yet she once received a letter from an audience member who saw a production that culminated with the characters making out.\u201cI wrote the show to say that was not permitted,\u201d Ms. Nottage said.\u201cI can learn a lot from a good actor who doesn\u2019t get my rhythm,\u201d she said.\u201cI build off their takes on things or the way they might hit a word,\u201d she added. \u201cThe specifications in my script come from there.\u201dFor playwrights, interpretation is one thing, but messing with the actual words in the script is another issue entirely.\u201cIf they are changing the language I would shut it down,\u201d said Ms. Ruhl. \u201cIf they honor my language and intentions then carpe diem.\u201dIn some cases, stage directions and notes may not solve these problems since directors may arbitrarily break from the text. When Ms. Nottage learned that a production of \u201cRuined\u201d in Florida was going to be, well, ruined \u2014 \u201cThe director felt the play was too long for a geriatric audience so they were cutting it down\u201d \u2014 she issued an edict, saying in essence, if they wanted a shorter play they should choose a shorter play.\u201cThey restored the text,\u201d she added.Ms. Thurber recalled a version of \u201cScarcity\u201d in which \u201cthe director literally inserted staging moments and musical moments and put characters into scenes where they weren\u2019t.\u201dHad she seen it early in the run she would have asked that it be shut down, but instead she settled for venting her anger at the director. Since then, Ms. Thurber has largely avoided productions of her plays in which she is not involved. \u201cI go out of my way not to read press for other productions,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201calthough sometimes I see posters online and it makes me feel uncomfortable.\u201dGoogle Alert, Mr. Lindsay-Abaire added, \u201cis a terrifying thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gratifying knowing your plays are being done,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut you click on these links and you see production photos that look like they\u2019ve been taken at summer camp talent shows.\u201dHe worries as much about straightforward and sincere but poorly directed and miscast productions of his plays as he does about conscious butchering: \u201cIt hurts seeing your characters reduced to wacky caricatures. You can\u2019t fly all around the country to each audience to say, \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s this and not that.\u2019\u201dBy contrast, Mr. Hwang and Ms. Nottage said they frequently enjoy seeing later productions of plays, with Ms. Nottage praising an amateur production of \u201cIntimate Apparel\u201d in Brooklyn Heights \u201cthat took a sensitive and nuanced approach.\u201dMany playwrights find that the most egregious directorial indulgences tend to occur abroad. \u201cIn Europe they do not see the word as sacred and distortion is permitted,\u201d Ms. Nottage said, explaining that directors trained there view \u201ctext as a piece of clay to do whatever they want with.\u201dMs. Ruhl\u2019s \u201cEurydice\u201d was performed in Germany with a major monologue cut and a new character added. \u201cThe actors wore clown makeup and the show ran two-and-a-half hours where my play was about 90 minutes,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was dumbfounded and felt very lonely sitting through it.\u201dMr. Lindsay-Abaire has learned to relish the absurdity of those productions. \u201cTo me the weirdo experimental version of my play is more forgivable because it\u2019s such a clear and deliberate departure from my intent as a writer,\u201d he said.The \u201cloopiest\u201d interpretation Mr. Lindsay-Abaire ever saw was a YouTube trailer for \u201cGood People\u201d in Zurich with the characters dressed as superheroes.\u201cIt was an insane avant-garde take on a very naturalistic play,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh. \u201cIf they even licensed it I\u2019m sure they were breaking every part of the contract.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He went with me to Trader Joe\u2019s, trailing behind, picking up items and putting them down. Afterward he would enthusiastically carry my bags. He started saying, \u201cI love you, and you love me too.\u201dI knew him for 13 days. For those 13 days, we were together constantly. He told me he was a real estate agent so he had time and a flexible schedule. He told me he was between apartments, staying with friends in their gorgeous Bushwick apartment, where he helped out with their new baby.He taught me about emo music. I introduced him to Gloria Estefan. We listened to everything in bed, shouting at Alexa while singing poorly and loudly.He was fast and alert, like an amphibian, popping and bobbing around me. He had a thing for that cartoon cat called Pusheen and would say, \u201cPusheen\u201d in a baby voice every chance he got. One day he brought me a stuffed animal sort of like it, and I oohed and aahed.James was kind of great, but his intensity freaked me out. When I first swiped him on Tinder, I didn\u2019t see the overgrown skater boy he turned out to be. I thought he was serious in his photos, a grown-up. In person he seemed too cool for me, too playful and young. He was cute, laughed a lot when I was funny, and complimented me. Truthfully, I didn\u2019t much like him at first. But I tried it.I always try it. That\u2019s how I am and always have been. I don\u2019t remember a lot from my childhood in Fort Wayne, Ind., but I do remember creepy things. There was a girl in the neighborhood who had a dirty face and dirty hands. Once we found her crouched on the floor of our pantry eating Ritz crackers, and my mother had to shoo her away.That image hits me in a dark place. It\u2019s so real, but did it actually happen? My childhood memory is like a murky, creepy liar. However, some things are crystal clear, like when my father would drive me to figure skating practice and I would look at my own hands in my lap and think: \u201cWho is that? How long will I be stuck in this charade? How long do I have to be trapped in me?\u201dIt seemed unendurable.Emotionally doubling let me \u2014 made me \u2014 hold hands with James and have sex with James and put up with James at all. I have always had romantic relationships because it seemed easier than not having them. It was so much more work to say, \u201cNo thanks.\u201dAlthough I was aware that humans need and desire love, sex, togetherness and family, and that they prioritize those things, I felt as if I were doing all that just to do it. In terms of love, I always accepted horrible deficits, emptiness and disconnection, and I didn\u2019t really care.When I met James, three years ago, I was 36 and nothing about my life was how I wanted it to be. My apartment had one window (it still does). I spent hours walking around Brooklyn Heights peering into people\u2019s living rooms. I was surviving as an actress, on residuals. When I was acting, I had everything; when I wasn\u2019t, I had nothing.And I set it up like that. I chose to believe that, for me, everything that was important to other people was wrapped up in success. It was as if success were a pi\u00f1ata, and when I finally smashed it all of the stuff of life would fall out, and I would consume it and become one with myself.I thought the same way about love. I figured that love, for me, would fall out of the success pi\u00f1ata whenever I was finally able to break it open. It took me years to realize that success wasn\u2019t actual or tangible or a pi\u00f1ata in any way. In fact, I had already experienced a big conventional success \u2014 being on a hit TV show \u2014 and no pi\u00f1ata containing all of life\u2019s delights had burst open for me. That\u2019s how I found myself on Tinder.And Tinder brought me James. For 13 days, James told me I was beautiful. For 13 days, he proudly held Cindy\u2019s leash and paraded her around my block as if it were his block. He was super into it, and it was his \u201cinto-it-ness\u201d that got me and started to change me. I was starting to imagine that I might like him or that liking him or any man was something from my very own life. I took him to meet my friends. There I was, getting kissed and squeezed in front of my people.Then, after those 13 long days, he said, \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dIt\u2019s the kind of sentence that makes the floor drop out.\u201cEverything I told you is true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true anymore.\u201dMeaning he wasn\u2019t actually working as a real estate agent. He didn\u2019t have a job, or, as it turned out, a place to live. He wasn\u2019t living with any friend or helping out with any baby. He was staying in a men\u2019s shelter somewhere out in Queens.He cried a lot, and I felt sick. I sat there waiting, vibrating in that empty moment.\u201cBut you have so many shoes,\u201d I said.And he did. He seemed to have on a different pair every time I saw him. He had style and outfits, which he kept in a locker.The feeling that followed was so strange, as if I were coming into consciousness in the middle of a home invasion. My breathing slowed and I became still. Psychologically, I started to move around him, soothing and cajoling him toward the door.I know that anyone can fall on hard times and that the world is awful, but I was suddenly scared of him and angry. It was as if he had broken into my house and my body. He had given me what I needed so I would give him what he wanted, and it made me feel worthless.In the moment, I did what I could to get him away from me. I could have screamed that he was a liar. Instead, I stood in silence, facing off with my own guilt and unease. It was ugly because I had a problem with a person who had nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201dBut it was his fault that he lied to me and used me. What happened between us was his fault. It took another 10 days for me to completely break up with him \u2014 via text, email and messenger \u2014 until he had resisted and persisted to the point that he finally earned my cruelty. And that was that. Until later that summer, when I passed a candy store with a giant stuffed Pusheen in the window. Staring into its pinprick eyes, I realized that my lying Tinder lover was the one who broke my emotional double. Because of him, I had crashed into my own self and come to see that I did want and need real love, that I did want and need good things, and that I am more than just a lifeboat for desperate men who prey on women who don\u2019t care enough about themselves.Leaning against that windowpane and remembering my time with James, I felt a tiny pi\u00f1ata burst open in my heart.Advertisement"}

After an ugly breakup, it was time to get her back.It wasn\u2019t the type of New Year\u2019s resolution that I, or the man I said it to, had anticipated. We hurled profanities and accusations onto it, but nothing could wash away the truth \u2014 we were over. And that\u2019s how I came to drive 2,130 miles for a haircut.When it comes to hair, I have long been the trusting type. For most of my life, upon entering a salon, I would hand over control to the stylist, saying, \u201cDo as you think best.\u201d They were the experts, right?This approach translated into many, many bad haircuts.And then I met Anne. A friend with similarly difficult hair had referred me to her. From the first moment, Anne seemed to know how to shape me into my best self. Maybe she could help again? Not that a new haircut is an unusual response to a breakup. But in my case, there were six states between my place in the Rocky Mountains and Anne\u2019s Manhattan salon.On the second day of the new year, I waded through the haze of grief that comes with all endings. I repacked my car with the items I had unloaded one year earlier, when \u201chappily ever after\u201d seemed a possibility. I climbed up and down, up and down, up and down the stairs that had led me home so many times. Listening to \u201cClay Pigeons\u201d on repeat, I harmonized with John Prine, vowing to \u201cGet used to bein\u2019 alone.\u201d I had been alone before, I reminded myself. I had spent most of my adult life alone. At 36, the closest I had come to marriage was a proposal from a man who couldn\u2019t commit to a dinner date. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want lasting love. I did. I do. But after decades of trying to find him, I still wasn\u2019t sure what he looked like.Maybe that\u2019s because I still wasn\u2019t sure what I looked like. There were so many possible versions of myself, I could never choose just one. And so for me, men appeared in chapters, but they never stuck around for the epilogue. With my car bloated from imprecise packing and with whiskey in my veins, I closed my eyes that night, waiting for sleep, waiting to turn the page.The next morning, Jan. 3, something urged me east, toward where I grew up, toward my family. And so I drove away from my home in southwest Colorado as the sun crept above the mountains and Prine counseled me to \u201cget along with it all.\u201dI drove past the trailhead where my last chapter had begun and saw myself standing there 14 months earlier, a woman who had shed her identity as a suit-wearing Manhattan lawyer for another, still-forming persona. Completely rejecting my former self was the only way I knew how to embrace the version of me who didn\u2019t want to drink martinis, work 70 hours a week and wear Jimmy Choos for the rest of her life. I knew that other me existed because of the sinking emptiness that had been a constant presence in my New York life.So two years ago I quit my job, moved into my car and drove west. It was a wholesale break from the world I had inhabited for more than a decade. In my new, itinerant life, I rarely showered. I washed my clothes once a month. I traded 70-hour workweeks for 40-mile trail runs. And I never cut my hair. It worked. After almost a year on the road, I had fully unearthed that buried part of myself. A part that now shone so bright with autonomy and independence that it had blinded me from seeing how the isolation of my new identity also haunted me. The days were shrinking, the nights growing longer, and I was alone. Then, I met him.Gazing out of my car\u2019s passenger window, which framed the snow-battered mountain ridge I had crested 14 months earlier, I glimpsed his tall silhouette.The man moved over rocks with a slowness I envied. When our eyes met, I saw a face that resembled my first love. A love founded on the ideals of my youth. And I was closer in this new life to the ideals of that 15-year-old girl than I had been since I had left my rural hometown almost two decades before. The youth of his face pulled me in.That day I followed him along the ridge, through a meandering valley and up a rock-scattered slope. When we reached the summit, I looked at his face against the looming peaks as he reached out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you,\u201d he said.\u201cGreat to meet you too.\u201d I placed my hand in his. Was it possible to collide with love like this?Now, as the mountains melted in my side mirror, I coaxed my car along the curves and wondered whether I would have fallen in love with any man who had been standing on that ridge at that moment. But I think it was more than just the longing bred from loneliness and isolation. It was the partnership I\u2019d found in the wholesale rejection of my past life. With him at my side, I hid in a town with fewer people than had resided in my Manhattan high-rise.I derided Manhattan as consumptive, overambitious and soulless. I declared that money was of no importance to me. I grieved for those who were less enlightened. And a year slipped away. But inhabiting the extremes demands self-discipline that borders on self-delusion. Near year\u2019s end, the voice of the woman I thought I had left behind began to stir. I fed her a martini. I let her watch \u201cSex and the City.\u201d I dug a sequined dress out of storage. But every time she emerged, I would try to shove her back into the past, where I thought she belonged.It had been her, I reasoned, who pushed me onto a path molded by others\u2019 expectations \u2014 a path that muffled the creative, the imaginative and the simple in me. But we can only suppress aspects of self for so long. Sooner or later, there will be a rebellion.My New York self never would have fallen in love with the man on that ridge. And he never would have fallen in love with her. It wasn\u2019t fair to either of us to be in a relationship with only half of me. The day I drove away, the sky was so blue that it didn\u2019t seem real. Two hours later, I came to a stop before flashing red lights and a clattering bell. I looked down at the golden tangle of ringlets cascading over my right shoulder. I missed my bob. I missed the woman with that bob.I closed my eyes and drifted back to New York City. I saw myself on gum-flecked sidewalks among skyscrapers, sliding my hands into the pockets of my crimson coat, my right finger poking through the familiar hole in the silk lining. My nose scrunched as the charred air mixed with stale remnants of the city\u2019s inhabitants, and horns and sirens blared around me. If I could have caught the noise\u2019s current, it would have carried me from West 48th Street to East Houston Street. The grunge, the grind and the grit were still in me and always would be.I opened my eyes. As the train thundered by, I reached for my phone. I knew who could help bring back that rejected part of myself: Anne. I hadn\u2019t seen her since I was last in New York, two years earlier. But it was easy to recall the trust I had enjoyed with her and the hours I had spent warmed by cups of tea and conversation at the salon. I scrolled to her website. She had an opening at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. Booked. I had three and a half days to get to East 11th Street and Avenue B.I had spent the better part of my time away feeling afraid to go back to Manhattan, but by the time a roadside plaque informed me that I was leaving Colorado, I was no longer afraid of the person I had been there. Instead, I was afraid that if I kept suppressing that person, I would land back in the same place I had been when I moved into my car and fled. I would just be standing at the other end of the spectrum. I wasn\u2019t driving 2,130 miles for a haircut. I was going to retrieve the woman I had left in New York and bring her back with me. I didn\u2019t know how the change would unfold or what it would look like, but I hoped I could somehow meet myself in the middle. In the meantime, I was going to listen to some Sinatra.Allison Snyder is a writer in southwest Colorado.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Life Is Short. That\u2019s the Point. ", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEASOur mortality is not something to be overcome. It is integral to our humanity.Contributing Opinion WriterConsider this fact of modern life: Nearly all of the technological products that we buy and use are designed with planned obsolescence in mind. They are built specifically to fail after a relatively short period \u2014 one year, two, maybe five. If you doubt that, think about how often you have to replace your smartphone. Gadgets are designed to die.The irony, however, is that the same Silicon Valley culture that produces these gadgets seems to be obsessed with living forever.  Today\u2019s \u201clife extension\u201d movement includes venture capitalists like the tech billionaire Peter Thiel pouring money into anti-aging and life extension start-ups. (While the rumor that Mr. Thiel receives regular blood transfusions from 18-year olds turned out to be false, there is, of course, an actual company \u2014 Ambrosia Plasma \u2014 that provides young plasma infusions for $8,000 a liter.) And Google launched the biotech company Calico to increase its \u201cunderstanding of the biology that controls lifespan,\u201d and bolstered that goal by conducting research on the long-living naked mole rat, a species that shows little to no signs of aging. In recent years, the lure of disrupting death has become a hot industry. Paul Bennett, a partner at the design consultancy IDEO, was among the first to tap into it. A profile in The California Sunday Magazine in 2015 described an epiphany he had: \u201c \u2018Oh,\u2019 he told himself. \u2018You need to redesign death.\u2019 \u201d Since then, an entire new market has flourished. Death as a conduit for innovation. Death as a participatory exhibition. Death as the organizing principle for networking dinners. Death as an app. There are now people who refer to themselves as \u201clongevity entrepreneurs,\u201d who see death not as a problem but rather as something to be eliminated. Instead of pursuing a good death, why die at all? Beneath the surface of this quest for eternal life seems to be an unwillingness on the part of its proponents to imagine the world without themselves in it.In a very fundamental way, this tendency is inhuman. In her new book, \u201cNatural Causes: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer,\u201d Barbara Ehrenreich writes: \u201cYou can think of death bitterly or with resignation, as a tragic interruption of your life, and take every possible measure to postpone it. Or, more realistically, you can think of life as an interruption of an eternity of personal nonexistence, and seize it as a brief opportunity to observe and interact with the living, ever-surprising world around us.\u201dI was taken by Ms. Ehrenreich\u2019s formulation, this notion that our experience of life, though unique to us, is just part of a broader continuum. Our time here is but a blip, and when we leave, the great world continues to spin. As such, the appreciation of our own lives has much to do with the ever-increasing awareness of its relative brevity. It is this \u2014 an awareness and acceptance of our own mortality \u2014 that makes us human. And it is the impetus, I\u2019d argue, for living our lives to the fullest.There was a brief period in my own life \u2014 less than two years \u2014 in which I got married, lost my mother to cancer, had a miscarriage, bought a house and gave birth to a child. Experiencing all this in so short a time span made me feel almost too human. That barrage of ends and beginnings left me intensely aware of the fragility of life as well as enthralled by the glorious intensity of it: I lost and simultaneously gained so much. Today this awareness of the temporal nature of it all leaves me determined to seize, observe and interact with the days that remain. It is the knowledge of how quickly, sometimes tragically, things can change or disappear that fuels my urgency to be in the present.As a teenager I remember lamenting how horrible and unfair life was, only to have my parents respond that one couldn\u2019t appreciate the good without experiencing the bad. Back then, hearing that was annoying; as an adult, it remains annoying, but it is also completely true.It is rare for us to give much thought to the challenges we would face if there were no end to our time on earth. Would the condition of our bodies affect the condition of our minds? Would everyone live forever, or just those with the means to afford it? Could you opt out of eternal life? Would inequality dissolve, or would it become even more of an intractable problem? Would we still gain the empathy, wisdom and insight that can come with age?

{"Headline": "Attempting the Impossible: A Thoughtful Meditation on Technology", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What began as a vague apprehension \u2014 unease over the amount of time we spend on our devices, a sense that our children are growing up distracted \u2014 has, since the presidential election of 2016, transformed into something like outright panic. Pundits and politicians debate the perils of social media; technology is vilified as an instigator of our social ills, rather than a symptom. Something about our digital life seems to inspire extremes: all that early enthusiasm, the utopian fervor over the internet, now collapsed into fear and recriminations.\u201cBitwise: A Life in Code,\u201d David Auerbach\u2019s thoughtful meditation on technology and its place in society, is a welcome effort to reclaim the middle ground. Auerbach, a former professional programmer, now a journalist and writer, is \u201ccautiously positive toward technology.\u201d He recognizes the very real damage it is causing to our political, cultural and emotional lives. But he also loves computers and data, and is adept at conveying the awe that technology can summon, the bracing sense of discovery that Arthur C. Clarke memorably compared to touching magic. \u201cMuch joy and satisfaction can be found in chasing after the secrets and puzzles of the world,\u201d Auerbach writes. \u201cI felt that joy first with computers.\u201dThe book is a hybrid of memoir, technical primer and social history. It is perhaps best characterized as a survey not just of technology, but of our recent relationship to technology. Auerbach is in a good position to conduct this survey. He has spent much of his life on the front lines, playing around as a kid with Turtle graphics, working on Microsoft\u2019s Messenger Service after college, and then reveling in Google\u2019s oceans of data. (Among his lasting contributions, for which he does not express adequate contrition, is being the first, while at Microsoft, to introduce smiley face emoticons to America.) He writes well about databases and servers, but what\u2019s really distinctive about this book is his ability to dissect Joyce and Wittgenstein as easily as C++ code. One of Auerbach\u2019s stated goals is to break down barriers, or at least initiate a conversation, between technology and the humanities, two often irreconcilable domains. He suggests that we need to be bitwise (i.e., understand the world through the lens of computers) as well as worldwise. We must \u201cbe able to translate our ideas between the two realms.\u201dAuerbach\u2019s polymathishness is impressive; it can also be overwhelming. This is not a book that wears its knowledge lightly, and the trail is sometimes meandering, littered with digressive pathways and citations. It\u2019s hard to pin down a clear line of argument. Still, this doesn\u2019t really detract from the overall pleasure of reading. \u201cBitwise\u201d is best approached as a series of essays and snippets. This is one of those books you dip in and out of, surrendering to what the American travel writer Gretel Ehrlich \u2014 in a very different context \u2014 has called \u201cambulation of the mind.\u201dIt\u2019s sometimes hard to remember this, but the internet is young \u2014 a mere three decades or so have passed since its mass adoption. Our relationship to technology is still evolving, characterized by inevitable spats and rapprochements. Yet throughout these cycles, we are increasingly intimate, ever more intertwined and interdependent. The danger is that this relationship will, like so much else in our public lives, be captured by extremism: that we will be forced to choose camps, that we will divide ourselves into mutually antagonistic factions of technology lovers and technology haters. We need guides on this journey \u2014 judicious, balanced and knowledgeable commentators, like Auerbach.Akash Kapur is the author of \u201cIndia Becoming: A Portrait of Life in Modern India.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s Vision of Self-Driving Cars Begins to Blur", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After Dara Khosrowshahi took over as Uber\u2019s chief executive last August, he considered shutting the company\u2019s money-losing autonomous vehicle division. A visit to Pittsburgh this spring changed that.In town for a leadership summit, Mr. Khosrowshahi and other Uber executives were briefed on the state of the company\u2019s self-driving vehicle research, which is based in Pittsburgh. The group was impressed by the progress its autonomous division had made in testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and in Arizona, according to three people familiar with the ride-hailing company, who were not authorized to speak publicly. They left the meeting energized, convinced that Uber needed to forge ahead with self-driving cars, the people said.The accident threw Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle efforts into flux, immediately forcing the suspension of its self-driving car tests in cities including Tempe, Pittsburgh and Toronto. Months later, Uber\u2019s executives are divided over what to do with the autonomous business, according to the people familiar with the company. While one camp is pushing Mr. Khosrowshahi to seek partnerships or even a potential sale of the unit, known as the Advanced Technologies Group, a rival contingent is arguing that developing self-driving technology is crucial to Uber\u2019s future, the people said.Mr. Khosrowshahi remains undecided, the people said, though he has expressed a desire to partner with other companies on autonomous technologies. In recent months, Uber has started talking with a few auto manufacturers about potential partnerships, including supplying Uber\u2019s autonomous driving technology for use in Toyota\u2019s minivans, according to one person familiar with the talks. Toyota declined to comment.The internal debates are unfolding at a time when many companies can ill afford to pause on autonomous technology given stiff competition from carmakers and other tech companies. In recent months, top engineers have left Uber\u2019s self-driving project for lucrative opportunities elsewhere. Uber\u2019s self-driving cars recently returned to the road in Pittsburgh but with human drivers at the wheel, meaning employees are driving around like any other motorist \u2014 except their vehicles are carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in technology.At a meeting in Pittsburgh on Aug. 8, according to a person briefed on the event, Mr. Khosrowshahi did not address what he would do with the self-driving efforts but told employees there that it \u201cis a big-time hardware manufacturing, software problem at scale. Lots of tech companies out there are going after this problem, but I think there are very few companies who are taking this on end-to-end at scale the way we are.\u201dIn a statement, Uber said: \u201cRight now the entire team is focused on safely and responsibly returning to the road in autonomous mode. That\u2019s our No. 1 objective, and we have every confidence in the work they are doing to get us there.\u201dBy early this year, Uber\u2019s self-driving division was preparing to ramp up development, pushing its testing cars in Arizona to tally more miles. The goal, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times, was for Uber to win regulatory approval to start testing a self-driving car service in Arizona before the end of this year.In May, Uber announced that it was shutting its driverless testing hub in Arizona and laying off 300 employees. A day later, preliminary findings from federal regulators investigating the crash confirmed what many self-driving car experts suspected: Uber\u2019s self-driving car should have detected a pedestrian with enough time to stop, but it failed to do so. Uber has begun a safety review and plans to publish its assessment in the coming months.Mr. Khosrowshahi has started to subtly de-emphasize the company\u2019s role in developing driverless technology.And in July, Uber announced that it was closing its autonomous trucking business. The company instead said it would focus exclusively on building self-driving cars.\u201cFor now, we need the focus of one team, with one clear objective,\u201d Eric Meyhofer, who leads Uber\u2019s driverless car efforts, wrote in an email to employees.In the preceding months, some senior engineers and executives with expertise in self-driving vehicles had already left. One of those was Don Burnette, one of Otto\u2019s founders, who became the chief executive of a new self-driving company called Kodiak, which focuses on long-haul trucking.\u201cI really wanted to focus on the trucking problem, and there was not as much focus on that at Uber,\u201d Mr. Burnette said.He added that Uber would most likely continue to pursue its vision of driverless cars because it and other companies \u201chave been working on it for so long, promising this for so long, and they have a tremendous amount of money behind them.\u201dCade Metz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Now California is poised to rein it back in.Over two decades, Silicon Valley built a political machine that fended off virtually every effort to regulate how tech companies collect and use data. And when an Oakland real estate developer named Alastair Mactaggart decided to fund a privacy ballot initiative in California, he learned just how powerful that machine was.Mr. Mactaggart\u2019s initiative proposed giving Californians more rights over their own data, with the power to demand that big companies stop selling and trading the information they collected about browsing habits and location.\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Mr. Mactaggart would say.His opponents turned out to be not just Big Tech and cable companies, who thought his proposal went too far, but some of California\u2019s leading privacy watchdogs and consumer groups, who said his proposal didn\u2019t go far enough.But Mr. Mactaggart\u2019s ballot initiative forced historic compromise in Sacramento, driving lawmakers, activists and Silicon Valley\u2019s giants to agree to tough new rules about privacy.

{"Headline": "Google Employees Protest Secret Work on Censored Search Engine for China", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, employees wrote that the project and Google\u2019s apparent willingness to abide by China\u2019s censorship requirements \u201craise urgent moral and ethical issues.\u201d They added, \u201cCurrently we do not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about our work, our projects, and our employment.\u201dThe letter is circulating on Google\u2019s internal communication systems and is signed by about 1,400 employees, according to three people familiar with the document, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The internal activism presents another obstacle for Google\u2019s potential return to China eight years after the company publicly withdrew from the country in protest of censorship and government hacking. China has the world\u2019s largest internet audience but has frustrated American tech giants with content restrictions or outright blockages of services including Facebook and Instagram.\u201cWe urgently need more transparency, a seat at the table, and a commitment to clear and open processes: Google employees need to know what we\u2019re building,\u201d the letter said.The letter also called on Google to allow employees to participate in ethical reviews of the company\u2019s products, to appoint external representatives to ensure transparency and to publish an ethical assessment of controversial projects. The document referred to the situation as a code yellow, a process used in engineering to address critical problems that impact several teams.Google declined to comment on the letter. It has said in the past that it will not comment on Dragonfly or \u201cspeculation about future plans.\u201dLate on Thursday, employees pressed Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and other management about Dragonfly at a weekly staff meeting. As of late Wednesday, one of the top questions on an internal software system called Dory, which lets employees vote for the queries that executives should answer at the meeting, asked whether Google had lost its ethical compass, said people who had reviewed the questions. Other questions on Dory asked directly about the Dragonfly project and specific information that may be censored by the Chinese government, such as air pollution data.\u201cIf we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China,\u201d Mr. Pichai said in the staff meeting, audio of which was obtained by The Times. \u201cThat said, we are not close to launching a search product in China.\u201dMr. Pichai and Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, stopped answering questions about Dragonfly after seeing their answers posted on Twitter.This week\u2019s staff meeting was the first opportunity for Google\u2019s work force to ask executives about Dragonfly, because the meeting was not held last week. The absence of a gathering \u2014 the result of a regularly scheduled break in the summer, according to a company spokesman, Rob Shilkin \u2014 led to fears among employees that leadership was becoming less transparent following several controversies over Google\u2019s government work.Google has traditionally been more responsive to employee concerns and more transparent about future projects and inner workings than other major technology companies, inviting questions from workers at its staff meetings and encouraging internal debate.In those principles, Google publicly committed to use A.I. only in \u201csocially beneficial\u201d ways that would not cause harm and promised to develop its capabilities in accordance with human rights law. Some employees have raised concerns that helping China suppress the free flow of information would violate these new principles.In 2010, Google said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company\u2019s corporate infrastructure in an attempt to access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack, combined with government censorship, propelled Google to pull its search engine from the country.Hundreds of employees at the tech company urged their leadership to be more transparent about its ethics and its use of artificial intelligence.Google\u2019s work on Dragonfly is not a guarantee that its search engine will be welcomed back to China. The government would have to approve its return and it has kept American technology firms like Facebook at arm\u2019s length, opting instead to work closely with homegrown internet behemoths.\u201cYou can never satisfy a censor, particularly the ones in China,\u201d said Charles Mok, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council who advocates and represents the information technology sector and who is affiliated with the territory\u2019s democratic camp.Google is probably facing intense pressure to introduce more of its products in China, Mr. Mok said, but added that the company would lend legitimacy to government censorship if it debuted a censored search product in China.\u201cThen the Chinese government can say, \u2018Google is O.K. with it, too,\u2019\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Information on School Websites Is Not as Safe as You Think", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe home page of Pinellas County Schools in Florida is brimming with information for families, students, staff members and the public: an easy-to-use dashboard of news, shortcuts and links to the district\u2019s Facebook page, Twitter feed and YouTube channel.But Pinellas\u2019s home page has been supplying information to another audience, an unseen one, as well this year. An array of tracking scripts were embedded in the site, designed to install snippets of computer code into the browsers of anyone clicking on it, to report their visits or track their movements as they traveled around the web.The trackers were detected last winter during a study by Douglas Levin, a Washington-based expert on educational technology. Asked about them in April, the district expressed surprise and said it would have them removed. But Mr. Levin found 22 trackers when he checked back last month.Trackers are as common on public school websites these days as microbes on a restroom door, to judge by Mr. Levin\u2019s examination of 159 public school websites from among the nation\u2019s largest and most tech-savvy districts. At least some form of ad tracking or online surveillance technology was embedded in all but one of them, he found.Their use is an \u201cindustry-accepted practice,\u201d said Lisa Wolf, the public information officer for Pinellas County Schools, echoing comments by school officials elsewhere.Most trackers are used to help websites work better, by counting page visits or catching problems with broken links. Some are used for promotions, as in Pinellas County, where Ms. Wolf said the trackers spotted in April had been left behind after a school-choice campaign, and others were later added to boost enrollment at a technical college.But some trackers are also designed to recognize visitors by the I.P. address of their device and to embed cookies in their browsers for the advertising practice known as behavioral targeting. And knowingly or otherwise, many school sites are hosting software from third-party companies whose primary business is buying and selling data for the detailed dossiers of personal information on finances, lifestyle and buying habits that advertisers prize. Those third parties may invite still other trackers onto the site, without the school\u2019s knowledge or control.\u201cThere\u2019s a continuum of data collectors, data sharers and data users within this large ecosystem,\u201d said N. Cameron Russell, the center\u2019s executive director, describing it as a \u201chuge invisible world\u201d of shifting business entities of which the public is mostly unaware. The companies offer school districts incentives to use \u201cfreemium\u201d services, free or discounted products for which, Mr. Russell says, \u201cyou\u2019re paying with your personal information.\u201dBlueKai was among the 22 trackers Mr. Levin found on the Pinellas County, Fla., schools site. Ms. Wolf said she did not know how it got there. \u201cIt is the district\u2019s expectation that our partners do not sell or misuse web visitor information,\u201d she said.\u201cSince 2013, we\u2019ve had 125 new student privacy laws passed by 39 state legislatures and the District of Columbia,\u201d Ms. Vance said. \u201dWe have almost no funding and almost no training required by most of that legislation.\u201dGoogle and Facebook prohibit collecting or sharing information from children under 13. But Mr. Levin said the integration of free social media into many school websites had still provided a subtle entry point for commercial activity in what parents might assume was a commerce-free zone.Allison Prystupa, president of the Massapequa Council of PTAs, sees Facebook as an essential tool, along with Twitter, Instagram, email and the phone apps Group Me and Remind.Younger parents today \u201cwant that instant information, whatever way they\u2019re going to get it,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey don\u2019t think twice about who\u2019s tracking them.\u201dBut her daughter Jillian, 20, who is studying to be a history teacher at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y., said the congressional testimony of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, in April was eye-opening.\u201cI don\u2019t think we realized how much information we were giving out, or where else it could be used,\u201d Jillian Prystupa said. She accepts ad tracking as a \u201cbusiness move,\u201d she said, but the buying and selling of her information is a different story.\u201cI think that if a social media site or a website is going to do that, it has to be in bold letters up front before you sign up for it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to know that whatever you\u2019re giving them can be used by them in whatever way, and then you can make your own decisions.\u201dThis is the third of four new Learning sections being published this year.

{"Headline": "Company Is Offering \u2018Fur-ternity Leave\u2019 for New Pet Owners", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Minneapolis marketing company recently made tweaks to its employee benefits this summer, ranging from conventional to unusual. It gave workers a larger commuter stipend, as well as a reason to avoid the office altogether: \u201cfur-ternity leave,\u201d or the ability to work from home for a week to welcome new dogs or cats.\u201cThis is kind of a no-brainer,\u201d said Allison McMenimen, a vice president at the company, Nina Hale, who helped devise the new policy. \u201cThe idea of offering benefits that just help keep employees at the office, that\u2019s over.\u201dIn recent decades, many companies in the United States have overhauled their perks in an effort to retain employees and entice new recruits. Tech giants like Facebook and Google have gone further, providing gourmet meals in cafeterias, gyms at work and day cares on site.Connor McCarthy, a senior account manager at Nina Hale, was the latest employee there to seek permission to work from home with a new pet.In May, Mr. McCarthy was finalizing the adoption of a goldendoodle puppy named Bentley. Mr. McCarthy, 26, said he had read a lot about the pitfalls of helping a dog adjust to a new environment.\u201cIt can be a stressful situation going from its original home to a new home,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.Worried about Bentley, then just 2 months old, being home alone, Mr. McCarthy sent a request to his boss and Ms. McMenimen: Could he work from home the first week to help Bentley get used to his new surroundings, including a kennel, and learn to go to the bathroom outside?He received a response almost immediately. Absolutely, they said.That first week, Mr. McCarthy worked from his apartment in Richfield, a Minneapolis suburb, with Bentley by his side. Bentley also spent some hours of the day in a kennel, getting used to a closed environment. About every hour, he took a trip outside to go to the bathroom.Even with his owner watching closely, Bentley had a few accidents in the house. But Mr. McCarthy noted that Bentley \u2014 a mix between a golden retriever and a poodle, which are thought to be two of the smartest breeds \u2014 was a quick learner.\u201cIt was really, really nice to be there while I\u2019m working to transition him,\u201d said Mr. McCarthy, who was working from home on Monday, with Bentley at his feet.In a workplace of 85 employees, a handful of people at Nina Hale in recent years had requested the ability to work from home after getting a new cat or dog, Ms. McMenimen said. She said the company began considering making it a formal benefit in May, after the request from Mr. McCarthy. The policy was officially unveiled in July.\u201cFor a lot of people, their pets are their children,\u201d said Ms. McMenimen, who is also considering getting a pet. \u201cOur employees are at all different stages of their lives.\u201dNearly three months after Mr. McCarthy got his dog, Bentley is potty-trained and socializes well with others at the dog park in his apartment complex. \u201cThat first week is crucial,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India\u2019s big outsourcing companies.India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said.\u201cIt requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. Aghi said. \u201cThese companies are creating jobs.\u201dAjay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules.\u201cOur framework will be fair to all stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dozens at Facebook Unite to Challenge Its \u2018Intolerant\u2019 Liberal Culture", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The post went up quietly on Facebook\u2019s internal message board last week. Titled \u201cWe Have a Problem With Political Diversity,\u201d it quickly took off inside the social network.\u201cWe are a political monoculture that\u2019s intolerant of different views,\u201d Brian Amerige, a senior Facebook engineer, wrote in the post, which was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cWe claim to welcome all perspectives, but are quick to attack \u2014 often in mobs \u2014 anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology.\u201dSince the post went up, more than 100 Facebook employees have joined Mr. Amerige to form an online group called FB\u2019ers for Political Diversity, according to two people who viewed the group\u2019s page and who were not authorized to speak publicly. The aim of the initiative, according to Mr. Amerige\u2019s memo, is to create a space for ideological diversity within the company.The new group has upset other Facebook employees, who said its online posts were offensive to minorities. One engineer, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, said several people had lodged complaints with their managers about FB\u2019ers for Political Diversity and were told that it had not broken any company rules.Another employee said the group appeared to be constructive and inclusive of different political viewpoints. Mr. Amerige did not respond to requests for comment.The activity is a rare sign of organized dissent within Facebook over the company\u2019s largely liberal workplace culture. While the new group is just a sliver of Facebook\u2019s work force of more than 25,000, the company\u2019s workers have in the past appeared less inclined than their peers at other tech companies to challenge leadership, and most have been loyalists to its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.Within Facebook, several employees said, people have argued over the decisions to ban certain accounts while allowing others. At staff meetings, they said, some workers have repeatedly asked for more guidance on what content the company disallows, and why. Others have said Facebook, out of fear of being seen as biased, has let too many right-wing groups flourish on the site.The dispute over employees\u2019 political ideology arose a week before Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing about social media manipulation in elections. A team helping Ms. Sandberg get ready for the hearing next Wednesday has warned her that some Republican lawmakers may raise questions about Facebook and biases, according to two people involved in the preparations.Those companies \u201cbetter be careful because you can\u2019t do that to people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think that Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory and they have to be careful. It is not fair to large portions of the population.\u201dA senior Facebook engineer wrote an internal message about what he described as the company\u2019s \u201cmonoculture.\u201dFacebook has long been viewed as a predominantly liberal company. Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have donated to Democratic politicians, for example, and have supported issues such as immigration reform.Mr. Amerige, who started working at Facebook in 2012, said on his personal website that he followed philosophical principles laid out by the philosopher and writer Ayn Rand. He posted the 527-word memo about political diversity at Facebook on Aug. 20.On issues like diversity and immigration, he wrote, \u201cyou can either keep quiet or sacrifice your reputation and career.\u201dMr. Amerige proposed that Facebook employees debate their political ideas in the new group \u2014 one of tens of thousands of internal groups that cover a range of topics \u2014 adding that this debate would better equip the company to host a variety of viewpoints on its platform.\u201cWe are entrusted by a great part of the world to be impartial and transparent carriers of people\u2019s stories, ideas and commentary,\u201d Mr. Amerige wrote. \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t think we can do this.

{"Headline": "Inside Twitter\u2019s Struggle Over What Gets Banned", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With his arms folded, Jack Dorsey paced back and forth in a conference room at Twitter\u2019s headquarters on Friday afternoon.In a rare look inside one of the social media company\u2019s policy meetings, the Twitter chief executive gathered with 18 colleagues, including the safety team, to debate ways to make the social media service safer for its users. The discussion quickly turned to how to rid the site of \u201cdehumanizing\u201d speech, even if it did not violate Twitter\u2019s rules, which forbid direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but do not prohibit deception or misinformation.Twitter asked that members of its safety team not be identified, for fear of them becoming targeted by internet trolls. \u201cPlease bear with me,\u201d said one team member at the meeting. \u201cThis is incredibly complex.\u201dFor about an hour, the group tried to get a handle on what constituted dehumanizing speech. At one point, Mr. Dorsey wondered if there was a technology solution. There was no agreement on an answer.The discussion capped a difficult week for Twitter. For the past five days, the company has been embroiled in internal conversations about how to evolve and explain its policies for what can and cannot be posted on its site. The debates were urgent, fueled by criticism against Twitter for its lack of action against the posts from the far-right conspiracy site Infowars and its creator, Alex Jones.On Friday, to provide more transparency about its decision making, Twitter invited two New York Times reporters to attend the policy meeting. During the one-hour gathering, a picture emerged of a 12-year-old company still struggling to keep up with the complicated demands of being an open and neutral communications platform that brings together world leaders, celebrities, journalists, political activists and conspiracy theorists.Even settling on a definition of dehumanizing speech was not easy. By the meeting\u2019s end, Mr. Dorsey and his executives had agreed to draft a policy about dehumanizing speech and open it to the public for their comments.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Dorsey, 41, said he was \u201cO.K. with people not agreeing\u201d with his decision to keep Mr. Jones\u2019s account live.\u201cI don\u2019t see this as an end point, I see this as maintaining integrity with what we put out there and not doing random one-off interpretations,\u201d he said.But Mr. Dorsey also said that while Twitter\u2019s longtime guiding principle has been free expression, the company is now discussing \u201cthat safety should come first.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation we need to have.\u201d He said he was thinking deeply about human rights law and listening to audiobooks on speech and expression.Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow of digital policy at the Council of Foreign Relations, said Mr. Dorsey had mishandled the Infowars situation but added that dealing with matters of free speech on social media is highly complex.\u201cThere is no due process, no transparency, no case law, and no expertise on these very complicated legal and social questions behind these decisions,\u201d she said.Just a week ago, debates around dehumanizing speech were not the main topic of conversation at Twitter. At a staff meeting at the time at the company\u2019s headquarters, Twitter employees were buoyant as they watched a break dancing executive on stage, a cameo by Mr. Dorsey\u2019s mother, and attended an after-hours dance party.Then late on Sunday, Apple yanked most of the content from Mr. Jones and Infowars off its iTunes store, quickly followed by deletions at Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify. At Twitter, executives met on Monday morning to debate their own response. They ultimately decided that Mr. Jones had not committed enough infractions to result in a permanent ban from the site.Mr. Dorsey discussed that decision on Tuesday in an internal post on Periscope, the live-streaming video platform owned by Twitter, according to an employee who watched the stream and who was not authorized to speak publicly.Mr. Jones did not respond to a request for comment.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Dorsey finally posted about Twitter\u2019s decision to keep up the posts of Infowars and Mr. Jones. In his tweets, the chief executive suggested that other social media companies had caved to political pressure by removing Mr. Jones\u2019s content. He also said the task of fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019s sensational claims should fall to journalists on the platform rather than Twitter\u2019s own moderators, prompting confusion.Internally, Mr. Dorsey, aiming for transparency, encouraged employees to post publicly about their opinions regarding Mr. Jones. Several hours later, Mr. Dorsey appeared on a radio show with the conservative media personality Sean Hannity and tried to refute claims that the site is biased against conservatives.In Friday\u2019s meeting at Twitter, the 18 attendees, all standing around a wooden conference room table, debated topics including whether tweets that disparaged immigrants could be considered dehumanizing. One executive insisted that it was important for Twitter to enable debate about immigration policy.\u201cImmigration is a really valid political debate in many countries around the world and I think we want to make sure we protect the ability of people to say things like, \u2018Immigration has affected my community. My local factory employs different people now; I can\u2019t get a job.\u2019\u201d said Nick Pickles, a policy strategist.Any new rules also had to allow victims of rape to openly discuss their experience online, said Ms. Harvey. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make people feel less comfortable,\u201d she said.Mr. Dorsey stroked his beard and nodded.In the interview afterward, Mr. Dorsey said he was contemplating broader changes, including \u201csystemic\u201d solutions that aren\u2019t a \u201cone-off.\u201d But those conversations, he said, have not been \u201cexplicit.\u201d Twitter is early in the process, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk more,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Accomplished lawyers, writers and business people were chatting in small groups aboard a chartered bus, waiting to depart for the evening activity. One person thought to bring a flask and was, briefly, our hero. But then LJ arrived. She wore a glittering silver dress and a backpack from which she pulled a bag of marshmallows. As she proceeded down the aisle, she offered a marshmallow to the occupant of every seat \u2014 and these decorated adults melted into the grade-school versions of themselves, happily sinking a hand into LJ\u2019s cellophane bag. I make my living as performing musician, so I can say authoritatively that LJ works a room with professional skill. Armed with two bucks\u2019 worth of aerated sugar, she became the most admired member of the traveling party. This spring, I set out on a long headlining tour. The routing looped through London, so I dropped LJ a note. We arranged to meet in the Shoreditch neighborhood for a walk down Brick Lane.

This walk with LJ, however, would be unlike any other I\u2019d taken in London, or anywhere else for that matter. We\u2019d be doing what LJ called \u201cglitching.\u201d Using an iPad, special microphones, a digital amplifier and some music software, LJ would manipulate the sounds of Brick Lane \u2014 adding reverb, echoes, EQ filters and melodies \u2014 and then share this altered audio with me through earbuds. According to LJ, the experience can simulate synesthesia for a neurotypical person. Adding music to my world could make it more like the one she lives in. 1/4 mileSaint Leonard\u2019s ChurchOld st.ShoreditchArnold CircusNomadic Community GardenLondonA501A10B134London wallSt. Paul\u2019s CathedralWhitechapelCity oflondonTower of LondonLondon Br.ThamesBy The New York TimesWe convened in the yard of St. Leonard\u2019s Church. It was noon and it was hot; the heat wave had been making headlines. I arrived with my bandmate Matthew Santos, who\u2019d accepted my invitation to tag along before we had to report to sound check. Like me, Matthew is almost six feet tall. Like LJ, he\u2019s musically multitalented: in my band he sings, plays keyboard and guitar and often rearranges songs on the fly for acoustic performances. The grounds of St. Leonard\u2019s are lush. There\u2019s a flower garden so immodestly fragrant it seems to exceed all botanical limits, crossing from horticultural into Haribo olfactory territory. In the center of the lawn are a pair of white tombstones commemorating the civilian war dead of Shoreditch. The inscription reads, \u201cThe names of the people interred in this grave are recorded on the memorial erected in another part of this cemetery\u201d (a rather administrative tone for an engraver). LJ carried a small black bag full of electronic equipment. She also brought a pair of four-and-a-half-inch rhinestoned heels. She said they were to elevate her ears to roughly the same plane as Matthew\u2019s and mine. After strapping them on, she announced, \u201cThat\u2019s a little better acoustically.\u201d Together we set out toward Brick Lane, chatting a bit before the glitching began. LJ said she had been a \u201cweird prodigy kid.\u201d For her, perfect pitch had been a nightmare. The whole world seemed out of tune. But then teachers introduced her to Indian ragas, Gamelan music and compositions with quarter tones, unfamiliar modes and atonal structures. As her musical horizons expanded, her anxiety dissipated. (She remains exceedingly sensitive to pitch, though. Her refrigerator, for example, hums in A flat. Working from home, I hear my fridge running 12 hours a day. Blindfolded, I\u2019m not sure I could pick the thing out of a lineup of three other refrigerators.)LJ routed us through Arnold Circus, a tiny park set in a roundabout. Arnold Circus is tiered like a wedding cake (if you were inclined to make a cake out of asphalt and frost the sides with wood chips and leafy perennials) and topped with a bandstand. LJ led us to the center of the bandstand, which had green railings and a low wooden ceiling beneath a peaked roof. \u201cClap your hands,\u201d she instructed. Matthew and I complied, setting off a shimmer of quick echoes that collided with one another as they bounced off the ceiling and the floor and back and again in a strange, rubbery effect. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Matthew said. I stamped. Cool. Matthew noted there was a tremolo to the sound; something about the space made the pitch of the echoes wobble up and down as they repeated. In the acoustic funhouse of the bandstand, Matthew and I let out little vocal yelps, listening to the how the bass in his voice resonated more dramatically than mine. None of the strange reflections were audible outside the railings, so to the people sunning on the grass nearby, we were just easily delighted idiots. \u201cO. K., would you like to plug in?\u201d LJ pulled the iPad out of her bag and wrestled with a knot of wires, getting all her digital equipment in order. Her headphones were binaural, which meant they recorded in 3D, for a full surround sound. Matthew and I handed over the jacks for our earbuds. Connected, we had to stay close, effectively leashed together by the ears. LJ pressed play on a soft prerecorded musical track she\u2019d composed. I hadn\u2019t expected that; I thought we\u2019d be working only with environmental sounds. The music layered with the echoes coming from all directions made it difficult to speak at a normal rate. Deliberately, LJ said simply, \u201cSound \u2026 changes.\u201d The rolling delays felt like a cinematic representation of intoxication, I thought. Like a sober mushroom trip. The three of us stepped out of the bandstand and went glitching into the sunlight. LJ cued up another composition, specifically inspired by Brick Lane. Brick Lane is a narrow one-way lined with cafes, vintage shops, curry houses, bars and salons. Most walls are blond brick, though some have been coated with so many layers of thick, glossy paint that they shine as if perpetually wet. I imagine that a core sample taken from one of these painted walls \u2014 a little cylinder the width of mechanical pencil lead, say \u2014 could be analyzed like tree rings. There\u2019d be a complete history in the tiny stack of colored wafers: the coats of paint applied when London-born daughters took over from their immigrant fathers, when the first wave of Bangladeshi arrived, the Jews before them, the French \u2014 all the way down to the brick itself, made by masons whose factories on the lane gave it its name.The three of us walked slowly, on account of both the wires and the sensory bombardment. An old man, leaning drunkenly on a stoop, heard me mutter \u201cOh my God\u201d and mimicked me. LJ\u2019s microphones picked him up and his voice ricocheted with mine in our ears. After we\u2019d passed, I couldn\u2019t tell if he continued to parrot me or if the echoes were generated by the software. I wondered if LJ sometimes found it difficult to discern raw signal from synesthetic effects in her daily life. We left Brick Lane for a tranquil path, lawn on one side and elevated train tracks on the other. LJ stopped. She wanted to hear the train come by \u2014 one of her favorite sounds. A train and a plane passed over at the same moment, the engine noises rising like a slow ocean. It felt lucky. It was midafternoon; soon Matthew and I would have to leave for our show. The three of us disconnected and the world went regular again, though I found myself still sensitized to sound of people\u2019s footsteps. LJ took us to a place we could debrief before parting ways. We followed her beneath an overpass where every inch of concrete was covered with full-color spray-painted murals. We passed through a small gate and the Nomadic Community Gardens opened around us: a rush of art and anarchy. Tiny wooden lean-tos were arranged in ragged rows, strewn with silk flowers, strands of lights, hand-painted signs. Some held small groups of chatting drinkers. One had a wooden piano missing two black keys, like it lost them in a fistfight. One housed a healthy-looking, butterscotch-colored dog. Sun-bleached boards were lashed together to serve as planters for unruly flowers that climbed over one another, trying to escape. In one corner, a wooden boat had been converted into a jungle gym, an aluminum slide rammed through its hull. The Nomadic Community Garden closes at night, but if permanent residents were permitted, Jack Sparrow would be their mayor. LJ and I bought cups of tea from a woman running a cafe out of a three-wheeled vehicle. I told LJ truthfully that I\u2019d enjoyed glitching. But I was still keen to home in on the particulars and parameters of her synesthesia. Did she hear specific notes when she ate? I asked. \u201cSushi tastes like power chords on acoustic guitar,\u201d she answered. On my ride with Matthew back to our hotel, and in the following days, I came to believe my approach was flawed: it was impossible to isolate LJ\u2019s synesthesia from the rest of her, because none of us can be disassembled into our component parts. I can\u2019t tour London as a woman without also traveling as an American; those lenses don\u2019t come uncoupled. The question \u201cWhat would it be like not to be me?\u201d is maddening because it\u2019s answerable only in fragmentary secondhand reports. We use the best and only tools at our disposal \u2014 conversation, art and travel \u2014 but nobody can break into another mind. Still, we try and try to pick the lock. Dessa\u2019s essay collection, \u201cMy Own Devices,\u201d will be published in September. In November, she will tour Britain as a musician in support of her record \u201cChime.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hold the Phone! My Unsettling Discoveries About How Our Gestures Online Are Tracked", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI was nearing the end of a five-hour marathon of meetings about Mastercard\u2019s cybersecurity efforts when an executive made a passing comment that snapped me out of my mild stupor.A small Canadian company that Mastercard had recently acquired, called NuData, had technology that could potentially stop someone from using stolen credentials to log into a website or mobile app, he said. NuData\u2019s software measured things called \u201cbehavioral biometrics\u201d \u2014 the individual gestures we make as we interact with our computers and smartphones.NuData tracked how people typed, how they tapped on their phone screens, how fast they moved their mouses and hundreds of other physical traits. Together, those could be combined into a spookily accurate analysis of whether online users were the people they claimed to be.That sounded like something out of \u201cMinority Report\u201d or \u201cGattaca.\u201d Was this an experiment being done in a lab, I asked skeptically, or was it actually in use in the real world, by paying customers?It was real, the Mastercard executive answered, but NuData couldn\u2019t introduce me to any of its customers. They all had nondisclosure agreements, and none wanted to talk.Intrigued, I started asking bank executives and others in the security field about these kinds of biometric tools. Did they use them? Did they know anyone who did?None of the American banks I asked would tell me if they used such software, but industry analysts started pointing me toward vendors that sell it. From them, I learned about how advanced these tools had become \u2014 and how invisible they are. Customers never know when their keyboard taps and phone screen swipes are being tracked.I learned that several large banks, and some household-name online retailers, are using this kind of software. Almost none would go on the record about it. I kept asking: Why not? If this is such a great security tool, shouldn\u2019t you tout it?Of the two dozen analysts, entrepreneurs, security experts and banking executives I spoke with during my reporting, only a handful were willing to be named. Most financial companies cited internal policies of never talking publicly about specific security measures. The more information you make public about your defenses, the theory goes, the easier it is for bad actors to evade them.But a few also admitted that they didn\u2019t want their customers to be creeped out. The idea of companies watching how we type and tap is unnerving. One retailer I often shop at uses behavioral trackers, I found out. Now, when I\u2019m scrolling through shoes and tossing them into my shopping cart, I have a jarring mental image of computers silently recording my clicks, pauses, mouse swoops and typos.We\u2019re still in the early days of this kind of surveillance. Right now, it\u2019s largely the province of banks and large retailers \u2014 companies with a strong financial motive to identify and block digital thieves.The scale of the problem they face is staggering. Shuman Ghosemajumder, the chief technology officer at Shape Security, which makes fraud-blocking software, said he knew of one high-end retailer that had a 99 percent attack rate last year on its login page. Only one in 100 visitors was a legitimate shopper; the rest were criminals trying to break into those customers\u2019 accounts.Soon, though, this kind of technology could be used much more broadly.But the lack of transparency around behavioral data collection is also scary. Companies that possess very sensitive information, like our banking records or medical information, are usually heavily regulated. There are restrictions on what they can do with the data they collect.Some of the vendors that sell behavioral biometric tools have amassed profiles on tens of millions of people. I shop at merchants that use technology from Forter, which said its database has profiles on 175 million people. My own data is in there.The only limits on what such companies can do with that information are the agreements they\u2019ve struck with their customers, banks and retailers. That\u2019s not a very strong safeguard.And if a company with biometric data wanted to use the information for purposes beyond security, like searching for clues about a customer\u2019s physical health or mental sharpness, there\u2019s very little to stop it. Once again, the tech industry has given us very powerful tools \u2014 and zoomed right past any public discussion about how and when it\u2019s O.K. to use them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kisses That Paid My Rent", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern Love\u201cYou need money,\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnd I need you.\u201dTwo years out of college, I moved to Japan for a position at a small, English-language magazine near Tokyo. Never mind that the editor of the magazine said she could not pay me. She offered me a place to sleep and claimed she would set me up with students who would pay to learn English. Best of all, she said I would have tons of time to write. I bought a ticket and went.As I tugged my suitcase out of the train station, I spotted a tall Caucasian woman, white hair piled atop her head, my new boss. Waiting in a black Mercedes was an older Japanese man. We got into the car and she introduced him to me as her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d Years before, she said, they had been lovers.\u201cBefore she became fat,\u201d he said as he drove, and she hit him, hard, his body shuddering before he straightened and laughed low in his throat.I shifted uncomfortably in the back seat.He was in his 60s, she in her 50s. I would stay with her until I had saved enough money to pay for my own place. I had a return ticket and a tourist visa.That first night, I slept on the floor on a futon next to a tottering kerosene heater. I shivered all night and wanted badly to go home, but I was stubborn and had asked my parents for money too many times in my 24 years. To return early from my big adventure would be a pathetic failure.A week later, the boyfriend took me to a noodle counter for lunch. After he taught me how to slurp, we went to a real estate office. No one spoke English. Without my having said one word or looked at one apartment, I saw him hand over an envelope of cash and the agent slid over a key.He brought me to my new home: a tiny place with two rooms and a bathroom.\u201cFirst month rent is gift,\u201d he said. \u201cNext month, you pay.\u201dI was stupefied with gratitude and assured him I would have plenty of money soon. During the day, I read submissions for the magazine and managed to find a few students. I would go to their homes and they would feed me, filling my backpack with apples and pillowy mochi cakes. I spoke English but had no idea how to teach it, so we role-played. I would be the waitress, the bank teller.Back in my apartment, I would write on an old computer my boss had lent me. I had an electric heater I would drag around, keeping it so close that it almost burned my ankles. My money was dwindling fast. I had embellished every call home to make it sound as if I was doing fine. Asking my parents for money would reveal I was a liar.When it stopped being cold, the weather turned wet and my clothes and shoes grew a spindly layer of mold.It was during the rainy season that the boyfriend started coming to my door, showing up at night with a bottle of whiskey and bar snacks.I let him in.We would talk about American novels and Marilyn Monroe. He had no children but sometimes showed me photos of his dog. One evening, very late, he put a 10,000-yen note on the low table between us. \u201cYou need money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I need you.\u201dHe scooted closer. I could smell him, a mix of kerosene, damp wool and whiskey. \u201cOne kiss,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not so much for you. And money, this is not so much for me. But we need what the other has.\u201d Ten thousand yen was at that time roughly 85 dollars. My monthly rent was 24,000 yen. He had been so kind in finding this apartment, taking me to dinner, bringing me triangles of warm rice wrapped in seaweed. I thought he wanted to practice English. I thought he liked talking about books. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said. But he had seen how I hesitated, how I looked at the money, how I wanted it, and he knew that I would.I was still on that side of the sensual equation when a kiss was just a kiss. A kiss did not have to lead to anything; it was an act in itself. Kissing was separate from sex, separate from lust, similar to the way you applied lip gloss at your locker, knowing a boy would be watching. It was what girls did to flex new muscles their younger selves never knew existed. Not to say it meant nothing, but it didn\u2019t mean much. It would be a simple exchange then, 10,000 yen for a kiss. My youth for his money.We did this for a few months, often enough to pay the difference between what I had saved and what was due.I never took my clothes off, never touched him with my hands. He would come to my door and sometimes I would ignore his knocking, and other times I would drink his whiskey and let him slide his money to me. We would kiss. He would put his mouth on my mouth, just like that, no understanding of or attempt at romance, just a swoop and grab and his face would be against mine and his tongue, unschooled and thick, prodding my own.Sometimes I would feel guilty about the money. Other times I felt like I was suffocating and I couldn\u2019t bear his animal tongue and saliva, his sweat, his excitement, and I would shove him off, wipe my mouth with my fist, go into the tiny bathroom and loudly, cruelly, rinse my mouth. Sometimes when I began to pull away, he wouldn\u2019t release me, and I would feel fear.He was not much taller than me, but he was a man, and this was his country, and I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen if suddenly he were no longer satisfied with the poor offerings of my lips. But he always let go. Occasionally he begged me to have sex, claiming he would pay any price, or my rent for a year. He said he needed my energy. That I was his fountain of youth. I wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201cThen I will stop giving you money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you are poor enough, you will have sex with me.\u201dBut I had that ticket home. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this country first,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll never sleep with you.\u201dI was shy and ordinary, neither a knockout nor unattractive. I was old enough, though, to know that youth bestows its own beauty. Youth has power.My youth, my power, had never felt so real as it did those nights, his hands shaking as he reached for his wallet, as he found the correct bills and slid them to me. I would never touch the yen until he left. After I watched his Mercedes slink off into the night, I would run to pick up the money and count it, amazed such a small thing, a kiss I had given away for free for so long, could have such value. When I had enough students, I no longer needed to open my door to his late-night knock. Not long after that, I returned home to America and graduate school. For years, usually around the holidays, the boyfriend and I exchanged emails. And, until now, I never spoke a word of this to anyone.Twenty years later, I remain unsure about the right and wrong of it. The entire experience of Japan seems removed from my life, some precarious, incoherent dream. Now, when I think of those blurry nights, pride and shame are tangled in my brain. Pride in my resilience, in the way I was able to draw a line and not cross it, in the realization of a power I never knew I had. Shame at the depths I had to fall to figure out these things about myself. And relief, perhaps most of all, that I had my ticket home; I always had the luxury of escape.I still feel an uncomfortable sense of gratitude, for his having understood I was desperate and offering me such a transaction, for his teaching me that there are times when it\u2019s possible to play both predator and prey, for his decision to neither take too much from me nor give too little. For his showing me there are concessions you make that you never dreamed you would. And that, try as you might, you will never forget them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Accuses Google of Burying Conservative News in Search Results", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration.Mr. Trump added that \u201cthey are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\u201dLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201dIn a statement, Google said that its search service was \u201cnot used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d and be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201dInterfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.\u201cThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. \u201cThat being said, I think it\u2019d be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.\u201dWhat sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a \u201cneutral platform,\u201d they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people. \u201cWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word \u201cTrump\u201d were articles from \u201cleft-leaning sites.\u201dThe piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm \u2014 including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page \u2014 and that formula is constantly being updated.\u201cEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users\u2019 queries,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201dEven longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.\u201cThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.\u201dLong before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAlthough it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls \u201cmore authoritative\u201d news sources.The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jones\u2019s account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher.Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet.\u201cSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as today\u2019s town squares,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. \u201cBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.\u201dJeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: Feeling Like an Insider, Finally, in Spain", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlaces 28 and 29In the charming city of Seville and the wine region of Ribera del Duero, our columnist finds a culture perfectly suited to her natural rhythms.Traveling the world for the past seven months, I\u2019ve often been aware of my outsider status. But in Spain, where I also visited the northern wine region of Ribera del Duero, I just felt like myself. Having a facility with the language helped. But also \u201cthose weird hours,\u201d as an early-bird American friend of mine put it, where no one even starts thinking about dinner until 9 p.m., are perfectly suited to my natural rhythms. Here I could get all my work done for the day, head out when I felt like it, eat at three different tapas places and wander around packed streets late at night freed of the emotional burden of constantly being on edge about my safety that often comes with being a woman traveling alone. And yet, even with that sense of comfort, I was surprised how often Spain surprised me. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the culture of generosity in Triana. So I went back to La Vel\u00e1 for the second night in a row, this time in the company of Felix Guerra, a 58-year-old father of three I had met when he was dancing with those musicians in medieval costume; like them, he is from the small town of Cortegana.What followed was beyond anything I could have imagined. A husky-voiced diva swept onto the stage in a sheer pink caftan, to the cheers of hundreds of adoring fans. It was like seeing Stevie Nicks for the first time, but in Spanish and Technicolor. Two young dancers, a man in black and white and a woman in skintight red ruffles, punctuated her songs with dramatic flamenco. But the real excitement came when the woman dancer exited and the man, dripping in sweat, dark chest hair bursting out of the unbuttoned collar of his white shirt, stomped his feet passionately for Mar\u00eda de la Colina, a woman some 40 years his senior. \u201cIt\u2019s too much!\u201d said my friend Shayla Harris, a filmmaker who came to visit for a few days. It became our motto, repeated every time we took a turn through the tiny, colorful, twisty cobblestone streets of Seville\u2019s old town, which we couldn\u2019t stop photographing. Wrong turns usually begot more wrong turns: A gate of intricate Moorish grillwork might reveal a courtyard filled with fountains and colorful tiles and tropical plants; walking around a red and yellow building might lead to a block full of blues and greens. Getting lost was the point. I lost count of the number of tapas places I tried out over 10 days in Valladolid and Seville, but I can safely say I ate more often, and often better, in Spain than anywhere else in the world. And that\u2019s even while making up for lost time. It wasn\u2019t until my second-to-last night in Ribera del Duero that I realized I\u2019d been doing dinner all wrong.\u201cWait, but how many restaurants are you going to a night?\u201d one of them asked. One? I said with uncertainty.The confusion turned to laughter. Why limit yourself to one restaurant a night? they asked. Spaniards get a glass of wine and their favorite tapa at one place and then move on for another round.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Tangier, MoroccoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ameen is accused of traveling to the house of an Iraqi police officer in Rawah, firing at him and then firing again when the officer was on the ground, killing him.The Eastern Villa Apartments are home to around nine families from Iraq and Syria, according to a Syrian man who lives next door to Mr. Ameen and who gave his name as Abu Alla.The Arabic-speaking families mostly kept to themselves, said Deborah Talbott, 52, a caregiver who lives across the way.

{"Headline": "Customers Died. Will That Be a Wake-Up Call for China\u2019s Tech Scene?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHuang Jieli, who ran a Chinese ride-sharing business called Hitch, was invited to a wedding in March. One of her drivers was getting married to a woman who had once been his passenger. Thanks, the invitation said, for getting them hitched.Didi Chuxing, Hitch\u2019s corporate parent and one of the world\u2019s most successful and valuable start-ups, once cheered these stories of young love. Like so many other Chinese internet companies, Didi explored all kinds of ways to bring in new users, including social networking.So through suggestive ads hinting at hookups through driving, Didi pushed Hitch\u2019s romantic possibilities. In a 2015 interview with the Chinese online portal NetEase, Ms. Huang compared Hitch cars to cafes and bars.\u201cIt\u2019s a very futuristic and very sexy scenario,\u201d she told NetEase.It\u2019s a rare moment of self-reflection in China\u2019s internet industry, which has grown to rival Silicon Valley in both size and influence. Two Chinese companies, Tencent and Alibaba, rank among the top 10 publicly listed companies in the world in valuation. Four of the 10 most valuable start-ups are from China, according to CBInsights. One of them is Didi, which ranks second only to Uber.But the potential for abuse in China is severe. Corporations are subject to little scrutiny from state-controlled media until problems spin out of control. Spotty enforcement and slow lawmaking leave the public less protected from exploitation. Chinese people are fixated on their phones, spending four more hours on average a week online than Americans. The industry\u2019s extreme growth \u2014 the number of internet users has doubled, to 800 million, in eight short years \u2014 has created a culture in which companies prize money over users\u2019 well-being.Didi itself admitted this week that it had lost its way. In a statement on Tuesday, it said it would stop using scale and growth to measure its success.\u201cIn the past few years we forged ahead wildly, riding on aggressive business strategies and the power of capital,\u201d the company said in the statement from Cheng Wei, its chief executive, and Jean Liu, its president. In the face of lost lives, the statement said, \u201cthe whole company started to question whether we have the right value system.\u201d\u201cTruly disgusting, despicable marketing for Didi Hitch that\u2019s all sexual innuendo and all about \u2018picking up\u2019 girls,\u201d said Rui Ma, a technology investor who works in both Silicon Valley and China, on Twitter. She added, \u201cDidi are you running a service for sexual predators or a ride hailing app?!\u201dWhile it wasn\u2019t obvious to female passengers that their drivers might want to hook up, the drivers knew. Until Didi deactivated Hitch, the car-pooling service allowed drivers to share comments with other drivers on the looks of their passengers, leading some male drivers to seek out the ones others had declared attractive.The problem goes well beyond Didi. China has grown so fast that many facets of life \u2014 shopping, online banking, transportation \u2014 lack the sort of established incumbents common in the West. Tech companies can swoop in and become dominant in those areas. That makes Chinese companies appealing to investors. It also makes them potentially dangerous.My conversations with Chinese tech companies and their investors, including some from the United States, revolve around user growth and the amount of time they can keep users glued to apps. On occasion I asked why they lent their technology to the government for surveillance, or what they thought the social impact might be from the videos, games and endless feeds of mind-numbing information they send to the public. They either gave me blank stares or said their technologies were merely neutral tools.\u201cNo matter how we complain or criticize, bad companies, be it Didi or Baidu, simply won\u2019t change,\u201d Ye Ying, editor of The Art Newspaper China, wrote on her WeChat timeline. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped using Baidu long time ago. Should I delete the Didi app as well?\u201dEven with women in top jobs, the industry can\u2019t seem to shake the attitude. Ms. Liu is probably China\u2019s most prominent female technology executive.Hitch\u2019s suggestive strategy was overseen by Ms. Huang. In one corporate video the company compared her to Hua Mulan, the female warrior of ancient China, and promoted her as a skilled executor of the company\u2019s vision. The video\u2019s English title is \u201cLean In, Jelly,\u201d using her English name.The question now is whether Didi, and executives in the rest of the industry, can root out those attitudes to protect users.\u201cWithout the interference of a value system, the vast majority of them will choose their job performances over users\u2019 safety,\u201d wrote Feng Dahui, a former Alibaba executive and industry critic, in a WeChat post. \u201cThis is the ethical dilemma of most internet elites.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One woman liked that peach gloss Michelle Obama goes for; another thought Meghan Markle had a nice defined nude thing going.\u201cSomebody might come out with swatches,\u201d said the woman in front of me. \u201cLast year a girl came out and showed us the shades so that once you got up there, you knew.\u201d\u201cI was just trying to Google for them, actually,\u201d said a brunette in workout clothes.\u201cWell, if you want that, I get the emails,\u201d said the first woman, and a group of us quickly clustered around her phone to study a digital rendering of nine lipstick shades, all free today only, only one per person, in honor of National Lipstick Day.\u201cI want Moxie,\u201d said the woman with the phone, whose superior knowledge and experience had quickly made her our leader. \u201cBut I\u2019d settle for Dare You if they run out.\u201dA curly-haired little girl with a tiny gold purse, waiting with her mom farther up the line, dashed past us and back again.

I don\u2019t usually, but I\u2019ve been trying to wear it more often as I get older and vie for higher-paying jobs. It\u2019s a strategy, and it works. If you look at photos of successful women \u2014 whether chief executives or actresses or politicians \u2014 they\u2019re all wearing lipstick. These women appear confident, responsible and sure of everything, a surety that starts with their gender. Nothing says \u201cI\u2019m a woman\u201d like a red lip.This is what you pay $18.50 for: category affiliation. The same applies to clothes made for women and haircuts for women, which are exponentially more expensive than for men. I had a lot of time in the lipstick line to think about all this \u2014 the fact that the pink tax is unfair to women while also revealing us to be complicit weirdos.In a way, this made revolutionaries of all the women in line. Our culture demands that we look a certain way, and we had all dedicated our morning to ensuring that we could look that way without paying for it.But alas, the category of free is filled with even more land mines than the category of woman. An hour into our wait, I was fully aware that if I had worked that hour instead, I would have made enough to buy a lipstick and maybe even liner to match. I\u2019d also given away my email address and been instructed to wave my arms and cheer for a National Lipstick Day video. I turned my back to the camera and left soon after.If I\u2019ve learned anything from lipstick, it\u2019s that my face is worth at least $18.50, plus tax.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Knows Digital Ads Work. Why Don\u2019t Democrats? ", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party\u2019s campaigns are ignoring obvious opportunities to engage with voters. Mr. Collins is a board member at Tech for Campaigns.President Trump may not be up for re-election until 2020, but since May 31, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee \u2014 his re-election campaign \u2014\u00a0has spent $629,500 on advertising on Google platforms alone, making it the top spender on political ads on Google platforms. That\u2019s nearly $200,000 more than the No. 2 spender, One Nation, a right-wing organization focused on influencing Senate elections.So why are Democratic campaigns ignoring such obvious opportunities to engage with voters? I\u2019m honestly not sure; perhaps old habits are hard to break. But outdated models aren\u2019t going to win in this digital world. Unlike the Democrats, Republican candidates and right-wing organizations are prioritizing the right channels.In the average 2016 Senate general election, Republicans outspent Democrats by a three-to-one ratio on YouTube, AdWords and other Google channels. From January to June, during the primaries, this gap was even wider at 20 to one.It\u2019s even worse for down-ballot, state-level campaigns, which are under-resourced in both manpower and financial support. A typical state legislative campaign might run with an average budget of $150,000 (just 10 percent of the budget of a successful federal House race). With a smaller budget, you need to be intentional and efficient. Why spend money on TV ads, which are often aired beyond your voting district or skipped entirely with DVRs, when you could be utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook ads that can zero in on specific ZIP codes and target voters by segment or even language?Other Democrats should take a cue and double down on digital: It empowers them to reach more people with less money, engage in back-and-forth conversations with voters and test what messaging is resonating in real time. It should also prove critical in turning out a younger voting population, which often sits out midterm elections.In Silicon Valley, support for Democrats is overwhelming, so how can we be getting beaten so badly at the digital game that we largely created?Since then, the organization has grown to over 7,500 skilled volunteers, completed over 75 projects with campaigns and played a major role in the Virginia 2017 midterms \u2014 contributing to nine wins, eight of them flipping seats from red to blue. They have built an impressive infrastructure that can rapidly scale to help hundreds of campaigns this coming November and long into the future.These volunteers are defining and executing digital strategies on campaigns: running email campaigns and paid digital ad programs, creating websites, building software and tools for caucuses and campaigns that save time and serve to amplify great candidates and ideas. It might be the largest force of digital talent that Democrats have assembled anywhere, and it came together in less than one year because so many talented professionals were craving a way to make a difference.Our tech community is full of smart people who have the passion and the optimism to make a change in our electoral process. It\u2019s time for us to step up and make our own contribution to the thousands of progressive candidates who are running for change. Let\u2019s start winning the digital game that we built before it\u2019s too late.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtEver since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies to stay out of the world\u2019s largest internet market, especially when many of Google\u2019s American rivals happily operate under that government\u2019s intrusive rules. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.But wasn\u2019t standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Google\u2019s Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in \u2014 a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of life\u2019s information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.Activists for online freedoms worry that Google\u2019s return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown \u2014 the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.\u201cIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey should just say so \u2014 that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think it\u2019s fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.\u201dIn a statement, a Google spokesman said that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201d But the company\u2019s leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last week\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.Mr. Pichai underlined this argument \u2014 that providing some access to the outside world is better than none \u2014 by citing his experience growing up in India.\u201cMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,\u201d he told Google\u2019s staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it weren\u2019t for that.\u201dThere are other factors behind Google\u2019s potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the company\u2019s executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, na\u00efve and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.\u201cI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said. \u201cAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where the internet is going\u2019 and \u2018If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u2019 \u2014 well, that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201dIf Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Google\u2019s shift.\u201cIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,\u201d said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldn\u2019t be telling Chinese people, \u2018Here\u2019s what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201dSure, it\u2019s early, and Google\u2019s plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy China\u2019s censors without losing its soul.But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a survey of 271 neighbors that he organized recently, he said, 90 percent disliked the name.The Detroit neighborhood now regularly called Fishkorn (pronounced FISH-korn), but previously known as Fiskhorn (pronounced FISK-horn)? That was because of Google Maps. Midtown South Central in Manhattan? That was also given life by Google Maps.Yet how Google arrives at its names in maps is often mysterious. The company declined to detail how some place names came about, though some appear to have resulted from mistakes by researchers, rebrandings by real estate agents \u2014 or just outright fiction.Before the internet era, neighborhood names developed via word of mouth, newspaper articles and physical maps that were released periodically. But Google Maps, which debuted in 2005, is updated continuously and delivered to more than one billion people on their devices. Google also feeds map data to thousands of websites and apps, magnifying its influence.In May, more than 63 percent of people who accessed a map on a smartphone or tablet used Google Maps, versus 19.4 percent for the Chinese internet giant Alibaba\u2019s maps and 5.5 percent for Apple Maps, according to comScore, which tracks web traffic.Google said it created its maps from third-party data, public sources, satellites and, often most important, users. People can submit changes, which are reviewed by Google employees. A Google spokeswoman declined further comment.The service has also disseminated place names that are just plain puzzling. In New York, Vinegar Hill Heights, Midtown South Central (now NoMad), BoCoCa (for the area between Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens), and Rambo (Right Around the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) have appeared on and off in Google Maps.A former Detroit city planner, Arthur Mullen, said he created the 2002 map as a side project and was surprised his typos were now distributed widely. He said he used old books and his local knowledge to make the map, approximating boundaries at times and inserting names with tenuous connections to neighborhoods, hoping to draw feedback.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be making a mistake and 20 years later people are having to live with it,\u201d Mr. Mullen said.\u201cIt rolls off the tongue,\u201d he said.In San Francisco, the East Cut name originated from a neighborhood nonprofit group that residents voted to create in 2015 to clean and secure the area. The nonprofit paid $68,000 to a \u201cbrand experience design company\u201d to rebrand the district.Andrew Robinson, executive director of the nonprofit, now called the East Cut Community Benefit District (and previously the Greater Rincon Hill Community Benefit District), said the group\u2019s board rejected names like Grand Narrows and Central Hub. Instead they chose the East Cut, partly because it referenced an 1869 construction project to cut through nearby Rincon Hill. The nonprofit then paid for streetlight banners and outfitted street cleaners with East Cut apparel.But it wasn\u2019t until Google Maps adopted the name this spring that it got attention \u2014 and mockery.\u201cThe East Cut sounds like a 17 dollar sandwich,\u201d Menotti Minutillo, an Uber engineer who works on the neighborhood\u2019s border, said on Twitter in May.Mr. Robinson said his team asked Google to add the East Cut to its maps. A Google spokeswoman said employees manually inserted the name after verifying it through public sources. The company\u2019s San Francisco offices are in the neighborhood (as is The New York Times bureau), and one of the East Cut nonprofit\u2019s board members is a Google employee.\u201cDon\u2019t believe us?\u201d its website asks. \u201cWell, we\u2019re on the internet; so we must be real.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They\u2019re making a zombie movie.\u201dYour head spins, you have so many questions:Will the cemetery be closed all four weeks? What happens if somebody, for instance my mother, dies during that time, do we do the simple graveside service Ma wanted while the zombies stand a short distance away, respectfully holding their intestines? Why is it always Friday night, when you\u2019re not going to be able to get through to anybody from the synagogue, that you hear about the zombie movie? \u201cAre they shooting in the Jewish section?\u201d I ask Steven, because in Fleischmanns, the old resort town where I grew up and my family is buried, the Jewish cemetery and the town cemetery are side by side.\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Steven says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big movie.

My mother had been very sick recently; the kind of sick where the hospice people ask if you\u2019ve got an undertaker and you make the calls to the family. Since that time, however, Ma has staged such a remarkable recovery that I expect to arrive at her nursing home in Westchester and find a dozen disciples gathered around. \u201cLook at her! It\u2019s a miracle! A week ago, she can\u2019t breathe and they\u2019re giving her the morphine and now she\u2019s back at Trivia! And can you believe it? She knows the answer to everything!\u201d On the other hand, my mother is 91, with dementia, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. She could go at any minute. I figure I will drive over to the Jewish cemetery in Fleischmanns and see what\u2019s going on.It\u2019s a small, pretty, hillside, cemetery. All my family is there: My father, Bernie; my uncles Artie and Hymie and Hymie\u2019s wife, Shirley; my grandmother Gussie and my grandfather, Jake Wadler, for whom I am named. Jake was originally buried in a big cemetery in Queens; then the family moved him to the mountains to be next to his wife. That move was made 70 years after Jake died, those Queens grave sites were very close to one another, so I suspect my grandmother is buried next to mostly Jake, with a vertebra from a stranger with a name like Saul or Irving.The dead live on in your memory, end of the story.So, I am stunned, walking past my aunt\u2019s grave, to hear her voice.\u201cYou missed the excitement,\u201d Shirley says. \u201cThey were making a movie right here in the cemetery.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re speaking from an afterlife?\u201d I say. \u201cHow are you able to do that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery which transcends human understanding,\u201d Shirley says. \u201cLike why the Greek coffee shops keep making those 12\u201d high lemon meringue pies when nobody has ever ordered them. But we don\u2019t get a lot of time. What do you want to know?\u201d\u201cThe zombie movie,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you have any idea how long it\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cNo idea,\u201d my aunt says. \u201cThey shoot something once, they shoot it again, it looks exactly the same and it goes on like that all day. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re singing or dancing, they\u2019re, what would you call it, lurching. They\u2019re big lurchers. If you\u2019re worried about your mother it\u2019s not a problem. They made an agreement with the synagogue. If somebody dies, the film company has to be out in 24 hours.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Ludicrous Attack on Big Tech ", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe idea that Google and Twitter are rigging their platforms against him is patently false.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Case in point are some tweets this week from President Trump, who wrote his umpteenth in a series of attacks on the big tech platforms.The latest sputter \u2014 that\u2019s a digital equivalent that falls between clearing your throat of mucus and vomiting slightly in your mouth \u2014 was aimed at Google. In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him:\u201cGoogle search results for \u2018Trump News\u2019 shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on \u2018Trump News\u2019 are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation \u2014 will be addressed!\u201dWill. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night.But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can\u2019t get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don\u2019t cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can\u2019t stand the endless bullying, but let\u2019s stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.So whether it\u2019s the idea that Twitter \u201cshadow bans\u201d right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it\u2019s all codswallop.You can look that fine word up on Google if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And Google is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold \u2014 and in some cases, dangerous \u2014 ways.It is certainly true that some of tech\u2019s egregious sins \u2014 like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, Google and Twitter leaders are expected to appear \u2014 need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It\u2019s hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.Last week, for example, he tweeted: \u201cSocial Media Giants are silencing millions of people \u2026 People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!\u201dBut it\u2019s been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn\u2019t-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it\u2019s probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.It\u2019s certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It\u2019s pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)What\u2019s most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an \u201cinnoventor\u201d of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) \u2014 is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: \u201cFor one set, we can\u2019t take enough down; for another set, we can\u2019t leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.\u201dWhich makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.\u201cThey want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u201dNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not.

Opinion Columnist\u201cAirbnb, without fundamental human goodness, would not work,\u201d Chesky said. A decade later, Airbnb is in more than 190 countries. It has had more than 300 million guest arrivals. It is valued in the tens of billions of dollars.From all the data the company has accumulated, no major country anomalies, in terms of patterns of behavior, have emerged. People from Japan, Brazil, Nigeria, Russia, the United States, Mexico and France are equally respectful and honest. There are no national outliers, Chesky said, on the goodness or trustworthiness scale. There are no enemies.That is interesting. I wonder if we are looking in the wrong places to assess the state of the world. The twilight of an era, as in Vienna a little over a century ago, is always murky. With nationalism and xenophobia resurgent, examples of humanity\u2019s basest instincts abound. They grab the headlines. At the same time, community and sharing, often across national borders, through digital platforms like Airbnb, BlaBlaCar and Facebook, expand. This is the world\u2019s undercurrent. It shifts the perceptions of billions.The nation state is trumpeted. The nation state is redundant. Perhaps the trumpeting is linked to the redundancy. The natural state of politics becomes theater. Its most compelling actors, however buffoonish, prosper. They strut the stage mouthing fantasies. They babble and veer. \u201cThese platforms are an integral part of the geopolitical landscape, because in some ways and for a different set of reasons their power is approaching the power historically held by nation states,\u201d Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of \u201cThe Sharing Economy,\u201d said. \u201cWe look to Facebook for identity.\u201d He continued: \u201cMore and more people actually have a sense of understanding of others\u2019 cultures and the feeling someone I don\u2019t know can be trusted.\u201dPerhaps Airbnb is the new NATO. I started thinking about this in Hungary earlier this year. Viktor Orban, the prime minister, promotes an illiberal model based on xenophobic nationalism. He is prospering. Yet just about every Hungarian I met was renting out apartments or rooms to strangers through Airbnb or other platforms. A woman I got to know had just rented her place to a Kazakh. Connected to each other, individuals organize the self-defense that is cross-border community. It is closed systems that kill.Of course, we have learned that the internet can be just as good at building silos and reinforcing the algorithmic separation of people as at bringing them together. We have learned that, contrary to idealistic pronouncements, Facebook or Google may be more driven by the temptation of maximizing advertising revenue through leading you to content you have responded well to in the past than by any mind-broadening mission. We know how echo chamber effects get amplified, and how those echo chambers may be opaque, easily infiltrated by Russian trolls. The utopian view of the Internet has collapsed.The gale of nationalism is gusting against bread broken together, the arc of history bending toward justice, and all that. Is it a market correction or a long-term trend? I\u2019m not sure \u2014 but we urgently need to broaden our analysis. Of one thing I am sure: As Peter Drucker, the management consultant and author, put it, \u201cThe greatest danger in turbulent times is not the turbulence, but to act with yesterday\u2019s logic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shares of Whirlpool, Alcoa and General Motors tumbled after the companies warned of the financial hit from the higher costs related in part to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.So far, the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have had little impact on Sonos, the company said. But as trade tensions ramp up, Sonos looks particularly vulnerable.In its filing with the S.E.C. ahead of its I.P.O., Sonos warned that tariffs were a potential risk to anyone buying its shares:If the tariff list remains unaltered, all of our inbound products to the United States would be subject to a 10 percent tariff assessed on the cost of goods as imported. If these duties are imposed on our products, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations.Of course, the trade worries only add to the list of more traditional investor concerns. The company, which started life as a multiroom speaker maker, has more recently ridden the wave of smart speakers. That has put the company in the position of both teaming up and competing with heavyweights like Amazon, Google and Apple.Sonos\u2019s growth is slower than some recent I.P.O.s as well. The company\u2019s revenue rose just 10 percent in its last fiscal year. For comparison, Spotify grew 37 percent and Dropbox 31 percent in the year before they went public.And a red flag for those looking to buy into the I.P.O.: Sonos\u2019s existing shareholders accounted for 8.3 million of the shares sold in the offering.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s the Conversation We Really Need to Have About Bias at Google", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut that concludes the \u201cdefense of Google\u201d portion of this column. Because whether he knew it or not, Mr. Trump\u2019s false charges crashed into a longstanding set of worries about Google, its biases and its power. When you get beyond the president\u2019s claims, you come upon a set of uncomfortable facts \u2014 uncomfortable for Google and for society, because they highlight how in thrall we are to this single company, and how few checks we have against the many unseen ways it is influencing global discourse.Dr. Noble argues that many people have the wrong idea about Google. We think of the search engine as a neutral oracle, as if the company somehow marshals computers and math to objectively sift truth from trash.But Google is made by humans who have preferences, opinions and blind spots and who work within a corporate structure that has clear financial and political goals. What\u2019s more, because Google\u2019s systems are increasingly created by artificial intelligence tools that learn from real-world data, there\u2019s a growing possibility that it will amplify the many biases found in society, even unbeknown to its creators.Google says it is aware of the potential for certain kinds of bias in its search results, and that it has instituted efforts to prevent them. \u201cWhat you have from us is an absolute commitment that we want to continually improve results and continually address these problems in an effective, scalable way,\u201d said Pandu Nayak, who heads Google\u2019s search ranking team. \u201cWe have not sat around ignoring these problems.\u201dFor years, Dr. Noble and others who have researched hidden biases \u2014 as well as the many corporate critics of Google\u2019s power, like the frequent antagonist Yelp \u2014 have tried to start a public discussion about how the search company influences speech and commerce online.There\u2019s a worry now that Mr. Trump\u2019s incorrect charges could undermine such work. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s complaint undid a lot of good and sophisticated thought that was starting to work its way into public consciousness about these issues,\u201d said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who has studied Google and Facebook\u2019s influence on society.Dr. Noble suggested a more constructive conversation was the one \u201cabout one monopolistic platform controlling the information landscape.\u201dSo, let\u2019s have it.In the United States, about eight out of 10 web searches are conducted through Google; across Europe, South America and India, Google\u2019s share is even higher. Google also owns other major communications platforms, among them YouTube and Gmail, and it makes the Android operating system and its app store. It is the world\u2019s dominant internet advertising company, and through that business, it also shapes the market for digital news.Google\u2019s power alone is not damning. The important question is how it manages that power, and what checks we have on it. That\u2019s where critics say it falls down.Google\u2019s influence on public discourse happens primarily through algorithms, chief among them the system that determines which results you see in its search engine. These algorithms are secret, which Google says is necessary because search is its golden goose (it does not want Microsoft\u2019s Bing to know what makes Google so great) and because explaining the precise ways the algorithms work would leave them open to being manipulated.But this initial secrecy creates a troubling opacity. Because search engines take into account the time, place and some personalized factors when you search, the results you get today will not necessarily match the results I get tomorrow. This makes it difficult for outsiders to investigate bias across Google\u2019s results.A lot of people made fun this week of the paucity of evidence that Mr. Trump put forward to support his claim. But researchers point out that if Google somehow went rogue and decided to throw an election to a favored candidate, it would only have to alter a small fraction of search results to do so. If the public did spot evidence of such an event, it would look thin and inconclusive, too.\u201cWe really have to have a much more sophisticated sense of how to investigate and identify these claims,\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s law school who has studied the role that algorithms play in society.Google has no similar program, but Dr. Nayak said the company often shares data with outside researchers. He also argued that Google\u2019s results are less \u201cpersonalized\u201d than people think, suggesting that search biases, when they come up, will be easy to spot.\u201cAll our work is out there in the open \u2014 anyone can evaluate it, including our critics,\u201d he said.The kind of blanket, intentional bias Mr. Trump is claiming would necessarily involve many workers at Google. And Google is leaky; on hot-button issues \u2014 debates over diversity or whether to work with the military \u2014 politically minded employees have provided important information to the media. If there was even a rumor that Google\u2019s search team was skewing search for political ends, we would likely see some evidence of such a conspiracy in the media.That\u2019s why, in the view of researchers who study the issue of algorithmic bias, the more pressing concern is not about Google\u2019s deliberate bias against one or another major political party, but about the potential for bias against those who do not already hold power in society. These people \u2014 women, minorities and others who lack economic, social and political clout \u2014 fall into the blind spots of companies run by wealthy men in California.Eventually, this error was fixed. But how many other such errors are hidden in Google? We have no idea.Google says it understands these worries, and often addresses them. In 2016, some people noticed that it listed a Holocaust-denial site as a top result for the search \u201cDid the Holocaust happen?\u201d That started a large effort at the company to address hate speech and misinformation online. The effort, Dr. Nayak said, shows that \u201cwhen we see real-world biases making results worse than they should be, we try to get to the heart of the problem.\u201dYet it is not just these unintended biases that we should be worried about. Researchers point to other issues: Google\u2019s algorithms favor recency and activity, which is why they are so often vulnerable to being manipulated in favor of misinformation and rumor in the aftermath of major news events. (Google says it is working on addressing misinformation.)Some of Google\u2019s rivals charge that the company favors its own properties in its search results over those of third-party sites \u2014 for instance, how it highlights Google\u2019s local reviews instead of Yelp\u2019s in response to local search queries.The danger for Google is that Mr. Trump\u2019s charges, however misinformed, create an opening to discuss these legitimate issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alex Jones and Infowars Content Is Removed From Apple, Facebook and YouTube", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTop technology companies erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones, the internet\u2019s notorious conspiracy theorist, thrusting themselves into a fraught debate over their role in regulating what can be said online.Apple, Google, Facebook and Spotify severely restricted the reach of Mr. Jones and Infowars, his right-wing site that has been a leading peddler of false information online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have used social media for years to spread dark and bizarre theories, such as that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Apple made its move on Sunday and the others followed on Monday.The actions, one of the tech companies\u2019 most aggressive efforts against misinformation, highlighted a difficult dilemma for their businesses. They have long desired to combat misinformation online, but they have also been reluctant to be arbiters of truth.But since a rise of misinformation online around elections, such as the 2016 presidential vote, the tech companies have faced increasing calls from lawmakers and the news media to address their role in that spread of false information and a related increase in partisan divisions. The tech companies have recently stepped up enforcement \u2014 but that has led to accusations of political bias, largely from conservatives.Apple on Sunday removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app. Commenting on the move, a spokeswoman said, \u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech.\u201dFacebook, Spotify and Google\u2019s YouTube site, which removed some Infowars content last week, followed with stronger measures on Monday. Facebook removed four pages belonging to Mr. Jones, including one with nearly 1.7 million followers as of last month, for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d Facebook said the violations did not relate to \u201cfalse news.\u201dYouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which had more than 2.4 million subscribers and billions of views on its videos, for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.Mr. Jones and Infowars are leaders in using the internet to spread right-wing conspiracy theories, an effort that was aided after Donald J. Trump appeared on Mr. Jones\u2019s show during the 2016 presidential campaign and praised Mr. Jones\u2019s reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Mr. Jones has repeatedly claimed that the government staged the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and numerous other mass shootings and tragedies.\u201cTo many, Jones is a bad joke,\u201d said the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut the sad reality is that he has millions of followers who listen to his radio show, watch his \u2018documentaries\u2019 and read his websites, and some of them, like Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, resort to deadly violence.\u201dMr. Jones and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.The big tech firms that control, via their websites and apps, how much of the world\u2019s media content is distributed have faced criticism in recent weeks for enabling Mr. Jones and Infowars.A Google spokesman said on Monday that YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel outright because he continued to flout policies he had already been penalized for violating.Mr. Jones and Infowars still have other ways to reach listeners and readers. They have increasingly been directing viewers to visit the Infowars website, which would limit their reliance on the tech companies, presumably foreseeing the bans. Twitter has not restricted the accounts of Mr. Jones or Infowars. A Twitter spokesman said the accounts were not in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules.Other tech companies\u2019 approach has been uneven; they have left up Infowars content on some of their services despite removing it from others.Infowars introduced a new smartphone app last month that is finding users on Apple\u2019s App store and Google\u2019s Play Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 23rd most popular news app on the Google Play store and the 33rd most popular news app on Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Monday, the Infowars app ranked ahead of apps like BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal on Google, and ahead of apps like MSNBC and Bloomberg on Apple.Apple decided to allow the Infowars app on its store after reviewing it, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Google Play Store has different policies than YouTube, a Google spokesman said.\u201cThe timing is very puzzling because he\u2019s been saying this stuff for years and they haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said.Conservatives warned that more sites would be cut off soon.Advertisement"}

But what if you don\u2019t like instant fixes? Here\u2019s where you take control. Once you tap the Adjustments icon, you will see three main categories: Light, Color and B&W.Touch a category heading to see all the elements of the image you can edit independently. Tap the name of a control for an onscreen slider to make your modifications. In the Light category you can change the photo\u2019s Brilliance, a setting that can make the picture look more vibrant without intensifying the color saturation. You can also adjust the picture\u2019s overall Exposure. And you can fiddle with the amount of detail visible in both the Highlights (bright areas) and the Shadows (dark parts) of the image, as well as the Contrast, which is the scale difference between the photo\u2019s light and dark tones. Finally, you can move the Black Point, which makes the contrast better in washed-out images by defining the point where the darkest part of the photo becomes totally black. The Color category has preview sliders for adjusting the overall saturation, or intensity, of the color in the photo. You can also change the contrast between similar colors in the scene to make them \u201cpop\u201d more. Many photos improve instantly if you cut out distracting elements and tighten the framing. Tap the Crop tool icon and drag the corners of the white box around the part of the picture you want to keep. Want the traditional Instagram square crop? Choose an aspect ratio by tapping the icon that looks like a stack of squares in the bottom-right corner. The Photos app may automatically straighten the image so horizontal and vertical elements in the scene are roughly parallel to the edges of the picture.

The hackers set up a fake page that mimicked the party\u2019s login page for its voter-registration website, a tactic that could gather names, passwords and other credentials of those using the voter database. The hackers also may have sent emails to people within the national committee to try to trick them into using the fake page, a tactic known as \u201cspearphishing,\u201d the officials said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, one of the officials said.\u201cThis attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections, and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks,\u201d said Bob Lord, chief security officer for the Democratic National Committee.

Bolton, the national security adviser, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the November elections.\u201cI can say definitively that it\u2019s a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we\u2019re taking steps to try and prevent it,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in an interview with ABC.Many of the hacking attempts are mimicking the techniques that were used to penetrate the Democratic National Committee in 2016. At the time, Russian state-backed hackers used trick emails to take senior party officials, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, to a page that looked identical to a password screen for Google\u2019s email service, Gmail. In fact, the page gave attackers access to the officials\u2019 accounts.Many of the warnings the national committee received several years ago about potential attacks either were ignored or did not reach the right individuals.Since then, the committee has taken steps to improve its cybersecurity. This year, it hired Mr. Lord, who previously held top technology roles at Yahoo and Twitter, and Raffi Krikorian, a former Uber executive, as its chief technology officer.The party\u2019s team has put new security practices into place and begun testing employees in spearphishing drills to see if they will click on the malicious emails. The national committee has also improved its cooperation with the F.B.I., according to law enforcement officials.The Votebuilder database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and files. A successful penetration of the database could have set off other hacks in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.Lookout first detected the fake website late Monday, using a newly built artificial intelligence system that spots fake sites as they are created, said Mike Murray, the company\u2019s vice president of security intelligence.\u201cWe realized the significance,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin hours, we started waking up people to get them on the phone.\u201dBecause the website was caught so quickly, it is impossible to know who the hackers were or how they planned to use the site, Mr. Murray said. Such attacks are easy, he said, because anyone with decent programming skills can make a fake website in a few hours.\u201cThe adversaries are becoming more sophisticated in how they use these websites, but the attack is the same,\u201d he said.Mr. Lord said the White House also needed to get involved to improve cyberdefenses.\u201cThese threats are serious, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that we all work together, but we can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the administration to take more aggressive steps to protect our voting systems.\u201dThe attempted hack was revealed as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cybersecurity division hailed its efforts to protect the nation\u2019s election systems from foreign intrusions.During a tour of the agency\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center near Washington on Wednesday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Christopher C. Krebs, her top deputy for cybersecurity, said the department was more prepared than it had been during the 2016 elections.\u201cWe are better positioned than at any time in history,\u201d Ms. Nielsen said, standing before a bank of computers and giant monitors showing real-time threats to the nation\u2019s cyber and physical infrastructure.An earlier version of this article misstated what cybersecurity officials said about hackers\u2019 efforts to gain access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s voter database. The officials said the hackers may have sent so-called spearphishing emails to D.N.C. officials, not that they did send such emails.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Jonathan Martin from Washington.

{"Headline": "\u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 Is the Movie Everyone\u2019s Talking About. Here\u2019s What to Read About It.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpike Lee lobbed a lit stick of dynamite into multiplexes nationwide over the weekend with the release of his latest feature \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d His serio-comic retelling of Ron Stallworth\u2019s extraordinary story \u2014 in 1972, Colorado Springs\u2019s first black cop and his Jewish partner succeeded in infiltrating the local Ku Klux Klan chapter \u2014 pushed a lot of present-day hot buttons. Critics grappled with complicated commentary on such charged topics as racism, code-switching, the politics of policework and radical activism.For such an avowedly political filmmaker as Lee, success necessarily means ruffling some public feathers. The lively conversation surrounding his latest provocation yielded some fine writing, from reviews to in-depth reportage to essays focusing on specific angles in a film that invites dozens of interpretations.In his review, A.O. Scott declares the film to be Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cbest nondocumentary feature in more than a decade and one of his greatest,\u201d adding: \u201c\u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It\u2019s an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions.\u201d He reserved special praise for Lee\u2019s direction, writing, \u201cIs it better to work inside the system, to push against it from the outside or to smash it to pieces? This is an old, unresolvable debate, a tension that has partly defined Mr. Lee\u2019s own career. His fearless embrace of contradiction gives \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 its velocity and heft.\u201dThe staff critic Richard Brody commended Lee\u2019s marriage of engaging pop aesthetics with vital, partisan calls to action. He writes: \u201c\u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 is an action film, of sorts, yet Lee makes nearly half its action intellectual action, the dramatization of the political ideas and cultural context on which the plotting depends. By doing so, Lee has made a movie of bold and brilliant paradox. \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 is one of his most politically passionate films, a vision of social pathology and moral devastation that is also, often, bouncy, riffy, and Top 40 catchy; for all its revelations of racist rot at the core of American society, Lee also offers a clear, specific, and wondrous, if wary, view of change that\u2019s possible because, at one time and to some extent, it actually happened.\u201dDavid Sims agrees with Lee\u2019s forceful, double-underscored approach to conveying his ideology. \u201cThis is a film loaded with broad comedy, bold speechifying, blunt depictions of racism, and astonishing visual flair,\u201d he writes, \u201cit is a Spike Lee movie, made with the kind of artistic and political verve that recalls his best work. \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 has all the subtlety of a mallet to the face, but Lee\u2019s argument begins and ends with the fact that this is an unsubtle moment in America.\u201dRichard Lawson saw the film as Lee\u2019s attack on the contentment that slows the march of progress. \u201cGradually, Lee also reveals the sad joke of the movie \u2014 and the truth of it, too,\u201d Lawson writes. \u201cHow eager so many of us are to be served narratives like this, in which insidiousness isn\u2019t so pervasive after all, in which the racists and other bigots are discrete, easily identified, and isolated. According to a flat reading of \u2018BlacKkKlansman,\u2019 the K.K.K. is a thing of the past, and whatever this new stuff is \u2014 the far right or whatever you want to call it \u2014 will soon be, too. Which, I think, is Lee\u2019s point.\u201d He continues: \u201c\u2018BlacKkKlansman\u201ds joke is an indictment of complacency, particularly that of white liberals who\u2019d rather not confront the distressing fact that not much has changed in 40 years, beyond a restyling of old, old ideology.\u201dAlissa Wilkinson offers a cooler take on the film with her review. Drawing on her experiences at the Cannes Film Festival premiere, she objects to an approach that she feels bludgeons the audience with its message. She argues: \u201cIf \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u201ds historical memory of American racism is right on the money \u2014 it\u2019s even based on a true story! \u2014 its way of drawing out those parallels is far less on target. \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019 isn\u2019t wrong about the evils of white supremacy. But it\u2019s pretty sure you, out in the audience, aren\u2019t going to get it unless it spells out the message in blinking neon lights.\u201d She adds: \u201cIf the movie aims to make complacent white people feel uncomfortable about their role in the current American turmoil, it fails spectacularly.\u201dThe reporter Salamishah Tillet talked to Spike Lee, John David Washington, Topher Grace and the film\u2019s producer Jordan Peele, who was originally going to direct, and others about the film\u2019s production. \u201cI knew if I couldn\u2019t direct this, I couldn\u2019t think of anybody better than Spike for this project,\u201d Peele said. \u201cIt just falls right into his unique tone, which is always different. Sometimes comedic, sometimes harrowing, usually socially relevant and political.\u201dSpike Lee, along with his star John David Washington and the co-writer Kevin Willmott, chatted with Kyle Buchanan about their expectations for the film\u2019s public premiere. Lee\u2019s no stranger to controversial receptions: \u201cI\u2019ve been through this,\u201d the director says. \u201c\u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 premiered right here, and people said, \u2018This film is gonna cause riots all over America.\u2019 Go Google the articles by David Denby, Jack Kroll \u2026 they said blood was gonna be on my hands. People were urging Tom Pollock, who was then the president of Universal Pictures, not to open the film. And if he was still gonna open it, don\u2019t put it in the summer, because you know how they do in the summertime.\u201dK. Austin Collins spoke with Grace about the challenges of his role as congenial bigot David Duke. Collins writes: \u201cThe hardest part, perhaps, was actually saying Duke\u2019s racist rhetoric aloud. \u2018It\u2019s a scary thing as a performer, especially if you are really, really liberal or have very different values, as I do, than that character,\u2019 [Grace] said. At first, Grace practiced alone in his office. \u2018I was swallowing the words. I thought, Well, I got to get comfortable with it. The character is obviously very comfortable with it.\u2019 Before meeting up with Lee, he rehearsed a speech to the tune of, \u2018I\u2019m really uncomfortable saying this dialogue.\u2019 But Lee, he said, was sympathetic to his plight. \u2018There\u2019s a terrible scene we are about to do,\u2019 he remembered the director saying, \u2018but it\u2019s in service of a message I\u2019m trying to say, and this thing really happened.\u2019\u201dCaleb Gayle places \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in the context of a longer tradition of black culture, starting with the scourge of segregation and working his way to the present. He writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why whites and blacks alike can herald Jackie Robinson as a civil rights hero yet can be so split on Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to kneel during the national anthem. And there\u2019s a reason why we conveniently forget that even Jackie Robinson had his moments of what some might consider radical: \u201cI cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in a white world.\u201d Through the rose-colored lens of respectability politics, we often choose to craft historical narratives in a way that removes any offense from our mainstream sensibilities. So in our textbooks, we sterilize King and Robinson\u2019s doses of radicalism to ensure that mainstream America doesn\u2019t feel guilt for the egregious actions of its past. This neutered view of race, informed by bad recollections of history, forced Ron and continues to force many people of color to fit into boxes of docile activism.\u201dAbraham Riesman focuses on Stallworth\u2019s partner Flip, portrayed by Adam Driver, in an analysis of the film\u2019s engagement with Jewish identity. He writes: \u201cTherein lies the terror of Flip\u2019s journey. If you\u2019re a white Jew, it\u2019s possible you\u2019re able to see yourself doing what he does. It\u2019s a version of the game young Jews often play when they first learn about the Holocaust: What would you do if the Nazis returned? (It\u2019s no longer as much of a hypothetical question as it was when I was a kid, but we\u2019re not quite there yet, Baruch Hashem.)\u201dThe reporter DeNeen L. Brown interviewed the real-life Stallworth to get all the details on how he pulled off his daring mission behind enemy lines: \u201cThat [Klan] threat was very real in Colorado in 1978, when Stallworth began his investigation, which would prevent three cross burnings, reveal Klan members in the military and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and thwart a plan by Klan members to bomb two gay bars in Denver.\u201d Stallworth also weighs in on how he received this dramatization of events he personally lived out: \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve seen the movie twice,\u2019 said Stallworth, now 65 and living in El Paso. \u2018It is a very powerful movie. Obviously, Spike wove the story around my story. He did a good job putting the story together and connecting the historical thread from the Confederacy to Charlottesville, David Duke and Donald Trump.\u2019 The movie, Stallworth said, is timely and symbolic: \u2018People need to realize this is a threat to the very fabric of American society.\u2019\u201dIn Lee\u2019s film, Harry Belafonte portrays an older activist who relates the account of a brutal murder to a rapt audience of his younger compatriots. Matthew Dessem reproduced the harrowing report from the scene written by civil rights icon W.E.B. Dubois. \u201cGreat masses of humanity flew as swiftly as possible through the streets of the city in order to be present at the bridge when the hanging took place,\u201d Dubois writes, \u201cbut when it was learned that the Negro was being taken to the City Hall lawn, crowds of men, women and children turned and hastened to the lawn. On the way to the scene of burning, people on every hand took a hand in showing their feelings in the matter by striking the Negro with anything obtainable, some struck him with shovels, bricks, and clubs, and others stabbed him and cut him until when he was strung up his body was a solid color of red, the blood of many wounds inflicted covered him from head to foot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This conversation, Maureen said, occurred on his private plane filled with junk food.And he hasn\u2019t changed much in the White House. He even calls it \u201cthe set,\u201d she said, as if it\u2019s just for him and just for television.\u201cHe\u2019s thinking of this as a reality show and he will get those ratings,\u201d Maureen said. \u201cHe\u2019s an attention addict.\u201d\u2018We\u2019re the Selfie Stick\u2019What about the role of the media covering President Trump?When asked about this last night, she acknowledged that the media and the president are caught in an intense symbiotic relationship. The most intense relationship in Washington, Maureen said, is not between the president and his wife but the president and the press.\u201cHe\u2019s the selfie president, we\u2019re the selfie stick,\u201d she said.Still, she added, The New York Times and the family that owns it (the Sulzbergers) have made clear that they are not part of \u201cthe resistance\u201d to President Trump.Even when pushed \u2014 at an Oscars party, for example, where various Hollywood stars warmly greeted our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, and pushed him to echo their own frustrations, Maureen said, he resisted and refused to be pushed into that role.\u2018The Hall Monitors\u2019Maureen is no less scathing with the Democrats as she is with Republicans. When she comes at you, \u201cit\u2019s not your fault, it\u2019s just your turn,\u201d is how our publisher puts it.Last night proved the point. After lambasting President Trump, she said she also blamed the Democrats \u2014 the party that used to be so connected to her own roots, as a daughter of working-class Irish Americans \u2014 for losing touch and becoming the party of scolds.\u201cThey give off this hall monitor supercilious air \u2014 and this entitled air,\u201d she said.Even President Obama, she said, sometimes failed to grasp the need to woo voters rather than hector them.\u201cPeople voted for Barack to bring us into modernity,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he could have explained it more and brought people along more.\u201dWhen dealing with Congress too, she added, he often showed that \u201che\u2019d rather be right than win.\u201dNow, she added, with President Trump dismantling his legacy, \u201che\u2019s learned you have to win first before you\u2019re right.\u201dOn that note, let\u2019s get to the news of the week, from all over the world (Canberra included).______It\u2019s a chilling example of the way algorithms impact human behavior.____________More than that, it\u2019s also about art and when to ignore crowds who think they have you pegged.______The key detail: punch that beast in the eye or the gills.______FeaturesOh, Canberra!For Fun______Two books that came up in conversations with Maureen Dowd round out my newsletter this week:Amy covered Hillary Clinton for years at The Times and Maureen told several people who asked about her own critical Clinton coverage to give this book a read so they could better understand the Clinton campaign\u2019s many flaws.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Trolls Have Won. Sorry, There\u2019s Not Much You Can Do.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bytech fixWhen it comes to online comments and discourse and what you can do to limit their toxicity, you only have a certain amount of power. The real leverage lies with the tech companies. This column is going to be a bit unusual. Typically, I write about a broad tech problem and offer some solutions. But this week, I\u2019ve stumbled into a topic that many agree has no easy fix: online comments.What does that show us? That you as an internet user have little power over content you find offensive or harmful online. It\u2019s the tech companies that hold the cards.Given the way things are going, our faith in the internet may erode until we distrust it as much as we do TV news, said Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches social media courses. Why are internet comments so hopelessly bad, and how do we protect ourselves? Even though there is no simple fix, there are some measures we can aim to take. Here\u2019s what you need to know about how we got here and what you can try.There are many theories about why the internet seems to bring out the worst in people. I gathered a sampling of some noteworthy findings.Ms. Papacharissi said that in her 20 years of researching and interviewing people about online behavior, one conclusion has remained consistent: people use the internet to get more of what they do not get enough of in everyday life. So while people have been socialized to resist being impulsive in the real world, on the internet they cave to their temptations to lash out.\u201cThe internet becomes an easy outlet for us to shout something and feel for a moment fulfilled even though we\u2019re really just shouting out into the air,\u201d she said.This is nothing new, of course. Before the internet, people took their frustrations to TV and radio talk shows. The internet was simply a more accessible, less moderated space.Daniel Ha, a founder of Disqus, a popular internet comment tool used by many websites, said the quality of comments vary widely depending on the pieces of content being discussed and the audiences they attract. For example, there are videos about niche topics, like home improvement, that invite constructive commentary from enthusiasts. But there are others, such as a music video from a popular artist or a general news article, which ask people from all around the world to comment. That\u2019s when things can get especially unruly.\u201cYou have an airport of people from all walks of life coming together, and they\u2019re speaking different languages with different attitudes and they\u2019re just saying stuff,\u201d Mr. Ha said. Comments can be terrible simply because many people are flawed. It\u2019s up to the content providers and tech platforms to vet their communities and set rules and standards for civilized discussion. That is an area where many resource-strained news publications fall short: They often leave their comments sections unmoderated, so they become cesspools of toxic behavior. It is also an area where tech companies like Facebook and Twitter struggle, because they have long portrayed themselves as neutral platforms that do not that do not wish to take on the editorial roles of traditional publishers.Tech companies have long employed various methods to detect fake comments from bots and spammers. So-called Captcha tests, for Completely Automated Procedures for Telling Computers and Humans Apart, ask you to type a word or select photos of a specific item to verify you are human and not a bot. Other methods, like detecting a device type or location of a commenter, can be used to pin down bots. Yet security researchers have shown there are workarounds to all these methods. Some hackers are now getting extremely clever about their methodologies. When the Federal Communications Commission was preparing to repeal net neutrality last year, there were 22 million comments posted on its site between April 2017 and October 2017, many of which expressed support for the move. \u201cIt was like Mad Libs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read through different comments one by one, it\u2019s hard to tell that some are from the same template. But if you use these machine learning algorithms, you can pick out some of these clusters.\u201dFor the issue of spoofed comments, there is a fairly simple solution: You can report them to the site\u2019s owner, which will likely analyze and remove the fakes. Other than that, don\u2019t take web comments at face value. Mr. Kao said the lesson he learned was to always try to view comments in a wider context. Look at a commenter\u2019s history of past posts, or fact-check any dubious claims or endorsements elsewhere on the web, he said.Yet once you report an offensive comment, it is typically up to tech companies to decide whether it threatens your safety or violates a law \u2014 and often harassers know exactly how offensive they can be without clearly breaking rules. Historically, tech companies have been conservative and fickle about removing inappropriate comments, largely to maintain their positions as neutral platforms where people can freely express themselves.In the case of Infowars, Apple, Google and Facebook were the ones that banned some content from the conspiracy site after determining it violated their policies. Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said on Tuesday that the company did not suspend the accounts belonging to Infowars because its owner, Alex Jones, did not violate any rules. \u201cIf we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that\u2019s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction,\u201d he said in a tweet. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment elaborating on the decision.Beyond reporting comments individually, you could also use an online petition tool like Change.org to demand that tech companies remove offensive content. (But note that supporters of Infowars are already on that site petitioning for the site's content to be restored on YouTube.)When publishers and tech companies fail to address inappropriate comments, Ms. Papacharissi recommended an exercise in self-discipline. \u201cThink before you read,\u201d she said. \u201cThink before you speak. And you don\u2019t always have to respond. A lot of things do not deserve a response. Sometimes not responding is more effective than lashing out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The connection did not work out when his prospective date texted him and said she wasn\u2019t crazy about being set up by her mother. But she did offer to ask if anyone at that day\u2019s meeting of her book club, in Manhattan, was interested in meeting with him.He was willing, but no one at the book club was interested either.

{"Headline": "A Generation Grows Up in China Without Google, Facebook or Twitter", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 Wei Dilong, 18, who lives in the southern Chinese city of Liuzhou, likes basketball, hip-hop music and Hollywood superhero movies. He plans to study chemistry in Canada when he goes to college in 2020.Mr. Wei is typical of Chinese teenagers in another way, too: He has never heard of Google or Twitter. He once heard of Facebook, though. It is \u201cmaybe like Baidu?\u201d he asked one recent afternoon, referring to China\u2019s dominant search engine.Now the implications of growing up with this different internet system are starting to play out. Many young people in China have little idea what Google, Twitter or Facebook are, creating a gulf with the rest of the world. And, accustomed to the homegrown apps and online services, many appear uninterested in knowing what has been censored online, allowing Beijing to build an alternative value system that competes with Western liberal democracy.Even if the Western apps and sites make it into China, they may face apathy from young people.Two economists from Peking University and Stanford University concluded this year, after an 18-month survey, that Chinese college students were indifferent about having access to uncensored, politically sensitive information. They had given nearly 1,000 students at two Beijing universities free tools to bypass censorship, but found that nearly half the students did not use them. Among those who did, almost none spent time browsing foreign news websites that were blocked.\u201cOur findings suggest that censorship in China is effective not only because the regime makes it difficult to access sensitive information, but also because it fosters an environment in which citizens do not demand such information in the first place,\u201d the scholars wrote.Zhang Yeqiong, 23, a customer service representative at an e-commerce company in Xinji, a small city a few hours\u2019 drive from Beijing, echoed that sentiment. \u201cI grew up with Baidu, so I\u2019m used to it,\u201d she said.The attitude is a departure even from those born in China in the 1980s. When that generation was coming of age a decade or so ago, some were rebels. One of the most famous was Han Han, a blogger who questioned the Chinese political system and traditional values. He sold millions of copies of books and has more than 40 million followers on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.Many young people in China instead consume apps and services like Baidu, the social media service WeChat and the short-video platform Tik Tok. Often, they spout consumerism and nationalism.In March, when the social media giant Tencent surveyed more than 10,000 users who were born in 2000 or after, nearly eight in 10 said they thought China was either in its best time in history or was becoming a better country each day. Nearly the same percentage said they were very optimistic or quite optimistic about their future.One who describes herself as patriotic, optimistic and outgoing is Shen Yanan. Ms. Shen, 28, works in the operations department at a real estate website in Baoding, a city of roughly three million people near Beijing. She believes China is a great country and will do her best to make it stronger, she said.Every evening, she watches one to two hours of South Korean soap operas on her phone. She does not have any news apps on her smartphone because, she said, she is not interested in politics. She has traveled to Japan a few times and has used Google Maps there, but otherwise did not visit any blocked foreign sites.\u201cThe Chinese apps have got everything,\u201d she said.Wen Shengjian, 14, wants to become a rapper and idolizes Drake and Kanye West. Shengjian, whose family moved in July from Beijing to Dongying, an oil town in eastern Shandong Province, said he had noticed that American rappers were very vocal about social issues and that some even criticized the president in their music.That would not work in China, he said, because it is a developing country and needs social stability. That is a line that the Communist Party makes sure that the state media and school textbooks repeat all the time.Shengjian, who likes playing basketball, said he knew the names of Google, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. He said a friend of his father\u2019s had told him that those websites were blocked because some of their content \u201cwasn\u2019t appropriate for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said.When young Chinese spend time abroad, many have to learn an entirely different internet ecosystem. That happened to Perry Fang, 23, who moved two years ago from Guangzhou in southern China to study marketing in Sydney, Australia. In Sydney, he learned a whole new set of websites, including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat.Now when he returns to China to visit his family for holidays, Mr. Fang said, it is hard not to be able to use Google. He has also learned not to check sensitive political news in front of his parents, who have scolded him for doing so.\u201cThe Chinese apps become useless as soon as you move abroad,\u201d he said. But with Google and others, \u201cwhichever country you go to, you can still use these apps,\u201d he added. \u201cThe return on investment is very high.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Don\u2019t Run This Year\u2019: The Perils for Republican Women Facing a Flood of Resistance", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe energy in the midterms is working against female Republican candidates who are reluctant or unable to claim any advantage to being a woman among voters.SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. \u2014 Diane Harkey, the Republican candidate for California\u2019s 49th Congressional District, recognizes that President Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t make women real comfortable.\u201dMen just have a different style, she said: \u201cThey\u2019re more warrior-oriented. We are a little more consensus-builders.\u201dBut she laughs off the idea of campaigning as a woman. \u201cI want all voters, I like men too,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it helps to talk about gender.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s anti-health care, anti-gun control, anti-family, anti-immigrant, anti-environment,\u201d said Mary Schrader, a Flip volunteer who was a Republican until 2016. \u201cShe\u2019s completely out of touch with the women in her district.\u201dRepublican women running in swing districts are instead left to carefully carve out the separation between themselves and Mr. Trump, a president who was elected with the biggest gender gap ever recorded, and who regularly dismisses female officeholders as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201clow I.Q.\u201dThose running in districts where the president is popular have been punished for so much as criticizing him for incivility.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican who is leading her party\u2019s recruitment efforts in the House, credits several candidates with keeping the party competitive in districts where Hillary Clinton won in 2016 \u2014 Young Kim in Southern California, for example, and Lea Marquez Peterson in Arizona.Ms. Stefanik argued that Republican women connect better to voters. \u201cDemocratic women are running in response to the Trump administration,\u201d she said. \u201cWith my candidates I\u2019ve worked to recruit, it\u2019s more about representing their communities and their districts.\u201dIn states and districts, though, the party has been slower to support Republican women.Carla Nelson, running for an open House seat in southern Minnesota, has the endorsement of four national conservative women\u2019s groups, nine incumbent congresswomen and the National Rifle Association. She beat an incumbent Democrat to win her current seat in the State Senate.But in the primary on Tuesday, local party organizations are supporting Jim Hagedorn, who has run for the seat and lost three times, even in 2016 when Mr. Trump won the district by 15 points.\u201cLocally it\u2019s different,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. \u201cAll the good ol\u2019 boys begged me not to run.\u201dMr. Hagedorn has a trail of blog posts derogating women. He described the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2005 as an attempt \u201cto fill the bra of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u201d and in 2008, he thanked John McCain \u201con behalf of all red-blooded American men\u201d for his vice-presidential pick \u2014 \u201cSARAH\u2019S HOT!\u201d he wrote \u2014 leading a columnist for the conservative Washington Examiner to label him in April \u201cthe worst midterm candidate in America.\u201d\u201cThe mailers would write themselves,\u201d Ms. Nelson said. It was no wonder, she added, that the Republican Party is \u201cstruggling to earn the support of women in the voting booth.\u201dRepublican voters may be less inclined to support women: 13 percent of Republican primary winners so far are women, compared with 42 percent among Democrats, according to the Rutgers center.Ms. Nelson sounds like many Democratic women when she describes why she is running in a year when the odds are so against her.\u201cThe need is so great for someone like me who has a track record of getting things done,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t sit on the sidelines.\u201d\u201cI sat back and said, \u2018Do I want to be somebody on the sidelines throwing rocks or do I want to jump in and make a difference?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy message was, \u2018I want to stand next to him when he\u2019s delivering conservative policies I agree with but be the first person to call out the incivility I see.\u2019\u201dShe was \u201cblown away,\u201d she said, by the support from many voters. One man, she said, told her, \u201cMy New Year\u2019s resolution was to only vote for female candidates.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what people are disgusted with in politics,\u201d said Ms. Sarver, who came in fifth out of 18 candidates in the March primary. \u201cI would rather lose with grace than lie to voters.\u201d\u201cRepublican women have always said we don\u2019t play identity politics,\u201d she said. \u201cHow we address that going forward is a really big problem.\u201dBut the biggest problem for Republican women this year is what Ms. Harkey told the crowd of 80 people who gathered to open her headquarters on a steamy August Saturday. \u201cThe energy is on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans are going, \u2018Are you Trump or are you not Trump?\u2019 \u2018Are you this or are you that?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what? This is no time to worry. Just get out and vote, and vote for the party, people, because the other side has gone way far left and it\u2019s going to continue.\u201dThe district of red-roofed Spanish-style McMansions and oceanside golf courses stretches from southern Orange County to northern San Diego County and includes the Marine base at Camp Pendleton. The crowd cheering Ms. Harkey included several veterans and a woman with a sparkling flag pin. A leader of a local Republican women\u2019s club noted proudly that her red dress was from Ivanka Trump\u2019s label.As Ms. Harkey called out to make sure she had not missed any local officials \u2014 \u201cSchool board, water board, anything else?\u201d \u2014 a man in the crowd replied, \u201cI\u2019m all for waterboarding!\u201dMs. Harkey told her story of arriving in California as a young girl from Illinois and having to peel onions with the Mexican bracero workers to earn $11 for her first Barbie doll. She went to community college and the University of California-Irvine, working her way up in banking and to become mayor of Dana Point, a wealthy oceanfront enclave. She served six years in the California State Assembly and is now a member of a board that reviews state tax assessments.After nearly two decades of voting Republican in presidential races, the district went for Mrs. Clinton by 7 points in 2016. And Pat Bates, a state senator, warned the crowd at Ms. Harkey\u2019s headquarters that Democrats had \u201coverperformed\u201d in their voter registration efforts in the June primaries. \u201cWe need boots on the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single Republican has got to vote or we\u2019re looking at a socialist southern Orange County and north San Diego, I kid you not.\u201dThe women at the Flip the 49th headquarters, who worked hard for that overperformance, began their activism out of concerns about the Trump administration dismantling the Affordable Care Act. They held weekly protests outside the office of Mr. Issa, a leading tormentor of Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, and once brought a cake in the shape of a Hawaiian shirt to encourage him to retire early; they returned to celebrate the next day when he announced he would.They began calling themselves ReSistas, and by November had joined up with Flip the 49th to rent office space in Carlsbad. A Trump effigy stands in one corner and across the window is a banner reading \u201cWe the People\u201d embroidered by Karin Brennan, a former Sergeant in Army intelligence who joined the group.\u201cEighteen months ago if you asked me my congressional district, I would have said I have to look it up on Google,\u201d said one volunteer, Ellen Montanari.With so many women running this year, the women here wanted to support a female candidate. But they believe Mike Levin, the Democratic opponent, will support what they see as women\u2019s issues, particularly health care and gun control.\u201cYou can have a female candidate,\u201d said Terra Lawson-Remer, a founder of Flip the 49th. \u201cBut you need an army to take power.\u201d Ms. Harkey was endorsed by Mr. Issa. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to bank on the R next to her name,\u201d said Nikki Faddick, a co-leader for a local chapter of Moms Demand Action, a gun control group.But Ms. Harkey, while a loyal Republican, is aware that she needs to choose her words carefully. \u201cI would like to see the president tweet less and govern a little more,\u201d she said in an interview.The crowd at her headquarters seemed mostly concerned about illegal immigrants taking advantage of the system. Ms. Harkey returned to her story about the braceros, noting that Mexican workers can come across the border on day passes to work in California\u2019s agricultural industry. Her voice betrayed a tinge of exasperation.\u201cIf the president wants his wall, he needs his wall,\u201d Ms. Harkey told them. \u201cJust do it, you know? It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "Data security is crucial for the integrity and stability of businesses today; and the unseen reality is that to fully protect customers\u2019 data, cloud platforms must have extraordinary security measures in place, spanning the virtual world and the physical. \u201cInfrastructure security is very, very important in cloud computing,\u201d says Rob Sadowski, a member of the Google Cloud Trust and Security team. \u201cBecause if that underlying foundation is flawed, anything you store on it is going to be potentially at risk.\u201dWith seven Google products that have more than one billion monthly active users each (Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Search, YouTube, Google Play and Android), Google Cloud excels at online security, and has the advantage of scale and experience. For more than two decades, Google has employed the comprehensive security approach called \u201cdefense in depth,\u201d which protects users and their data with multiple layers of security that build upon and reinforce one another. In the event that one layer is circumvented or compromised, many more are in place to prevent potential attackers from accomplishing their objectives. But what exactly happens when your confidential business document is stored on Google Cloud\u2019s network? Here\u2019s how security tactics in both the virtual and physical realms all work together to help protect your valuable data.\n\u201cOur private network sits apart from the public internet,\u201d Sadowski says. That means not only enhanced reliability and performance but also increased control and customized security for Google Cloud customers. The people who make it past the wildlife quickly encounter one security safeguard after another: High fences surrounding the perimeter. Vehicle-blocking gates. Badge scanners. Camera monitoring. Guards must confirm that visitors\u2019 names are on an exclusive list. Inside, security gets even more intense. \u201cWe use retina scans, high-resolution camera coverage, laser-based intrusion systems and more,\u201d Sadowski says. Less than 1 percent of Google employees are granted access to the high-security zones in one of its data centers worldwide, where Google Cloud customer data is stored. The payoff? Row after row of secure servers, protected from the heat by an elaborate cooling system using recycled water from nearby sources.Google Cloud designed the chip because it has a very important purpose: to verify the integrity of the hardware and boot-up software in the data center\u2019s servers. These chips regularly check the servers, and if something seems awry \u2014 if any hardware or software can\u2019t be verified  \u2014 that server will not start or be used until its integrity is confirmed.The Titan chip\u2019s use in the checking process helps underpin Google Cloud\u2019s \u201czero trust\u201d philosophy: \u201cEssentially, something is considered bad,\u201d Sadowski explains, \u201cunless it is verified to be good.\u201dThe bespoke chip is a trusted part of Google Cloud\u2019s wide-ranging approach to security. \u201cWe design this hardware ourselves,\u201d Sadowski says, \u201cbecause we want it to do one specific job, we want to know how it works and where the components are coming from, and we want to write any code that will run on it.\u201dTo help organizations protect their employees\u2019 identities, and to further safeguard the company\u2019s sensitive data, Google Cloud offers physical security keys. If a business chooses this extra level of protection, small cryptographic devices are required to be in employees\u2019 possession to log in to their accounts. A common attack method today is to \u201cphish\u201d users into giving away their account credentials. These keys make it very hard to compromise Google accounts. \u201cEven if someone were to steal your username and password,\u201d Sadowski says, \u201cthat person wouldn\u2019t be able to log in without having this physical key present.\u201d No security key, no access. Simple.Cloud computing leads to innovation. And businesses that figure it out early \u2014 the strategy, the transformative possibilities \u2014 may end up being progress makers, game changers and models for other businesses. But companies and their employees have to believe in their cloud security systems before they gain the confidence and freedom to spend time on the magical stuff that makes their businesses stand out. \u201cGoogle Cloud\u2019s comprehensive approach to security helps protect your data and keeps you in control,\u201d Sadowski says, \u201cwhich means greater freedom and peace of mind.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "\u2018Weaponized Ad Technology\u2019: Facebook\u2019s Moneymaker Gets a Critical Eye", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFacebook has made a mint by enabling advertisers to identify and reach the very people most likely to react to their messages. Ad buyers can select audiences based on details like a user\u2019s location, political leanings and interests as specific as the Museum of the Confederacy or online gambling. And they can aim their ads at as few as 20 of the 1.5 billion daily users of the social network.But microtargeting, as the technique is called, is coming under increased scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Some government officials, researchers and advertising executives warn that it can be exploited to polarize and manipulate voters. And they are calling for restrictions on its use in politics, even after Facebook, in response to criticism, recently limited some of the targeting categories available to advertisers.Facebook is just one player among tech giants like Google and Twitter that also offer data-mining services to try to influence consumer and voter behavior. But Facebook\u2019s gargantuan reach, vast holdings of user data and easy-to-use self-service advertising system have made it a lightning rod for political microtargeting.Much of the new attention being paid to microtargeted advertising has emerged from investigations into how Russian groups interfered in elections and how the voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. Microtargeting, they have found, was a central tool for foreign groups trying to interfere in elections.\u201cThese techniques raise fundamental questions about the relationship between privacy and democracy, as concerns about voter surveillance could lead to disengagement with the political process,\u201d Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, wrote in the report.New research on how groups tied to the Kremlin exploited the technology during the 2016 presidential election in the United States is also raising concerns.Then on Election Day, the same Russian group sent the same Facebook user demographic an ad urging them to boycott the presidential election.\u201cNo one represents Black people. Don\u2019t go to vote,\u201d the ad said.In the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Facebook has made major changes to try to deter subversive groups from exploiting its system.But there remain many categories available to political and other advertisers, including selecting audiences by their ZIP code, education level, brand of smartphone, and whether they are politically moderate, very conservative or very liberal.Facebook has also said that it would require anyone seeking to run a political campaign or political issue ad to confirm their identity and location as well as disclose who paid for the ad. In May, Facebook introduced an archive containing political ads shown on Facebook and Instagram. It includes information on the ad costs, viewership and certain demographics of the ad audience.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said the archive and other changes would \u201chelp prevent the abuse\u201d of the company\u2019s advertising tools.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible to advertise in obscurity on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Leathern said in a statement.But critics, including some civil rights experts and researchers, say that Facebook\u2019s recent efforts have done little to disable microtargeting as an engine of voter manipulation. The company\u2019s new political ad archive, for instance, does not include details on the criteria used to target voters.The problem, critics of microtargeting say, is that even a small amount of money could potentially have large negative effects.To stoke anxiety among Latinos last year, for instance, the Internet Research Agency used Facebook to aim an ad at users interested in Mexico, Latin hip-hop and the Chicano Movement. The ad showed a cartoon of immigrants standing in front of a barbed-wire border with a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come to steal your jobs,\u201d it said, \u201cwe came to make a living.\u201dThe Russian group paid 10.6 rubles \u2014 about 16 cents \u2014 for the Facebook ad, which was seen 283 times. But the targeting was so successful that the selected group spread the ad, which eventually racked up 16,000 reactions and 95,000 shares.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Targeted Ads Stalking You? Here\u2019s How to Make Them Stop", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOnline ads have always been annoying, but now they\u2019re worse than ever.Consider what happens when you shop online for a wristwatch. You peruse a few watch websites and the next thing you know, a watch advertisement is following you everywhere. On your computer, it\u2019s loading in your Facebook feed. On your phone, it\u2019s popping up on Instagram. In your web browser on either, it\u2019s appearing on news sites that have nothing to do with watches. Even if you end up ordering the watch, the ads continue trailing you everywhere.They\u2019re stalker ads.To the ad industry, targeted ads are better for people than the old days of randomly blasting commercials.\u201cThe content isn\u2019t free, so what would you rather see?\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chairwoman for the ad agency 360i. \u201cAds that are at least trying to be of interest to you, or ads that are spray and pray?\u201dFortunately, I have good news. After several years of interviewing internet companies and privacy experts and testing many web tools, I finally managed to make my stalker ads go away.Before you try to exorcise targeted ads, it helps to understand what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.Let\u2019s say you are shopping online for a blender. You load a webpage for a blender from Brand X, then close the browser. The next time you open the browser, ads for the blender are following you from site to site. They\u2019re also showing up in some of your mobile apps like Facebook and Instagram.When you visited Brand X\u2019s website, the site stored a cookie on your device containing a unique identifier. Brand X hired multiple ad tech companies to do its marketing. The ad tech companies embedded trackers that also loaded on Brand X\u2019s website, and the trackers took a look at your cookie to pinpoint your device.The trackers can tell if you are interested in buying something. They look for signals \u2014 like if you closed the browser after looking at the blender for awhile or left the item in the site\u2019s shopping cart without completing the purchase. From there, the ad tech companies can follow your cookie through trackers and ad networks on various sites and apps to serve you an ad for the blender.Ms. Hofstetter said that among ad tech companies, there are good actors and bad actors. The good ones will try to minimize the chances of annoying you by showing you the blender ad only a few times and stopping if they detect that you made the purchase. The bad ones only care to persuade you to buy the blender, so they will relentlessly serve you the ad and not bother to determine whether you already bought it.Things get extra messy when brands employ multiple ad tech companies that employ different approaches. Perhaps one ad company finished serving you the blender ad after a few times on Facebook. But elsewhere on the web or inside another app, another ad tech company served you that same ad endlessly.Here are a few simple steps you can take if you are being pestered by an ad and want that to end:There are more extreme methods to take if you want to prevent targeted ads from ever following you around. But this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart: In my experience, you have to take all, not just some, of these steps to get the pesky ads to leave you alone forever.It will probably take you a couple of hours to set yourself up to prevent ads from haunting you. I gradually made all these changes to my devices and internet accounts over the last few years and only recently stopped seeing targeted ads. It was a grueling process.But I\u2019ve been happy with the results. Those wristwatch ads that once followed me are gone. And recently, I was served an ad for 7-11 on Instagram.Was that ad irrelevant to me? Yes. But was it a sign that I was no longer being well tracked? Also yes. I confess I was pretty happy to see it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeonard Pozner says he spends hours every day trying to erase online conspiracy theories that the death of his 6-year-old son Noah at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.But the bulk of his work is more methodical. Sandy Hook conspiracies are strewn around the internet on various platforms, each with its own opaque rules and reporting mechanisms. So Mr. Pozner has studiously flagged countless videos and posts for a wide variety of offenses \u2014 invasions of privacy, threats and harassment, and copyright infringement \u2014 prompting Facebook, Amazon and Google to remove false material about his son.Twitter has been less receptive to his claims and some smaller sites have simply not responded at all. But one company, Mr. Pozner says, has actively pushed back against his attempts.WordPress.com, one the internet\u2019s biggest blogging platforms, is operated by a company called Automattic, which also runs a wide array of smaller sites and internet services. Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists have been able to remain on WordPress.com thanks, in part, to policies put in place to resist previous campaigns to get content removed from its service, particularly through the strategic use of copyright claims.These debates have put tech companies into a sort of existential crisis. But for Mr. Pozner and others like him, the arguments have long been much more personal, as they struggle with images of family members being repurposed in horrifying new ways and experience harassment themselves because of misinformation online.\u201cThe only items that concern me is when his image is being used in a negative, ugly way \u2014 denying the tragedy, calling him a crisis actor and everything else that the typical global village idiot on the net does,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.In the absence of uniform online policies about hoaxes, Mr. Pozner\u2019s most effective tool has been filing copyright claims on images of Noah. He has filed such claims with Automattic about photos of Noah appearing on posts that labeled him a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d who had been spotted in Pakistan after Sandy Hook and others that claimed he was a \u201cfiction\u201d and that photos of him were created using images of his older half brother.Automattic has repeatedly responded to Mr. Pozner with form letters saying \u201cbecause we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.\u201d The letters explain that fair use could include \u201ccriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\u201d They also warn that the company could collect damages from people who \u201cknowingly materially misrepresent\u201d copyrights.\u201cThe responses from their support people are very automated, very generic, very cold and there\u2019s just no getting through to them,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.\u201cThey have taken this incorrect interpretation of freedom of speech to an extreme,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing WordPress has taken out \u2014 and where I\u2019ve been successful \u2014 is if someone posts personal information like my driver\u2019s license or address.\u201dAutomattic said that the responses Mr. Pozner received were \u201ca predefined statement\u201d that is used in copyright situations. \u201cWe regret that it was used in this situation,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe offer our apologies to the family for the response we gave to them.\u201dMr. Pozner\u2019s complaints appear to have been thwarted in part by longtime policies at Automattic intended to prevent the use of copyright claims to censor criticism and journalism on its platform. The responses sent to Mr. Pozner included a link to a post from 2013 describing the company\u2019s efforts to deal with spurious but effective copyright claims. The post also highlighted that the company had filed suit against two particularly egregious offenders in an effort to \u201cfight back\u201d on behalf of people who were posting material on the platform.Online platforms are not held liable for copyright infringement claims against people who use their platforms as long as they remove or block access to content in response to the claims. This is crucial to the function of any website where people can post content, and internet companies have traditionally tended to err on the side of removal, even when claims may be dubious. This has created opportunities for abuse, and Automattic has made fighting that a corporate cause.\u201cThey avoid getting involved because fair-use determinations are notoriously complex and fact specific,\u201d Mr. Rubin said of online platforms. \u201cPlatforms would rather eliminate their own potential liability by taking the content down and leaving it to the parties to battle amongst themselves in court.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Pozner, however, Automattic suggested that its approach was imperfect. \u201cWhile our policies have many benefits to free expression for those who use our platform, our system like many others that operate at large scale, is not ideal for getting to the deeper context of a given request,\u201d the company said in a statement.Although the posts reported by Mr. Pozner \u201dare not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law,\u201d the company said, \u201cthe pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that.\u201dHe has removed photos of Noah from Facebook by relying on policies that protect the privacy of children under 13, a process that has required him to send the company his driver\u2019s license and a copy of his son\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. Pozner has also successfully filed such reports with Google.\u201cYou can\u2019t even measure the volume of content I\u2019ve taken down at this point,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.At times, he has been able to explain the abuse he and his family have received, some of it because of his efforts to purge Sandy Hook conspiracies from the internet, and seek removals based on a slowly evolving awareness in the tech community about the issue. (In June of last year, a 57-year-old woman in Florida was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr. Pozner and his family.)A report to Vimeo led to a response on Friday from a representative who said he would assign the case to a specialist, but first told Mr. Pozner that he was sorry to hear about his situation.\u201cEveryone has gotten better this year, especially with all the work that I\u2019ve done to shame a lot of these platforms for continuing to abuse us and the memory of our children and just all of the ugliness that goes on,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cIf you type in Noah Pozner now into an image search on Google, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s mostly normal results but it used to be 99 percent hateful angry memes, so the cleanup is huge.\u201dMr. Pozner said he was tired of hearing technology companies say that they do not want to be \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d an oft-repeated refrain, particularly as concerns around misinformation on social media grow.\u201cTechnology platforms have had this misguided, futuristic vision of freedom of speech and everything was built around that, but it doesn\u2019t really fit into the day-to-day use of it,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cBy not taking action, they have made a choice. They are the arbiters of truth by doing nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Jones and Infowars have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. On Sunday, Apple removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app and by Monday Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube had followed with similar measures.But this isn\u2019t the only effort to stop Mr. Jones from spreading his theories. He also faces multiple defamation claims, and well before Monday\u2019s moves, several scholars of free speech had already concluded that many of the things he has said online were not in fact protected by the First Amendment.In a recent court filing, four law professors who specialize in free-speech issues said that Mr. Jones\u2019s oeuvre was riddled with \u201cabsurd conspiracy theories\u201d and urged a federal judge considering a lawsuit against him not to let him hide behind the First Amendment while publishing his rhetoric.\u201cFalse speech does not serve the public interest the way that true speech does,\u201d the scholars wrote. \u201cAnd indeed, there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201dIn a breathless moment (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s like, whoa, whoa \u2014 C.I.A.?\u201d), Mr. Jones went on to suggest that Mr. Gilmore may have been involved in the attack on Ms. Heyer to bring about what he described as \u201cthe downfall of Trump.\u201dIn March, Mr. Gilmore sued Mr. Jones for defamation, arguing that he had suffered threats and harassment because of the report.In defending himself, Mr. Jones has claimed in court papers that his allegations concerning Mr. Gilmore were \u201copinion, not statements of fact\u201d and that Infowars is a \u201cfreewheeling\u201d website, \u201cin which hyperbole and diatribe reign as the preferred tools of discourse.\u201d His viewers, Mr. Jones maintained, \u201cexpect an interview or monologue to be more free-flowing and opinionated and less precise in its use of language than an article or a book.\u201dWhile they acknowledged that the protection of speech is \u201ca priority of the first order,\u201d the First Amendment scholars, from institutions like Rutgers University and the University of Chicago Law School, noted that since the Middle Ages defamation law has created \u201csocial boundaries about what speech is and is not acceptable.\u201d It has also, they wrote, long sought to balance the freedom of expression with the safeguarding of people\u2019s reputations.To do this, the scholars said, defamation statutes have always restricted some speech \u2014 especially for private figures like Mr. Gilmore, who have less of an ability than those like Mr. Jones with media platforms to \u201cdisseminate their own side of the story.\u201dThe scholars were particularly scathing when it came to Mr. Jones\u2019s contention that his videos on Infowars reflected nothing more than his beliefs. It would set a dangerous precedent, they said, if Judge Moon ruled on his behalf.\u201cIt would allow unscrupulous news organizations to couch their language as \u2018opinion\u2019 and to mask their meaning with implication and insinuation,\u201d the scholars wrote. That, they added, would leave \u201creaders clear as to the message but avoiding all liability for defamatory remarks. This should not be allowed and, in fact, is not allowed.\u201dThe law professors who signed the amicus brief were Lyrissa B. Lidsky, dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, Tamara R. Piety at the University of Tulsa College of Law, David A. Strauss from the University of Chicago Law School, and Carlos A. Ball of Rutgers.The brief was also signed by Michael B. Hissam, a lawyer at the firm of Bailey & Glasser in Charleston, W.Va., who is amicus counsel for Mr. Gilmore, and Katharine M. Mapes and Katherine O\u2019Konski, lawyers at the firm of Spiegel & McDiarmid in Washington.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Li Yuan, Asia tech columnist, and it\u2019s my turn to write the newsletter. This week, the tech world on both sides of the Pacific got embroiled in the topic I\u2019m most passionate about: censorship. Allow me to indulge a bit.But as exhausting and exasperating as the debate about tech companies\u2019 role in policing content may be for many Americans, I often watch it with envy and wish we could have similarly vigorous discussions about free speech and due process in China.As many of you may know, China has the world\u2019s most sophisticated and brutal internet censorship system called the Great Firewall. Over the past decade, the Chinese government blocked Google, Facebook and Twitter, along with thousands of other foreign websites. In their places rose the homegrown search engine giant Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter called Weibo, and the Facebook-like app called WeChat. The government also carried out many crackdowns on tools that help circumvent the Great Firewall.I was surprised by the reactions (good and bad) to the column. Some readers were sarcastic. Not having access to Google, Facebook or Twitter? \u201cLucky them!\u201d wrote one Facebook user. \u201cThey have not missed anything important!\u201d said another.The point of the column wasn\u2019t about access to those websites, which, as flawed as they are, constitute much of the internet in many countries. It was about access to information and what happens when a government controls the flow of information.I\u2019m especially surprised that the column went viral on the Chinese internet. Censorship is a tired topic to many Chinese, who live it everyday. Since both The Times and its Chinese website are blocked in China, people made screenshots or PDF versions of the column, then posted it on social media timelines or shared it in chat groups. I posted the links on my Weibo account but the tweet got blocked quickly.\u201cAfter reading your article, I\u2019m very worried about China\u2019s future,\u201d a lawyer in Beijing messaged me. Her family has been using tools to bypass the Great Firewall for years. She said her son was considered \u201cweird\u201d by his high school classmates because he shared information he learned from some blocked foreign websites. Now he\u2019s studying at a college in the United States.\u201cHe had to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was too different.\u201dThere were some discussions about how representative the young people in my column were. Some readers, especially expats, said they know plenty of Chinese who scale the Great Firewall. Some of my closest Chinese friends also said they will have to send themselves into exile if the government blocks all censorship-bypassing tools. It will be the last straw for them.But outside of these circles, it\u2019s often a different picture. Some people \u2014 even those who have many ways to get out of the Great Firewall \u2014 decide to stay in and defend it.So my column wasn\u2019t just about the young generation of Chinese. It was about all Chinese who grew up without access to uncensored information. Once inside the wall, it\u2019s hard to escape because often you don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know.In other news this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Takes a (Careful) Step Toward Autonomous Flying", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "A new flying ambulance service will use small helicopters outfitted with tech that could eventually let them fly without pilots.Supported byTRACY, Calif. \u2014 Last week, at a tiny airport in the dusty flatlands east of San Francisco, a red-and-white helicopter lifted gently into the air, hovering a few feet over the tarmac. It looked like any other helicopter, except for the small black cube attached to its nose.Local officials spent the week testing this aircraft for a new emergency service, due for launch in January, that will respond to 911 calls via the air. But as this helicopter moves police officers and medical workers over the San Joaquin Valley, it will feed a more ambitious project. That black cube is part of a growing effort to build small passenger aircraft that can fly on their own.\u201cThere are many things that must come to fruition before autonomous aircraft start flying people,\u201d said Mark Groden, a co-founder and the chief executive of SkyRyse. \u201cBut we are developing the technology that can take us there.\u201dThe motivation is obvious: Pilots are expensive, and they need rest between flights. Autonomous flight can drive new kinds of passenger services or even change the economics of today\u2019s airlines. As companies like Aurora build aircraft for autonomous flight, entrepreneurs like Mr. Groden believe that adapting existing aircraft is more realistic. But any path will take a while, for technical and cultural reasons.Government and industry have long worked to automate portions of passenger flight \u2014 \u201cautopilot\u201d is part of the American vernacular \u2014 and in some ways, building an autonomous aircraft is easier than building driverless cars, which have long been tested on public roads. Aircraft operate in wide-open spaces, as opposed to narrow roads teeming with pedestrians and other vehicles. And piloting a plane or helicopter is the kind of highly procedural task that computers are typically good at.\u201cThe technical challenge is simpler in a lot of ways,\u201d Mr. Bry said. \u201cNobody wants these things whipping through the forest as fast as they can go. They just want them to fly reliably, carry people from point A to point B, and deal with takeoff and landing.\u201dBut dealing with the uncertainty that comes during takeoff and landing, not to mention the rare and random events that cause crashes in the middle of a flight, can be extremely difficult.Passenger flight is also highly regulated. Even if they build systems that fly reliably, companies may have trouble moving the technology into public airspace.That is why SkyRyse, backed by $25 million in funding, including investments from the Silicon Valley venture firms Venrock and Eclipse, is working with the City of Tracy. The Tracy emergency service will operate under current federal rules, and it takes only a step toward autonomy.The helicopter includes sensors that it would need for autonomous navigation. The radar, for example, is similar to the laser sensors on driverless cars, providing a detailed view of the surroundings even in heavy weather. But at this point, these sensors operate in tandem with pilots. Mr. Patt calls it \u201ca way of building trust\u201d with regulators.At the same time, these sensors capture enormous amounts of data describing what the helicopter encounters from takeoff to landing \u2014 and how the pilot responds.\u201cWe can simulate puffs of wind, engine failure, even birds digested into the tail rotor,\u201d Mr. Groden said.But shifting this work into emergency services like the one in Tracy will take years. Moving it into flying taxi services may take even longer.Still, the biggest hurdle may be convincing regulators and the public that autonomous flight is safe.\u201cThere are a lot of start-ups doing this,\u201d Igor Cherepinsky, director of autonomy programs at Sikorsky, said. \u201cQuite a few of them are na\u00efve about what it will take.\u201dIn an earlier version of this article, some picture captions misspelled the name of the start-up developing hardware and software for autonomous flight. The company is SkyRyse, not SkyRise. Also, an earlier version of this article misquoted, in one instance, Mark Groden, a co-founder and chief executive of SkyRyse. Mr. Groden said, \u201cWe can simulate puffs of wind, engine failure, even birds digested into the tail rotor,\u201d not \u201cthe tail rudder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Wyoming Governor\u2019s Race, a Wealthy Conservative Donor Tries on a New Hat: Candidate", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA conversation with Foster Friess, who was an early supporter of President Trump. He\u2019s now one of six Republicans competing in a primary on Tuesday. But there is good reason to believe that Mr. Friess\u2019s campaign \u2014 aided by many of the politicians and groups he has donated to generously over the years \u2014 is now in a much-improved position to win the Republican nomination in his very Republican state, all but ensuring he would be elected governor in November.On Tuesday morning, the president weighed in with his own endorsement. Mr. Friess \u201cwill be a fantastic governor!\u201d he tweeted.In Wyoming, the state Mr. Trump won by a larger margin than any other, that may prove meaningful.It also doesn\u2019t hurt that he has been spending a lot of his own money on advertising and get-out-the vote operations, helping raise his profile in a state where many know him only as a transplant who moved Jackson, the state\u2019s billionaires\u2019 playground. Mr. Friess, who is 78 and has faced criticism that he is using his out-of-state Beltway connections to effectively buy an election, spoke with The New York Times about his campaign and whether he is a good fit for this moment when Republican voters are rejecting anyone they perceive as too cozy with the \u201celite.\u201dThe following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.Q. Hi, Mr. Friess. How are you?It wasn\u2019t I wanted to be the next governor of Wyoming. I just wanted to contribute to make Wyoming a wonderful place. We absolutely love this place, and now we have a half-billion-dollar deficit. And a lot of the elite here are treating my money, our money, the welders\u2019 money, the carpenters\u2019 money, nurses\u2019 money, truck drivers\u2019 money, as if it\u2019s Monopoly money.Almost all of my aunts and uncles lived to be over 100. So I\u2019m ready to go.You mentioned \u201cthe elite.\u201d Given your background and your success, don\u2019t you worry people will say, \u201cNo, he\u2019s one of the elite.\u201dMy mom and brother and I would go into the basement and butcher a couple dozen chickens every few months, put them in the freezer. And then a few days later get a couple bushels of corn. Because my mom said we can\u2019t afford any of that expensive store-bought food. So I\u2019ve always been the little guy.I really had a very special moment on the campaign trail where I went into a shop where there were eight welders. And they took a picture of me. And I had my white, white shirt on and next to me were the grimy, sooty guys who had been welding all day. And it just kind of clicked that these are the guys I\u2019d want on my unofficial governor\u2019s expense review board. Every time I see an expense I can impact, I\u2019m going to ask myself, \u201cWhat would my welder friends do?\u201dI think on something so complicated as tariffs, there\u2019s gonna be pluses and minuses. I think what his intent was to get us in a situation where we\u2019re not taken advantage of by other countries because of the mismatches.Whatever those inconsistencies are, as you go about correcting them, there\u2019s gonna be some glitches. Look what happened when we got rid of the monopoly of AT&T to switch to cellphones. You and I are talking on cellphones. Had we not deregulated AT&T, would we not be doing that? Sure, we have to be sensitive. And I think he\u2019s tried to accommodate that by giving subsidies in places. But bottom line, it\u2019s the whole thrust of he\u2019s going to renegotiate these deals.You\u2019ve got the endorsement of Donald Trump Jr. How useful is it to have the Trump name behind you? He ended the war on coal. Secondly, he said we\u2019re going to start saying Merry Christmas again. And Wyoming has a lot of people who are very enamored with the basic, fundamental underpinnings of our society and culture, which is the fact that Christian values are much of why our country is great. Here in Wyoming we are so, so proud of a president who puts America first.You mentioned that values, Christian values in particular, are important. Some people inside the Republican Party have criticized it for only talking to itself and said it needs to do a better job of being more inclusive. Do you think that\u2019s fair?I think that\u2019s about as deep a pile of hogwash as you can run into. The Republican Party has got Marco Rubio and (Ted) Cruz from a Cuban background. We\u2019ve got Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal from an Indian background. We\u2019ve got Tim Scott; the blacks. So as I walk around the country, I see more and more people gravitating to the common-sense love that Donald Trump has for America. And they love America, too.You think Donald Trump is a lover, not a hater or a fighter?Well, I think he hates evil. When people try to take people\u2019s freedom of expression and freedom of their religious beliefs, I\u2019m sure he hates that. But boy, there\u2019s no question that he loves America. Do you think though that there\u2019s any validity to the notion that some people in this country \u2014 black, brown, immigrant, gay, lesbian \u2014 may not feel welcome in Donald Trump\u2019s America?They may feel that. but then you should probably ask why? The unemployment for blacks is now the lowest it\u2019s ever been. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dick Cavett in the Digital Age", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "Stopping to smell the flowers with the last great intellectual talk-show host.Supported byRIDGEFIELD, Conn. \u2014 Everyone wants to ask Dick Cavett the same question, and it is a question that he never wants to answer: Of all today\u2019s talk-show hosts, who is the \u201cnext Dick Cavett\u201d?\u201cWell, that\u2019s an awkward subject matter for me, because I know all of them,\u201d Mr. Cavett, 81, said on a recent sunny Thursday afternoon at his sprawling country house in Connecticut. \u201cI\u2019m not addicted to talk shows. God knows, I\u2019ve spent enough time on them.\u201d But \u201cthe next Cavett\u201d? Is such a thing possible?If only.After Mr. Mailer accused Mr. Vidal of \u201cintellectual pollution\u201d and Mr. Cavett of being \u201csmaller intellectually\u201d than himself, Mr. Cavett suggested, in what was perhaps the original sick burn, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don\u2019t shine?\u201dIn fact, \u201c\u2018intellectual\u2019 was a word that always made me go up the wall, partly because I knew how the word is esteemed in the world of television,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, sipping seltzer with orange and munching grapes in his sunroom. \u201cI was called \u2018intellectual,\u2019 I guess, because I didn\u2019t know any better than to read the guests\u2019 books.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the strangest sensation to be getting the same comments that I got decades ago: \u2018I\u2019m addicted to your show,\u2019 or \u2018I watch it every night,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett said. \u201cI have virtually 3 percent memory of what I\u2019m seeing on the screen. People I would have sworn I never had on \u2014 there they are, for 90 minutes.\u201dAlthough his last talk show, on CNBC, ended in 1996, he has stayed in public view: making cameos on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d attending film premieres and doing guest appearances on late night.\u201cDarling?\u201d she said. \u201cThis ain\u2019t \u2018darling,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ali, who had been invited for an impromptu visit and given the master bedroom. \u201cThis is the three-time heavyweight champion of the world, and I\u2019m lying in your bed, watching your TV.\u201d (\u201cIt usually takes a beat,\u201d he said, smiling.)Ever ready to try new technology, he is thinking about starting a podcast. \u201cEverybody seems to be doing one,\u201d he said. He sent away for an Ancestry.com genetic test, and was surprised to find he had forebears in South Sudan. In 2010, he married Martha Rogers, a marketing consultant and author from Florida and a longtime friend, who found the new place in Connecticut.\u201cPart of it was to be nearer the city, nearer good medical stuff,\u201d Mr. Cavett said with resignation. But his old summer haunt also now harbors tattoos and nightclubs. \u201cMontauk is a \u2018sleepy little fishing village\u2019 no more,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I guess, fish are still extracted from the sea. But it\u2019s full of places for people who actually stand outside for God knows how long in order to get in and be deafened by music.\u201d He smiled tartly. \u201cDo I sound old?\u201dNot in the slightest, actually.Padding in bedroom slippers past a ballroom that seemed the next best thing to Mrs. Astor\u2019s, Mr. Cavett, always lean and diminutive, looked thinner now in his baggy khakis and plaid woodsman shirt, but still moved with the grace of a the high school gymnastics champion he once was, back in Lincoln, Neb. The house is still filled with boxes from the move, and the couple has yet to figure out exactly how many rooms it has. \u201cSomewhere between 25 and 50, I guess,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cWe found rooms in the basement about a month and a half ago that we didn\u2019t know were there.\u201d Back in the sunroom, an ornate Italian fountain was babbling just outside, as Mr. Cavett sat in a wicker rocking chair with a serene smile. As the light poured through three windows, beads of perspiration were beginning to form on his visitor\u2019s face. Who would not be daunted by the task of interviewing the consummate interviewer?\u201cJack Paar called me once,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, referring to the early \u201cTonight Show\u201d host who gave him his first gig. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, kid, when you do your show, don\u2019t do interviews.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Did I hear you right? Am I supposed to read to the guests?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, no, no, I mean \u201cinterviews,\u201d Q. and A. Make it a conversation.\u2019\u201d But in a late-night landscape rebuilt for clickable clips, unscripted moments seem increasingly rare. \u201cIf I were doing a show today,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, \u201cit would not include a nice actress who\u2019s so \u2018excited\u2019 about her new movie, and so \u2018excited\u2019 about her director, and so \u2018excited\u2019 about the costumes. \u2018Excited\u2019 is a word that could easily be stricken from the show business vocabulary.\u201dStephen Colbert, with whom Mr. Cavett has lunched at the Yale Club, is perhaps most adept, Mr. Cavett said, at puncturing the celebrity bubble, \u201cmost deliciously when the guest doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s puncturing it.\u201d (Who else? \u201cI\u2019m crazy about him, I just think he\u2019s really funny and good,\u201d Mr. Cavett said of Seth Meyers. \u201cBut I fell into the trap! I swore I wouldn\u2019t be talking about the late-night people.\u201d) Moreover, while today\u2019s hosts enjoy certain freedoms unimaginable to his generation \u2014 like Samantha Bee swearing on air (\u201cSamantha\u2019s very funny,\u201d he said) \u2014 Mr. Cavett had the leisurely airtime to explore ideas. He once did a full hour with Ingmar Bergman, the cerebral Swedish film director.It was clear from the first taping of \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d in 1968 that this would be a different kind of television entertainment. The guests included Mr. Vidal and Mr. Ali, blackballed from boxing because of his refusal to join the Army and fight in Vietnam. Naturally the topic came up. Mr. Cavett went over the executive\u2019s head at the network, insisting that his show wouldn\u2019t stoop to \u201cthis chicken-dribble,\u201d and the episode ran, but not as the premiere.Although Mr. Cavett\u2019s show was provocative, his persona, balancing Ivy League erudition with unflappable Midwestern solidity, has rarely ruffled anyone. Early in his career, Groucho Marx wrote him a letter saying, \u201c\u2018I think you hit a mother lode with the idea of a bumpkin coming east to Yale, and you should mine that for all you can,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I did.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not give the instructions,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, barely containing a smile. Mr. Rodale appeared along with the writer Pete Hamill that day. Mr. Rodale, whom Mr. Cavett recalls \u201clooking like Trotsky,\u201d was in high spirits during the interview. He brought a dish of asparagus soaked in urine for Mr. Cavett to sample (\u201cAnybody\u2019s we know?\u201d the host joked, before declining) and jauntily asserted that, with his healthy diet, he planned to live to 100. Shortly after that segment ended, however, Mr. Cavett, who was interviewing Mr. Hamill, heard an eerie gurgle, or was it a snore? He may or may not have said, \u201cAm I boring you?\u201d (Mr. Cavett said he has a DVD of the episode, but he has not watched the footage for years). \u201cThis looks bad,\u201d Mr. Hamill whispered.Glancing over at Mr. Rodale, Mr. Cavett saw that he was stiff in his chair, his back arched, and unconscious.\u201cThe scene shifts, instantly and unrealistically, to me standing at the edge of the stage saying, \u2018Is there a doctor in the audience?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett recalled. Audience? \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d Katharine Hepburn, he said, later explained to him that he knew \u201cIs there a doctor in the house\u201d would convulse the audience \u2014 though it was an appropriate ask, given that Mr. Rodale died on the set.\u201cPeople would always beat up on Johnny by saying, \u2018When Cavett\u2019s got Attorney General John Mitchell on, Johnny has Charo,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett said.While Mr. Cavett said he loathed Nixon\u2019s politics, he called him \u201ca brilliant, brilliant man\u201d and was cordial to him in person. Years after Watergate, he remembers seeing the former president and his younger daughter, Julie, seated at an outdoor restaurant in Montauk, so he grabbed a menu and, posing as a waiter, began to list the specials: Yorba Linda cream pie, Whittier College souffl\u00e9. Not his best material, Ms. Nixon told him. The current president is perhaps the only celebrity over the age of 70 that Mr. Cavett has never met, other than being beaten by him to shrimp in a benefit buffet line years ago. \u201cI think all people who get to president of the United States must have something wonderful about them,\u201d Mr. Cavett said in a mock-diplomatic tone. \u201cWith that,\u201d he added, \u201cCavett held a gun to his head and shot himself.\u201dAs afternoon light began to grow golden over the pond that glistened at the base of the hill behind his house, he was showing no hurry to rise from his wicker chair. \u201cHow do these people decide who\u2019s right in this?\u201d Mr. Cavett said. Friends like Mr. Allen and Marshall Brickman, the screenwriter, are still around, but the man who knew seemingly everyone finds it haunting that so many notables he was once close to \u201care no longer there.\u201dWatching his shows, Mr. Cavett said, \u201cthe odd sensation about it is there I am sitting with Lucille Ball or someone like that, and it is overlain by the thought \u2018One of us is dead.\u2019\u201d\u201cSo far,\u201d Mr. Cavett said wryly, \u201cit\u2019s always the other one.\u201d Because \u201cyou never think that will happen to you. That\u2019s something you hear old folks talk about.\u201d Despite the burdens of age, Mr. Cavett seems to be managing the bouts of depression that have dogged him since he was an undergraduate, when one day \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why I didn\u2019t want to get up, didn\u2019t want to go to class, and I couldn\u2019t read,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed that all the color went out of everything.\u201dYears later, after breaking out in an agitated sweat shortly after boarding a Concorde for London in 1980, he was taken for electroconvulsive therapy at Columbia-Presbyterian hospital, a treatment he called \u201cmiraculous.\u201dSuccess was no balm. \u201cOne thing you must never say to someone with depression is, \u2018What reason have you got to have depression?\u2019\u201d he said. That\u2019s like saying, \u2018what reason have you got to have asthma?\u2019\u201d And even his brand of urbane fame, once a thrill, has taken on a different quality. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t want to be recognized, and just enjoy a museum or an art gallery. And now, it\u2019s always, \u2018Can we take a selfie?\u2019\u201dMr. Cavett could tell his fans to stick their smartphones where the moon don\u2019t shine, of course. But he usually complies. \u201cOr I say, \u2018I thought you\u2019d never ask,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo make the people standing by laugh.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the relative President Nixon was sitting with at a restaurant in Montauk where Dick Cavett posed as a waiter. It was Mr. Nixon's younger daughter, Julie, not his wife, Pat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Familiar Rock Dreams in \u2018Gettin\u2019 the Band Back Together\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a Broadway show needs a preshow warm-up, what follows is likely half-baked.Like \u201cThe Full Monty,\u201d it concerns a bunch of middle-aged men trying to revive their flagging spirits by putting on a show. In this case, the men are former members of a garage band called Juggernaut, whose high school dreams of rock superstardom have dissolved into careerism and slackerdom.Mitch, once Juggernaut\u2019s lead singer, is a stockbroker so bad at his job that he gets fired on his 40th birthday. When he slinks back to New Jersey to live with his mother, he discovers that her home has been threatened with foreclosure by Tygen Billows, the once and forever frontman of Juggernaut\u2019s old nemesis, Mouthfeel. (How he came to own \u201c73 percent of the real estate\u201d in town is a mystery barely acknowledged.) To rescue the house and his self-esteem, Mitch agrees to a rematch of the epochal battle of the bands that Mouthfeel lost years earlier.The redemptive competition is a vigorous nod to \u201cSchool of Rock,\u201d and so is the sequence in which Mitch (Mitchell Jarvis) reassembles his players. They include Bart Vickers (Jay Klaitz), a shlubby math teacher with a secret crush; Sully Sullivan (Paul Whitty), a police officer with Broadway dreams; and Rummesh Patel (Manu Narayan), a nerd who wanted to be a pediatrician but was instead pressured into entering his father\u2019s dermatology practice \u2014 and, imminently, an arranged marriage.Because more clich\u00e9s can still be accommodated, a fifth member of Juggernaut must be recruited to replace one who has conveniently died in the interim; cue the audition sequence lifted from \u201cThe Full Monty.\u201d Naturally the new kid, Ricky Bling (Sawyer Nunes), saves the day at the reconstituted band\u2019s first gig. At an Orthodox Jewish wedding he delivers a \u201ccomical\u201d rap (including the immortal line \u201cmake a ruckus with your tuchis\u201d) closely patterned on the one in the \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201dImitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but in a musical it cancels the possibility of surprise. Here the obviousness of the characters and the outcome of the plot give the songs almost nothing to do, and here I\u2019m able to say that Mark Allen, who wrote the music and lyrics, is equal to the task. His tunes are so rote they\u2019re textureless, and his lyrics make about as much sense as random phrases sent through several passes of Google Translate.\u201cI took the safe road / to a life of stocks and bonds,\u201d Mitch sings. \u201cAnd bonded years / the same day reloaded / and hindsight crystal clear.\u201d So true.As such, the characters are barely even archetypes. Tygen (Brandon Williams) is a hair metal narcissist who can\u2019t finish a sentence; his entourage are vamps and half-wits. In general, the women are groupies, dim blondes or foxy single moms raising teenage angst-machines; the men of Juggernaut are heart-of-gold sad sacks. By the time several cast members \u201cbreak\u201d in a clearly scripted eruption of supposed hilarity, you begin to feel that the show, in its mania to please, has crossed a line from silly to clammy. You want its hands off you.With such icky material, a clean production like the one the director John Rando delivers can make matters worse. (It looks and moves like a real musical; why doesn\u2019t it feel like one?) The scenic design by Derek McLane and costume design by Emily Rebholz are suitably cartoony, but the lighting, by Ken Billington, goes too far into rock concert fantasy. Likewise, Chris Bailey\u2019s choreography leans heavily on mimed air-guitar licks and high-five exuberance.Maybe, in hindsight crystal clear, the title\u2019s annoying apostrophe should have been a clue to its ambitions. The show aims so low that all it achieves is a ruckus in the tuchis.Follow Jesse Green on Twitter: @JesseKGreen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Yacht Spotting", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationI know next to nothing about boats or sailing, and even as I approach my mid-30s, my mother still periodically reminds me that I\u2019m \u201cnot a very strong swimmer.\u201d None of that, however, has stopped me from occasionally daydreaming about a life at sea.So last summer, while eyeing ships from Rockaway Beach, I downloaded MarineTraffic, an application that maps the comings and goings of boats around the globe. (A dating app had recently led, bit by bit, to a promising relationship; maybe something similar would work for boat ownership.) MarineTraffic displays each ship as an arrow on a Google map, its color correlating with the type of vessel: blue for passenger boats, green for cargo ships, red for tankers and so on. Zoom in and tap on an arrow, and the app will provide more information about a particular boat, including pictures, voyage details and ports of call. Recently, from the comfort of my landlocked bathroom, I tapped on one red arrow and was able to watch the Torm Sofia, a 750-foot tanker flagged in Singapore, pass under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on its way to Philadelphia. If I had zoomed all the way back out, it would have been one of 160,000 arrows, a confetti-swirl of adventure and commerce spanning the seven seas.My favorite arrows are the magenta ones, which represent pleasure crafts. A vast majority of these are small boats with playful names like Fin N Tonic and Swim Lessons \u2014 the minnows of the category. More fun are the leviathans: superyachts. The past two decades have seen a sharp rise in the number of \u201chigh-net-worth individuals\u201d who, unsatisfied with mahogany speedboats or lowly non-super yachts, prefer 230-foot mini cruise ships outfitted like palaces, staffed with professional crews and often worth hundreds of millions of dollars.Obviously my fascination is less with the ships themselves and more with their owners. \u201cLet me tell you about the very rich,\u201d F.Scott Fitzgerald wrote at the beginning of \u201cThe Rich Boy.\u201d \u201cThey are different from you and me.\u201d Superyachts would have been a fine case study for him. All boats are totems of self-sufficiency; the superyacht might be a billionaire\u2019s way of convincing himself that he is alone in both his labor and his leisure. (The chief executive of Sears named his behemoth Fountainhead, after the Ayn Rand book.) Or maybe their purpose is more practical: an escape from traffic, pedestrians and every other daily reminder that extreme wealth floats on an ocean of human sweat.The truth is that it\u2019s hard not to be a little jealous. Each time I click on a superyacht and see a picture of a helicopter on its deck or a baby grand piano in its salon, I hold two competing ideas in my head. The first idea is: I want one. It is a natural inclination, I imagine, to long for a vessel with a squash court and a missile-defense system. The competing idea is: MarineTraffic is basically a tracking device for indefensibly wealthy capitalists, and it will probably come in handy when the revolution begins.Should the revolution happen to begin in New York City, the first salvo may well be heard at the base of the Statue of Liberty \u2014 where, last summer, a string of billionaires parked their superyachts for months, a huddled and possibly tired mass but definitely not a poor one. I\u2019ve used my phone to spy on bobbing castles in New York Harbor owned, at one point or another, by James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, J.K. Rowling and the son of the guy who founded the University of Phoenix. Rowling\u2019s looked every bit as enchanting as you would imagine.I, too, have access to a kind of superyacht: the $44 million, 310-foot Andrew J. Barberi, sometimes referred to as the Staten Island Ferry, which I recently took on a sunset cruise through the harbor. There, less than 100 yards from Lady Liberty, a relatively humble-looking superyacht sat motionless in the water. I whipped out MarineTraffic, and within seconds I had zoomed in on the 187-foot Minderella. I flipped through photos of it in Cyprus, France and Florida. I used Google to dig up pictures of its interiors and learn about its former owner, a successful mortgage lender. In mere minutes, MarineTraffic had helped me turn my nebulous resentment of the rich into a sharply tuned critique of a rich person\u2019s social-media presence.I think it\u2019s safe to assume that I will never own a craft like the Minderella. But standing on the ferry, watching the sun go down with my phone in one hand and a 24-ounce Bud Light in the other, I wondered how much different the view from the Minderella was from my view on the Andrew J. Barberi, and I couldn\u2019t help but think Fitzgerald was full of it.James D.

{"Headline": "Tech Industry Pursues a Federal Privacy Law, on Its Own Terms", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow top tech companies are going on the offensive.In recent months, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others have aggressively lobbied officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere to start outlining a federal privacy law, according to administration officials and the companies. The law would have a dual purpose, they said: It would overrule the California law and instead put into place a kinder set of rules that would give the companies wide leeway over how personal digital information was handled.\u201cWe are committed to being part of the process and a constructive part of the process,\u201d said Dean Garfield, president of a leading tech industry lobbying group, the Information Technology Industry Council, which is working on proposals for the federal law. \u201cThe best way is to work toward developing our own blueprint.\u201dThe efforts could set up a big fight with consumer and privacy groups, especially as companies like Facebook face scrutiny for mishandling users\u2019 personal data. Many of the internet companies depend on the collection and analysis of such data to help them target the online ads that generate the bulk of their revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the strategy here is to neuter California for something much weaker on the federal level,\u201d said Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cThe companies are afraid of California because it sets the bar for other states.\u201dIn the United States, tech companies\u2019 efforts to fight privacy regulations gained momentum in late spring, as it became clear that the California proposal might become law.At a board meeting for the Information Technology Industry Council in May, Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top lobbyist, warned that an early proposal for privacy in California posed a threat to the industry and that the trade group needed to make the issue of privacy a priority, according to two people briefed on the meeting, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Until that moment, there had been a split in the tech industry about privacy rules. Companies like IBM and Salesforce, which sell data storage and software to other businesses, were more willing to accept consumer privacy laws, IBM and other members of the Information Technology Industry Council said. Social media and other companies that relied primarily on advertising for revenue, like Facebook and Google, were adamant that the industry should fight all rules.But at that meeting, it became clear that Facebook and Google had softened their resistance to a federal privacy law, as long as they were deeply involved in writing the rules.\u201cThere has been a complete shift on privacy,\u201d said Chris Padilla, vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. \u201cThere is now broad recognition that companies that were resistant to privacy rules can no longer just say no.\u201dGoogle said it seemed inevitable that privacy rules would come to the United States.\u201cThere are renewed efforts to define the privacy legislative frameworks of the future, and we look forward to working with policymakers around the world to move the process forward,\u201d Google said in a statement.Many of the companies also recognized that it was a good time to press ahead with a federal privacy law since Trump administration officials have expressed openness to a business-friendly approach to such rules.David Redl, the head of a division of the Commerce Department that is leading the agency\u2019s privacy efforts, said in a July speech that the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to prosperity will be our guide.\u201d\u201cWe also know that industry is looking to the administration to demonstrate leadership on this issue,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re rightfully concerned about the potential for a fractured and stifling regulatory landscape.\u201dLindsay Walters, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that the administration aimed to work with Congress on legislation \u201cthat is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity.\u201dThe administration said it intended to have an outline of potential rules by the end of the year. But the timeline could easily be pushed back, as numerous agencies may be involved, including the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology.In a sign of the latitude that a federal privacy law might give tech companies, at least three trade groups \u2014 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association, and the Information Technology Industry Council \u2014 are planning to push for voluntary standards instead of legal mandates that carry steep penalties for violations.In exchange for volunteering to follow certain guidelines on what kind of information they collect and share about users, the groups said, they would insist that the federal statute nullify California\u2019s rules.That position has outraged privacy advocates.\u201cThe idea that the companies that violated our privacy for more than a decade will suddenly have a self-regulatory blueprint is ridiculous,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president of Common Sense Media, a privacy and children\u2019s advocacy group that supported the California law.Privacy advocates said tech companies were pushing to undercut the California privacy law in other ways. Although passed in June, the law stipulates that lawmakers can pursue technical changes in its language until the end of this month. It is scheduled to take effect in January 2020.Any changes are supposed to be minor, but tech lobbyists and privacy groups continue to swarm the offices of the legislators behind the law, their aides said. Consumer privacy groups, which have been pushing lawmakers to leave the law virtually untouched, fear the companies are trying to soften protections.This month, the California Chamber of Commerce and other business and tech groups sent 19 pages of edits to the law to State Senator Bill Dodd, one of the bill\u2019s authors. They criticized language, such as the law\u2019s definition of personal information, that they said would apply to too many people or websites.In the letter, the groups said California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, would need more time to figure out how to enforce the rules and asked to delay enactment for one year. The business groups argued that the law could hurt a typical consumer.\u201cUnless the law is clarified, he or she might also inadvertently be deprived of special discounts and promotions,\u201d the letter said.In a rebuttal letter to Mr. Dodd, several consumer privacy groups called for him and other California lawmakers to keep any changes to a minimum, saying the tech industry\u2019s moves were \u201cexcessive in nature.\u201d\u201cThe sky is not falling, as industry suggests,\u201d the groups said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the trade group that is among those pushing for voluntary standards, instead of legal mandates, when it comes to the privacy of personal information online. It is the Information Technology Industry Council, not the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.Advertisement"}

She was 14 when we took our first 200-mile backpacking trip on the Pacific Crest Trail, the great ribbon running through mountains and deserts from Mexico to Canada. It was just the two of us and a few million mosquitoes. One great thing about hiking with my daughter is that mosquitoes love to dine on her, thus neglecting me. On that trip, even DEET repellent and a head net couldn\u2019t fend them off:\u201cDad! I just counted! I have 49 mosquito bites on my forehead alone!\u201dShe was an old hand at outdoor masochism, for we had been going on family backpacking trips since before she turned 2. First, she and I resolved to complete the Pacific Crest Trail in my home state, Oregon. Then we decided to spend a few years hiking across Washington State. After that, how could we not complete California as well?Each day on the trail, we rose with the sun, carried all our possessions on our shoulders, filled our water bottles from creeks, rested in meadows dazzling with alpine wildflowers, bathed in rivers, and at dusk found a flat spot on which to unroll our sleeping bags and fall asleep while counting shooting stars.So if you\u2019ll indulge me once more, a few lessons from the wilderness:President Trump\u2019s turmoil isn\u2019t the only important thing in the world; another is family.The upshot is that today every American inherits a stunning patrimony, a piece of some of the most beautiful terrain in the world. You may not be able to afford a weekend house, but you\u2019re already a shared landlord of spectacular wilderness. For a day at a time, my daughter and I \u201cowned\u201d dazzling camping spots that even Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett can never buy. On our public lands, no one can pull rank on you \u2014 except a bear.In contrast, the wilderness is almost always too hot or too cold. It is vast and unbending, reminding us that we are not the lords of the universe, but atoms in the firmament. We are put in our place.Our most memorable segments of the Pacific Crest Trail were the ones that tormented us. There were exhausting 25- and 30-mile days through the searing deserts of Southern California, and cold rains and icy nights in Washington.Nature disciplined us, and sometimes frightened us, by making us ford high rivers, cross steep snow banks \u2014 or by getting us lost. Early one hiking season in the mountains of Oregon, when the trail disappeared beneath several feet of snow that had refused to melt, we became utterly lost for a couple of days, so I was thrilled to eventually come across footprints in the snow: We had stumbled on a trail! But after a while, my daughter noticed that the footprints had claws.\u201cDad,\u201d she said, \u201cI think that\u2019s a bear you\u2019re following.\u201dI\u2019m on a book leave this summer, and also glued to the news from Washington.

How much is your rent?\u201d a friend once asked. He immediately put his hand over his mouth.\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s so rude.\u201d Many of us grow up learning that money is one of a few topics \u2014 like politics, sex and religion \u2014 that you should avoid in polite company. You don\u2019t brag about your net worth. You don\u2019t share your salary with colleagues. You try not to ask your friends about their rent, even if it helps put your budget in perspective.We\u2019re discouraged from talking about money at every turn, but if you want to fix your financial situation, talking about it is necessary.Even setting aside that social taboo of discussing money, there are practical hurdles in your way to getting better at money: Learning about money is intimidating, and there\u2019s no structural system in place to teach us. Further still, we look at poor money skills as something to be ashamed and embarrassed of, which can keep us from being honest about money and seeking out the right kind of help. \u201cWe all know physical health numbers, like BMI, weight and clothing sizes, so we can assess where we fall on that spectrum,\u201d Ms. McLay said. \u201cBecause of a lack of agreed upon financial metrics, people feel fear or shame around what their finances look like.\u201d \u201cIf your finances cause you stress and anxiety, it\u2019s natural to want to keep this to yourself because you might feel embarrassed or ashamed about the decisions you made,\u201d she said.Ms. Mclay added: \u201cWhen you ignore your financial situation, minor problems happening on a regular basis build up to very substantial challenges.\u201dIt\u2019s time we all change the story and open up about money.As wages continue to stagnate and the income gap continues to widen, talking and learning about money is crucial for change.O.K., so you\u2019re convinced: Talking about money is important. So how do we begin?\u201cWhile it may be convenient to discuss whether you\u2019re spending too much on travel while you\u2019re in the car on a road trip, it can lead to a much healthier conversation if you sit down with a list of topics to discuss,\u201d she said. Pick a regular time to hold money meetings and talk about any financial goals, setbacks and habits. This will help you avoid fighting about those topics in the future. \u201cThe more we talk about our situations and either accept them or work on improving them, the healthier our relationship with money will get,\u201d she said.This also creates the possibility for learning. Maybe your friend tells you how she paid off her loan early, for example. Or maybe she just starts suggesting cheaper hangout alternatives. Either way, you invite better financial habits and solutions when you break the money taboo.\u201cSet three to four financial goals, like saving $5,000 or making $45,000 a year in a job, and start working toward those goals,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more financial goals you achieve, the more comfortable you\u2019ll get with your financial situation.\u201d\u201cThere are very few financial problems that improve by ignoring or neglecting them,\u201d Ms. Bailie added. \u201cWhen you begin to understand the value of being open and transparent about money, it starts to feel like an imperative.\u201d Illustration by Benedikt RugarAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lost in the Storm", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "Houston thought it was prepared for a major hurricane like Harvey. But as the flooding overwhelmed the city\u2019s emergency systems, families like the Daileys found out too late that they were on their own.Wayne, who as a child in Galveston County spent hours watching the cloudscapes drift over the Gulf of Mexico, kept multiple weather apps on his phone and had already been tracking the storm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get us,\u201d he told his sister. But coastal storms were a part of life that he had prepared for, and they did not concern him.He was more worried about his wife. Casey Dills-Dailey was undergoing surgery to remove the adrenal gland above her left kidney. The surgeon predicted an uncomplicated operation, conducted through tiny incisions. Still, Wayne wondered, would the surgery do what it was supposed to do? Was the doctor as skilled as he said he was? It was hard to grasp that the life of his 38-year-old wife could be endangered.The operation came after years of mysterious symptoms that began when Casey was in her early 30s. She had hot flashes and eventually stopped menstruating. Her face became chubby, and her full-but-shapely figure ballooned to nearly 250 pounds, fattening in odd places, including the space between her shoulders. Ugly red marks appeared on her abdomen. The illness left her in pain, nauseated and unable to stand for more than 15 minutes at a time.Casey was referred to Dr. Curtis Wray, a surgical oncologist, to remove what doctors suspected was a noncancerous tumor that was releasing extra cortisol, causing her Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The diagnosis helped explain many of her problems, from high blood pressure to erratic moods. Casey could not wait to look and feel like herself again.That morning, a resident surgeon said Casey should expect to stay three or four days for recovery. He described the operation\u2019s potential complications \u2014 bleeding, infection, damage to other organs \u2014 which frightened Wayne. Dr. Wray, the senior surgeon, came in and reassured them. His team had performed the operation many times. Surprising Wayne and Casey, he predicted she would be home in 24 hours.Wayne asked to see the tumor when it was out. After surgery, Dr. Wray called him from the waiting area and showed him an image on his phone. The tumor was the width of Wayne\u2019s two thumbs put together. Most important, to the surgeon it appeared benign.After Casey was settled in her hospital room, Wayne drove home to spend the night with their two sons. The family lived outside the Houston city limits in northeast Harris County, in a trailer park where homes stretched along fancifully named streets \u2014 Drifting Winds, Island Song and theirs, Enchanted Path Drive.The Daileys were what Wayne called a \u201csimple, simple family\u201d: Casey, a housewife who home-schooled their oldest son, Luke, 14; their youngest son, Ronnie, 10; and Wayne himself, a \u201cmiddle-class worker, a lower-class worker,\u201d without a steady job. For more than a dozen years, he had operated heavy machinery at oil refineries, clawing trenches into the earth for foundations and pipe racks. The finances were in his wife\u2019s name in case he did not make it home. He had survived explosions, survived co-workers. Lately, he had been working for a friend\u2019s tree-service firm. Casey made their uncertain income stretch, scrapping junk metal and advertising homemade quilts for $50 on social media; it took her about a week to make each one.Their trailer-park community had its drugs and gangs and violence, the evening cracks of gunfire and whining sirens. But four generations of family members and friends filled the homes on their block. Casey\u2019s parents lived across the street, next to her aunt. Three homes over, there was Casey\u2019s grandma\u2019s bowling partner. Next door was Erasmo Villa, from Mexico, who with his brother-in-law had drywalled the Daileys\u2019 home free of charge just because they were neighbors, and neighbors help each other. Casey cultivated roses that bloomed from pale pink to vivid red, growing impossibly high.Casey grew up in the trailer. Her mother had many miscarriages before giving birth to her only child, and Casey quickly took a place at the center of the family, clinging like a bear to her grandpa\u2019s neck. As an adult, she cared for him and other sick relatives until they died.Having little money did not mean the Daileys could not be generous. Casey joined the homeowners\u2019 board, chaperoned school field trips and led a Cub Scout troop with Wayne because nobody else volunteered. An evicted family with three children had slept on pallets on the Daileys\u2019 living-room floor. Wayne and Casey served as temporary guardians for one of Ronnie\u2019s friends so he wouldn\u2019t be sent to a foster home during his parents\u2019 rough patch. Their Wi-Fi password evinced their Christian faith: 12loveGod.That night after Casey\u2019s operation, Wayne picked up the boys from their grandparents\u2019 trailer. He ate dinner, put the television on in the bedroom and fell asleep. At around 9:30 the next morning, Casey called him from the hospital. \u201cCome up here,\u201d she said. They were discharging her.Tropical Storm Harvey was rapidly strengthening in the gulf, and Wayne stopped to pick up necessities. When he walked into the imposing hospital in the early afternoon, though, nothing looked amiss. In truth, doctors at Casey\u2019s hospital, Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, were preparing for a possible hurricane, sending stable patients home. During Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, Memorial Hermann, with 540 patients inside, lost power and was evacuated, as medical workers manually squeezed air into the lungs of patients whose mechanical respirators had failed. Since then, billions of dollars had been spent to protect the hospital and other facilities at the Texas Medical Center campus.A surgical intern just weeks out of medical school examined Casey. He prepared discharge instructions and wrote two prescriptions: one for a stool softener and the other for 40 tablets of Tramadol, an opioid painkiller. He did not prescribe steroids, which would typically be needed when a steroid-producing tumor like Casey\u2019s was removed.A nurse went over the bright-orange folder of information, explaining how to keep the incisions clean to avoid infection and emphasizing the importance of being as active as possible to help prevent a potentially deadly blood clot from forming in her legs or lungs. Casey was to follow up with Dr. Wray in a week.She arrived home that afternoon in pain and ready for a nap. Casey\u2019s aunt from across the street texted to offer help and asked whether Casey and Wayne were ready for the hurricane. Casey responded that they would fill containers with water, hunker down and keep an eye on their outdoor dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s all we can do.\u201dLate the next night, Friday, Harvey barreled into the Texas coastline northeast of Corpus Christi as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest to strike the United States in over a decade. It stalled, losing strength but absorbing more water from the gulf, before pinwheeling into Houston.\nOn Saturday night, before 10 p.m., Wayne opened his screen door, stepping barefoot onto the stoop to look at what was coming. Wind chimes tinkled, and the roof dripped a steady beat of rain between crashes of thunder. Branches tipped with small red flowers swayed dizzily above the door. A shock of lightning brought the trees into sudden light. Less than an hour later, he opened the door again to a hiss of sheeting rain that obscured the rumble of thunder. Behind him in the house, an emergency alert blared from one of their mobile phones, a flash-flood warning: \u201cImminent Threat \u2014 Severe.\u201dHarris County\u2019s top elected official, Judge Ed Emmett, also decided that there should be no mass evacuations. With a population of more than 4.5 million \u2014 about equal numbers outside and inside Houston \u2014 Harris County\u2019s roughly 1,700 square miles held more people than half of the states in the country.Texas law requires every jurisdiction to have plans for managing emergencies, and as the lead county official, Judge Emmett served as its emergency-management chief. On Sunday, he was based at the county\u2019s emergency operations center, in the Houston TranStar building, which houses Harris County\u2019s lead agency for disasters, the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.As the storm moved into the area, the activity in the vast headquarters picked up. Personnel from various agencies gathered at rows of desks, their partitions marked by edge-lit glass signs with the office logo glowing an eerie white. Just below the room\u2019s high ceilings, giant video screens played the news and tracked weather.Webbed with rivers, creeks, lakes, bayous and reservoirs, Harris County had experienced a notable increase in severe, storm-induced floods in recent years. Storms in 2015 and 2016 killed more than a dozen people and swamped parts of the \u201c500 year\u201d floodplain \u2014 an area that according to previous models had only a 0.2 percent chance of flooding in a given year. Climate experts predicted that the trend would continue as the atmosphere warmed and extreme weather rose in frequency and intensity. The built environment worsened the problem: Concrete covered ever more miles of rainfall-absorbing prairieland, and sewers and ditches were designed by the local government to overflow into the streets, which were considered part of the drainage system. This helped protect homes and businesses from flooding, but it could trap their inhabitants when streets became canals.A dizzying array of agencies participated in emergency response, coordinating their activities using the National Incident Management System, a protocol that arose from efforts to jointly battle wildfires in the 1970s and that was adopted nationally after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The concept was simple: Disaster response, and the responsibility for it, started at the point of impact and moved out and up as resources were overwhelmed. Individual and local-community preparedness \u2014 stocking food, water and medicines and looking out for neighbors \u2014 was the initial safeguard. The 911 system was the next, connecting people with police, fire, rescue and emergency medical assistance. The circle expanded from there. If one of the county\u2019s 54 independent fire departments, which were responsible for water rescues, found itself overwhelmed, it could reach out to the fire desk at the county emergency operations center in the TranStar building, which could request assistance from other local fire stations or from representatives of the Coast Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency sitting nearby. Health and medical services had a separate hierarchy of support agencies.When Harvey reached Harris County, beginning to release what became a once-in-a-thousand-years rainfall of more than 1 trillion gallons, officials were confident they could prioritize people in life-threatening situations. But as the water rose on Sunday, it overwhelmed those preparations. Many local fire departments lacked boats or trucks that could handle flooded streets, and those that had them could no longer share. A Houston police sergeant drowned in his vehicle trying to drive to work. The flooding was so widespread that it impeded the arrival of additional state and federal teams.At TranStar, officials felt agitated and helpless. They were getting personal emails appealing for rescues, sometimes with photographs of elderly relatives attached. There was no time to wait. \u201cI got a crazy idea,\u201d Rodney Reed, the assistant chief for operational support for the Harris County Fire Marshal\u2019s Office, said as Judge Emmett walked into a snack-filled room. \u201cI need you to support it.\u201d Reed argued that they should invite unaffiliated volunteers into the rescue effort. According to conventional wisdom, they get in the way and often end up needing help themselves. But Reed assured the judge that taking the step would save lives.And so at noon on Sunday, Judge Emmett stepped to a lectern before news cameras to make an unusual statement. A large screen looped colorful radar images of the storm behind him. \u201cThose of you who have boats and high-water vehicles that can be used in neighborhoods to help move people out of harm\u2019s way, we need your help,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment assets are fully utilized.\u201dJudge Emmett asked the public to call the emergency operations center if they were willing to volunteer. County officials wrote each offer on a sticky note or scrap of paper, affixing it to a wall with blue tape in neat rows according to geographic quadrants, ready to be pulled whenever a fire department called requesting boats.The perhaps-even-greater challenge was connecting the volunteers to the people who needed rescuing. Callers had trouble getting through to 911 as the volume of calls for assistance more than quadrupled. Judge Emmett asked people to stop calling unless they faced immediate danger. \u201cThe phone lines are backed up,\u201d he said.Like most other emergency agencies, the Coast Guard, which controlled many boats and helicopters, had not prepared to respond to distress signals posted on the public\u2019s technologies of choice: Facebook and Twitter. Instead, it used social media to disseminate five emergency numbers for the local Coast Guard station, setting up a separate, parallel dispatch system for residents in need of rescue. In a sign of the ad hoc nature of the triage system, personnel tracked urgent medical cases with a pencil-and-paper checklist. In its postings, the Coast Guard instructed people to mark their roofs or \u201cwave sheets, towels etc.\u201d to get rescuers\u2019 attention.Identifying who needed help the most was the crucial first step to responders saving lives. During the county\u2019s news conference, authorities sent a wireless emergency alert to cellular customers, including Wayne and Casey: \u201cCall 911 for LIFE THREATENING emergencies ONLY. STAY PUT IF SAFE.\u201d\nIf there had ever been a time to evacuate, this was not it. That morning, a man named Samuel Saldivar had driven into the neighborhood about a mile south of the Daileys\u2019 home to rescue his parents, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He loaded them and four of their great-grandchildren into a large white van and crossed a small bridge over Greens Bayou after sunrise. The bayou had often swamped bridges along its path, and officials had recognized the need to improve it.As Saldivar came off the bridge, the rising waters swept the van from the road. Saldivar was able to escape, and clung to a tree for the better part of an hour. The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, had no boats. The sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived with one and, with a local firefighter, rescued Saldivar. But the van, with everyone else still trapped inside, was now submerged. The rescuers\u2019 boat, not fit for swift water, could not reach it. Saldivar\u2019s parents, two great-nieces and two great-nephews all drowned.Throughout Sunday, brown water continued to fill Enchanted Path Drive. By the afternoon, the floodwaters reached Wayne and Casey\u2019s garden. Luke asked his father if the flooding was going to kill the grass, or the rose bush, or the plants in the yard. Wayne said no. He also cut off the boy\u2019s restless entreaties to wade across the street, where Casey\u2019s aunt\u2019s car now stood parked in water to the top of its wheels. \u201cBe smart,\u201d Wayne snapped. \u201cNot like these people over here.\u201d He gestured at neighbors tracing a milky brown path toward the main road, submerged to their upper thighs and carrying umbrellas. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in that water,\u201d Wayne said.As Wayne monitored the flooding, he also kept an eye on Casey. Her pain had quickly become far more severe than anticipated. The Tramadol was not helping, and a months-old injury to her hip and leg was making it even more difficult to get up and move. She grew queasy shortly after Wayne removed an anti-nausea medication patch from behind her ear as instructed, three days after it had been applied at the hospital. Having coped with bouts of vomiting for years, Casey had the drug Zofran at the ready, and it seemed to help for a few hours at a time.\nOn Sunday her temperature was slightly higher than normal. Wayne\u2019s father, a former volunteer fire chief with some training in emergency care, explained by phone how to check her incisions for signs of infection like redness, swelling or pus. They looked fine. When she woke up, she even took a few phone calls, including robocalls with updates from Luke\u2019s home-school academy and Ronnie\u2019s elementary school.As the sky deepened into gray on Sunday evening, Wayne padded to the door in his bare feet and jeans. Rain dripped from the trees, drawing expanding circles in the dim water that now covered their lowest step. A man in a blue baseball cap, his shirt rolled up below his chest, waved as he waded by, water above his buttocks, pushing a small, round raft with a woman inside it. \u201cYou ought to go out,\u201d he warned. Wayne chortled, unconvinced. \u201cY\u2019all be careful,\u201d he responded.On Facebook Live, Wayne repeated the message officials were spreading. \u201cIf you\u2019re safe where you\u2019re at, stay where you\u2019re at. If you have to get out, get out.\u201d He reassured his anxious mother on Facebook. \u201cWe are safe.\u201dAs the waters rose Sunday night, Wayne stayed up with Casey, who could not stop vomiting. \u201cSomething ain\u2019t right,\u201d Casey said. On Monday morning, it continued raining, and the muddy water rose to their top step, just below the front door. Casey had finally fallen asleep, and when Wayne checked on her, he found it hard to keep her awake.\nAround 1:30 in the afternoon, Wayne called 911. In Harris County, 911 calls were routed based on geography to one of several primary \u201cpublic safety answering points,\u201d or PSAPs \u2014 independently managed call centers that were most typically housed in local police departments. He reached the answering point for calls outside Houston in unincorporated Harris County, at the Harris County sheriff\u2019s office. He told the woman who answered that Casey had recently had surgery. \u201cShe has been very sick. She\u2019s been vomiting for the past day and a half approximately, and she\u2019s in severe pain. And I don\u2019t want her to get in this water in her sutures. She needs to get airlifted to a hospital.\u201dThis was not a police emergency, so the communications officer transferred the call to a secondary PSAP, which would determine the next steps. The phone rang 10 times over the course of about a minute, much longer than usual. Another woman picked up, speaking quickly. \u201cFire and ambulance.\u201d After giving his address and confirming that he needed a water rescue, Wayne said that Casey had recently had surgery and had been vomiting for a day and a half. The second call-taker interrupted him. There were over a thousand calls for help, she said. \u201cAs soon as the fire department is able to make it to this area then you will be evacuated.\u201dThe job of a 911 call-taker is emotionally and technically demanding at the best of times. During Harvey, the stress was extraordinary. The overloaded call center where the second call-taker was working, Harris County Emergency Corps, served roughly a dozen independent fire and ambulance services in the county. The corps had doubled its staff to eight from four for the storm, but call volume had more than tripled. Every one of the six 911 lines and additional non-emergency lines was ringing nonstop. Personnel were working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in the building and a nearby hotel. Someone had posted the center\u2019s direct-dial phone numbers on Twitter, and it was now receiving calls from other parts of the county, requiring phone transfers that took up to 20 minutes.The center did something it had never done before. Its leaders walked to the call floor and told call-takers to bypass the formal triaging system that it normally used to assign emergency-priority codes to callers. Instead, they would log the call for water rescue and read a script saying that there were many calls and that the fire department would respond as soon as it could.The sheriff\u2019s communications division, which handled primary calls, also faced severe challenges. The basement had filled up with water from Buffalo Bayou, causing power failures. Its staff moved to a regional 911 training center, the only available backup location with a connection to the physical 911 network. After the move, key technical functions stopped working, including, for a time, the internal dispatch system.As Harris County flooded, the total volume of calls to one 911 call center shot up, but the number of calls that were assigned medical priority codes (in red) increased only slightly \u2014 some medical emergencies were coded as flood rescue calls after the center suspended normal questioning protocols.\n      Source: Harris County Emergency Corps\n      According to data provided by the sheriff\u2019s office, the proportion of 911 calls answered within an industry target of 10 seconds plummeted. On Sunday, more than 40 percent of 911 callers to the sheriff\u2019s office hung up during the long waits, according to internal email records from the regional 911 network provider. That further increased the load on communicators, who typically had to follow up on the so-called \u201cabandoned\u201d calls. In Houston the problem was even worse \u2014 of the nearly 40,000 calls, more than half ended in hang-ups.Oversight of 911 is fragmented among states and localities, systems are often poorly funded and there is no national mandate to upgrade. By the time it is widely adopted, experts say, next-generation 911 technology itself may well be obsolete. Harris County had been in the process of updating its technology for 10 years when Harvey struck, but the new system would not be operational until February of this year.Wayne knew none of that, though. Nor did he know that Casey had not been tagged as an urgent medical case.That evening, as it continued to rain, Wayne heard an airboat passing by his house and tried to flag down its driver, who had earmuffs on to protect against the earsplitting engine noise. The man slowed down when he saw Wayne in the doorway standing next to Ronnie. \u201cMy wife and my kids and I need out!\u201d Wayne shouted to the man. \u201cMy wife needs help. She has a medical condition.\u201d The man said he was on the way to pick someone up and would get Wayne and his family on the way back. \u201cJust stay right there.\u201dCasey was in the bedroom with the television on, lethargic and in pain. Wayne gave her the news, and she nodded. Wayne stuffed clothing, dry towels and rain jackets into bags. He let family members know that an airboat was coming for them, and his sister posted the news on his Facebook page. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t swim out,\u201d one of his oldest friends wrote. Wayne told everyone he loved them. \u201cWe are going to be O.K.,\u201d he wrote around 7 p.m., and then turned on Facebook Live. \u201cAs we wait for the airboat to come back for us, I\u2019ll just show y\u2019all what it looks like,\u201d he said.It was raining, but the water level had stopped rising. \u201cAirboats will be here any time now,\u201d Wayne said. A droning sound in the background grew louder. \u201cMatter of fact, I think I hear them now, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and end the video,\u201d he said.Wayne leaned out his front door to look at the main road, which was five trailer lots away at the end of their street. The airboat came into view. But instead of turning onto Enchanted Path Drive to pick them up, it continued on to wherever it was heading.Wayne felt a wave of panic, but he tried to keep his composure for his kids. He wanted them to feel sure that their father would get them out of there. Minutes later, their home lost power. The television news switched off along with the Wi-Fi, which the boys were using to watch videos. It would be night soon, and Wayne could see that the homes of their remaining neighbors were also dark.Wayne turned off Casey\u2019s fully powered cellphone to conserve its battery. His own phone could last nearly a day, and he had an external battery to extend it for another. Late into the night, he called and texted every number that his family and friends sent him to reach volunteer rescuers. He placed calls to a number for the Cajun Navy, an ad hoc volunteer group. He called strangers and took calls from strangers. By midnight, he believed Casey had been added to about a half-dozen rescue lists.But most rescue operations, both official and unofficial, had shut down for the night for safety. Casey was still running a slight fever. Wayne checked her incisions again. They still looked good. He tried to reassure worried friends and family members. \u201cIt will be tomorrow,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cI have Casey stable for now. I have everyone sleeping. I am going to get some rest. I only had about an hour of sleep in about 28 hours. Love you guys and will keep y\u2019all posted.\u201dShe told Wayne that many neighborhoods in his area had to be evacuated. \u201cAs of right now they haven\u2019t resumed water-rescue operations,\u201d she said. The fire department would do so at daylight. She had Wayne\u2019s phone number for them, and they would get to him as soon as possible. \u201cO.K., thank you very much,\u201d Wayne said. But the 911 center did not assign any personnel or resources, and the call-taker once again categorized the incident as a water-rescue call to be sent to the local fire department, not a medical emergency for the E.M.S. agency.The local fire service, Sheldon Community Fire and Rescue, was in charge of rescues. But Sheldon owned no boats or high-water vehicles and it had flooded out one of its fire engines. The day before the flooding began, Sheldon personnel responded to five incidents, a typical number. On Sunday the number of calls shot up to more than 170, nearly all of them requests for water rescues as opposed to reports of fires; roughly 40 more calls came in for addresses already in the system \u2014 people who had called for help and then called back after they did not get assistance. The fire desk at the emergency operations center had little it could offer. It gave the cellphone numbers of Sheldon Fire chiefs to civilian volunteers with boats, which was helpful but also added to the logistical burden.On Sunday night, Sheldon Fire and Rescue leaders called the 911 center to say that the service lacked resources to conduct water rescues, especially at night. Instead of dispatching calls one by one to the handful of Sheldon Fire and Rescue crews, the 911 center put those calls into a holding pattern. Fire captains could access the ever-lengthening list on a mobile data terminal in their cars. On Monday, new calls for rescue in the district arrived on average every minute to two minutes. By the time of Wayne\u2019s 911 call that day, Sheldon Fire had already received more than 500 water-rescue calls, not counting duplicates.The triage method was haphazard. Sometimes if a call sounded urgent, a 911 dispatcher would text or phone District Capt. Isaac Pinson, saying, \u201cHey, man, can you get to this?\u201d Pinson said later that whenever possible, he read the dispatchers\u2019 notes and, by radio from his Tahoe truck, prioritized sending fire crews on fishermen\u2019s boats to homes where lives were in danger, or to areas with the greatest concentration of flooding. Sometimes a personal contact helped identify someone needing rescue. One crew went to get family members of a Texas state trooper out of their house.The chaos created considerable wasted effort. Captain Pinson sent personnel to rescue people who became stuck on flooded streets after wading out of homes where they could have stayed safely. His crews lost precious time responding to false alarms, including a report that the roof of the local high school had collapsed with hundreds of people sheltering inside. For the most part, Captain Pinson concluded, people clamoring to get out of their homes were just scared, not at risk of drowning or dying of a medical emergency.\nAt daylight on Tuesday, Wayne saw that the water level outside had dropped slightly. He could barely rouse Casey. He tried calling the Texas Department of Public Safety and, failing to reach someone who could help, called 911 a third time. \u201cI need a medical-emergency rescue,\u201d he said with an edge to his voice he did not have before.The call-taker at the sheriff\u2019s office asked him if it was because of flooding. Wayne said no and explained about Casey\u2019s surgery and the last two days of vomiting. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of unresponsive,\u201d he said. When the call-taker said she would get an ambulance there, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way\u201d and explained that five or six feet of water still lay outside. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for two days to get her out of here,\u201d Wayne said.Emergency workers later reported that 911 dispatchers in Harris County had limited knowledge of impassable roads, including routes to local hospitals. Although dispatchers were kept abreast of major road closures, some could not use their terminals to access potentially useful websites like the state transportation department\u2019s web page showing blocked roads, or even Google Maps. A next-generation 911 system that incorporates layers of multimedia information might help solve that problem in future disasters, perhaps even incorporating information from drone overflights.The communications officer at the sheriff\u2019s office told Wayne that she would get an ambulance to him and instructed him to let the paramedic know the situation when the call transferred.A Harris County Emergency Corps call-taker picked up the call and asked for Wayne\u2019s address. \u201cO.K., we do already have your two calls for service,\u201d the woman said.\u201cMy wife, she\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Wayne said. \u201cShe\u2019s unresponsive, she\u2019s real lethargic, she\u2019s been vomiting. She\u2019s in a lot of pain. And I really, really, really, really need to get her to a hospital A.S.A.P.\u201dShe told Wayne brusquely that there were thousands of calls for service in the area. \u201cThe fire department is working as quickly and safely as they can to get everybody out, O.K.? It\u2019s just going to take some time for them to be able to get everybody, O.K.?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t O.K., but Wayne said, \u201cO.K.\u201dNineteen seconds into the call, the communicator closed the incident as a \u201cduplicate\u201d without assigning any responders, since Wayne\u2019s previous call was already in the queue.Wayne called family members, and his mother commented on Facebook at 10 a.m., asking for help from anyone who could provide it. \u201cCasey\u2019s condition has worsened. She is feverish and unresponsive.\u201d\nWayne tried 911 again. This time, his call ended up in Houston. About one call in seven was misrouted by cell towers during the storm, a higher than normal rate, according to data obtained through a public-records request from the regional 911 network, Greater Harris County 911. Communicators had to stay on the line trying to transfer these misrouted calls, adding to the gridlock.The Houston call-taker rerouted Wayne to the Harris County Emergency Corps. This was now the fourth time Wayne had spoken to this center, and he could not have been clearer with the call-taker on the line when she asked him what he was reporting. \u201cMy wife is in urgent need of medical, medical attention,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019s almost unresponsive.\u201dAt last, the call-taker classified the problem as a \u201c31,\u201d an unconscious party, rather than as someone in need of water rescue. \u201cWe\u2019re getting medical to you as soon as they can get there,\u201d she said.South Lake Houston covered a territory of around 70 square miles, much of it rural or industrial. A rotating staff of five paramedics and emergency medical technicians typically worked two 24-hour shifts per week and supplemented their income with other jobs, including with other ambulance services.Normally, they answered five or six calls a day. On Sunday, they were dispatched to 17 calls. On Monday, it was 39, and because of flooding they only reached two of them. Tuesday was looking to be even worse. The ambulance service had not staffed up before the crisis, and the flooding prevented some personnel from making it in for their shifts. Two paramedics who had worked two days straight in a nearby district drove in on Monday morning to help.From the beginning, the disaster had been harrowing for the paramedics. One crew sped in an ambulance toward a hospital downtown in the midst of the violent storm, with a critically ill patient on a ventilator. Floodwaters stopped them on the roadway. They tried hitching a ride three separate times with three different trucks, but the water was too high. Ultimately the paramedics lifted the woman into a volunteer\u2019s kayak and walked her the last mile. The crew had to be flown by helicopter back to the station.Several times, the paramedics waded through water only to arrive where someone did not really need help. Once, they were dispatched to respond to a reported death and spent an hour canvassing a flooded neighborhood on foot, unable to locate the person. Sometimes they worked with the fishermen and pleasure-craft operators who formed an impromptu rescue network but were not trained or equipped to save lives. In the broader region, volunteers sometimes overturned in rough floodwaters (at least four ultimately drowned).By midday Monday, the E.M.S. service\u2019s leaders concluded that, in the case of callers who were inaccessible by ambulance, it was best to keep track of their conditions and try to reach them only if they became critical. Joe Fress, the director, asked his personnel at the station to write out a list of all the medical calls that were listed as \u201cpending\u201d in the computer system, with locations and phone numbers.On Monday, one of those pending patients was Randy De\u2019Shun Belcher, a 38-year-old man with diabetes who did not have his insulin with him. His fianc\u00e9e, De\u2019Licia Thomas, called 911 after midnight to report he was having difficulty breathing. \u201cI\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now,\u201d the call-taker at Harris County Emergency Corps said, and South Lake Houston E.M.S. was dispatched.Thomas called back when the ambulances did not arrive as promised. The call-taker incorrectly assured her that units were en route. \u201cYou gotta understand we\u2019re going through a hurricane,\u201d she said. The apartment complex was just off the Texas State Route 8 Beltway, which was not flooded. But the entrance to the apartment complex was under water, about 100 feet from the beltway\u2019s frontage road, and not navigable by ambulance. Nobody called Thomas to let her know.Just after noon on Monday, Thomas tried 911 again. \u201cHe\u2019s not breathing properly,\u201d she said. She called again 90 minutes later. The call-taker sighed loudly, sounding exasperated as she took down the address. Thomas repeated what was happening, now sounding tired and dejected.At 5 p.m., still waiting, she again called 911 in tears to report that her fianc\u00e9 was barely breathing. \u201cO.K., I\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now,\u201d a communicator again told Thomas. The call was coded in a way that indicated Belcher was getting sicker, which led Fress, finally, to tell his paramedics, \u201cLet\u2019s just try to get there, let\u2019s try to make it.\u201dThey parked on the Beltway and grabbed gear and medications from the ambulance. They crossed the feeder road and entered the complex, the floodwaters rising to their waists in the parking lot. Their rescue equipment was splashed even as they held it aloft on their shoulders. Their boots grew heavy with water, and their hips ached.As they made their way, another 911 call-taker, speaking quickly but patiently, was giving Thomas\u2019s mother, also in the home, instructions on how to start CPR. At 5:50 p.m., the paramedics finally walked into the apartment. Belcher, a father of 12, had been without a pulse and not breathing for at least a half an hour. The paramedics knew they would not get him back, but they also knew, for the sake of the devastated women, they had to try.The medical interventions did not work. The paramedics felt horrible that they could not save him, and that the medical examiner\u2019s staff would not be able to get there to pick up Belcher\u2019s body. They needed to do something they had never done before Harvey \u2014 they left Belcher\u2019s body on the living-room floor with a breathing tube in his mouth and an intravenous catheter in his right arm so the medical examiner would know what they had done. Before they left, they covered Belcher with a bedsheet, knowing that Thomas might be stuck in the apartment with him for days before his body was retrieved.Before noon on Tuesday, Wayne heard the thrum of helicopter rotors and saw a rescue line being lowered behind the trailers two streets over.He burst through the back door, where the grade was higher, sloshed through water that reached his thighs and lifted an extension ladder against the side of the trailer. He climbed to the roof, shouting and waving a flashlight. Luke stood on the front steps signaling with a bright yellow broom. Ronnie hollered for his father from the back door, not knowing where he had gone.The helicopter moved toward them. It hovered overhead. Then it flew away.Wayne swore. He made a decision: He did not want his children to watch their mother die. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring y\u2019all over there,\u201d he told his boys, gesturing to Casey\u2019s parents\u2019 trailer across the street. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to get Mommy out of here.\u201d He carried little Ronnie, with Luke sloshing along beside them.Wayne had no idea for whom the helicopter had come, or how it had been dispatched, but he learned months later. Norma Anderson, 75, had kidney failure and, having missed dialysis, was in bad condition. A 911 communicator told her daughter that ambulances could not reach the neighborhood, and she would have to await fire-rescue crews. Fortunately for Norma, the owner of her trailer had a friend who knew the district\u2019s congressman, Gene Green, and thought to call him. An intern in the representative\u2019s Washington office, Simon Handler, took the call and phoned a federal agency for a helicopter, which soon arrived.Wayne returned from Casey\u2019s parents\u2019 house soaking wet. He changed his clothes and went back to Casey\u2019s side, telling her over and over that help was coming. Shortly before 1 p.m., nearly a day after Wayne\u2019s first 911 call, a paramedic from South Lake Houston E.M.S. called Wayne back. It was the only call Wayne\u2019s cellphone recorded having received from the station, although paramedics later recalled talking with Wayne more than once to keep track of Casey\u2019s condition.Greg Perches, a paramedic who said he spoke with Wayne, arrived at South Lake Houston E.M.S. on Monday night, which allowed the ambulance service to assemble a second crew. Wayne impressed him by saying he thought Casey was becoming septic, using a medical term that indicated a potentially deadly consequence of a severe infection.The county\u2019s systems were supposed to prioritize people like Casey, people who \u201chave a medical situation, even if they\u2019re not in an area where flooding is life-threatening,\u201d Francisco S\u00e1nchez, a deputy emergency-management coordinator for Harris County Homeland Security and Emergency Management, later said.Perches says his director, Joe Fress, phoned the county fire desk to see whether the county had resources to send to Wayne and Casey\u2019s street, but was told it did not. By the logic of the county\u2019s emergency-management plan for health and medical services, the ambulance service should have been able to call for assistance from a regional catastrophic medical operations center, which was in charge of coordinating patient evacuation, transport and placement. But that center did not have its own air or boat resources, and additional ambulances would have been of no use in reaching flooded areas. The ambulance companies had to rely on fire services to help them. But in South Lake Houston\u2019s district, unlike in some other parts of Harris County, including Houston, fire and ambulance services were completely independent agencies. Although they were responsible for largely overlapping districts, Sheldon Fire and South Lake Houston E.M.S. did not follow recommendations to set up a joint command in response to the disaster, in part because there were so few workers available. Also, while personnel were individually friendly and respected each other, there was \u201cbad blood from a long time ago\u201d between the agencies, Sheldon Fire\u2019s Captain Pinson says. \u201cThey don\u2019t work with us that well.\u201d Workers from both agencies would later agree that communications between them during the disaster were poor. Their radios were on different channels, and their calls were dispatched separately by the 911 center. That meant that when someone having a medical emergency was also trapped by floodwaters, the fire department would not necessarily know about it. The paramedics were fatalistic. \u201cWe were fortunate to get what we could get\u201d in terms of outside help, says Billy Slagle, a supervisor at the E.M.S. service. Theirs is a \u201cvery small community,\u201d he says, \u201cwho\u2019s nobody.\u201dPerches told Wayne to flag down any boat he could, both men later recalled. Right after the call, Wayne turned his phone to record Casey as she lay, flushed and barely conscious, on the recliner chair by the front door. He had heard on the news that people were making false reports when they called 911. He wanted to document that this was a true medical emergency, and that Casey needed help, in case anyone ever questioned him.\u201cCasey?\u201d Wayne asked as he recorded her. The feverish eyes of his wife flickered and focused. She made a sound that might have been the beginnings of the word, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming to help us, O.K.? I love you.\u201d She groaned softly and turned her head away from him. \u201cJust keep breathing, O.K.?\u201d he said. Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cJust Breathe\u201d was their special song.It was 12:54 p.m. There was still no power, and light from the open door threw shadows across her reddened face as she lay on the easy chair. Outside, the flooding continued receding, but slowly.After he finished the short recording, Wayne heard a sound that made him look outside. He saw a tiny aluminum boat motoring past the house with two men in it. Wayne stood up and kicked the door open, shouting: \u201cMy wife is dying, man. I got to get her out of here.\u201dThey carried Casey to the boat and motored 300 feet to the drainage ditch at the corner of Enchanted Path Drive and John Ralston Road, where the street was dry. One man took off running to try to flag an airboat, waving his arms and screaming: \u201cWe got a medical emergency! We got a medical emergency!\u201dStephanie Vincent, a 37-year-old respiratory therapist from Kinder, La., was with a group of boat volunteers about a half-mile up the road and saw the man running in their direction. \u201cThey got something over there,\u201d she said, and started running toward the man with several friends.One of the airboats they were with flew ahead of them. About a half-dozen men picked up Casey by her arms and legs and loaded her into the airboat. \u201cBe careful of her left side,\u201d Wayne warned them.Vincent and a medical student whose name nobody could later recall tried to get a history of Casey\u2019s problems, but a glance told them all they needed to know. \u201cThis woman needs critical care right now,\u201d the medical student said. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting for her life, and she looks like she\u2019s losing.\u201dThey headed to a nearby field free of power lines where a helicopter could land. A volunteer from Pasadena, Tex., tried calling a number he had found for the Coast Guard on Facebook or Zello, a walkie-talkie app that citizen rescuers were using. Other volunteers stood on a bridge where the road crossed a swollen channel, waving their brightly colored life jackets to try to flag passing helicopters.Vincent stood beside Casey, holding her hand and trying to talk to her. Casey was able to open her eyes and squeeze Vincent\u2019s hand, but she could not speak aside from moaning. Casey was trembling, and Vincent took off her jackets to make a pillow.For the volunteers, the day to that point had been filled with waiting. They had slept in a Baptist church overnight and followed a member of the Cajun Navy to try to evacuate 275 people from a flooded trailer park. But when they reached the neighborhood, residents did not want to leave. The volunteer boat fleet had not managed to find anyone willing to be rescued until Wayne and Casey.Now Vincent felt there was a reason they were supposed to be there. She wished she had brought a monitor to check Casey\u2019s oxygen level. Wayne kept hold of Casey\u2019s hand and murmured encouragement to her. He repeatedly thanked the volunteers. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Vincent said. She and her friends had waited hours for something useful to do. If they had known about Casey, they would have gone right to her.The man from Pasadena called again to check on the helicopter. There were several operating in the area, but all were fully loaded with passengers and would not be back for the better part of an hour. A half-hour passed, then more, with Vincent growing irritated and panicked. Why were they just sitting there? Casey was going to stop breathing and die if they did not get her somewhere. \u201cPut her on our boat,\u201d she told the others.Her idea was to take Casey back to the meeting point where the boats had launched that morning, at the Houston Motorsports Park, about three miles north off a major parkway. Two Texas Department of Transportation high-water dump-truck crews had been parked there for hours, waiting to transport evacuees.Several volunteers lifted Casey onto a seat of the white bay boat, laying her head back on the bow, where Stephanie arranged life jackets to cushion it in anticipation of a fast, bumpy ride. Vincent and Wayne supported Casey\u2019s head as they took off, speeding west along the swollen canal toward the flooded Greens Bayou.They began twisting along Greens Bayou, taking shortcuts where they could. Vincent sat on the bow facing backward, hair whipping in the wet wind, keeping a finger on Casey\u2019s neck to monitor her carotid pulse. It was extremely fast and irregular, an indication that Casey\u2019s heart was malfunctioning. The skin around Casey\u2019s lips was blue. All of these signs were ominous, and Vincent later said she thought about the possibility she would need to start CPR. She had the sense that Wayne expected it, too.At one point, Vincent\u2019s friend Rachelle McClellan jumped out of the boat to help push them over a sand-choked levee against a current \u2014 she had to be pulled back in on the other side, where the water was deeper. To McClellan, the way Casey\u2019s hands and feet looked reminded her of how her mother\u2019s did the day she died. The entire journey took about 15 minutes. When they arrived, a truck was already backed up deep into the water. McClellan held onto the truck bed to keep it steady, and several men lifted Casey into it, where the gravel normally goes. Wayne and a transportation employee hopped in behind her.They planned to drive to a hospital, but found the roads were closed, and a National Guardsman they passed recommended that they drive to a small shopping center off Beltway 8, about four miles north. There was supposed to be a medical station at a Kroger grocery store, and there was also a 24-hour emergency-care center run by Memorial Hermann, the hospital system where Casey had undergone her surgery.As the truck bumped and jerked along the road, Wayne could not recall a more uncomfortable ride. The motion was beating up Casey. He struggled to keep her covered as the rain started up again. She was wet and filthy and surely cold.They arrived to find no medical clinic outside the Kroger, and the emergency medical center was closed. The two transportation employees in their orange vests cussed and looked scared. \u201cThis woman is dying,\u201d Wayne heard one of them say into a phone or radio. \u201cShe\u2019s going to die right here if we don\u2019t get her an ambulance.\u201dShe said the paramedics would do their best to get there and asked whether he had access to a defibrillator. He did not.The call center dispatched a South Lake Houston E.M.S. ambulance to the far north of its territory. \u201cYou need to bring the patient to the freeway,\u201d the paramedic who took the call, Tyler Cegielski, said. The paramedics were not willing to exit the freeway for fear of swamping their ambulance in high water. They would have to navigate around some areas of flooding and predicted they would be at that part of the freeway in 10 or 15 minutes.The dump truck bumped back out of the parking lot and onto the freeway to await the ambulance. Wayne leaned over Casey, cradling her head in his left arm, and caressing her with his right, her body half in his lap and half in the bed of the dump truck.\u201cJust hang in there, sweetheart. Just breathe. Just breathe,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp is on the way. The ambulance is coming.\u201dIt was taking much longer than 15 minutes. Wayne saw several ambulances pass by, but they seemed to be going other places. The rain picked up again, and the workers let out a tarp over the truck bed to protect them.Casey had been fading in and out of consciousness for hours now. Wayne felt her stir. Her left hand rose to clench his shirt, pulling his face down to her so they were nose to nose. Her eyes were open now, looking at him. \u201cLet me go,\u201d she said, the first clear words he\u2019d heard her say in more than a day. \u201cLet me go.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he said. \u201cHelp is right here.\u201d But Casey did not respond. She vomited something dark and foul-smelling. She stopped breathing.Wayne reached his hand out and beat on the driver\u2019s side window. \u201cMy wife\u2019s dying back here,\u201d he yelled.Milburn climbed into the truck bed with them. Casey had no pulse. He began performing CPR. Wayne saw a constable on the other side of the Beltway and leapt out of the back of the dump truck to run to her, jumping over the central median. She called for help on her radio and, seeing another constable pulling up, she told Wayne, \u201cGet that one.\u201d Wayne ran over and told the second constable the situation. That constable, too, got on his radio. Wayne crossed back over the median and hailed a third constable, who turned on his emergency lights, cut off traffic and pulled up behind the dump truck. Another constable arrived along with passers-by who had been driving on the freeway. One went into the back of the dump truck to help work on Casey.\nAbout three minutes after Wayne returned to the dump truck, at 3:16 p.m., the ambulance finally arrived.Two of the paramedics who had tried to save Randy Belcher the previous day, Jeremy Fuentes and Jason Foster, took over and brought Casey out of the dump truck. They figured it had been about eight minutes since her heart had stopped. They inserted a breathing tube, started an intravenous line in the crook of her right elbow and placed a needle into the tibia of her right leg to deliver fluids. They attached a pistonlike Lucas device that uses a suction cup to compress and recoil the chest, providing automated CPR.The idea that the young woman had been breathing and even speaking just a few minutes earlier made Fuentes think they had a chance to revive her. They went through everything they had on their truck that might restart Casey\u2019s heart \u2014 multiple doses of epinephrine and atropine \u2014 but nothing seemed to work. The monitor showed a flat line, no electrical signal that they could shock back to regular rhythm. To Fuentes, the hardest part was watching Wayne watch Casey.After about 20 minutes, one of the paramedics said, \u201cMr. Dailey, we got to go.\u201d Wayne rode in Ambulance No. 25 with Casey. He supplied her medical history as the ambulance, slowed by the rain, headed to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital in Humble, more than 11 miles away, the only working hospital they knew they could reach.They arrived at 3:54 p.m. Casey\u2019s temperature was high, but her pulse, breathing rate and blood pressure were nonexistent. Her pupils did not react to light, a sign that her brain had not received enough oxygen.For eight minutes, the hospital team pumped Casey\u2019s chest, filled her lungs with oxygen, and gave her additional doses of epinephrine. But at 4:04 p.m., Dr. Christopher Langan concluded nothing could revive her.It was 1 day 2 hours 30 minutes after Wayne\u2019s first call to 911. Wayne reached Casey\u2019s parents on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cCasey\u2019s gone.\u201dWayne responded to the messages. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that my wife passed away on the way to the hospital,\u201d he wrote in a text message to a stranger with a South Carolina area code. \u201cI appreciate your efforts, thank you.\u201d\u201cI am so so sorry for your loss,\u201d the stranger wrote back. \u201cSending prayers your way.\u201dThe next week, Wayne\u2019s and Casey\u2019s parents noticed that she was not named as a victim of the storm. Wayne called the Harris County Medical Examiner\u2019s office, distraught. \u201cHow come my wife is not on the list of people who died as a direct impact of Harvey?\u201d he asked. The investigator explained that \u201cdirect impact\u201d primarily meant drowning. Wayne\u2019s wife, on the other hand, had a medical problem.Wayne said he knew that, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t have died in the back of a dump truck on Beltway 8 after going through three boat rides if there were no floodwaters in front of my house. Because E.M.S. is 10 minutes down my street. She\u2019d be in a hospital right now.\u201d The investigator apologized and offered to talk to her administrator to see if she could get Casey on the list.To this day, Casey\u2019s death is not included in Hurricane Harvey\u2019s official toll. Randy Belcher\u2019s is not either. In interviews, personnel at South Lake Houston E.M.S. said they believed that at least four or five other people in the district who called 911 with medical emergencies died when they were not rescued in time.Local media highlighted deaths of people in other districts as well: Noah Delgado, an 8-year-old who died of an asthma attack in northwest Harris County and whose mother could not get through to 911; Bonnie Parsutt, 69, who died in Galveston County after her oxygen failed when the electricity went out; Mary Avila, 80, also in Galveston County, who died in a nursing home when she could not get dialysis; and a heart-attack victim who died at home in a flooded neighborhood of Montgomery County that emergency workers could not reach.The City of Houston reported to the F.C.C. that many people with disabilities who had entered themselves into the State of Texas Emergency Assistance Registry and had repeatedly called 911 and 211, the city\u2019s non-emergency line, to request help when their homes flooded did not receive assistance.The number of acutely ill people who lost their lives because of delayed rescues has not been tallied. Preliminary data from the state health department\u2019s Center for Health Statistics indicate that 2,498 people died in Harris County in August 2017, nearly 200 more people than died in July of that year. Over the period of 2008-16, deaths in July compared with August typically varied only slightly. August 2017 appears to be an outlier.The Harris County medical examiner lists only 36 deaths as storm-related, all of which were caused directly by drowning, falls in floodwaters and electrocutions. \u201cWe consider only deaths that are a direct consequence of environmental factors,\u201d says Tricia Rudisill Bentley, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner\u2019s office.When they discharged Casey before the storm, doctors at Memorial Hermann did not send her home with this medicine, which is routinely given after removal of a hormone-producing adrenal-gland tumor. Memorial Hermann referred questions about the case to the individual physicians. Dr. Curtis Wray, her surgeon, declined several requests to speak through UTHealth, where he is an associate professor of surgery. The intern who discharged Casey also did not respond to several email and phone inquiries.Dr. Geoffrey Thompson, the head of endocrine surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Casey\u2019s symptoms were consistent with insufficient cortisol. \u201cSomeone forgot to give her steroids,\u201d says the surgeon, whose group has performed close to 3,000 operations of the type Casey had. That failure, and the delay in her transport to the hospital, was all the more tragic, Dr. Thompson added, because the condition she had \u201cis highly curable.\u201dDr. Laurence Katznelson, medical director of the pituitary center at Stanford School of Medicine, agrees. \u201cEverybody gets placed on steroids,\u201d he says. Asked whether he could come up with reasons Casey\u2019s doctors might not have prescribed steroid medication, Dr. Katznelson replied, \u201cI can\u2019t think of one.\u201dFor Wayne Dailey, who has struggled emotionally and financially in the wake of Casey\u2019s death, improving systems for identifying people with medical emergencies in disasters and getting help to them in time is his most fervent wish. As the climate continues to change, Harvey is far from Houston\u2019s most extreme hurricane possibility. Parts of Harris County prone to devastation from storm surges \u2014 windswept walls of water that slam onto land with great power \u2014 were spared that additional hazard this time. \u201cAs catastrophic as Harvey was,\u201d Francisco S\u00e1nchez, the Harris County emergency-management coordinator, says, \u201cit had the potential to be much worse.\u201dThe crowd left the church wiping their eyes. Wayne and Luke, two of the pallbearers, followed behind them. \u201cYour Mom would be proud of you,\u201d Wayne said to Luke, touching his cheek.The family drove to the graveyard. As Casey\u2019s coffin was lowered, all was silent except for the sound of grass being mowed in the distance. One by one, each guest departed, until only Ronnie remained, peering into the broken ground. Wayne came to get him, but for a long time the boy refused to leave.Graphics by Rodrigo de Benito Sanz and Grant Gold.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: A Road (and River) Trip Through Western Germany", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlace 31A four-day loop through the German states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz and Hessen was made all the better by unexpected company.  The thick trees had opened up to a view of an endless river valley and mountains covered in evergreens so dense they indeed looked black. We felt powerless to do anything but pull over and take pictures that will never do it justice. If this is what happens when robots take over the world, I might be O.K. with it. JADA: We seemed to have similar road-trip styles: Head to a signpost destination and do a lot of meandering along the way. Once I drove from Frankfurt to meet you in Stuttgart, I didn\u2019t care where we went, as we eventually got to the ice age caves in the Swabian Jura, or Swabian Alps, which was a reason this area was on the 52 Places list.Frankfurt is really a cosmopolitan city. More than half of its inhabitants or their parents were born in another country. It is a city of finance, beautiful riverbanks and Germany\u2019s main airport. Locals tell me that people there are pretty open-minded and inviting.At the same time, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the southwestern German state that was on the itinerary, is known to be more conservative and maybe more traditionally German as foreigners might envision the country.  JADA: Frankfurt felt really alive to me. A friend\u2019s husband took me around before you and I met up, and explained that Germans see it as ugly and functional. The city was flattened during World War II, so it\u2019s now a hodgepodge of Modernist architecture mixed with reconstructed medieval buildings. JOHN: After leaving the cuckoo clock, we snaked through the countryside; I did a double-take when we were driving through this speck of a village, Fl\u00f6zlingen, and I saw a black man sitting outside of a garage. Being a black man myself, I am always interested in hearing the stories of black people I meet in Germany \u2014 a small but growing part of German society. Patrick Koffi Agbavon-Wolf, with blue overalls and a cigarette, was winding down after a day of factory work. He\u2019s 52 and originally from Togo but has been in Germany for more than two decades, settling here after several visits to Europe.What struck me was that he said he did not really have to confront the far-right, xenophobic populism that is growing in Germany (and all over Europe, for that matter). Not that he was na\u00efve to the challenges presented by that rise; but I think that Mr. Agbavon-Wolf represented how immigrants can sometimes integrate into quiet corners of the country, even as debate rages over their place in German society.Unfortunately, all that talking set us back on our journey to Lichtenstein (a municipality, not to be confused with the nearby principality of Liechtenstein). We arrived around midnight and almost didn\u2019t get to check in to our hotel because there was no nighttime front-desk service. JADA: The one boon of all our bad timing is we often got to see Germany\u2019s fiery sunsets over fields of hay or sunflowers. Two travel lessons learned: call small hotels and warn them if you\u2019re coming in after 8 p.m., and plan for dinner or you\u2019ll end up eating sad schnitzel in a gas station. Lichtenstein was way more remote than we\u2019d anticipated, but at least it was stunning in the daylight. JOHN: I certainly saw that the next morning when I went for a run into the woods and ended up taking a hike. I struggled up the mountainside, beneath a beautiful canopy of trees and rugged track. It ended up being totally worth it, though. At the top of the incline, I reached Lichtenstein Castle. I did not have the 2 euro entry fee with me \u2014 I don\u2019t typically run with cash \u2014 but one of the groundskeepers was nice enough to let me in for a quick peek. It was built in 1842 at the edge of a cliff for a rich art collector who wanted to live in a castle.That collector had an amazing view. You can see the entire Echaz valley: lush greenery surrounding charming houses with pitched roofs. The park felt more like a children\u2019s museum, with activities like racing the clock while dragging a sled of hides and throwing spears into foam mammoth targets. There is also a delicate 40,000-year-old figurine of a mammoth carved from a mammoth tusk \u2014 art that apparently grew out of inspired boredom, since hunting and gathering only took up a few hours of the day. But I think we were both most intrigued by the Euro-centric way the exhibits described how Neanderthals migrated to Germany from Africa, followed by homo sapiens.JOHN: Yes, the story was definitely framed from a white European perspective. I was happy to see a sign explaining that Africa was the cradle of mankind. JADA: It was a ton of fun squeezing through all the tiny entryways. I loved the story the guide told, about how the cave\u2019s namesake, Queen Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg, visited in 1893, but she didn\u2019t get to see the whole thing because the passages got too narrow for her hoop skirts. JADA: Germany is famous for its beer, of course, but this part of the country is really known for its dry white wines. Rieslings get a bum-rap in the states for being too sweet, but after trying these, I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re just importing the wrong stuff. JOHN: I prefer dry reds. And apparently there are some good pinot noirs in Germany as well.JADA: The food recommendation you gave me that I liked the most was maultasche, at a beer garden on the Neckar in T\u00fcbingen. It\u2019s a Swabian specialty, a dumpling filled with minced meat (there\u2019s a veggie version, too). I had mine in a soup with a tasty broth.JOHN: That quick stop we made in T\u00fcbingen was a highlight for me. One-third of the city\u2019s 85,000 residents are university students. Culturally, it\u2019s an interesting mix of young and vibrant and classically traditional: the old brick city wall that bordered a main thoroughfare stood right across from a crowd of millennials gathered at sidewalk tables, enjoying libations.And, as you know, I have a bit of an ice cream addiction. At the market, I was able to sate myself with yogurt ice topped with fruit preserves. We only did part of the route, getting off at the St. Goar castle, but if you did the entire trip from R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein to Koblenz, you can see about 40 hilltop castles in a 40-mile stretch. And, of course, the region has wineries galore. Interestingly enough, though, unlike many other wine regions in the world, you don\u2019t taste wine at the vineyards here. Instead, there are wine shops in towns where there are tastings. The way back is slower because it\u2019s upriver, so we took the speedy train that runs along the Rhine and cut our travel time by two hours. Pretty much every second, you\u2019re looking at cute villages or hills covered in vineyards. It made me regret the two decades of my life I had spent riding New York City subways to work. JOHN: It was a fortunate circumstance that we sat next to a man named Clemens on the boat. He lives in Munich but was on his way to Koblenz for work. He\u2019s a lawyer and had court the next day. The 65-year-old could have just taken a train all the way, but he realized that he had never taken this beautiful boat ride that was right in his backyard. JADA: The heavy downpour that started right after we boarded was a bummer, but in a magical moment, the rain cleared up just around the time we reached the famous Lorelei rock, which juts out of the water just before the tiny town of St. Goarshausen. Clemens told me it was named after a young siren who used to sit on the rocks, singing, distracting men in passing boats so they crashed to their deaths. As we floated by, a group of women started singing a song of Lorelei they said they had all learned in school, and then others on the boat joined in. It was wonderful.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Ypres, BelgiumAdvertisement"}

All river all the way, the water catches the sun, sparkling the surface as you zoom past palisades, marinas and mountains.This time, get off at Cold Spring and investigate. The village, which is home to excellent hikes, a bucolic Main Street and scads of suburban charm, is also a launch site for some awesome kayak tours of the Hudson, including to Pollepel Island and other notable sites.But the Pollepel story is the kicker. Starting in the 1800s, a New Yorker named Francis Bannerman collected and sold surplus military equipment. A lot of it. When Bannerman\u2019s collection, which included explosive black gunpowder, became too unsafe to store in the city, he bought Pollepel Island and constructed the castle to store his supply. And with a facade reading \u201cBannerman\u2019s Island Arsenal,\u201d then clearly visible from the train, the castle functioned as an advertisement for his wares. A fire in 1969 began the process of decay that leaves the castle in ruins today.While the castle no longer peddles its wares, it continues to do its job of enticing city passengers to experience the joys of the Hudson.

There are plenty of to-dos for non-kayakers:Required ReadingMargot, What\u2019s the Plan?One of my favorite New York activities is surveying buildings as I wander the streets, wondering who lives in them, or who once did, and what their lives have been like.So as you can imagine, I love the Tenement Museum. Erected in 1863 and opened as a museum in 1992, the building at 97 Orchard Street shares stories of its former inhabitants, mostly working-class immigrants from Russia, Ireland and Germany from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, through tours in and around their reproduced living spaces.The tours, as conversational as they are informational, are led by educators who invite visitors to chime in with questions or stories about their own histories of immigration. As a result, each tour is unique, offering an opportunity to connect with strangers over a salient issue.A gregarious guide named Daryl recently led a gaggle of tourists (and me) on such a tour, one that started walking up an outdoor stairway, past a set of recreated outhouses and ultimately through a peeling hallway and into a cramped apartment.There we met 14-year-old Victoria Confino (or the actor portraying her), one of several children in a family of Sephardic Jews from Kastoria (then a part of Turkey and now Greece) who lived at 97 Orchard.Victoria was aflutter inside the three-room, 10-person apartment, restored to its 1916 trappings, showing us her books and spices, and answering questions about where she shopped, worked, played and studied (\u201ckindergarten at age 11, blech\u201d).Before and after our encounter with Victoria, Daryl (an institution at the museum, I hear) prompted us to imagine what the Confinos\u2019 lives might have been like: How did it smell on the boat to New York? As a Sephardic family, how much or how little might the Confinos have had in common with Russian Jews in the city?And he filled us in on the Confino story after 1916: The family later moved to Spanish Harlem, Victoria\u2019s son went on to work for NASA, and, more recently, her surviving family has helped to build her story at the museum.In our city, history is very much alive.Tejal\u2019s Before and After: RestaurantsTejal\u2019s Before and After: BarsNearbyRequired ReadingExtra ExtraFrom You\u201cI am 60 years old and walk from the subway to the Queens Museum and Socrates Sculpture Park.

{"Headline": "It Took a Village to Make Their Perfect Home", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntAfter years in a quiet walk-up, a couple discovers a \u201chuge life upgrade\u201d in the abundant conveniences of a bustling co-op community. After the couple, who married two years ago, decided they wanted an upgrade, the debate went on for months: Rent or buy? \u201cWe asked everyone we knew, and we Googled,\u201d Ms. Gerard said. \u201cThe more information we got, the more undecided we were.\u201dInitially, the neighborhood wasn\u2019t important to them. It was more about location: Some neighborhoods were too far into Brooklyn, meaning a longer commute, few train options and an almost suburban feel.\u201cI realized how nice it was to walk down the street to a coffee shop and have proximity to things we care about \u2014 work, friends, family and general conveniences,\u201d Ms. Gerard said. \u201cWe became more particular about what things matter to us more.\u201d Their price range, about $600,000 to $750,000, might be a challenge if they wanted a real second bedroom, Mr. Rozboril told them.Near the Brooklyn Museum in Prospect Heights, a large and lovely two-bedroom co-op unit was asking $789,000, with maintenance in the high $700s. A nearby construction zone on the former site of a Key Food roared outside. The apartment was on the ground floor, and the new building replacing the supermarket would likely have blocked much of the sunlight. \u201cConstruction was literally outside the window of every single room except for the kitchen, which looked out on a brick wall,\u201d Mr. Rozboril said. Mr. Rosen, who grew up near the Holland Tunnel, didn\u2019t think the noise would bother him, but the dim light would. \u201cThis was the first one where there were so many more pros than cons, but there was one big con,\u201d Ms. Gerard said. It soon sold for $850,000. In Park Slope, a beautifully renovated two-bedroom in a small condominium building on a lovely tree-lined block was asking $699,000, with monthly charges in the low $600s.The couple were number 36 on the open-house sign-in sheet. If one bedroom was small, the other was tiny. Closet space was minimal. The kitchen included a combination washer-dryer rather than a dishwasher, which they found weird. The home wasn\u2019t suitable for them; it quickly sold for $809,000.In Concord Village, the seven-building co-op complex, circa 1950, near the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, Ms. Gerard and Mr. Rosen were intrigued by a corner two-bedroom with around 900 square feet, plenty of closet space and a large, open kitchen. The asking price was $799,000, with maintenance of around $1,100 plus assorted amenity fees.\u201cI knew immediately where I wanted to put my office,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. With quick access to multiple subway lines, it was easy to get anywhere. The bedrooms came outfitted with soundproof windows, which reduced the traffic noise from outside.Ms. Gerard discussed the situation with colleagues, one of whom lived in the complex. \u201cThere were all these people in our lives who had lived in Concord Village and had good things to say,\u201d she said. \u201cHearing it from people who live there, it was so wonderful.\u201d The unit they were interested in had been on the market for months, and had already had one price drop. The sellers had long since departed for California. The couple held firm to their offer and bought the place for $720,000.But there was still money to be spent. The inspector noted that there were not enough circuit breakers. \u201cIt seemed like an easily fixable problem,\u201d Ms. Gerard said. But every time the electrician came, he found something else wrong.\u201cThe electrician was a bearer of bad news for, like, six weeks,\u201d Ms. Gerard said, to the tune of about $12,000. Apparently, some previous owner had improperly installed overhead lights. The couple finally arrived in the spring, with Crusher the dog in tow. Mr. Rosen arranged his desk in a corner, near two windows. Their new home, he said, represents \u201ca huge life upgrade.\u201dTheir floor has a trash chute and recycling area. There is a laundry room in the basement. \u201cSomething about not having to go out for the laundry makes my life so much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these little amenities, I love them. They make it great.\u201d Packages are announced with computerized notifications. \u201cIn the old place, you would hear the door buzzer so loud it would freak me out,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cWhen I walk the dog and come back, there\u2019s a screen in the lobby. I like that a ton better than being interrupted periodically during the day.\u201dMs. Gerard enjoys a shorter and easier trip to work, with no transfers.\u201cWe are on the wait list for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are on a five-year wait list for a parking spot, a three-year wait list for a storage locker and a one-year wait list for bike storage.\u201d For now, they store their bicycles in the master bedroom, which is so big it begs for more furniture. \u201cWhen I describe it to others, I say it\u2019s the ugly building near the bridge,\u201d Ms. Gerard said. \u201cI never imagined myself living near a busy highway. I really liked living on smaller streets that were quiet, but it has so many conveniences, it became easy for me to overlook that. I was expecting what I wouldn\u2019t like, and it turned out not to matter to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Special Envoys Were Once Disdained Under Trump. Now They\u2019re Popping Up All Over.", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Thursday that he was appointing a special envoy to handle negotiations with North Korea. Just days earlier, he introduced special envoys for Iran and Syria, equally knotty problems. Another for Afghanistan is said to be in the offing.In its early days, the Trump administration slashed the number of special envoys, seeing them as an unnecessary bureaucratic layer. R.C. Hammond, a top official, routinely bemoaned that there were more than 60 such envoys, making the department\u2019s organizational chart look like a starburst.But Mr. Pompeo is a man in a hurry. Frustrated with a nomination process that has been slowed by White House missteps, a lengthy blacklist against onetime Trump critics and increasing partisanship on Capitol Hill, he is moving to bring in highly experienced diplomats to coordinate policy on the most difficult issues he faces.The department\u2019s bureaus for East Asian and Pacific affairs and for South and Central Asian affairs, vital centers for coordinating and implementing policy, do not have nominees for their top slots. And only one of the department\u2019s six under secretary positions has a Senate-confirmed appointee.\u201cThat\u2019s my mission set: to build that esprit and get that team on the field,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, a promise he has often repeated.He has had modest success, announcing 16 ambassadorial nominations in August alone. And the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, eager to get diplomats in place, has rushed hearings in many cases. The nomination of David Hale to become the department\u2019s third-ranked diplomat moved through the committee in about a month.But there is a widely held perception even among Republicans in Congress that the Trump administration does little to vet its nominees, with Senate staff members discovering controversies and lawsuits \u2014 often through simple Google searches \u2014 never mentioned in paperwork that is supposed to be all-encompassing. In a confirmation hearing on Thursday, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, took to task David T. Fischer, a Michigan car dealer who has been nominated to become ambassador to Morocco, for failing to list in his materials a lawsuit in which Mr. Fischer played an important role.Mr. Merkley asked Mr. Fischer to provide the committee with a detailed explanation of the case, a request Mr. Fischer promised to fulfill. Such belated back-and-forths often delay confirmations by weeks or months.\u201cThere\u2019s a great frustration with our friends, who say there\u2019s no one to talk to. And Pompeo can\u2019t do it all himself,\u201d said James J. Carafano, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a member of the Trump transition team, who added that the department\u2019s many vacancies were \u201ca self-inflicted wound.\u201dThe White House has avoided those who signed such letters for Senate-confirmed slots.\u201cPompeo has to construct a team and fast, and appointing special envoys is one way to do that,\u201d said Thomas A. Shannon, who recently retired as the department\u2019s highest-ranking career diplomat. \u201cAnd I think these latest choices are inspired.\u201dStephen E. Biegun, an executive at the Ford Motor Company and a White House aide in the George W. Bush administration, was named on Thursday by Mr. Pompeo to be the senior envoy leading negotiations with North Korea. The two will head to Pyongyang next week, which will be Mr. Pompeo\u2019s fourth trip there.Mr. Pompeo canceled a July meeting with top Indian diplomats to make his third trip to Pyongyang, a decision that caused bruised feelings in New Delhi \u2014 a reminder of how much help he needs.\u201cIt\u2019s a great move to have a special envoy, and it shows the administration is maturing,\u201d said Joseph Y. Yun, the previous special envoy for North Korea, who retired in February.Negotiations with North Korea have stalled in recent months over Mr. Pompeo\u2019s demand that Pyongyang demonstrate tangible steps toward eliminating its nuclear and ballistic weapons programs, and his insistence that North Korea will not get any relief from economic sanctions until the denuclearization process is complete.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Divided Era, One Thing Seems to Unite: Political Anger", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKen Storey was in a pique, the kind that often seizes and overwhelms the better judgment of people who follow politics closely these days.Those 145 characters, which soon bounced around among conservative activists online and became the subject of several Fox News segments, would cost him his job as an adjunct sociology professor at the University of Tampa, incite death threats, strain his relationship with his parents and, nearly a year later, leave him living on two part-time jobs that pay less than a third of what he used to earn. His rent, car payments and electric bills are all past due, he said in a recent interview.While his case and the resulting backlash were extreme, Mr. Storey, 34, instigated the kind of zero-sum political confrontation that breaks out every day all across the country as politics seeps into and disrupts everyday life. To a degree that is unique to this period and this president, disputes over politics have divided Americans\u2019 homes, strained marriages, ruined friendships and invaded the workplace.High tension, raw emotion and occasional violence have always been a feature of American democracy \u2014 in times of war and peace, through presidential impeachments and mass protest movements. But interviews with voters across the country, along with an analysis of recent research by political scientists who specialize in partisan division, suggest that politics is changing how Americans think and behave in new and unsettling ways.Experts point to several reasons. The volume and sheer ubiquity of information about politics, combined with Americans\u2019 ability to instantaneously render public judgment on one another\u2019s views, has made the political conversation much noisier. And for the first time the country is led by someone who inflames that conversation on a nearly daily basis, taunting his adversaries on Twitter and quickly triggering tens of thousands of responses.\u201cThere is a constant obsession with the ups and downs, the tweets, who we\u2019re supposed to be mad at \u2014 and that is different,\u201d said the historian Jon Meacham, who has written a new book, \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d on how the country endured its most traumatic moments, from the Civil War to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan to Vietnam. \u201cTrump has raised the metabolism of division to remarkable levels.\u201dThere is a sense, especially among Democrats who recoil at Mr. Trump\u2019s style of politics, that partisan affiliation reflects more than just a voting preference. Rather, it says something about your character. And where you come down on Mr. Trump is increasingly a decisive factor in whether or not someone wants to associate with you.Savannah Fehling, 23, of Sarasota, Fla., is one of many Americans whose own troubles live out the data. She said her relationship fell apart after she and her ex-boyfriend came to realize that their political differences \u2014 initially something that drew them together \u2014 were driving them apart. She described herself as \u201cquite liberal\u201d and him as \u201cquite conservative.\u201d\u201cIt was difficult for me to reconcile dating someone who, I realized, had more than just very different political views, but very different core values that helped inform those views,\u201d Ms. Fehling said. Her ex, she added, was a \u201csweet, smart, thoughtful guy.\u201d But in the end, \u201che was raised by people who thought a certain way, and it was difficult to get through that.\u201dMaryann Meador, 65, of Saint Marys, Ga., said that she and her husband of 23 years always had mild disagreements over politics. She attributed this to their backgrounds: He is from Texas and collects guns; she was born in Brooklyn and got active in local Democratic politics. But something about Mr. Trump\u2019s election, she said, sharpened their differences. \u201cThe Bushes were hard years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we really didn\u2019t get into screaming matches about it.\u201dNow they have given up their tradition of watching the NBC Nightly News together every evening. She hides her laptop when he walks in the room because she doesn\u2019t want him to see her reading something political that could spark a fight. When he drinks coffee from a cup with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan on it and leaves it on the counter, she is tempted to smash it. \u201cBut what would that accomplish?\u201d she asked.The pollster Frank Luntz, who has worked primarily for Republicans but says he has become increasingly disenchanted with his party and critical of Mr. Trump, recently commissioned a survey of 96 questions on the topic of political dialogue and division. In 1,000 interviews, he said, he found one answer especially troubling: Nearly a third said they had stopped talking to a friend or a family member because of disagreements over politics and the 2016 election.\u201cThis is very different,\u201d Mr. Luntz said in an interview. \u201cWith Obama, people hated him or people loved him. But you weren\u2019t evil for how you felt. You might be accused of being a racist or a socialist. It still wasn\u2019t the same.\u201d\u201cThen 2016 rolls around,\u201d she said.Among the requests for conflict mitigation she has received since: rabbis and pastors whose congregations are at each other\u2019s throats; Fortune 500 companies where productivity is down because employees bicker over politics; and a mother in New England who feared her family\u2019s holiday would be ruined because her two daughters who were returning from college had not spoken to each other since the 2016 election.\u201cThis is now deep in our homes, deep in our neighborhoods, deep in our places of worship and deep in our workplaces,\u201d Ms. Lukensmeyer said. \u201cIt really is a virus.\u201dAt a focus group convened by Mr. Luntz, Joshua Narramore, 34, of Avon Lake, Ohio, described how he was cut off by an old friend \u2014 someone whose children he babysat and whose family would have him over for dinner \u2014 after posting in support of Mr. Trump on Facebook. A number of his posts could have set this friend off, Mr. Narramore acknowledged. One was a meme calling Hitler \u201cthe first progressive;\u201d he described another as a more harmless gloat after the 2016 election.He said he made the admittedly provocative posts out of frustration, because he was \u201csick and tired of seeing all the anti-Trump stuff.\u201dHe and the friend have not spoken since.\u201cIt stinks,\u201d Mr. Narramore said. \u201cBut he\u2019s a person I never stopped praying for.\u201dTell us about an experience when you felt you couldn\u2019t talk about your politics because you thought you\u2019d be criticized. Share your experience here.Mr. Storey, the former University of Tampa professor, said his mother still won\u2019t speak to him about the Twitter incident because she found it so upsetting. He said a stranger who found his number online called and threatened him by reciting his parents\u2019 address.But, reflecting on the direction he thinks the country is heading in under Mr. Trump and the Republican Party, he added that he had no regrets about the tweet.\u201cI don\u2019t apologize for holding our politicians or those who elect our politicians accountable,\u201d he said.Unable to make much of a living on his part-time jobs teaching at a community college and writing about tourism for a local website, he is thinking of moving cities and going back to school to become an urban planner.\u201cAll over a tweet,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Google said those accounts had shared \u201cEnglish-language political content in the U.S.,\u201d but it did not provide detail on what types of videos or content.While YouTube is the most popular online video platform, with nearly two billion visitors every month, it has managed to avoid the scrutiny heaped upon Facebook for its involvement in spreading misinformation by foreigners. In part, that is because sharing content to other users across its network is not as easy.Google\u2019s attempts to build a social network to rival Facebook have largely flopped, so fake Google+ accounts reach a limited audience \u2014 making it unpopular among both users and foreign manipulators.Google said Tuesday that it suspended one account linked to an Iranian influence campaign. Google said that \u201crelevant videos\u201d on the 39 now-deleted YouTube channels had 13,466 total views in the United States \u2014 a relatively small number for YouTube. It did not define what constituted a relevant video.Those YouTube channels were terminated over the last few weeks, said Rob Shilkin, a Google spokesman.Google said it had used forensic evidence, such as common internet protocol addresses and website domain information, to conclude that the misinformation campaign was a coordinated attack from Iran\u2019s state broadcaster.\u201cThis finding is consistent with internet activity we\u2019ve warned about in recent years from Iran,\u201d Mr. Walker wrote. He added that Google had warned its users about email \u201cphishing\u201d attempts and security attacks from Iran.A report published by FireEye regarding an Iranian influence campaign aimed at audiences in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East provided a few examples of YouTube accounts that were trying to advance Iran\u2019s interests. One of those channels was called Liberty Front Press \u2014 the account that Google said it had deleted earlier in the week \u2014 featuring videos with titles like \u201cRudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimate\u201d and \u201cNew C.I.A. chief followed the law, served the country.\u201dIn October, Google said it had deleted 18 accounts with links to the Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, that uploaded English-language political content. The channels had uploaded more than 1,100 videos spanning 43 hours.Google said Thursday that it had detected and removed an additional 42 channels from \u201cI.R.A.-related actors\u201d since last year. Those channels had 58 English-language political videos, which had accumulated fewer than 1,800 views.Advertisement"}

(After the chat was over, he wanted another pass at the topic. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not concerned about job performance,\u201d he clarified. \u201cIt\u2019s that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my role to be a speculator or analyst.\u201d)But direct criticisms of the president have been relatively sparse. Though Mr. Cartwright, 57, said in an interview that he wished Mr. Trump would \u201cact more presidential,\u201d he reached for empathy when explaining his own constituents\u2019 choices in 2016.\u201cThey voted for the change candidate, and you do that when you are hurting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I try to remind them that it is the Democratic Party that cares about the people who are hurting more than any other party. And I say to myself, I have to redouble my own efforts because these are my people who are hurting.\u201dAcross the state, candidates have been similarly introspective. Perpetually a bellwether \u2014 with bipartisan representation in the United States Senate currently and seesawing control of the governorship for decades \u2014 Pennsylvania has assumed an especially prominent place in the present political moment. Not only are Gov. Tom Wolf and Senator Bob Casey, both Democrats, fighting to keep their seats this November, but congressional districts have been rendered more competitive under a redrawn map, making the state central to any Democratic path back to a House majority in Washington.\u201cTwo things can be true at the same time: There is xenophobia and nationalism and racist undertones,\u201d said John Fetterman, the longtime mayor of Braddock, outside Pittsburgh, and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. \u201cBut there\u2019s also people that are reachable.\u201dOften, success is as much a matter of emphasis as policy. Rick Bloomingdale, the president of the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that despite a \u201cgreat economic plan\u201d from Hillary Clinton in 2016, the piece of her platform that broke through most was \u201chow awful Trump was.\u201d\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear you tell them how bad Trump is,\u201d Mr. Bloomingdale said. \u201cThey either know or they don\u2019t care.\u201dThough Democrats hope to erase the memory of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s race statewide, regions like Mr. Lamb\u2019s and Mr. Cartwright\u2019s have been a particular focus of the political reclamation project. The party once ruled many of the labor strongholds of the southwest, where the river\u2019s edge is pocked with brownfields and shuttered taverns and roadside sunflowers that tilt backward, like a boxer dodging a punch, when a truck cuts a curve too sharply.\u201cI watched him do it once,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cHe had to change his shirt afterward. That was the metric of success.\u201dSo perhaps nowhere was Mr. Trump\u2019s success more striking than across the northeastern ZIP codes where Democrats had long held firm. In Luzerne County, which includes Wilkes-Barre, President Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney in 2012 by five points; Mr. Trump won it by 19. In neighboring Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton, Mr. Obama won by 27 points; Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Trump there by only three.But the congressman has strained to avoid such typecasting as a liberal shill. Among other flourishes, he has been eager to share word of a new hobby with prospective voters: deer hunting.\u201cMy job is to get to know people and learn about their passions,\u201d he said in the interview.There is another upside. \u201cIt helps me talk to Republican members of Congress, too,\u201d Mr. Cartwright said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to say, \u2018You know, I don\u2019t hate you.\u2019\u201dSome skeptical voters have commanded extra care from Mr. Cartwright and his team. Outside the bingo tent at a church bazaar in Tannersville, Mr. Cartwright encountered Duane Grady, a Trump voter who owns a home heating oil business and expressed fondness of the Republican tax cuts. He said he used to support Democrats.\u201cYou heard it from Uncle Matt: We want you back, man,\u201d Mr. Cartwright told him.\u201cDon\u2019t let that far left-wing fringe, like antifa and stuff like that, make you think that they control the entire party,\u201d the worker said. \u201cDon\u2019t think that we all belong to that side.\u201dMr. Grady, it turned out, lived outside of Mr. Cartwright\u2019s district, but he is the sort of voter Democrats need just the same. And he remained ambivalent. \u201cI\u2019d love to go back,\u201d he said of voting Democratic. \u201cBut they got to get a whole new wave in there.\u201d\u201cGripping and grinning,\u201d a man grumbled from his folding chair as Mr. Lamb passed.A baby began to cry. \u201cI get that reaction from a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Lamb said.\u201cThere really is no playbook or master plan or strategy,\u201d he said.But Mr. Lamb has pursued a hobby of his own, as needed.When two seniors began dancing beside an inflatable bounce-house at the festival in Conway, Mr. Lamb joined them \u2014 all limbs and peer pressure \u2014 twisting and kicking to the beat.\u201cAre you allowed to just do whatever you want with your hands?\u201d he asked, mid-shuffle.Yes, he was told. There was no playbook or master plan or strategy.Matt Flegenheimer reported from Conway, Pa., and Thomas Kaplan from Tannersville, Pa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}

Netflix is working on a documentary series inspired by Dr. Lisa Sanders\u2019s New York Times Magazine column, \u201cDiagnosis,\u201d that will investigate mysterious illnesses. And a new narrative film will tell the behind-the-scenes story of how the Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor exposed decades of sexual harassment and assault allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.As those projects come together, anyone looking for a window into the paper\u2019s inner workings can check out these five documentaries, all now streaming online, for similar glimpses inside The Times.In 1978, at the age of 25, Will Shortz, The New York Times\u2019s crossword puzzle editor, held the first American Crossword Puzzle Tournament at a hotel in Stamford, Conn.

Maybe It\u2019s Not Your Fault", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rise of the new \u201cattention economy.\u201dIn doing so the companies seemed to suggest that spending time on the internet is not a desirable, healthy habit, but a pleasurable vice: one that if left uncontrolled may slip into unappealing addiction. \u201cThe liberation of human attention may be the defining moral and political struggle of our time,\u201d writes James Williams, a technologist turned philosopher and the author of a new book, \u201cStand Out of Our Light.\u201dMr. Williams, 36, should know. During a decade-long tenure at Google, he worked on search advertising, helping perfect a powerful, data-driven advertising model. Gradually, he began to feel that his life story as he knew it was coming unglued, \u201cas though the floor was crumbling under my feet,\u201d he writes.Mr. Williams compares the current design of our technology to \u201can entire army of jets and tanks\u201d aimed at capturing and keeping our attention. And the army is winning. We spend the day transfixed by our screens, thumb twitching in the subways and elevators, glancing at traffic lights.This is us: eyes glazed, mouth open, neck crooked, trapped in dopamine loops and filter bubbles. Our attention is sold to advertisers, along with our data, and handed back to us tattered and piecemeal.  Mr. Williams, 36, was speaking on Skype from his home in Moscow, where his wife, who works for the United Nations, has been posted for the year. Mr. Williams is now concerned with overwired individuals losing their life purpose.He knew that among that his colleagues, he wasn\u2019t the only one feeling this way. Speaking at a technology conference in Amsterdam last year, Mr. Williams asked the designers in the room, some 250 of them, \u201cHow many of you guys want to live in the world that you\u2019re creating? In a world where technology is competing for our attention?\u201d \u201cNot a single hand went up,\u201d he said.Mr. Williams is also far from the only example of a former soldier of big tech (to continue the army metaphor) now working to expose its cultural dangers. In late June, Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist for Google, took the stage at the Aspen Ideas Festival to warn the crowd that what we are facing is no less than an \u201cexistential threat\u201d from our very own gadgets. He likes a chess analogy. When Facebook or Google points their \u201csupercomputers\u201d toward our minds, he said, \u201cit\u2019s checkmate.\u201d Back in the more innocent days of 2013, when Mr. Williams and Mr. Harris both still worked at Google, they\u2019d meet in conference rooms and sketch out their thoughts on whiteboards: a concerned club of two at the epicenter of the attention economy. Since then, both men\u2019s messages have grown in scope and urgency. The constant pull on our attention from technology is no longer just about losing too many hours of our so-called real lives to the diversions of the web. Now, they are telling us, we are at risk of fundamentally losing our moral purpose.\u201cIt\u2019s changing our ability to make sense of what\u2019s true, so we have less and less idea of a shared fabric of truth, of a shared narrative that we all subscribe to,\u201d Mr. Harris said, the day after his Aspen talk. \u201cWithout shared truth or shared facts, you get chaos \u2014 and people can take control.\u201d But many of the biggest questions remain unanswered. At the top of that list, no smaller a mystery remains than \u201cthe relationship between attention and our conscious experience of the world,\u201d said Jesse Rissman, a neuroscientist whose lab at U.C.L.A. studies attention and memory. Also unclear: the consequence of all that screen time on our bedraggled neurons. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand how modern technology and changes in our culture impact our ability to sustain our attention on our goals,\u201d Dr. Rissman said.Britt Anderson, a neuroscientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada, went so far as to write a 2011 paper titled \u201cThere Is No Such Thing as Attention.\u201d Dr. Anderson argued that researchers have used the word to apply to so many different behaviors \u2014 attention span, attention deficit, selective attention and spatial attention, to name a few \u2014 that it has become essentially meaningless, even at the very moment when it\u2019s more relevant than ever. Despite attention\u2019s possible lack of existence, though, many among us mourn its passing \u2014 Ms. LuPone, for example, and others who command an audience, like college professors.Katherine Hayles, an English professor at U.C.L.A., has written about the change she sees in students as one from \u201cdeep attention,\u201d a state of single-minded absorption that can last for hours, to one of \u201chyper attention,\u201d which jumps from target to target, preferring to skim the surface of lots of different things than to probe the depths of just one. At Columbia University, where every student is required to pass a core curriculum with an average of 200 to 300 pages of reading each week, professors have been discussing how to deal with the conspicuous change in students\u2019 ability to get through their assignments. The curriculum has more or less stayed in place, but \u201cwe\u2019re constantly thinking about how we\u2019re teaching when attention spans have changed since 50 years ago,\u201d said Lisa Hollibaugh, a dean of academic planning at Columbia. In the 1990s, 3 to 5 percent of American school-aged children were thought to have what is now called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. By 2013, that number was 11 percent, and rising, according to data from the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health.At Tufts University, Nick Seaver, an anthropology professor, just finished his second year of teaching a class he designed called How to Pay Attention. But rather than offering tips for focusing, as one might expect, he set out to train his students to look at attention as a cultural phenomenon \u2014 \u201cthe way people talk about attention,\u201d Dr. Seaver said, with topics like the \u201cattention economy\u201d or \u201cattention and politics.\u201dAs part of their homework for the \u201ceconomy\u201d week, Dr. Seaver told his students to analyze how an app or website \u201ccaptures\u201d their attention and then profits from it. A classmate, Jake Rochford, who chose Tinder, noted the extreme stickiness of a new \u201csuper-like\u201d button. \u201cOnce the super-like button came into play, I noticed all of the functions as strategies for keeping the app open, instead of strategies for helping me find love,\u201d Mr. Rochford, 21, said. After completing that week\u2019s assignment, he disabled his account. But Dr. Seaver, 32, is no Luddite.\u201cIt can\u2019t be that there are too many things to pay attention to: That doesn\u2019t follow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could be that there are more things that are trying to actively demand your attention.\u201d And there is not only the attention we pay to consider, but also the attention we receive. Sherry Turkle, the M.I.T. sociologist and psychologist, has been writing about our relationship with our technology for decades. Devices that come with us everywhere we go, she argues, introduce a brand new dynamic: Rather than compete with their siblings for their parents\u2019 attention, children are up against iPhones and iPads, Siri and Alexa, Apple watches and computer screens. Every moment they spend with their parents, they are also spending with their parents\u2019 need to be constantly connected. It is the first generation to be so affected \u2014 now 14 to 21 years old \u2014 that Dr. Turkle describes in detail in her most recent book, \u201cReclaiming Conversation.\u201d\u201cA generation has grown up that has lived a very unsatisfying youth and really does not associate their phones with any kind of glamour, but rather with a sense of deprivation,\u201d she said.And yet Dr. Turkle is cautiously optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see people inching their way toward \u2018time well spent,\u2019 Apple inching its way toward a mea culpa,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the culture itself turning toward a recognition that this can\u2019t go on.\u201d Advertisement"}

The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.\u201cThis is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,\u201d said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, \u201crobotic process automation.\u201d The programs \u2014 often called bots \u2014 fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.The companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company\u2019s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers\u2019 compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto\u2019s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: \u201cWe\u2019re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.\u201dRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. \u201cNo one misses that work,\u201d Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,\u201d said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto\u2019s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto\u2019s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.\u201cThe long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,\u201d said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company\u2019s bots as \u201cdigital colleagues.\u201d In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.\u201cBut these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,\u201d said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. \u201cFor workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.\u201dThe recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology\u2019s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of robot you can see,\u201d Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Push for 3-D Weapons by One of the World\u2019s \u2018Most Dangerous People\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 For Cody Wilson, this week had long been in the making. For more than five years, the professed gun-rights and free-speech advocate had sought to publish online his blueprints for a downloadable gun, but had repeatedly been blocked by the federal government.Until Tuesday evening, it looked like he finally would get his way. But hours before the schematics for a 3-D gun called the Liberator were expected to be posted \u2014 so-called for the single-shot handguns that the Allies designed as an insurgency weapon in World War II \u2014 a federal judge granted a temporary nationwide injunction blocking Mr. Wilson and his company, Defense Distributed.Earlier Tuesday, standing in the front room of Defense Distributed\u2019s office in Austin, Tex., Mr. Wilson fielded calls from reporters, conducted television interviews and was ready to celebrate.\u201cIt seems like I\u2019ve crystallized the terms of the debate according to how I wanted it,\u201d Mr. Wilson said, adding that his goal was to protect both the Second and the First amendments.\u201cI still believe in the rights to keep and bear arms, and I believe what I\u2019m doing is a way of protecting them,\u201d he said, while also affirming his adherence to free speech.In one room of the Defense Distributed office hung a framed yellow front page of a newspaper describing the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II. A model of the Liberator, the printer-made pistol, was on a bookshelf. A library in the back had thousands of volumes ranging from technical journals to the works of Shakespeare.No stranger to controversy, Mr. Wilson was listed by Wired magazine as one of the 15 Most Dangerous People in the World in 2012, the year he began Defense Distributed. Included on that list were former President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, both known for involvement in crimes against humanity. In 2017, Mr. Wilson created Hatreon, a crowdfunding site that has often been used by neo-Nazi groups that were kicked off more traditional peer-to-peer websites like Patreon and PayPal. Many of the organizers of a white supremacist rally last year in Charlottesville, Va., for instance, used Hatreon to raise money for the event.Mr. Wilson dismisses the idea that publishing gun blueprints is threatening or illegal.\u201cThe argument that I\u2019m making,\u201d he said, \u201calthough not always very well, is that what I\u2019m doing is actually a pretty mainline American idea.\u201dAsked about his political views, Mr. Wilson said he has voted only once in his life: for then-Representative Ron Paul in a state race in 2008.Born in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Wilson and his family moved to Cabot, Ark., when he was in the first grade. At Cabot High School, Mr. Wilson was elected student body president. He attended the University of Central Arkansas, where he majored in English, and studied abroad in China for a semester. After graduating in 2010, he went to law school at the University of Texas.In his second year there, Mr. Wilson began tinkering with a 3-D printer to design a functional gun. By 2013, he had created his company, Defense Distributed, and published online the blueprints for a gun that were downloaded more than 100,000 times. Dropping out of law school to pursue his new idea full-time, Mr. Wilson received a letter from the State Department in May 2013 ordering him to pull his files from the internet, citing arms export laws.While Mr. Wilson, 30, has described himself as a techno-libertarian, free-speech provocateur and online heretic, his critics have said he is a media hound and a peddler of \u201copen-source terrorism.\u201dCalled \u201cghost guns\u201d because they lack serial numbers and are made almost entirely of plastic, Mr. Wilson\u2019s blueprints would allow for the mass production of untraceable firearms that could be made at home, gun control advocates have warned, including by convicted felons, terrorists or other people currently prohibited from buying them.\u201cThe people who make them will be state actors or well-financed criminal cartels who have the ability to execute well-organized criminal attacks in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.Since starting his company, Mr. Wilson has faced pushback from all sides. YouTube has repeatedly pulled his promotional videos. Once it learned of his plans, Stratasys, the company from which he leased a 3-D printer, forced him to return it. Indiegogo canceled his crowdfunding campaign, forcing him to set up a Bitcoin account to receive donations. A company called Thingiverse, which publishes user-created design files, removed all of his designs.On Monday, attorneys general in eight states filed a joint federal lawsuit in Seattle to block Defense Distributed from publishing the files online.But Tuesday morning, things were looking up. With practiced calm, Mr. Wilson answered questions from reporters while also taking calls from his lawyers and monitoring judicial hearing updates.To him, Mr. Wilson explained, the fight over the publishing of his blueprints was less about guns than it was about renegotiating the relationship between citizens and the state.\u201cI think the state should be as weak as possible relative to the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proper posture of the state is one that at least is in fear of its citizen, not one that lords over it.\u201dWhen asked about the potentially dire consequences of his 3-D printed weapons, Mr. Wilson often responds with a philosophical view. \u201cUnderstanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated,\u201d he said to Popular Science in 2012, shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting.Mr. Wilson\u2019s Twitter handle is @Radomysisky, named after the Russian revolutionary and leader of the Communist International who was executed for trying to kill Stalin. Among his heroes, Mr. Wilson cites Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a Frenchman considered by many to be the \u201cfather of anarchism.\u201dMr. Wilson is also a fan of Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal who is a staunch libertarian and funder of causes such as paying young people not to go to college. Mr. Thiel invited Mr. Wilson to a private Wyoming retreat, where the two men discussed the future of Bitcoin. Mr. Wilson was inspired by the potential of Bitcoin, an encrypted, digital currency that forgoes more traditional routes and works person to person online.The cryptocurrency\u2019s potential, he said, is to disrupt the ability of governments to raise taxes. This was partly his motivation for starting Dark Wallet in 2014, a secure online means of storing currency. With Dark Wallet, Mr. Wilson hopes to simplify Bitcoin, which can be tech-intensive and difficult to use.Mr. Wilson has said that the goal of Defense Distributed is to promote decentralized solutions in an ever-centralizing world. In recent media appearances, he said that companies like Google, Facebook and YouTube have tried to exert more control over public discourse, particularly after racial unrest last summer in Charlottesville.\u201cThey can decide at will who isn\u2019t able to participate,\u201d he told Reason magazine in April, adding that he hates Silicon Valley almost as much as he hates Washington, D.C. In the push to democratize information, Mr. Wilson has said, 3-D printers will only become revolutionary tools when they are used not for useless things like trinkets or lawn gnomes, but medical devices, drugs or guns.Mr. Wilson said that the Allies\u2019 efforts to liberate Europe in World War II partly inspired the development of the 3-D printed firearm. Before the invasion, he said, they contemplated dropping guns behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory.\u201cInstead of dropping the gun on Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cwe dropped it on the internet.\u201dSusan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andie MacDowell, Still Worth It", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "at home with \u2026One of the original 1980s model-actresses on her very modern maturity.Supported byThis early examination of digitally mediated relationships is worth a revisit: The success with which the protagonist\u2019s camera unzipped his subjects makes the Kardashians seem like pikers.The sex in that film was suggested. But in \u201cLove After Love,\u201d which entranced reviewers during an earlier theatrical release, Ms. MacDowell has the first nude scene of her long career.Hearty chuckle. With projects including playing a madcap American in the fifth season of \u201cCuckoo,\u201d a British farce, out later this year, and a bohemian hippie sidekick to Richard Dreyfuss and Chevy Chase in \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d for early 2019 (both on Netflix), Ms. MacDowell can afford to relax this summer. If only she could.It was teatime late last month, and Ms. MacDowell was sitting on a well-worn sofa upholstered in a faded cabbage rose print in the living room of her modest ranch house, mildly exasperated by her inability to recall the names of two current movie stars. A wheezy, nervous, rescued Chihuahua-Boston terrier mix named Ava Gardner clung to her lap as the actress, whose beauty still startles, explained how a 2016 film, \u201cCertain Women,\u201d was an exemplar of the kind of work she\u2019d like to be doing. Though she couldn\u2019t actually remember the title.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrific movie,\u201d she said, \u201cLaura Dern is in it and that girl from the vampire movies, what\u2019s her name? And that actress from Montana. Names! What the hell is that all about?\u201d(Why not Google? Because at a certain age, there is honor in eschewing that mnemonic short cut.)\u201cMichelle Williams!\u201d she said triumphantly, referring to a star of \u201cCertain Women.\u201dMs. MacDowell herself has passed in and out of stardom, as a model turned actress who never quite got her due, especially for her calm comic presence (she was marvelous in \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d). Often she was cast as a somewhat elusive, well-scrubbed ideal (as in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d in which she somehow made a fisherman\u2019s sweater seem sexier than a bikini). As has been the case for many beautiful women, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s extraordinary face has sometimes confused those seeking to employ her as an actress. Born in Gaffney, S.C., she came up as a model in the late 1970s, her rosy cheeks and untamed hair a welcome alternative to the sleek blondes \u2014 Cybill, Christie and Cheryl \u2014 who had dominated that decade. Since 1985, she has been under contract to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, that company\u2019s longest reigning spokesperson. In ads for Calvin Klein jeans, Ms. MacDowell improvised a naughtier sort of down-home girl. She is proud that Ram Dass is one of her over 45,000 followers and amused that Deepak Chopra followed her for one day. (He wanted to invite her to an event by direct message, she said. \u201cThen he unfollowed me. Whatever. I don\u2019t care. I have Ram Dass!\u201d)Yet in 2016, she was slammed as an elitist when she posted a selfie from an American Airlines flight that carried this caption: \u201cHELP, I paid for first-class and they put me in tourist because of my dog that I pre-booked and paid for.\u201d She was carrying Ava Gardner, whom she had just rescued, from Los Angeles to Charleston, S.C., and a steward bumped her to coach, saying there wasn\u2019t enough room in first class. Twitterers didn\u2019t like the word \u201ctourist,\u201d nor did they like a complainer, they complained.Ms. MacDowell\u2019s gracious response, offering to donate her refund to charity and noting how she\u2019d let the flight attendant\u2019s rudeness rub off on her, may serve as primer for more impulsive celebrities. She is lately more sanguine about the trolls, she said. \u201cPeople tell me I\u2019m not relevant anymore, blah, blah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut who wants to be relevant? It\u2019s a lot of work, to stay in that place forever. I\u2019ve never wanted to sell myself. All I ever wanted was for someone to take me seriously.\u201d\u201cShe was of the stature and the sort of person I wanted to impress,\u201d Ms. MacDowell said. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want to sell myself now, either. I\u2019m 60, for godsakes! There\u2019s this artist I saw at the Tate, a video artist, and she was so like me. She\u2019d set up her camera and come down in the morning and lean in like this,\u201d \u2014 Ms. MacDowell leaned forth, solemnly, and dropped her voice an octave \u2014 \u201cand say, \u2018Good morning.\u2019 And then in the evening she\u2019d come back and say, \u2018Good night\u2019. If I knew how to do my Instagram, I\u2019d be just like her. And if I could remember her name and meet her, I think she would like me and we\u2019d be friends.\u201dMs. MacDowell has quietly been part of this flowering.The experiences of her character in \u201cLove After Love\u201d \u2014 her sexual explorations, her sometimes hapless dating encounters and adult sons \u2014 dovetail somewhat with her own. Her son, Justin Qualley, who works in real estate in Montana, is 31; her daughters Rainey Qualley, a pop singer, and Margaret Qualley, an actress, are 28 and 23. Their father is Paul Qualley, a former model and contractor from whom Ms. MacDowell has been divorced for nearly two decades. She was married briefly to Rhett Hartzog, a businessman, whom she divorced in 2004. Having raised her children first here in Montana, and then in Asheville, N.C., where she was known as Rose Qualley, she is newly an empty nester and experimenting with life in Los Angeles, her first true immersion in that company town.\u201cYou know what\u2019s great?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a nobody there. Nobody cares that I\u2019m a movie star, whatever that is. Because everyone else is, too.\u201d Regarding solitude, she said, \u201cI do know from experience what\u2019s it like to be alone, but I am good at it. And I do know sadness. You can\u2019t get to my age without having felt some kind of intense pain.\u201dAt 23, Ms. MacDowell was working as a model in Paris when her mother died of heart failure. She was 53, and had been a severe alcoholic. Ms. MacDowell, the youngest of four daughters, had been her mother\u2019s caretaker: plucking the smoldering cigarettes from her fingers when she passed out on the floor and covering her with a blanket. When Ms. MacDowell was 16, she staged an intervention, which failed, and when her mother was fired from her job at the McDonald\u2019s where they both worked, it was Ms. MacDowell who drove her to work on that last day because her mother had lost her driver\u2019s license. \u201cInterestingly enough,\u201d she went on, \u201cwe had a good relationship. I had a lot of empathy for her. I was the last one home, and I didn\u2019t want to leave her like that.\u201dA few months before she died, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s mother wrote her a letter. \u201cShe told me she quit drinking,\u201d she said, \u201cand that she was very proud of me and that I deserved to have a mother who was sober. I was supposed to go home for Thanksgiving, but I did not. I really regret that. I\u2019m always trying to grab ahold of my children and spend time with them. I have to remember it\u2019s natural at that age to want to experience the world on your own.\u201dA few years ago, Ms. MacDowell was on another flight and began talking with her seat mate. \u201cWe had a nice chat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end she told me, \u2018I\u2019m a mindfulness therapist and I just wanted to tell you that you have a lot of anxiety.\u2019 Yeah, no kidding!\u201d Indeed, she said, being anxious is her legacy and that she\u2019s been amusing herself by trying to break down her tics (the constant motion of her hands, for example), so she can use them in her work. Russ Harbaugh, the 34-year-old director of \u201cLove After Love,\u201d said his first choice for the role was a more conventional bet, an older actress with three Oscar nominations who left before he was able to secure financing. There was some pressure to cast a surer box office wager, but all along Mr. Harbaugh felt that Ms. MacDowell would be, as he put it, transformative. On the night before filming was to begin, she called him into her hotel room. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d he recalled Ms. MacDowell saying.\u201cI think she was honestly feeling not good enough,\u201d Mr. Harbaugh said. \u201cSo I told her the story of how she was cast. In this business, you don\u2019t want people to feel like they\u2019re not your first choice but she didn\u2019t need me to lie to her. I wanted her to know that I sought her out.\u201dMs. MacDowell remembers the exchange differently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I could do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that the relationship between Russ and Chris\u201d \u2014 O\u2019Dowd, who plays one of her sons \u2014 \u201cwas so strong, I felt left out. There didn\u2019t seem to be any room for me. I didn\u2019t have any reservations about the role. I needed to know that he wanted me. I wanted to know that I was supposed to be there. I felt like the seventh child in a family that nobody notices. I guess I wanted to know that he loved me, and once I had that, I felt safe.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Seeking a Return to China, Is Said to Be Building a Censored Search Engine", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGoogle has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added.Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google\u2019s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available.Google\u2019s work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership.Amnesty International said it would be a \u201cdark day for internet freedom\u201d and would constitute \u201ca gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom\u201d if the tech giant accepted China\u2019s censorship terms.One internal posting that was viewed by The New York Times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so, opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company. Some employees said the work was a violation of Google\u2019s previous statements about its stance on Chinese censorship, as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights.\u201cWe provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,\u201d said Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman. \u201cBut we don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201dIn the years since Google\u2019s exit, local competitors have risen up, including China\u2019s dominant search engine, Baidu. Beyond search, the vast majority of Google\u2019s services, including its app store, email service and YouTube, remain inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country\u2019s system of internet controls is known.Talks between Google and the Chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the United States and China, one of the people said. The talks were not going well, this person added.But the Chinese government could nonetheless use Google as a chip in its negotiations with the American government, which has been critical of the way China limits market access for United States technology companies. By letting Google\u2019s search engine back into China, the Chinese government could give President Trump a political victory, earning some good will.For Google, China is an increasingly difficult market to navigate. The Chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since President Xi Jinping came into power five years ago.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Challenge Is America\u2019s Opportunity", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Reif is president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.American tensions with China over international trade spring partly from concerns that China gives tax breaks to its companies to boost their exports, restricts access to its markets, forces foreign companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies, steals intellectual property and pursues industrial espionage.Expert, decisive action is needed to stop these practices in defense of fair international competition and America\u2019s strategic and commercial interests. But it would be a mistake to think that an aggressive defense alone will somehow prevent China\u2019s technological success \u2014 or ensure America\u2019s own.China is not an innovation also-ran that prospers mainly by copying other people\u2019s ideas and producing them quickly at low cost. The country is advancing aggressively to assert technological supremacy in critical fields of science and technology.In short, stopping intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices \u2014 even if fully effective \u2014 would not allow the United States to relax back into a position of unquestioned innovation leadership. Unless America responds urgently and deliberately to the scale and intensity of this challenge, we should expect that, in fields from personal communications to business, health and security, China is likely to become the world\u2019s most advanced technological nation and the source of the most cutting-edge technological products in not much more than a decade.But China\u2019s technological dominance is not inevitable. The United States has tremendous assets, including the immense global strength of our technology sector. This partly depends on a unique formula no other country has been able to copy: the large number of first-rate American universities pursuing advanced research with long-term federal support. This relationship is rooted in a national culture of opportunity and entrepreneurship, inspired by an atmosphere of intellectual freedom, supported by the rule of law and, crucially, pushed to new creative heights by uniting brilliant talent from every sector of our society and every corner of the world. For decades, these factors have helped make our nation the most powerful scientific and technological engine on Earth.Every American can take pride in this distinctive system. But there is nothing automatic about its excellence.We also need to take a fresh look at industry-university-government partnerships as mechanisms for strategic co-investment in early-stage research. In the 1980s, such efforts, though far from perfect, helped the American semiconductor industry survive and thrive. Stressing what worked and discarding what didn\u2019t, we need to collaborate actively across those three sectors in the same spirit now to make our entire innovation system faster and more effective, so ideas generated in the United States get to market in the United States first.At the same time, government, industry, schools and universities should boldly develop our homegrown talent, of every age and in communities across the country. An enduring benefit of the G.I. Bill and America\u2019s response to Sputnik was that Americans became, for some decades, the best educated people on Earth, and we can do it again.Finally, we should make sure we have an immigration system that welcomes the best talent from anywhere in the world, so that people hungry for opportunity continue to see America as the best place for their education and the best place to spend their lives and careers, enabling the United States to reap the benefit of their creativity and drive.Cultivating these assets will also provide a position of strength as the United States negotiates to stop unfair business and market practices.As a nation, the United States needs to change its focus from merely reacting to China\u2019s actions to building a farsighted national strategy for sustaining American leadership in science and innovation. If all we do in response to China\u2019s ambition is to try to double-lock all our doors, I believe we will lock ourselves into mediocrity. But if we in the United States respect China as a rising competitor with many strengths we can learn from, that view will inspire America to be its incomparable best.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New York Times Reviews Neil Simon", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA look at the work of Neil Simon over the decades reveals a prolific chronicler of New York City life who examined angst, romance and ambition through a comic lens, whether for the stage, film or television. Critics, like audiences in general, were mixed in their response to Mr. Simon\u2019s comedy, which tended toward shticky one-liners and heart-squeezing monologues. Here is a look at his most notable works, how The New York Times reviewed them and (when available) where you can stream them.\u201cMr. Simon evidently has no aspirations except to be diverting, and he achieves those with the dash of a highly skilled professional writer,\u201d Mr. Taubman wrote.In his review, Mr. Taubman wrote of Mr. Simon: \u201cHis skill \u2014 and it is not only great but constantly growing \u2014 lies in his gift for the deliciously surprising line and attitude. His instinct for incongruity is faultless. It nearly always operates on a basis of character.\u201dThe film was remade in 1999 with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, but without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.Mr. Simon, he wrote, \u201chas taken the trouble to trouble his people, tease the laughs to see what real woes lie beneath them. He has made a magnificent effort to part company with the mechanical, and his overall success stands as handsome proof that humor and honesty can be got into bed together. But in winnowing out the last traces of contrived situation comedy, Mr. Simon may also have thrown away situation itself.\u201dThe Farrelly Brothers remade the film in 2007 with Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan and Malin Akerman, without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.That same month, CBS aired a new TV movie of the play, again adapted by Mr. Simon and updated to the 1990s, with Woody Allen and Peter Falk in the leading roles.Two years later, Mr. Simon and the director Robert Moore teamed up once again with Mr. Falk and Ms. Brennan for \u201cThe Cheap Detective,\u201d in which (as in \u201cMurder by Death\u201d), Mr. Falk starred as a Humphrey Bogart-style private investigator.Mr. Simon received his third Academy Award nomination for this original screenplay, in which a newly dumped single mother (Marsha Mason) is forced into an \u201cOdd Couple\u201d-style relationship with a guitar-strumming, yoga-practicing new-to-New-York actor (Richard Dreyfuss). They initially drive each other crazy but, of course, eventually fall in love. Mr. Dreyfuss won the Oscar for best actor; in addition to Mr. Simon\u2019s script, the film was nominated for best actress, best supporting actress (for Quinn Cummings) and best picture.In a reversal of his usual migration, Mr. Simon subsequently adapted the film script for the stage. The Broadway musical version of \u201cThe Goodbye Girl\u201d debuted in February 1993 and ran 188 performances, with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short in the leads.Nine years later, Mr. Simon removed the music and rewrote the script again for a TV movie adaptation, directed by Richard Benjamin.

{"Headline": "How Civil Must America Be?", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans care about being nice. How do we disagree with our neighbors about guns?The shop\u2019s name stems from a term of derision for the teetotaling, lecture-friendly Congregationalists who settled the town in the 1850s. Those days are long over. Grinnellians now tend to keep any impulse to hector one of their neighbors under wraps.Pete Brownell, a well-known and well-liked local philanthropist, sometimes stops by Saints Rest for coffee on his way to work. He and his wife, Helen Redmond, have supported many projects in town, including a public library renovation and a residency program run by a local artists\u2019 collective. He is also the third-generation C.E.O. of Brownells, a major firearms company whose headquarters are here, which calls itself the country\u2019s \u201cleading supplier of firearm accessories, gun parts, and gunsmithing tools.\u201d Brownells sells and manufactures guns and ammunition. For much of the last year, Mr. Brownell also served as chairman of the board of the National Rifle Association.Grinnell is both progressive bastion and gun town, a place urbane and rural. It is home to an influential liberal arts college with an endowment of more than $1 billion, and also a Monsanto plant. Usually, these juxtapositions are a point of pride, if they are noteworthy at all.The first thing most everyone says is that the Brownells are good, generous people. Their children all go to school together. Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond care very much about making Grinnell a good place to live for everyone. The second thing people say is that they want to protect the family\u2019s privacy. Mr. Brownell\u2019s family did not choose his occupation, people point out. Besides, Ms. Redmond, who is president of the board of the Grinnell-Newburg Community School District, votes Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She has donated to the progressive state-level political action committee her neighbors created last year. Everyone is clear that Pete Brownell\u2019s politics are his own.And while Ms. Abrahamson quietly resigned from the board of a community arts center when she realized that the group has accepted money from the Brownells, she did not say so at the time. Then, in 2016, Brownells opened a massive new warehouse, office and retail complex on the outskirts of town. It looms over Interstate 80. In May 2017, Mr. Brownell became the president of the N.R.A.\u2019s board. \u201cEach of these things were pushing people toward discomfort,\u201d Mr. Dobe said. \u201cLas Vegas broke it open.\u201dThis disquiet eventually bubbled up online. \u201cIt was clear that people had been holding back their feelings,\u201d said Eliza Willis, a professor of political science at Grinnell. A local Facebook group gave them the space to express their feelings. \u201cAll these people came out of the community making comments and expressing unhappiness about the facility and about his election to the presidency of the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Willis said.Others expressed their disagreement and their concern for the Brownell family\u2019s privacy. \u201cIt got quite active and a little heated,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a unified feeling about this.\u201dThe fracas also underscored the fact that no one seemed to have talked to Mr. Brownell about any of it directly. A day or two after the Las Vegas shooting, Ms. Abrahamson said, she phoned his office to invite him to meet with her and another pastor, Cameron Barr, to discuss ways they might \u201cwork together to increase gun safety.\u201d She said that her overture, which she repeated in a Facebook message, received no response.A week later, other members of the Grinnellians for Change Facebook group sent a letter asking for Mr. Brownell\u2019s attention. It was signed by 170 people and published in the Grinnell Herald-Register. The group wrote: \u201cNowhere are mutuality and reciprocity more important than in a small town such as ours.\u201d Mr. Dobe characterized their message this way: \u201cNow that you\u2019re the president of the N.R.A., we think you kind of owe us a conversation.\u201dAgain, Mr. Brownell did not answer. \u201cPete Brownell did not respond as a neighbor,\u201d said Kesho Scott, an associate professor of sociology and American studies at Grinnell. Ms. Scott\u2019s and Mr. Brownell\u2019s daughters are friends and sleep over at each other\u2019s houses. The parents see each other at the bank. \u201cAll of a sudden he wasn\u2019t responding to his neighbors,\u201d Ms. Scott said. Friends of the Brownells, including the Grinnell city manager, Russ Behrens, say that neighborliness is a two-way street. Members of his family had seen the Facebook group\u2019s angry, frustrated posts and comments, a couple of which suggested confronting Mr. Brownell with a vigil at his home. \u201cThere were people that could have sat in a room and had a conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. He and other friends have talked privately in the past with Mr. Brownell about his views on gun safety. He felt things got out of hand online. \u201cBy that time Pete almost had to go to his corner because they had already kind of set the message in and made their attacks. Nothing good was going to happen from that point on.\u201d \u201cIt really prevented any type of conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said.Mr. Brownell did meet with George Drake, a former president of the college who has been working with Ms. Abrahamson and others, on the condition that Mr. Drake keep the conversation confidential. Mr. Brownell\u2019s neighbors say they want to build on whatever common ground they share with him on gun politics. First, they have to know what that might be. (He also declined to speak with me.)His public remarks have been unsurprising in the national conversation, but also strike some as unneighborly. He echoes the N.R.A.\u2019s talking points on the Second Amendment, repeating that people he characterizes as \u201canti-American\u201d are trying to take away guns, which are our national heritage. He has a familiar mix of gun politic signifiers about ecological preservation, wildlife restoration, respect for military veterans, police and emergency medical workers. He has also said that he wants the N.R.A. to be an inclusive organization that supports L.G.B.T.Q. gun owners and other marginalized groups.Mr. Brownell\u2019s tone never fully matched the most aggressive rhetoric stemming from the N.R.A., like that of Dana Loesch, of its spokeswomen. Ms. Abrahamson and others said that they had hoped Mr. Brownell was going to use his role to modulate the N.R.A.\u2019s tone over what was supposed to be a two-year term. Nothing he has said in public suggests that he did. His neighbors may want to believe that his so-called real views, the ones he would share in private, are different from what he has said publicly. They also suspect it may not really matter. Like it or not \u2014 and many do like it \u2014 gun money does a lot for Grinnell.They have also supported a robotics team at Grinnell-Newburg High School. They have contributed to the Grinnell Area Arts Council and the Poweshiek County Community Fund.Brownells Inc., the gun company, has become an integral part of the economic health of the city. Alongside the college, Grinnell Mutual Insurance Company and the Grinnell Regional Medical Center, it is among Poweshiek County\u2019s largest employers. Founded in nearby Montezuma in 1939, where its headquarters were until 2016, Brownells was a relatively small and specialized business for its first 60 years. Since Mr. Brownell joined the company as an executive vice president in 1997, Brownells has acquired three other firearms companies, become a military defense contractor, secured a patent for its online ordering system, opened a retail store and undergone two expansions, the first of which the company almost immediately outgrew upon its completion in 2011. Reversing the trend, Mr. Behrens said, was the city\u2019s primary consideration in courting the relocation. The Brownells expansion was expected to create at least 162 new jobs in Grinnell and stimulate the city\u2019s housing market. There was almost no public opposition to the Brownells project. Records say that no one appeared for the scheduled public comment session held immediately before the City Council signed an initial development agreement in November 2012. With the exception of one letter to the editor of the Grinnell Herald-Register, Mr. Behrens said, \u201cThere was no pushback from the community at all,\u201d in part because there was great value in keeping a three-generation family business \u2014 \u201chopefully soon to be fourth,\u201d he added \u2014 in Poweshiek County. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we went out and recruited some random gun manufacturer,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. \u201cThis was about the expansion of an existing industry. We today have no reservations about doing it, and we would do it again.\u201dThis, says Kirsten Klepfer, the pastor of Grinnell\u2019s First Presbyterian Church, \u201cwoke me up.\u201d A week after the shooting, she preached an uncomfortable sermon at the Sunday morning service. \u201cIf we think there\u2019s no connection between Orlando and Brownells, we\u2019re probably not thinking hard enough,\u201d she said. Ms. Klepfer told her congregation that, the day before the store opened, she had approached Brownells seeking financial support for a new behavioral health program that was having a cash flow crisis. She subsequently withdrew the request. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d she told her congregants. It had become clear to her that \u201cwe like them when they pump our community full of money, we turn our eyes when they pump our communities full of guns.\u201d She has since told another mental health organization she works with that she believes they should not take donations from Brownells.Ms. Klepfer, the church\u2019s leader for over a decade, may be the person with the strongest principled objection to what she sees as the community\u2019s complicity in the firearms industry. She may also be the person who struggles least with the moral complexity and social risk of raising such objections. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019re not a big church,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s mostly me.\u201d The Pulse shooting also moved Janet Carl, the recently retired director of the college\u2019s writing center, to action. Ms. Carl, who represented Grinnell in the Iowa Assembly for six years in the 1980s, said that the shooting prompted her to submit a letter to the Grinnell Herald-Register, the first she had ever written. After it ran, she was contacted by three other people who wanted to become more active on gun safety, colleagues who had had no idea that they shared her concerns. This was the origin of an ad hoc organizing group, which grew after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The group planned several weeks of protests and educational events to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, including a silent walk to the Brownells facility. The \u201cNewtown\u201d screening took place on the college campus but was not a school-sponsored event, and the college has largely stayed out of local politics. Every faculty or staff member I spoke to was careful to say their efforts do not represent their employer. And the students, whatever their reputation for rabble-rousing, have not participated much in this off-campus effort. It was Grinnell alumni who brought the debate to campus. Shortly after Mr. Brownell became president of the N.R.A., Alana K. Smart, a 1968 Grinnell graduate, raised the question of whether the school, founded by an abolitionist, ought to accept money from the family. Ms. Smart, a chairwoman of Colorado Faith Communities United to End Gun Violence, discovered that the Brownells had made a named gift in to the college in 2014. Their gift helped create the Ignite Program, a community engagement effort that brings local elementary and high school students to campus. Ms. Smart and her classmates formed a group called Concerned Alumni of Grinnell College and set about expressing their concerns to the school. In October, members of the campus community learned about the alumni reaction through reporting in the student newspaper. This caught the attention of some faculty members. In June 2018, representatives of the Concerned Alumni group, on campus for their 50th reunion, delivered a petition to the college on behalf of 500 signatories. They asked the college to reject further gifts from Mr. Brownell, because he represents the N.R.A.\u2019s \u201cdeleterious impacts on the quality of American life.\u201d At the meeting, Raynard S. Kington, the president of Grinnell College, declined this prospect of vetting individual donors\u2019 affiliations before accepting gifts, calling it logistically onerous and ethically murky. Mr. Kington, appointed in 2011, has previously suggested that the disagreement over the donation is part of the college\u2019s educational commitment to facilitating civil debate over conflicting viewpoints. (\u201cGrinnellians,\u201d campus marketing copy reads, \u201cask hard questions and question easy answers.\u201d) She was chastised by members of the administration during a break in the meeting, she said, for her reporting. She was approached by Angela Voos, the vice president for strategic planning and Mr. Kington\u2019s chief of staff. \u201c\u2018Really? Again?\u2019\u201d Ms. Herman said Ms. Voos said, as she waved a copy of the newspaper. Ms. Voos complained that the story\u2019s characterization of Mr. Brownell as \u201c\u2018a major benefactor of college and community programs and organizations\u2019\u201d was \u201c\u2018misleading.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kington, Ms. Herman said, joined the conversation to agree. Ms. Voos told The New York Times that her memory of the episode is different, but that \u201cthe basis of the interaction is correct.\u201d Ms. Herman, she said, \u201cchose to combine a donor\u2019s philanthropy to the college with his philanthropy to the local community and then to conclude that he is a \u2018major benefactor\u2019 of the college.\u201d (Ms. Voos added that the Ignite program also had other internal funding sources.)In any event, the college says it cannot legally disclose the details of individual contributions without permission from the donor. It is possible that Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond have made or will make additional gifts under different disclosure conditions.Ms. Willis argued that accepting Brownell\u2019s money is effectively an endorsement of the N.R.A. \u201cThe college confers legitimacy by taking that donation,\u201d she said, contravening the institution\u2019s professed commitment to social justice. (Mr. Rebelsky and many other faculty members said they disagreed.) Ms. Willis also noted that the college, committed to improved town-gown relations, had much to gain by accepting a donation to start a program \u201caiming to educate kids in this community that aren\u2019t the children of college professors.\u201dThe college, Ms. Voos said, is proud of the program: \u201cWe see it as an extension of our mission to our local public schools.\u201d She notes that about a third of local elementary and high school students live in households that are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and few have had much exposure to \u201cthe college experience,\u201d even in this college town. The program has just finished its fourth year. In other ways, the college and Brownells Inc. share similar goals as stewards of the local economy. City administrators have pinned their hopes for a revitalized downtown on both. In 2014, the city and the Brownells company jointly applied for funds from the Iowa Economic Development Authority. They were unsuccessful, but the city and the college received joint funding the following year, which was partly to support what the school calls its \u201cZone of Confluence\u201d project. A two-lane highway that divides the campus and the downtown area has long been a physical manifestation of the town-gown divide. The college and city government hope that investing in this area will connect the campus to the community and bring more money downtown. Here, it seems, everyone agrees.While he has not accepted \u2014 or rejected \u2014 invitations to speak with his neighbors, Mr. Brownell has, in his public role, spoken about them. Many of his remarks to N.R.A. members have traded on stereotypes about liberals. To the considerable anger of these neighbors, he positioned himself as the bemused and indulgent teacher of big-city professor types. In a 2010 profile that appeared on an N.R.A. website, Mr. Brownell took credit for creating what he called \u201ca gun culture\u201d at the college and for educating Grinnell students and faculty members about firearms. \u201cPrevious anti-gun sentiment at the college has been offset by an open-mindedness that never would have existed without a little push from Pete,\u201d the story said. In a 2011 interview posted on the N.R.A. YouTube channel, Mr. Brownell said that the students \u201chave never really broken through those things that somebody told them at a young age, and they\u2019ve never really experimented with changing their thoughts about just a larger picture.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, he had turned \u201ca couple of New York City professors\u201d into gun enthusiasts who visit shooting ranges when they travel. \u201cThese trips are \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Metropolitan Opera and on the way let\u2019s take our pistols.\u2019\u201d Few people had even seen these remarks until Ms. Smart unearthed them last year. Mr. Kington, the college president, agreed in June to denounce Mr. Brownell\u2019s statements about taking giddy Grinnell faculty members to the shooting range.No one I spoke to had any idea who he might have been talking about, nor did they remember Mr. Brownell ever coming to campus to discuss these issues. But they would not necessarily object if he did. Lecturing about \u201csomething he has expertise on,\u201d like the Second Amendment, Ms. Willis said, \u201cwould be completely keeping within an academic institution, the idea of critical thinking, all of that.\u201d All paths actually don\u2019t cross at Saints Rest. Anyone in Grinnell will tell you that there are three kinds of people in town: the college students, the \u201cCollege people\u201d \u2014 faculty, staff and the white-collar professionals in that orbit, which even includes clergy like Ms. Klepfer and Ms. Abrahamson \u2014 and \u201ceveryone else.\u201d There\u2019s another early-morning kaffeeklatsch at the Hardees across Highway 146, just outside of downtown. At lunchtime, farm-to-table Prairie Canary is a popular Main Street lunch spot, but lots of people head to the West Side Family Restaurant a mile away.\u201cCollege people\u201d have been the most involved in these debates. They recognize that they need to bring \u201ceveryone else\u201d into the conversation \u2014 Grinnell natives, farmers, blue-collar workers, Brownells employees, hospital staff \u2014 but have so far struggled to connect. \u201cThere are certainly people on both extremes that want to make an issue out of this,\u201d said Mr. Behrens, the city manager. But \u201cmost people in Grinnell go about their daily business. They\u2019re glad Brownells is here, they\u2019re glad the college is here.\u201d Whatever political conflict there might be \u201cnever really surfaces.\u201dSome people do cut cross all the cultures. Molly Miller\u2019s maternal grandparents owned both a farm in Poweshiek County and a diner downtown. She grew up in Iowa City, but she and her sister attended Grinnell College, and she lives and works in town. Ms. Miller, too, likes the Brownells. She also says their family\u2019s comfort comes at the expense of her family\u2019s own. In November 1991, her mother, Ann Rhodes, was a vice president at the University of Iowa when a physics graduate student shot and killed three department faculty members and a postdoctoral researcher and injured two administrators in another building, before killing himself. Ms. Rhodes, who was also the university\u2019s spokeswoman and tasked with handling the aftermath, was among the first to come upon a wounded colleague, who died the following day. Ms. Miller was just an infant at the time. She grew up knowing that the shooting had a lasting effect on her mother\u2019s physical and mental health, and on her family. \u201cI\u2019m going to inherit my family\u2019s farm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if my family\u2019s farm was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year, I think I would find a different livelihood.\u201d At the Fraternal Order of the Eagles club, I settled in for a beer ($1.75 a pint, frosted mug!) next to Steve Hardeman and his friends Teresa Coon and Roger Van Donselaar. Dr. Coon is a family physician, and engaged to Mr. Van Donselaar, a Grinnell native who has owned a farm for over 30 years. Mr. Hardeman, too, is a native who works in farming. Mr. Hardeman and Mr. Van Donselaar both grew up around firearms. Dr. Coon only recently relocated to Grinnell after more than two decades in the Quad Cities region of northwest Illinois and southeastern Iowa, a metropolitan area of nearly 400,000 people, where she ran a women\u2019s health medical practice for 25 years. Mr. Van Donselaar was pleasantly surprised when she managed to get him to have dinner at Prairie Canary. Ms. Coon does not share their views on firearms, which she cheerfully contested while jabbing Mr. Hardeman on the arm for emphasis. He was quite patient with this, up to a point.No one at the bar made fun of me when I timidly mentioned bump-fire stocks. (These accessories modify a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the firing rate of an automatic.) Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting, where a dozen bump stocks were found in the gunman\u2019s hotel room, retailers like Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stopped carrying them. Pages cached by the internet Archive and Google show that Brownells also removed the products from their online inventory sometime after Sept. 29, 2017; a company representative did not respond to a request to confirm the products\u2019 removal.For gun control advocates, this seems like a victory, and it may be \u2014 or it may not. State and local bump stock bans face legal challenges, and local ordinances banning the devices in Ohio have been overturned. More to the point, Mr. Hardeman said that he or most anyone at the bar could rig a semiautomatic firearm to simulate an automatic fire rate in 15 minutes, no bump stock needed. Brownells continues to carry parts and accessories that achieve similar results, including binary trigger modification parts, which ship to 44 states.Mr. Hardeman told me a familiar story. He is proud that he was able to contribute to his impoverished household in his boyhood by hunting small game. When he hears that gun owners are irresponsible, he tells me, he\u2019s affronted. To him, his neighbors are lumping him and his friends in with a group to which they don\u2019t belong. He said it seems impossible to talk with them. \u201cLiberals want to take my guns,\u201d he said. Virtually everyone in Grinnell has taken great care to say that they do not want to take anyone\u2019s guns. This includes Ms. Abrahamson and Ms. Scott, who says that the distinction between gun control and gun safety matters. \u201cMany of us are gun owners,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to challenge the Second Amendment. We just want to know if there\u2019s safety where there are guns. This is not an anti-movement.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s what I hear all the time,\u201d Mr. Hardeman said, throwing up his hands. Before I could ask, the bartender set another frosted mug in front of me. \u201cNo, someone else got it for you,\u201d she said when I tried to pay.After all this not talking, few people seem to have thought about what they might actually say to Pete Brownell. \u201cPeople keep telling me they want to have a conversation,\u201d said Don A. Smith, an emeritus professor of history, emphasizing the last three words. \u201cWhen I ask them what they wish to have a conversation about, they say they don\u2019t know!\u201dMany people I spoke to brought up the concept of \u201cIowa nice\u201d in our conversations. During my visit, I ferried four hardy senior ladies back downtown after a protest across the highway from Brownells. I asked them whether there\u2019s any difference between Iowa, Midwestern and Minnesota nice. Everyone laughed, and someone piped up from the back seat, \u201cNo, but ours is better!\u201d \u201cIowa nice\u201d could be the solution or the problem. The social contracts of small-town life seem rather less sturdy these days. No amount of moral clarity or urgency has made it possible to overcome the hurdle of getting people \u201con all sides\u201d to talk to one another, even as they talk to one another about dozens of other things every day. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want his family hurt \u2014 and I mean in their spirit. I don\u2019t even know if we have that kind of effect on them or not. But I just think in a small town you just have to be more careful with each other.\u201dThe person who circulates among and across all these local tribes with the most ease is Mr. Brownell \u2014 certainly because of his wealth, if not also because of his fluency in the cultures that collide or coexist here. Our cultural ideas about civility and respect incline his neighbors to accept his silence. While many debate their right to carry big guns or their complicity in the gun epidemic, Mr. Brownell is, it seems, the only one who does not need to answer.Ms. Willis, a fifth-generation Iowan, calls the phenomenon \u201cIowa polite.\u201d And she said it had been tested. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of hard to maintain, because there\u2019s a sense of frustration that he won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have maintained it.\u201d Surely it can\u2019t last. In May, Mr. Brownell declined to serve a second year as N.R.A. president and was replaced by Oliver North. He remains a member of the organization\u2019s board of directors. His work is not over. Last month, a group of Senate Democrats asked Mr. Brownell and six other N.R.A. leaders for details about a 2015 trip to Moscow. There, the delegation met Maria Butina, who was charged last month with being a covert Russian agent in an investigation unrelated to the probe by Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel.After the Parkland, Fla., shooting in February, stickers with the Brownells logo and the text \u201cBrownells, where school shootings are good for business\u201d appeared on walls and fixtures across downtown Grinnell. No one would say who was responsible for them. It was a strong breach of the oppressive contract of niceness. But it wasn\u2019t the only speech taking place in the public sphere. On my way out of town, I heard a radio spot advertising the can\u2019t-miss Brownells Second Amendment Sale that weekend.Advertisement"}

What are the most important tech tools for doing your job?I\u2019m a really big fan of tracking oneself to get a better view of the behaviors and habits we don\u2019t really think about, so a lot of the tech tools I use regularly at work or otherwise are software.What\u2019s so great about these tools, and what could be better?It\u2019s so easy to lie to ourselves or bury our heads in the sand about things we\u2019d like to be better at; like how it\u2019s easy to ignore your bank account unless it\u2019s payday.
