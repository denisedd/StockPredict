{"Headline": "This Conspiracy Theory Should Worry Trump", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen two or more people join together to break the law, as Michael Cohen says he and the president did, the penalties can be harsh. Mr. Katyal was an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration.His defense then evolved to denying any personal responsibility for those actions. Predictably, Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement on Tuesday destroyed that defense, too, after he told a federal judge under oath that the president had directed him to arrange payments to the two women, who claim to have had affairs with Mr. Trump, \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election.\u201d Now President Trump has moved on to a new defense, claiming that what he did wasn\u2019t a crime and so it can\u2019t be prosecuted. That argument has no basis, either, and is inconsistent with centuries of Anglo-American law.Here\u2019s the new Trump argument, stripped down to its essence: It was clear that he would reimburse Mr. Cohen for those payments to the women, and he\u2019s allowed under Supreme Court precedent to give his campaign as much of his own money as he wants to. But, the Trump defenders say, reporting violations happen all the time, and that is certainly true. But there are two facets that make the Trump reporting violations criminally significant, as opposed to a misdemeanor oversight or bureaucratic snafu: It appears to have been an intentional end-run around the campaign finance laws and to involve a conspiracy. Each of these points explains why the new Trump argument will fail. Criminal law focuses on mens rea, or criminal intent. This means the very same act can be criminal if done with one state of mind and innocent if done with another. It is a mistake to think about Mr. Cohen\u2019s allegations as some sort of routine paperwork error. Structuring a transaction to intentionally avoid reporting it as required by the law is a very serious offense, not a technical one that can be forgiven. That is particularly true of the secret payments to the two women, which, had they been disclosed before the election, as they should have been, might have altered the outcome. The answer is that it isn\u2019t the same crime, and hasn\u2019t been thought of that way in the Anglo-American legal tradition for over 500 years. Rather, conspiracy has always been a separate offense, punished independently without calibration to the underlying crime. So conspiracy to sell a joint can be punished the same way as conspiracy to sell a kilo of marijuana. Why would the law be written that way? The answer has to do with the harm to society when individuals agree with one another to commit criminal acts. These acts are seen as possessing a higher level of moral culpability and are also more dangerous. Two people can often do more harm than one. And those criminal economies of scale are sometimes supplemented by psychological dangers. People tend to take more risks in groups than alone. For these reasons, the law has always treated conspiracy harshly. Indeed, for much of American history, conspiring to commit an immoral but not illegal act was itself punishable as conspiracy.Incidentally, it\u2019s no surprise that Mr. Trump himself came out in an interview aired Thursday against the practice of \u201cflipping,\u201d where prosecutors give a guilty person a deal in exchange for information against another person. Flipping and conspiracy charges go hand-in-hand; the latter is what encourages the former.We are approaching a reckoning, where criminal and perhaps impeachment processes will begin asking hard questions. It would be a huge mistake for the president to rely on assurances from his legal team that what he did was ordinary and not prosecutable. Rather, if the Cohen allegations are true, what President Trump did was knowingly conspire to violate federal campaign law and to hide it from the American people right before the election, and that very severe crime is one that must be punished.

{"Headline": "How Rising Inequality Has Widened the Justice Gap", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewRising inequality has harmed low-income families not only by depriving them of a fair share of society\u2019s income growth, but also in a more specific way: It has stacked the legal system even more heavily against them.Indigent persons charged with crimes are entitled to state-sponsored lawyers, but here, too, funding shortages are widespread.The stakes in criminal proceedings are often enormous, but civil disputes often produce life-shattering outcomes as well.Solving this problem will require not only moral outrage, but also a clearer understanding of how market forces have contributed to it.Free-market enthusiasts celebrate Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand,\u201d which describes how markets harness self-interest to serve the broader interests of society. Yet Smith himself understood that greed alone wouldn\u2019t create a just community. He believed that markets could function adequately only in the context of an elaborate foundation of laws and ethical norms.But even the most carefully devised regulations aren\u2019t sufficient. They must also be enforced, which requires costly resources. Generally, we let families decide for themselves whether to incur the necessary expenses to engage in civil disputes. Yet many families simply cannot afford to pay for competent legal representation.Rising inequality has reduced the supply of legal aid by kindling resistance to taxation. A sense of entitlement to income produced by the fruits of one\u2019s own labor has always existed, but in today\u2019s winner-take-all economy, those on top earn vastly more than before. And changes in campaign finance laws have enabled them to lobby successfully for lower tax rates, contributing to widening budget deficits.Rising inequality has increased the need for legal assistance by inflating the cost to low-income families of achieving other basic goals.In almost every modern society, for example, an important goal of parents is to send their children to good schools. But a \u201cgood school\u201d is an inescapably relative concept \u2014 it is one that compares favorably with other schools in the local environment. And the best schools are almost invariably located in costlier neighborhoods.Higher spending on housing by top earners has shifted the frames of reference that shape spending by those just below them, and so on. Because of this expenditure cascade, the median new house in the United States is now 50 percent larger than in 1980, even though median income has grown little in the interim.Is this a matter of public concern? Most economists celebrate reliance on market rates of pay in the name of efficiency, but many go on to argue that they also promote a measure of fairness, rewarding those who work hard and invest in developing their skills. Well and good. Yet it is an overreach to claim that market-determined rates of pay are morally just.Many top earners are not only talented and hardworking, but they are also lucky to have grown up in privileged circumstances. And it is one thing to say that someone who is 10 percent more skillful should be paid 10 percent more. But in today\u2019s winner-take-all marketplace, those who are only 1 percent more talented often earn thousands of times more. These observations are difficult to square with anyone\u2019s conception of a just society.The good news is that we could relieve both revenue shortfalls and household budget distress \u2014 and provide more legal aid to the poor \u2014 without causing painful dislocations for the rich.Many people who could easily afford the tax increases necessary to pay for more generous social services currently resist that step because they believe it would make it harder for them to buy the special extras they want. But that belief is mistaken, because the standards that define special are elastic. When everyone spends less, those standards adjust accordingly.Much private spending is thus mutually offsetting, resembling across-the-board increases in weaponry in arms races that do not alter the balance of power. Because higher taxes don\u2019t affect relative purchasing power, they have little effect on people\u2019s ability to buy life\u2019s luxuries.We could simultaneously support the Legal Services Corporation and other social services more generously and inhibit the expenditure cascades that have made it more difficult to afford these services. And most reassuring to those whose taxes rose, the very same households as before would still be in the top 10 percent.It would be instructive to ask wealthy taxpayers who oppose this policy change to explain why.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Litany of Grievances: How Turkish-American Relations Deteriorated", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s abrupt increase in tariffs on Turkey, aggravating an economic crisis in the country that spilled into global financial markets on Friday, appeared to be a response to Turkey\u2019s refusal to release an American pastor. But the escalation also reflected a litany of deep-seated grievances between the United States and Turkey that threatens relations between the two NATO allies.Those grievances, analysts said, have been amplified by Mr. Trump and his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both strong-willed leaders who share a penchant for invective and doubling down when threatened.Sinan Ciddi, executive director of the Institute of Turkish Studies in Washington, said Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Trump were headed toward the \u201crabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland.\u201dHow did it come to this? Here is a look at the issues behind the rising American tensions with Turkey, a country of 79 million that straddles Europe and Asia and has long played a vital role in the stability of the Middle East.Seemingly at the center of the dispute is the case of Andrew Brunson, a 50-year-old American pastor from North Carolina. Mr. Brunson has been detained in Turkey for more than a year and a half on suspicion of engaging in espionage and having links to plotters of the failed coup to topple Mr. Erdogan in 2016.Mr. Brunson, who has done missionary work in Turkey for more than 20 years and headed a small church in the city of Izmir on Turkey\u2019s Aegean coast, has denied the accusations. He could face 35 years in prison if found guilty.Though Mr. Brunson was moved from prison to house arrest last month, his case has still touched a nerve in the Trump administration. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are devout evangelical Christians, a core voter group for Mr. Trump. The president has raised the case personally with Mr. Erdogan more than once, including in a phone call.Turkey\u2019s refusal to release the pastor, Mr. Pierini said, appeared to reflect \u201ca complete misreading of U.S. policy by the Turks.\u201dBulent Aliriza, the director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research organization, said the Brunson case had \u201cbrought to a head simmering tensions in the U.S.-Turkish relationship.\u201dThose tensions date back years. Some historians tie the decline to 2003, when the Turks refused to allow American troops to transit through Turkey in the American-led invasion of Iraq.Relations worsened during the last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, particularly over Turkish government accusations that the United States was involved in the failed coup.To the Americans, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s seeming tolerance of the Islamic State militants who had established themselves in Syria was unacceptable.For Mr. Erdogan, one of the most grating grievances with the United States centers on the person he regards as the instigator of the failed coup: Fethullah Gulen, an influential Turkish cleric and former ally who lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Gulen has denied the accusations.Frustrated by what they saw as the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to extradite Mr. Gulen, the Turkish authorities accused the United States of complicity with him. When Mr. Trump took office, there was some hope expressed by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s aides that Mr. Gulen would be extradited. But there has been no indication of any change.Yes, for a time it seemed that Mr. Trump had taken a liking to Mr. Erdogan, a strongman leader whom he praised after a NATO summit this year. But when negotiations between American and Turkish officials over Mr. Brunson\u2019s release fell through, attitudes changed.\u201cThere is that affinity Trump has with strong leaders, and Erdogan is certainly one of them,\u201d Mr. Aliriza said. \u201cBut then something snapped, and it snapped on the Brunson issue because apparently Trump thought that he had a deal with Erdogan.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s autocratic behavior is now considered by outside economists and many investors as a threat to Turkey\u2019s economy, once the envy of the region. Rapidly rising debts have fueled fears of insolvency in the country, now accelerated by a plunge in the value of the currency, the lira. Mr. Erdogan says he regards these stresses as the work of foreign conspirators.\u201cIt was benefiting from tons of money coming in. It was on the way to becoming an E.U. member. It had good relations with the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Aliriza said of Turkey. \u201cErdogan is now rejecting globalization, saying that the global economic forces that were his allies are now his enemies.\u201dMr. Erdogan remained defiant in a speech on Friday in the northern city of Bayburt, saying his government \u201cwill not lose the economic war.\u201dBut experts say he may be miscalculating the true effect of the sanctions imposed by the United States, and warn that there is nobody in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s immediate circle who dares question his judgment.\u201cEssentially you\u2019re heading for the cliff,\u201d Mr. Pierini said. \u201cThe issue now is who will be courageous enough to tell the president, \u2018This is the wrong way.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mueller III, has gathered about the two Trump Tower meetings, it could find that the foreigners violated that law \u2014 and that Donald Trump Jr. conspired in that offense.The special counsel\u2019s inquiry into the June 2016 meeting is no doubt complicated by the constantly changing explanations from nearly everyone involved.Another provision of the same statute makes it illegal for an American to solicit a foreigner for such illicit campaign help \u2014 again, even indirectly. If a grand jury were to interpret the evidence about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s words and actions as a solicitation, he could also be vulnerable to direct charges under that law, experts said.Notably, the statute can be violated even if the promised or requested help is never provided.Legal experts have struggled to identify a precedent for criminally charging somebody under this law. As a result, an attempt to prosecute Donald Trump Jr. under that statute would raise novel issues.And Robert Bauer, a New York University election-law professor who served as White House counsel in the Obama administration, argued that the statute against foreign campaign assistance is so broadly worded that its covers Russia paying spies and hackers to collect and disseminate negative information about Mrs. Clinton to help Mr. Trump win the election \u2014 even expenses like their travel for the meeting.\u201cThe phrase \u2018contribution or donation\u2019 sounds like a gift to help fund the campaign or give them something they otherwise would buy,\u201d Mr. Kerr said.Specifically, they were accused of preventing the Federal Election Commission from fulfilling \u201cits statutory duties of providing the American public with accurate data about the financial activities of individuals and entities supporting federal candidates, and enforcing limits and prohibitions, including the ban on foreign expenditures.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when a meeting between top Trump campaign advisers and Kremlin-connected Russians took place.

Funding secured.Add it all together, and it appears that an investigation has the potential to move down a number of paths. The question is how this might play out for Tesla and Mr. Musk.A formal investigation does not mean a case will be filed. It does indicate that the S.E.C. is committing resources, and investigations tend to take on lives of their own. Where they end is not always where they started heading, especially when there is a thorough review of corporate records.Rule 10b-5 prohibits any scheme to defraud, which includes misstatements or omissions of material information that affect the market value of shares. Given how erratic Tesla\u2019s stock has been, and how it responded so quickly to Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, showing that the information was material and might have harmed investors if it was misleading does not appear to be difficult.One possible defense to a potential fraud charge would be that Mr. Musk reasonably believed there was sufficient financing at the time he posted the statement.But there are hurdles to that defense. The S.E.C. would need to prove only that Mr. Musk\u2019s actions had been reckless, defined as a significant departure from the proper standards of business conduct. Evidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund or the private equity firm Silver Lake had reservations about financing a deal, or that the discussions were still continuing, may be enough to show recklessness.It is a difficult violation to prove. It requires the S.E.C. to show that the person acted with that specific purpose. Making a case based only on a single tweet would be a challenge even though the statement drove up Tesla\u2019s stock. Mr. Musk could offer a more innocent explanation, such as he was merely jumping the gun to reveal his desire to take the company private.This tack has advantages for Mr. Musk, Tesla and the S.E.C. It requires showing only that the issuing of corporate information was mistaken or at least inartful. It would not jeopardize the company\u2019s ability to issue shares, because it is a claim only of negligence, not of fraud, and the S.E.C. appears to have stopped requiring companies and individuals to admit culpability as part of a settlement, so a resolution under this provision would not affect private litigation.If serious consideration is being given to taking Tesla private, the company and Mr. Musk have an incentive to reach a resolution with the S.E.C. as quickly as possible. The firms that might help fund a deal may be hesitant to commit financing if the cloud of an S.E.C. investigation is hanging over Tesla. But resolving the investigation will not be easy, at least not until there is greater clarity about what exactly Mr. Musk meant with his ill-fated tweet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Residents: 12. Average Age: 75. Biggest Challenge: Avoiding Extinction.", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCORIPPO, Switzerland \u2014 With Swiss punctuality, the village of Corippo comes to life at 8:15 a.m., when people gather in the church square to get their daily bread.It is delivered by Eros Mella, a baker who every morning drives the hairpin turns of the scenic Verzasca Valley, in the Italian-speaking region of southern Switzerland.In the summer months, Mr. Mella\u2019s buns and loaves are bought by the locals and a few holidaymakers. But in the snowy winter months, \u201cI drive up here for two or three clients,\u201d Mr. Mella said.The village now has only 12 full-time residents \u2014 not only Switzerland\u2019s smallest population, but also perhaps its oldest, with an average age of 75.The regional authorities think they may have a solution to help preserve Corippo: In July, officials agreed to allow a publicly financed local foundation to turn a handful of the village\u2019s 30 abandoned houses into a hotel.The plan borrows from a model used in nearby Italy, known as \u201calbergo diffuso,\u201d or scattered hotel.Such establishments were first built in the Friuli region of northeastern Italy, to revive villages that had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1976, said Fabio Giacomazzi, an architect, who is the president of the Corippo foundation.\u201cWe\u2019re doing something new for Switzerland, but knowing that it can be done,\u201d he said.Initially, the hotel is set to have about 25 beds, spread across a cluster of soon-to-be-refurbished houses. The hotel\u2019s public space will pivot around a new reception area situated within the village\u2019s seasonal restaurant, which will be enlarged and revamped. After 2019, more beds will be added, as well as a seminar room that executives could rent for a corporate retreat.Corippo\u2019s nonprofit foundation says it has already secured 2.2 million Swiss francs out of the 3.2 million needed to start the hotel next year. (The Swiss franc is about equivalent to the dollar). Most of this money is public funding, coupled with bank loans. Spending the night in a double bedroom will cost between 100 and 150 Swiss francs, in line with the pricing of hotels in the valley, according to Mr. Giacomazzi.\u201cWe have long been searching for a way to ensure Corippo can survive, and this hotel now offers the best chance of doing that,\u201d said Saverio Foletta, the secretary of the foundation.But even though Corippo faces an existential threat, the hotel has received a lukewarm response from residents, some of whom criticize the focus on tourists rather than on their own basic needs, like addressing a deficient water supply system.There are also concerns over whether hotel guests can really help offset Corippo\u2019s unfavorable demographics and stop it from becoming a ghost village. Only one of Corippo\u2019s residents still works, for a forestry company several miles from the village. The others are pensioners who rely on outside help from younger family members. A priest visits to say Mass twice a month.While never a metropolis, the village was once much larger. In the 19th century, Corippo was home to over 300 people. But as mountain agriculture started to decline, farmers left their cattle and sheep to find work in the cities.The nonprofit foundation was started in the 1970s \u2014 when Corippo had about 50 residents and was added to a list of protected Swiss villages \u2014 but it has so far failed to stem the loss of population.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about sustainable tourism, we should start by asking exactly who will be left here in 10 years to welcome the tourists,\u201d said Alfredo Scilacci, an architect and town planner who lives in Geneva, and who inherited an ancestral family home in Corippo.One of the most crippling blows to Corippo came at the end of the 1950s, when the village school shut down.\u201cA place without children is a place without life \u2014 and I don\u2019t think you get young people to come and live here just by adding a hotel,\u201d said Clementina Bernardasci, 73, who was part of the last generation to attend school in Corippo, before leaving the village to work in a watch factory when she turned 15. Ms. Bernardasci returns regularly but is no longer a full-time resident, and no one in her family envisions living here again.During a recent weekend, Corippo felt relatively lively and almost youthful, thanks to a group of Boy Scouts who were sleeping in a stable while hiking across the region.Some visitors come from far afield, drawn both by the natural beauty of the area\u2019s mountains and waterfalls, and by a sense of nostalgia.As he admired the village\u2019s old stone roofs, Vladimir Yeremin, a Russian physicist who was on a family holiday, said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to visit a place that takes you back to how life was hundreds of years ago, because that\u2019s difficult to find in Russia now.\u201dAt 67, Silvana Dal Tin is among Corippo\u2019s youngest residents. The hotel could help Corippo, she said, but \u201conly if it brings more than just people who want to take photos.\u201dSoon enough, the number of cars driving up the valley had almost doubled, forcing the local authorities to add traffic police because of road jams and parking problems. Many day-trippers from Milan and elsewhere picnic along the river, leaving litter rather than filling local restaurants.All of that publicity around the bridge has not brought any significant financial benefit to the valley, officials said, but it confirmed, instead, the need to focus on projects like Corippo\u2019s hotel.To profit from tourism, the area needs to make \u201cevery effort to transform day tourism into a stay of at least two or three days in our valley,\u201d said Alan Matasci, the president of the Verzasca foundation in charge of the valley\u2019s development.Mr. Matasci forecast that Corippo\u2019s hotel would bring overnight visitors without adding to the risk of mass tourism, a phenomenon also unlikely given the village\u2019s size and geographic isolation: The narrow road that winds up to Corippo ends in a cul-de-sac on the church square.\u201cWe can\u2019t predict or control exactly how tourism develops,\u201d Mr. Matasci said. \u201cBut we can say that without this hotel, there will probably be nobody living in Corippo in 15 years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Financing reached a high of $2.92 billion in 2015, but this year, it is on pace to be less than half that, according to CB Insights, a financial research firm.The number of independent ad tech companies has fallen 21 percent since 2013, to 185 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to LUMA Partners, which analyzes digital media and marketing.\u201cWhile all industries go through a maturation curve, this one faces a particular need for consolidation,\u201d said Terry Kawaja, the chief executive of LUMA Partners. \u201cSo many of these companies were not profitable.\u201dAlthough many consumers have never heard of ad tech firms, people\u2019s online activity is influenced every day by these companies as they battle for a share of ad impressions on phones, tablets and laptops. The \u201cMad Men\u201d style of advertising workers has been replaced by the \u201cmath men\u201d of ad tech start-ups, which specialize in gathering data on consumer preferences.Advertising, the economic juice behind the internet, has long been an attractive area for start-ups. During the last 10 years, the ease of forming companies and the availability of cheap venture capital led to a flood of ad tech start-ups, pushing boundaries on where and how ads were delivered. They introduced technologies like the automation of ad buying \u2014 called programmatic advertising \u2014 and header bidding, in which many ad exchanges bid on publishers\u2019 space simultaneously.Ari Paparo, chief executive of the ad tech start-up Beeswax, said he had noticed a distinct decline in venture capital funding for ad tech firms just in the last two years. \u201cThe private market is influenced by the public market, and you saw so many fail as publicly traded entities,\u201d he said.There were 260 deals between ad tech companies and venture capital firms in 2014 but only 122 in 2017, according to PitchBook. In the first half of 2018, there have been 53 deals.The fear is that when investment dries up, innovation will die.Small start-ups are crucial to the industry because they often serve as catalysts for technological advances, said Doug Knopper, one of the founders of the ad tech platform FreeWheel, which was sold to Comcast in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s still more innovation to come, but if V.C.s don\u2019t put money into it because they don\u2019t see a path to exit, does innovation stall?\u201d he said, referring to venture capitalists.Some are hoping a third big competitor could help the industry. Eric Adelman, president and one of the founders of Three Pillars Recruiting, said while the AT&T acquisition consolidates power in fewer places, the deal could help make AT&T a rival to Google and Facebook.\u201cHaving three giants in the industry is much better than having two giants,\u201d he said.In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cThe dynamics of the market may be changing, but it\u2019s stemming more from people\u2019s shifting consumption habits than one platform\u2019s popularity.\u201dNot all smaller players are giving up. Kevin Hunt, senior vice president of global marketing for the ad platform SpotX, is betting that his company\u2019s focus on video advertising will set it apart.\u201cIt\u2019s important for companies who are in this space to be technically flexible, to make sure they have built a solid foundation that allows them to move as technology moves,\u201d he said.Eric Franchi, one of the founders and a former executive at the digital advertising company Undertone, isn\u2019t giving up on ad tech. After the software company Perion acquired Undertone in 2015, Mr. Franchi teamed up with Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, to fund an ad tech-focused venture-capital fund called MathCapital that helps the little guys.\u201cWe want the best entrepreneurs that want to build ad tech companies to come to us,\u201d Mr. Franchi said. \u201cOver time, hopefully we can be a force for good in the space to help these companies get started.\u201dAnd even after Ben Barokas sold his company Admeld to Google in 2011, he decided to stay in the ad tech industry, creating a content compensation platform called Sourcepoint.\u201cI think certainly Facebook and Google are hoovering up the vast majority of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I believe in independent content creation. Those who invest appropriately are going to also win and attract advertising dollars.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Is Said to Be Subpoenaed by S.E.C. Over Elon Musk Tweet", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal securities regulators have served Tesla with a subpoena, according to a person familiar with the investigation, increasing pressure on the electric car company as it deals with the fallout from several recent actions by its chief executive, Elon Musk.The subpoena, from the Securities and Exchange Commission, comes days after regulators began inquiring about an Aug. 7 Twitter post by Mr. Musk, in which he said he was considering converting Tesla to a private company. In the post, he said that the financing for such a transaction, which would probably run into the tens of billions of dollars, had been \u201csecured.\u201dIt has become clear since then that neither Mr. Musk nor Tesla had actually lined up the necessary financing aside from having preliminary conversations with some investors.The Twitter post by Mr. Musk, who has considered taking Tesla private in the past, was something of a flip remark, said several people familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about the episode.The serving of a subpoena, which typically requires the approval of top S.E.C. officials, indicates that an inquiry has advanced to a more formal, serious stage. It can take years for an investigation to yield any action, and some investigations do not result in any action.A subset of independent directors, who have formed a committee to consider any formal proposal to take Tesla private, has hired another law firm, Latham & Watkins.And on Wednesday, Tesla hired Goldman Sachs to work on a possible going-private transaction, according to a client note reviewed by The New York Times.Representatives of Tesla and the S.E.C. declined to comment.The scope of the commission\u2019s investigation, which is being led by the San Francisco office, is unclear. Even before Mr. Musk\u2019s message on Aug. 7, the S.E.C. had been inquiring about issues at Tesla.About a week earlier, Martin Tripp, a former Tesla employee who has filed a whistle-blower complaint against the company, was interviewed by commission officials over the phone, his lawyer, Stuart Meissner, said.Mr. Tripp, who was an engineer at a Tesla battery plant in Nevada, said he had seen problems with some of the batteries installed in the company\u2019s cars. He has accused Tesla of misleading investors about some production figures.Tesla has sued Mr. Tripp, accusing him of trying to steal trade secrets. Mr. Tripp has said the company and Mr. Musk have wrongly portrayed him as a saboteur.Over the past few months, there has been a war of words between the parties. But the dispute between Mr. Musk and Mr. Tripp has receded into the background amid the furor over Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about taking the company private.An earlier version of this article misstated which news outlet first reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had subpoenaed Tesla.

{"Headline": "A Rebirth for Alabama Democrats? Not So Fast", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMontgomery MemoWho turns out to be correct will depend on when their answers are graded.Less than a year after Alabama surprised itself by electing its first Democratic senator in a quarter-century, Republicans are primed to reassert what they regard as the state\u2019s hard-won political order. And the Democrats, though emboldened and enchanted by Mr. Jones\u2019s victory, are only beginning to rebuild the long-atrophied political muscles they need to compete.\u201cThis year, you\u2019re not going to see a giant blue wave coming across the state of Alabama,\u201d Mr. Jones said in an interview. \u201cBut there are opportunities in the state where we can make some strides.\u201dThe stakes this autumn for both parties, and the state as a whole, are significant. With a few exceptions, every statewide elected office will be on the ballot in November. So will every seat in the Republican-dominated Legislature \u2014 and the lawmakers elected this year are expected to be in power through the redistricting process that will follow the 2020 census.Alabama\u2019s electoral calendar makes the question that has loomed for eight months \u2014 How well will Mr. Jones\u2019s success transfer to other Democrats? \u2014 especially stark, particularly in a state that has tilted almost entirely toward Republicans in recent years.\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a stemming of that tide, before you can say that his election was a high-water mark that stopped the Republicans from winning,\u201d John H. Merrill, the Republican secretary of state, said in his Capitol office.Most of all, there are the numbers: More than twice as many voters cast ballots in the Republican primary for governor as in the Democratic primary. Studies consistently rank Alabama among the nation\u2019s most conservative states, and among the least elastic, meaning there are relatively few swing voters. And even against an opponent who had become a pariah, Mr. Jones won by just 21,924 votes out of more than 1.3 million cast.Mr. Jones acknowledges that his victory was \u201cnot in and of itself indicative of a long-term trend.\u201d But he and other Democrats say it laid a foundation for them to mount competitive campaigns in certain races this year, including some for statewide office.\u201cAlabama is a ruby-red state,\u201d said Representative Terri Sewell, who was Alabama\u2019s only Democrat in Congress before Mr. Jones\u2019s election. \u201cIt was the day Doug was elected, and it definitely was the day after he was elected. But there were some lessons learned that will help us race by race.\u201d\u201cUnder the normal conditions existing this fall, I\u2019m confident lightning will not strike twice for the Democrats in Alabama,\u201d said Luther Strange, the Republican former state attorney general who briefly filled the Senate seat that Mr. Jones now holds.Such assessments are a balm for Republicans, commonplace among analysts, and no surprise to Democrats, who have largely foundered in the state since Republicans captured the Governor\u2019s Mansion in 2002.But there is also widening agreement that Democrats are better positioned in Alabama now than they have been in at least a decade, and perhaps longer.That is not saying all that much. And many Democrats say it reflects the strengths of individual campaigns, not those of the party as a whole.In the days after Mr. Jones\u2019s victory, Don E. Siegelman, the last Democrat to serve as governor of Alabama, spoke for many Democrats when he said the state party was still \u201can organizational flop\u201d that had \u201cbeen of little or no value to candidates.\u201d Another Democratic former governor, Jim Folsom Jr., said that the state party was \u201cin shambles.\u201d And Mr. Jones said last week that \u201cthe party infrastructure continues to be just stagnant.\u201dAnd he benefited from the reality that many Republicans simply stayed home rather than vote for Mr. Moore.\u201cThere is energy and there is passion, and that\u2019s the effect of the Doug Jones race, especially since he won,\u201d Mr. Maddox said. \u201cPeople, rightly so, felt like their efforts contributed to a win, and when you win, you want to do it again and again and again.\u201dMr. Jones, for his part, is urging his party\u2019s candidates to \u201cbe authentic, engage the voters and don\u2019t take any voting segment for granted.\u201d Democrats, he said, were \u201cfinally waking up to the fact that we have to play what I call long ball.\u201dThrough a campaign spokeswoman, Mr. Maddox\u2019s opponent, Gov. Kay Ivey, declined to be interviewed for this article.But Terry Lathan, the chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party, questioned the significance of the Democratic Party\u2019s nascent recovery in Alabama, even as campaign-finance records showed Mr. Maddox\u2019s fund-raising keeping pace with Ms. Ivey\u2019s in July and his having more cash on hand than she did.\u201cIf you\u2019re on life support, and all of a sudden you don\u2019t need an oxygen machine, I guess that\u2019s a step in a better direction,\u201d Ms. Lathan said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready to run a marathon.\u201dDemocrats, some more tentatively than others, sense the possibility of a sustained opening, the first they have seen in many years. But beyond social media, even the most seasoned and stalwart Democrats qualify their expectations.\u201cMaybe Doug Jones was a perfect storm,\u201d said John D. Saxon, a Birmingham lawyer and a longtime figure in Democratic politics in Alabama. \u201cLast year was special. But if the question is, \u2018Can we find the magic again?\u2019 I would say, quite possibly. Not an easy road, not a sure thing, not even a safe bet. But it\u2019s quite possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Charity Calls Attorney General\u2019s Suit a Political Attack", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLawyers for President Trump\u2019s charitable foundation pushed back aggressively against the New York State attorney general\u2019s office in court papers on Thursday, calling a lawsuit against the charity a political attack motivated by the former attorney general\u2019s \u201crecord of antipathy\u201d against Mr. Trump.When the suit was filed, Mr. Trump derided it on Twitter as the work of \u201csleazy New York Democrats\u201d and the new submission continued that line of attack.Some opponents of the president have held up the attorney general\u2019s office as a potential backstop to prosecute crimes should Mr. Trump choose to pardon his associates convicted in the continuing federal investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.His successor, Barbara Underwood, however, has taken up his anti-Trump mantle, pursuing old lawsuits and filing new torts against the president and his agenda.Though Mr. Schneiderman is no longer in office, the Trump Foundation sought in its papers to depict the recent lawsuit as a political vendetta, saying the former attorney general had a \u201cmission to \u2018lead the resistance\u2019 and attack Mr. Trump whenever possible.\u201dThe papers accused Mr. Schneiderman, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the race, of using his \u201cpublic antipathy for Mr. Trump\u201d to solicit donations for his own re-election campaign and of turning \u201ca blind eye\u201d to alleged misconduct by the Clinton Foundation. The papers noted that if the suit is not dismissed, the Trump Foundation\u2019s lawyers would \u201cseek discovery,\u201d presumably for more information about Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s conduct.The Trump Foundation also went after Ms. Underwood, saying she has continued the \u201cinflammatory rhetoric\u201d by \u201cstating publicly that she considers her battles with the President \u2018the most important work (she) has ever done.\u2019\u201d(Ms. Underwood actually said that working as attorney general was the most important work she had ever done.)The Trump Foundation was meant to be devoted to charitable activities, but the attorney general\u2019s office asserted in its suit that it was often used improperly to settle legal claims against Mr. Trump\u2019s various businesses.In its papers, the Trump Foundation shrugged these allegations off, saying that Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel paid $185 \u2014 \u201cplus interest\u201d \u2014 to the foundation \u201cas compensation for the fair rental value of the painting.\u201d According to the papers, the Trump National Golf Course also reimbursed the foundation for the payment it made to Mr. Greenberg.But the foundation was also used to curry political favor, the suit contends, and during the 2016 race, it became a virtual wing of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Emails show that Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, often directed its expenditures, even though charity groups are explicitly prohibited from political activities.The Trump Foundation claimed in its papers that Mr. Trump, like all political candidates, had a \u201cright to raise money for charity and attend charity events.\u201d Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer for the foundation, said that even if Mr. Trump enhanced his political standing by attending the event, that was not illegal.\u201cOur common experience as Americans informs us that candidates routinely support and raise money for charitable causes,\u201d the papers said. \u201cDonations made at the suggestion of candidates are neither uncommon nor unlawful.\u201dIn a statement on Friday morning, Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the attorney general\u2019s office, said it would continue \u201cholding Trump and his associates accountable for their flagrant violations of New York law.\u201d\u201cAs our lawsuit detailed, the Trump Foundation functioned as a personal piggy bank to serve Trump\u2019s business and political interests,\u201d the statement said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Austerity Helps Bankrupt an English County, Even Conservatives Mutiny", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain\u2019s Big SqueezeNORTHAMPTON, England \u2014 It was a seething, stomping protest in this ordinarily genteel medieval town: Throngs of residents, whistling and booing, swarmed the county hall. \u201cCriminals!\u201d they shouted. They held up banners that read: \u201cTory councilors wanted for crimes against people in Northamptonshire.\u201dThe crime?The bankruptcy of their Conservative-led local government, which has a budget deficit so big that councilors are stripping away all but the minimum services required by law. Inside the county hall, the besieged council debated the latest round of cuts \u2014 it had already voted to close libraries and stop repairing roads \u2014 as disgusted residents jeered.\u201cYour guilt should keep you awake at night,\u201d Patrick Markey said at the meeting earlier this month, his voice trembling with rage. \u201cIt\u2019s criminal incompetence and criminal politics.\u201dUsually, local government finance is a dull affair. But Northamptonshire has become a warning sign of the perilous state of Britain\u2019s local governments. A Conservative Party bastion, Northamptonshire is leafy and affluent, littered with aristocratic estates \u2014 yet in February its local authority became the first in two decades to effectively run out of money.Britain is already in upheaval over Brexit, its looming withdrawal from the European Union, with many experts warning of economic hardship ahead. But Northamptonshire is foreshadowing another potential fiscal crisis: Local governments drained of resources, cutting services to the bone.Councils are Britain\u2019s fundamental unit of local government, dealing with an array of basic needs: trash collection, public transport, libraries, town planning, and care for children and other vulnerable people, among other things. They levy a tax on homes and charge fees for some services. They also collect a nationally set tax on commercial real estate, and keep an increasing share of it. But for years they received most of their funding from the central government.The crisis in Northamptonshire is complicated and partly self-inflicted. But it has roots in the austerity policies and cost cutting that the Conservative-led national government imposed a decade ago in response to the global financial crisis. The Tories in London argued that austerity was the responsible solution to balance public accounts and encourage future growth.Now some Conservatives, especially at the local level, are openly defying what has been a pillar of the party\u2019s ideology.Funding from London for local governments has fallen 60 percent since 2010, with reductions expected to total $21 billion by 2020, the Local Government Association has calculated. In response, nearly every council in Britain has cut or outsourced services, sold off assets and tried a host of budget gimmicks, experts in local finance say.One in 10 of the larger councils that have obligations to care for children and elderly people \u2014 about 35 councils in all \u2014 are in danger of exhausting their reserves within the next three years, according to the National Audit Office.\u201cThere\u2019s a slow-moving domino effect,\u201d said Rob Whiteman, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.Northamptonshire was the first flashing red light. East Sussex County Council, run by Conservatives, recently announced it would reduce services to the \u201clegal minimum.\u201d The Conservative-led county council in Somerset warned it might be facing bankruptcy. This month, two families won a case against Bristol City Council to block plans to reduce funding of special education needs and disability services.The Northamptonshire council, having run through its rainy-day funds, now has enough money to pay only for mandatory services for the elderly and children. Unable by law to run a deficit, the council voted in February to shut down 21 of the county\u2019s 36 libraries, remove bus subsidies and suspend road repairs. (A court recently blocked the decision to close the libraries.) At the meeting earlier this month, some councilors seemed resigned to the angry public response.\u201cI am happy to apologize,\u201d said Richard Auger, a Tory councilor. \u201cI think mistakes were made,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation we\u2019re responsible for.\u201dThe crisis is a political embarrassment for Conservatives, who are already divided into warring camps over Brexit. The former leader of the Northamptonshire council, Heather Smith, has resigned from her position, and from the Conservative Party. Investigators sent from London blamed her and other councilors for mishandling local finances, even as she blamed London for impossible mandates and a refusal to consider higher taxes.Sounding increasingly like their Labour opponents, some Conservative councilors in Northamptonshire are now talking about stopping the outsourcing of public services and demanding tax increases.\u201cI was a believer that we had to save money, but there had to be other ways than to slash and burn,\u201d said John Ekins, a recently elected Conservative councilor in Northamptonshire. \u201cHow did we get to where we are? What the hell has been going on?\u201dThey called it the Graph of Doom.It was 2013, and the Northamptonshire council was presented a Power Point chart that depicted an unavoidable contradiction: a sharp, rising public demand for local services contrasting with a sharp cutback in money from the national government, as part of the austerity program led by Conservatives in London.\u201cIt was showing how we were all heading towards this cliff edge,\u201d recalled Ms. Smith, who was then a senior councilor. The cliff edge was a shortfall of $175 million that needed to be addressed by 2020.A committed Tory, Ms. Smith initially embraced the calls for austerity, as did many in reliably Conservative Northamptonshire. \u201cBeing a Conservative-run council, everybody accepted that the country had been overspending and that it was time to scale all of that back,\u201d Ms. Smith said.The problem was how to do it. The council needed to find huge savings, but it also had limited revenue sources.Raising taxes was ruled out, deemed ideologically unpalatable while the Conservatives were making austerity-related cutbacks. Eric Pickles, the government minister who oversaw local government financing between 2010 and 2015, said it was a \u201cmoral duty\u201d for the Tories to keep local taxes low.\u201cSome Conservative councils had a big fight over it, and said, \u2018No, we\u2019re not doing it,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThey had a huge amount of pressure on them.\u201dNorthamptonshire also had a more unusual problem. Many Conservative councils were partly shielded from central-government cuts because they had large earnings from the commercial real-estate tax, called business rates.But the concentration of blue blood in Northamptonshire actually hurt its tax base. Much of the region is owned by gentry like the Duke of Buccleuch, thought to be the largest private landowner in Scotland and England, and Earl Spencer, uncle to Princes William and Harry, heirs to the British throne.Those holdings are generally agricultural land, said Guy Shrubsole, who runs the investigative blog \u201cWho Owns England?\u201d And agricultural land is exempt from business rates, leaving Northamptonshire even more dependent on funding from London.Faced with the cold reality of the Graph of Doom, council leaders decided that the old ways of doing business no longer applied. The council\u2019s then chief executive, Paul Blantern, designed the \u201cNext Generation Model,\u201d an initiative that pivoted the council, like many others across the country, toward outsourcing.Under \u201cNext Gen,\u201d the council would become a commissioning body, spinning off many of the services it had been performing and, in the process, saving millions of pounds a year.One initiative, Olympus Care Services, was founded in 2014, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the council. It was created to oversee adult social care services, with the intention of generating extra revenue by selling off surplus bed spaces to privately funded care customers.During its first years, Olympus managed to post modest profits, as well as reducing the overall cost to the council.But it never achieved the projected cost savings, and as budget pressure from the council mounted, it started recording losses \u2014 around $4 million in 2016 and $1.25 million in 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s all such a perfect storm,\u201d said Simon Edwards, director of the County Councils Network, a cross-party group that represents England\u2019s local authorities. \u201cNorthamptonshire was trying to be too innovative too quickly, outsourcing this and spinning off that, that they thought would save them money and protect some of the services.\u201d\u201cThey did some things wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cBut inexorably austerity is leading many counties into very difficult financial positions.\u201dThe outsourcing experiment collapsed last year, before it had fully started. By February, the council realized it had no way out, issuing a formal notification of de facto bankruptcy. In response, Conservative leaders in London dispatched government inspectors.In March, the inspectors issued a damning report.Max Caller, the chief inspector who wrote the report, said that the county council\u2019s troubles were self-inflicted and that the Next Gen approach did not have any \u201cdocumented underpinning\u201d that set out how it was expected to deliver savings.\u201cThe things that they did were unwise,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou could say that they didn\u2019t want to face up to the challenges of austerity, but all the other councils have.\u201dAccording to his findings, he said, Northamptonshire overspent by $130 million over three years and took no steps to rein in expenditure. \u201cEverything has been a waste of money.\u201dStill, he said of the financial problems afflicting other councils: \u201cYou can\u2019t go year after year holding down taxation rates at local level and taking the money away and expecting the same level of service. That\u2019s not possible.\u201dMs. Smith and other local Conservatives said the inspectors\u2019 report was unfair, and that the national government was wrongly scapegoating the council. She said other Conservatives, locally and in London, grew irritated with her insistence that insufficient funding was the core problem.\u201cThey wanted me to shut up about us being underfunded,\u201d she said.This year, the government announced some new money for councils, including about $200 million for adult social services. Even so, some experts say that councils are still staring at a $4 billion funding hole.In response, according to an annual government survey of council leaders, an overwhelming majority of county councils across England plan to raise council tax, their levy on homes, 5.99 percent this year \u2014 the maximum the central government will allow. Many have also said they would like to raise business rates, a move the central government is still rejecting.Before declaring bankruptcy, Northamptonshire took the desperate step of selling and leasing back a $70 million headquarters building it opened in October. The move brought widespread public ridicule and helped prompt the arrival of the government inspectors.Northamptonshire\u2019s financial troubles were clear from the moment the government began to pull back on grants to local authorities, officials said. What they did not expect was that a Conservative government in London would let the county slide into bankruptcy.\u201cI honestly believed that the government would not let us sink because we were a Conservative authority,\u201d said Ms. Smith, the former council leader. \u201cBut I was wrong. They were quite happy to just throw us out and annihilate us, really.\u201dOn July 24, the Northamptonshire Council issued a Section 114 notice that banned any new expenditure of public money, after realizing it needed to save almost $90 million more this year. In laymen\u2019s terms, this meant that the council was declaring de facto bankruptcy for a second time.Politics is usually sharply divided in the county, with Labour on the left and the Tories on the right. But by the time the council voted to shut down most of the county\u2019s libraries, the overall scope of the cutbacks startled many people in both parties. In recent years, the council had also closed local centers for children and sharply reduced educational funding.But it was the vote to shut down the libraries that struck the sharpest nerve, even in affluent villages like Roade, where the local library is described as \u201ca pub without pints.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t face the libraries being cut,\u201d said Sam Rumens, a Conservative councilor who voted against that measure, as he sat recently with some Labour officials at the town hall discussing \u201cproblems of capitalism.\u201d (\u201cThis is one of the leftiest views you\u2019ll get out of me today,\u201d he told them.)\u201cThere was a very sharp intake of breath,\u201d he recalled when he said that he would oppose the cuts. Labour lawmakers cheered and members of the public who attended the debate on the budget this winter roared their approval.\u201cThe whole process has gone mad,\u201d said Jason Smithers, another Conservative politician and the incoming mayor of Higham Ferrers, as he strolled through the town, which has yellow-brick houses that look straight out of a Jane Austen novel and a grocer selling organic duck and goose eggs.Like Mr. Rumens, he was a dissenter from his Conservative colleagues. \u201cThey were like cowboys running through the town,\u201d he said of colleagues who voted for the library cuts. Mr. Smithers said he supported higher taxes even if it would jeopardize his political fortunes. \u201cI\u2019m a Conservative through and through,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to be realistic.\u201dCouncil leaders in Northamptonshire said they had done everything by the Conservative government rule book.\u201cWe did everything that the government asked for,\u201d said one senior council official, who would speak only on condition of anonymity. There was even a handbook prepared by Mr. Pickles, the minister in London, on \u201c50 ways\u201d councils could save money. It suggested banning mineral water in council meetings, scrapping subsidized canteens in favor of local sandwich delivery firms and opening coffee shops in libraries.In Horton, a village where elegant mansions peek from behind wooded lanes, Wedgwood Swepston, 57, was out inspecting his Land Rover.

{"Headline": "Why Apple Is the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School.Those interpretations obscure Apple\u2019s other accomplishment \u2014 pioneering a financial model that is the envy of corporate America. Sure, Apple produces innovative phones and laptops, but look inside its sleek exterior and you\u2019ll find an elegant financial machine that has become the ideal for corporate America. Without investing significantly in hard assets, Apple spins cash and returns it to shareholders at a stunning rate. It\u2019s difficult not to admire.But the model that has been perfected at Apple is risky and imitated poorly by many American corporations. The next decade will reveal whether these imitations were a series of brilliant moves or large-scale financial engineering.Apple has $115 billion of debt outstanding, and it has distributed $288 billion to its shareholders in the past six years, most of it through share buybacks. In the most recent nine months alone, Apple bought back $54 billion worth of shares.This transformation is representative of trends in corporate America. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have issued on net over $1.3 trillion of debt and retired over $1.9 trillion of equity over the past four years. American companies are borrowing money to buy their own shares in what is tantamount to a huge, slow-motion leveraged buyout.Apple has conducted its buybacks responsibly: It bought shares when they were relatively cheap, rewarding the patient shareholder. Other companies have not been so prudent, taking on debt to make ill-timed purchases of expensive shares rather than investing in growth opportunities. In some cases, they have done so simply to push up share prices so that management can meet goals for quarterly earnings or metrics that trigger compensation.Second, Apple\u2019s financial model emphasizes cash flow over profits. Apple is not simply immensely profitable; in 2017, it generated $16 billion more in operating cash flow than profits. It does that in part by running its day-to-day operations in a distinctive way. Typically, a company has to use external funds to fund the process of stocking goods and collecting revenue from customers.Apple\u2019s model turns this upside down. Its retail stores collect cash from customers quickly, it is ruthless on keeping inventory low, and it takes forever to pay suppliers. In the process, Apple\u2019s operations are extremely effective cash generators. This is no coincidence. It is the result of the canny supply chain that Tim Cook built. In effect, Apple has largely been financed on the backs of its suppliers, who are willing to hold their inventory and wait more than 100 days to get paid, just for the pleasure of doing business with Apple.This restructuring of operations to minimize inventory, move to subscription models (which generate predictable streams of cash) and keep suppliers waiting has become the dominant pattern in large corporations. Amazon, for example, generates relatively small profits but mountains of cash through this process. But this emphasis on cash also means that executives can become wary of making capital expenditures, such as new factories or server farms. This kind of spending can increase profits in the long run but bites into cash flow in the short run. That is a recipe for sluggish corporate investment, just as we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the financial crisis.Finally, Apple is the epitome of an \u201casset light\u201d company: It owns very few hard assets and therefore needs almost zero outside capital to run its business. As of mid-2018, Apple has $105 billion of operating assets and $120 billion of operating liabilities. What does that mean? Miraculously, its operations rely on no capital from outside financiers.How does one achieve this apotheosis of the asset-light strategy? First, create a supply chain in Asia run by companies willing to invest in low-return projects that create your products. Second, hold those suppliers under your thumb. Idolizing asset-light strategies, however, can also lead to underinvestment, an excessive reliance on outsourcing and the artificial division of companies to avoid hard assets.The accomplishments of Apple\u2019s model are substantial. But the financial strategy that has worked so well for Apple is a risky one for less capable companies with weaker strategic positions. For them, aping Apple can just as easily result in too much debt on their balance sheets, precarious supply chains and deferred opportunities for investments.The financial archetype defined by Apple \u2014 asset-light strategy, leveraged share buybacks and cash flow above all \u2014 is a high-wire act. Boards should guard against the temptation to follow Apple\u2019s path blindly. Big investors, especially mutual funds and pension funds that represent so many individuals, should question the management of any company that does. Many of Apple\u2019s imitators are more likely to mortgage the future than create it.Mihir A.

{"Headline": "If Food Is Medicine, These Are the Labs", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetBOSTON \u2014 The \u201cfood as medicine\u201d philosophy has a simple goal: to control or cure chronic illness by changing what people eat. As the movement gains greater visibility, community meal programs are seeking bigger kitchens to meet demand.Today, the nonprofit organization has 60 employees and thousands of volunteers who help cook and deliver meals tailored to the dietary needs of clients managing various life-threatening conditions, including diabetes, kidney disease and cancer. And Community Servings is poised to nearly triple its meal production with a $21 million expansion of its headquarters in Jamaica Plain, a Boston neighborhood.When completed next year, the 31,000-square-foot \u201cfood campus\u201d will house a kitchen large enough to prepare as many as 1.5 million meals a year, healthful entrees that these days include quinoa burgers, turkey tender Parmesan and sweet potato lentil soup. The facility will also include a learning kitchen for job training, classrooms for nutrition education and a policy center focused on teaching other groups how to replicate the organization\u2019s model.Demand for medically tailored meals in the Boston area has grown some 40 percent in the last five years, said David B. Waters, the organization\u2019s chief executive. The wait list for Community Servings is now about 100 people. The vast majority of the group\u2019s clients are in low-income households and have more than one illness.\u201cThese are often people with very complicated nutritional needs, which are difficult for anyone to manage,\u201d Mr. Waters said. \u201cBut then you add in poverty, and it\u2019s all the more challenging.\u201d\u201cWe had maxed out at our last facility,\u201d said Sue Daugherty, Manna\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe freezers were so full we had to duct-tape them closed or they would pop open.\u201dSome local insurers are already aligned with the meal services. Community Servings, for example, has contracts with five local health care providers that reimburse the organization for meals.\u201cHealth plans are beginning to understand that not only is this the right thing to do, it\u2019s very good business,\u201d said Ellen M. Zane, the chief executive emeritus of the Tufts Medical Center and a co-chairwoman of Community Servings\u2019 capital campaign.The fund-raising campaign at Community Servings has raised $8.3 million toward its $10 million goal. The balance of the construction costs is expected to be financed by the federal New Markets Tax Credit Program, community development lenders and the city.The opportunity for expansion on the dense city block came about unexpectedly when the owner of an adjacent Montessori school retired and the building became available for purchase, Mr. Waters said.During construction, the organization is using the existing kitchen to continue to prepare meals for 15 different medical diets. The meals are apportioned in color-coded trays and stored in walk-in freezers until delivery. Each client receives a weekly bag of lunches, dinners and snacks. If the client has children, the whole family receives meals.\u201cParents will give their meal away if food is scarce, so if you want to feed the sick parent, you have to feed the whole family,\u201d Mr. Waters said.Since its start less than three years ago, the organization has had to move twice to meet rising demand, said Sarah Leathers, the founder and executive director. After borrowing the kitchen in a pasta shop to get going, organizers quickly discovered they needed more storage and cooling space. So they rented kitchen time at a restaurant in Avon, Conn., for about a year.\u201cWhen we started, we thought we would serve the Farmington Valley first and then gradually start to grow,\u201d Ms. Leathers said. \u201cBut then the calls started to come in from outside the valley, and it was hard for us to say no. Now, we\u2019re in 42 towns.\u201dIn Philadelphia, Ms. Daugherty and her staff at Manna toured at least 65 locations before deciding to lease and renovate a second-floor space with a freight elevator and a loading dock. Finding an affordable space in Philadelphia\u2019s Center City neighborhood made the hunt especially challenging, but closeness to public transit was paramount for an organization reliant on volunteers, she said.The location, near the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, a hub of city attractions, has also raised the organization\u2019s profile.\u201cIn our old location, we were on an alleyway behind these dumpsters,\u201d Ms. Daugherty said. \u201cHere, I can\u2019t tell you how many people come in off the street and ask about what we\u2019re doing.\u201dThe 23,000-square-foot space gives Manna the ability to cook and store up to 2.8 million meals a year, and serve up to 2,500 clients a month. The renovation cost just under $5 million, raised through a capital campaign.One of Manna\u2019s biggest fans is William S. George, the president and chief executive of Health Partners Plans, a nonprofit insurance company owned by medical school hospitals in Philadelphia.Several years ago, Mr. George decided to test Manna\u2019s meal program with a small group of patients with Type 1 diabetes. He said he was so impressed with the outcome, including reduced costs, that \u201cwe opened up the floodgates\u201d and extended the service to patients with other conditions. About 2,400 of the company\u2019s members, most poor and on medical assistance, have now received Manna\u2019s meals.\u201cI don\u2019t think any other insurer in the country is doing this to the scale we are,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your traditional way of managing care. You need to have the courage to stand up and say you can\u2019t just keep throwing money at these conditions by admitting people to the hospital.\u201dA caption in an earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a volunteer dietitian at Community Servings.

{"Headline": "Plunge in Lira, Turkey\u2019s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkey\u2019s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets. Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns. But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes. A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.After the Turkish lira fell even further \u2014 one dollar bought 3.8 liras at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was worth 7.2 liras \u2014 investors dumped other emerging-market currencies. The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand lost 2 percent after falling nearly 6 percent last week.Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping nearly 2 percent during the day. European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lagged for much of the day, and closed down 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent.\u201cTurkey\u2019s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country \u2014 in this case, Turkey \u2014 can quickly spread to other regions.Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country\u2019s prospects. Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank\u2019s independence.Normally, a country in Turkey\u2019s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency\u2019s slide. But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.\u201cIn the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as \u2018risk off\u2019 toward emerging markets,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.But \u201cTurkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.\u201dBut it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already at 17.75 percent. Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.\u201cDo not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists\u2019 and merchants\u2019 responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C.\u201dYet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey\u2019s interior ministry had opened investigations into 346 social media accounts officials said had helped \u201cmanipulate perceptions\u201d about the lira.Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.\u201cThe catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade,\u201d said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING. \u201cThis is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it\u2019s a pretty toxic environment.\u201dChina\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday. The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi by 0.34 percent against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level in 15 months.China\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 2 percent at one point on Monday, but it closed down 0.3 percent. The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index fell 2 percent. Stocks in Seoul fell 1.5 percent. A broad index of Europe\u2019s biggest companies was down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading.A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet. Turkey\u2019s economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned, but I wouldn\u2019t be pressing the panic button,\u201d the economist, Xu Sitao, said.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "El Salvador Recognizes China in Blow to Taiwan", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 El Salvador severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan on Tuesday and established ties with China, leaving only 17 nations that officially recognize the Taiwanese government.Latin America and the Caribbean have been an important bastion of support for Taiwan. Nine of the countries that maintain diplomatic ties are in the region. That has been eroding, however. Panama broke ties with Taiwan\u2019s government in 2017, and the Dominican Republic did the same in May 2018.China\u2019s Communist government seeks to absorb self-governed and democratic Taiwan and is campaigning to erase any acknowledgment of Taiwanese sovereignty by countries or corporations.In a nationally televised speech on Tuesday, El Salvador\u2019s president, Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, proclaimed the \u201cextraordinary opportunities\u201d that would come with recognizing China.Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said El Salvador had recently asked for loans for a port project that Taiwanese engineers concluded was economically unfeasible.Mr. Wu denounced Chinese tactics of using project financing to gain allies and said Taiwan was unwilling and unable to do the same.\u201cIt is irresponsible to engage in financial aid diplomacy or compete with China in cash,\u201d Mr. Wu said.Taiwan\u2019s government accused Beijing Tuesday of strong-arm tactics.\u201cChina\u2019s rude and unreasonable actions are not those of a responsible country, and they will have a seriously negative influence on cross-strait relations,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.Since breaking its ties with Taiwan, Panama has sought investment from Beijing. Last month, the two sides began free trade talks, with the aim of making Panama a hub for Chinese goods in Central America.The United States broke official ties with Taiwan in 1979 in order to establish relations with China, yet it has a robust unofficial relationship with Taiwan, as evidenced by its new $250 million diplomatic compound in the capital, Taipei.Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, recently traveled in the United States, drawing protests from Beijing, which has worked hard to isolate Taipei diplomatically.Ms. Tsai made the United States stops during a trip in which she also visited Paraguay and Belize, two of the 17 countries that maintain ties with the island nation.Since Ms. Tsai\u2019s inauguration two years ago, China has been using diplomatic, economic and military means to coerce Ms. Tsai into stating that Taiwan is a part of China, but she has shown no signs of capitulating.Ms. Tsai has repeatedly called for talks with Beijing, provided the two sides meet as equals and without political preconditions.\u201cAnything can be negotiated, except that our freedom and our future cannot be compromised,\u201d she said during a brief speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library last week, echoing the former American president.El Salvador\u2019s announcement that it is recognizing Beijing has ramifications for both her Democratic Progressive Party and the United States.Ms. Tsai is chairwoman of the party, which has historically favored formalizing Taiwan\u2019s independence. Local elections in November will serve as an unofficial referendum on the first two years of her administration, during which Beijing has refused to speak with her.The opposition Kuomintang \u2014 which ruled China until 1949 and is the Communist Party\u2019s preferred dialogue partner in Taiwan \u2014 will use the loss of the third diplomatic ally this year to attack Ms. Tsai and her party\u2019s ability to manage cross-strait relations.El Salvador\u2019s decision to switch its recognition from Taipei to Beijing also has strategic implications for Washington, as Taiwan\u2019s diminishing presence in the region allows for greater Chinese influence.In a news conference, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said from Beijing, \u201cI\u2019m confident the people of El Salvador will feel the warmth and friendship of the Chinese people and derive tangible benefits from its cooperation with China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "John McCain, War Hero, Senator, Presidential Contender, Dies at 81", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn S. McCain, the proud naval aviator who climbed from depths of despair as a prisoner of war in Vietnam to pinnacles of power as a Republican congressman and senator from Arizona and a two-time contender for the presidency, died on Saturday at his home in Arizona. He was 81.According to a statement from his office, Mr. McCain died at 4:28 p.m. local time. He had suffered from a malignant brain tumor, called a glioblastoma, for which he had been treated periodically with radiation and chemotherapy since its discovery in 2017.Despite his grave condition, he soon made a dramatic appearance in the Senate to cast a thumbs-down vote against his party\u2019s drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But while he was unable to be in the Senate for a vote on the Republican tax bill in December, his endorsement was crucial, though not decisive, in the Trump administration\u2019s lone legislative triumph of the year.A son and grandson of four-star admirals who were his larger-than-life heroes, Mr. McCain carried his renowned name into battle and into political fights for more than a half-century. It was an odyssey driven by raw ambition, the conservative instincts of a shrewd military man, a rebelliousness evident since childhood and a temper that sometimes bordered on explosiveness.Nowhere were those traits more manifest than in Vietnam, where he was stripped of all but his character. He boiled over in foul curses at his captors. Because his father was the commander of all American forces in the Pacific during most of his five and a half years of captivity, Mr. McCain, a Navy lieutenant commander, became the most famous prisoner of the war, a victim of horrendous torture and a tool of enemy propagandists.Shot down over Hanoi, suffering broken arms and a shattered leg, he was subjected to solitary confinement for two years and beaten frequently. Often he was suspended by ropes lashing his arms behind him. He attempted suicide twice. His weight fell to 105 pounds. He rejected early release to keep his honor and to avoid an enemy propaganda coup or risk demoralizing his fellow prisoners.He finally cracked under torture and signed a \u201cconfession.\u201d No one believed it, although he felt the burden of betraying his country. To millions of Americans, Mr. McCain was the embodiment of courage: a war hero who came home on crutches, psychologically scarred and broken in body, but not in spirit. He underwent long medical treatments and rehabilitation, but was left permanently disabled, unable to raise his arms over his head. Someone had to comb his hair.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018His mother, Roberta McCain, Navy all the way, inspired his political career. After retiring from the Navy and settling in Arizona, he won two terms in the House of Representatives, from 1983 to 1987, and six in the Senate. He was a Reagan Republican to start with, but later moved right or left, a maverick who defied his party\u2019s leaders and compromised with Democrats.He lost the 2000 Republican presidential nomination to George W. Bush, who won the White House.In 2008, against the backdrop of a growing financial crisis, Mr. McCain made the most daring move of his political career, seeking the presidency against the first major-party African-American nominee, Barack Obama. With national name recognition, a record for campaign finance reform and a reputation for candor \u2014 his campaign bus was called the Straight Talk Express \u2014 Mr. McCain won a series of primary elections and captured the Republican nomination.12 PhotosAt some McCain rallies, vitriolic crowds disparaged black people and Muslims, and when a woman said she did not trust Mr. Obama because \u201che\u2019s an Arab,\u201d Mr. McCain, in one of the most lauded moments of his campaign, replied: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\u201dAnalysts later said that Mr. Obama had engineered a nearly perfect campaign. And Mr. McCain confronted a hostile political environment for Republicans, who were dragged down by President George W. Bush\u2019s dismal approval ratings amid the economic crisis and an unpopular war in Iraq.\u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did,\u201d Mr. Obama said Saturday. \u201cBut all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John\u2019s best, he showed us what that means.\u201dReturning to his Senate duties, the resilient Mr. McCain moved to the right politically to fend off a Tea Party challenge to his 2010 re-election. He voted against the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care plan, which became law in 2010. He endorsed Mitt Romney\u2019s losing Republican bid for the presidency in 2012.But while he was a persistent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, Mr. McCain had by 2013 become a pivotal figure in the Senate, meeting with Mr. Obama and occasionally fashioning deals with him. He joined a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of Eight, that sought compromises on comprehensive immigration reform.\u201cWhen Mr. McCain is with the president \u2014 on immigration and in brokering the recent deal to secure Senate approval of stalled Obama nominees \u2014 they can usually trump the political right,\u201d The New York Times said in a 2013 news analysis. \u201cWhen he is against him \u2014 sabotaging Mr. Obama\u2019s plan last year to nominate Susan E. Rice as secretary of state \u2014 the White House rarely prevails.\u201dAs Congress reconvened in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate, Mr. McCain achieved his longtime goal to become chairman of the Armed Services Committee, with the power to advance his national security and fiscal objectives under a $600 billion military policy bill. He considered the post second only to occupying the White House as commander in chief.With the rise of Donald J. Trump, the Republican flame thrower who steered American politics sharply to the right after his election in 2016 as the nation\u2019s 45th president, Mr. McCain was one of the few powerful Republican voices in Congress to push back against Mr. Trump\u2019s often harsh, provocative statements and Twitter posts and his tide of changes.In his end-of-life memoir, Mr. McCain scorned Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming admiration for autocrats and disdain for refugees. \u201cHe seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes,\u201d he wrote of the president. \u201cThe appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.\u201dLong before Mr. Trump was criticized as setting new lows for public discourse, Mr. McCain himself had used coarse language and blunt insults, although they were far less assertive, and he often used them in jest. He called Secretary of State John Kerry, a Democrat, \u201ca human wrecking ball,\u201d and the right-wing Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u201cwacko birds.\u201dPersonal animus between Mr. McCain and Mr. Trump arose in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016. After months of boasts by Trump about his wealth, celebrity and deal-making as qualifications for the White House, and his dismissive capsule characterizations of climate change as \u201ca hoax\u201d and the Iraq war as \u201ca mistake,\u201d Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney, with standing as the previous two Republican presidential nominees, denounced Mr. Trump as unfit for the presidency.Saying Mr. Trump had neither the temperament nor the judgment for the White House, Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney called him ignorant on foreign policy and said he had made \u201cdangerous\u201d statements on national security. They warned that his election might imperil the United States and its democratic systems.\u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201dMr. McCain held his fire. But the nation was shocked. An avalanche of denunciations tumbled from editorial boards and political leaders, but the outrage faded into the tapestry of Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations against Mexicans, Muslims, women and black and Hispanic people. Trump supporters, who were mostly white, said his biases showed a refreshing willingness to disregard political correctness.On Saturday night, Mr. Trump expressed his sympathies and respect for Mr. McCain\u2019s family, but refrained from commenting on the senator himself.As the Trump juggernaut rolled on, Mr. McCain, campaigning for re-election to his sixth six-year term, did not attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, but said he would support his party\u2019s nominee. (Mr. McCain withdrew that support months later after a recording surfaced exposing lewd comments about women by Mr. Trump, who bragged that his celebrity allowed him to grope them.)With his wife, Ghazala, at his side, the father held up a pocket-size copy of the Constitution and asked if Mr. Trump had read it.In response, Mr. Trump belittled the parents, saying the soldier\u2019s father had delivered the speech because his wife had not been \u201callowed\u201d to speak. His implication, that Mrs. Khan had not spoken because of female subservience in some strains of Islam, drew widespread condemnation, led on Capitol Hill by Senator McCain.\u201cWhile our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI challenge the nominee to set the example for what our country can and should represent.\u201dSoon after Mr. McCain\u2019s statement, other Republican senators offered their own condemnations. In ensuing days, as outrage over the Trump remarks spread, Mr. Trump told his Twitter followers that Mr. Khan had \u201cno right\u201d to \u201cviciously\u201d attack him.Seemingly impervious to criticism of any kind, Mr. Trump, who had easily won nomination, turned his guns on Mrs. Clinton. After a bruising campaign laden with Trump falsehoods and scurrilous innuendo, he defeated her in the general election, losing the popular vote by nearly three million but winning in the Electoral College.After the election, Mr. McCain, determined to let the new administration take shape, said he would temporarily not discuss Mr. Trump publicly.But weeks after President Trump moved into the White House and began blindsiding the public and sometimes the government with executive orders and mixed messages on immigration, foreign policy and other issues, Mr. McCain, himself newly re-elected, let loose.\u201cMake no mistake, my friends, these are dangerous times,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut you should not count America out, and we should not count each other out.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his White House was operating like a \u201cfine-tuned machine,\u201d Mr. McCain said, \u201cIn many respects, this administration is in disarray.\u201dAppearing on the NBC News program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d a day later, Mr. McCain punctured Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that the news media was \u201cthe enemy of the American people.\u201d\u201cThe first thing that dictators do is shut down the press,\u201d Mr. McCain, a strong defender of the First Amendment, told his national television audience. While not expressly calling the president a dictator, he said, \u201cWe need to learn the lessons of history.\u201dFor a senator who had long backed free trade, NATO and assertive foreign policies, and who had harbored suspicions about Russian intentions, Mr. McCain\u2019s differences with Mr. Trump ran deep. He denounced Russia for \u201cinterfering\u201d in the presidential election and called for a select Senate committee to investigate the Kremlin\u2019s cyberactivities.His disapproval of Mr. Trump perhaps peaked in July, after the president and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met privately in Helsinki, Finland, and then participated in an extraordinary joint news conference there. Responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s performance, in which the president spoke favorably of his Russian counterpart and questioned American intelligence findings that the Russians had interfered in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. McCain declared, \u201cNo prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.\u201dAlthough Mr. McCain was sharply critical of Mr. Trump, especially when he thought the new president had threatened to overstep domestic or national interests, he remained broadly supportive of the administration\u2019s agenda.After an acrimonious yearlong fight over replacing the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, Mr. McCain joined the Senate\u2019s 54-to-45 majority to confirm Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Neil Gorsuch as an associate justice. Justice Gorsuch\u2019s installation tipped the court\u2019s balance in favor of a conservative majority that seemed destined to last for years.Mr. McCain voted for all but two of Mr. Trump\u2019s 15 cabinet selections and eight other administration posts requiring Senate confirmation. But he also chastised Mr. Trump for comments equating Russian and American interests. \u201cThat moral equivalency is a contradiction of everything the United States has ever stood for in the 20th and 21st centuries,\u201d he said.During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing taking testimony from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump, Mr. McCain posed confusing questions, seeming to conflate the 2016 investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state with the 2017 investigation of Russian interference in the American election. He later issued a clarification.\u201cWhat I was trying to get at was whether Mr. Comey believes that any of his interactions with the president rise to the level of obstruction of justice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the case of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails, Mr. Comey was willing to step beyond his role as an investigator and state his belief about what \u2018no reasonable prosecutor\u2019 would conclude about the evidence. I wanted Mr. Comey to apply the same approach to the key question surrounding his interactions with President Trump \u2014 whether or not the president\u2019s conduct constitutes obstruction of justice.\u201dSince he had opposed the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, Mr. McCain became a critical vote on the Republican bill to repeal and replace it. Written in secret, the Republicans\u2019 bill was opposed by health care and patient advocacy groups. Mr. McCain, fearing his constituents might be harmed, was noncommittal. After struggling to write a passable bill and with no votes to spare, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, put off a showdown when Mr. McCain was sidelined by surgery for a cranial blood clot over his left eye in July.Senator McCain\u2019s office disclosed that, behind the clot, his doctors had found a glioblastoma, an aggressive and malignant brain tumor. Medical experts said that such cancers may be treated with radiation and chemotherapy but almost always grow back, and that the median length of survival with a glioblastoma is about 16 months.The seven-year Republican drive to derail the Affordable Care Act had collapsed. Some pundits called the McCain vote cold revenge for Mr. Trump\u2019s mockery of his ordeal as a prisoner of war. But the senator told colleagues that he felt compelled only to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d And in a later statement, he gave a fuller explanation.\u201cThe vote last night presents the Senate with an opportunity to start fresh,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other, stop the political gamesmanship and put the health care needs of the American people first. We can do this.\u201dIn December, Mr. McCain had been expected to be a pivotal vote in the Republican drive to rewrite the nation\u2019s tax code and cut taxes for individuals and businesses by adding up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit. Critics of the measure had identified him as a potential holdout against his party\u2019s legislation. Days before the vote, however, Mr. McCain returned home to Arizona for medical treatment, and he did not cast a ballot in the Senate proceedings. But he endorsed the bill, and his support was important, though not decisive, in the Senate\u2019s 51-48 adoption of the tax package.John Sidney McCain III was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, one of many posts where his father, John Sidney McCain Jr., served in a long, distinguished Navy career. He was the middle sibling of three children. His mother, born Roberta Wright, was a California oil heiress. His parents eloped to Tijuana, Mexico, to marry in 1933.With his older sister, Jean Alexandra (who was known as Sandy), and brother, Joseph Pinckney McCain II, John grew up with frequent moves, an often-absent father, a rock-solid mother and family lore that traced ancestral lineages to combatants in every American war and to Scottish clans. There were also highly dubious family claims of having descended from Robert the Bruce, the 14th-century king of the Scots.The patriarch of the 20th-century military family was John\u2019s grandfather, Adm. John Sidney McCain Sr. A pioneer of aircraft carriers, he led many naval and air operations in the Western Pacific in World War II, covering Gen. Douglas MacArthur\u2019s invasion of the Philippines and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in the war\u2019s final stages. He was in the front row of officers aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese signed the documents of surrender in 1945.John\u2019s father was a decorated submarine commander in World War II. In Washington, the elder Mr. McCain was influential in political affairs as the postwar Navy\u2019s chief information officer and liaison with Congress. Senators, representatives and military brass were often guests at his home. Raised to full admiral, he was the commander of American naval forces in Europe and, from 1968 to 1972, of all American forces in the Pacific, including those in the Vietnam War theater.(Two Navy destroyers were named McCain, for the senator\u2019s father and grandfather, the first father-and-son full admirals in American naval history.)Whipsawed by family relocations, young John attended some 20 schools before finally settling into Episcopal High School, an all-white, all-boys boarding school in Alexandria, Va., in the fall of 1951 for his last three years of secondary education. The school, with an all-male faculty and enrollments drawn mostly from upper-crust families of the Old South, required jackets and ties for classes.But the scion of one of the Navy\u2019s most illustrious families was defiant and unruly. He mocked the dress code by wearing dirty bluejeans. His shoes were held together with tape, and his coat looked like a reject from the Salvation Army. He was cocky and combative, easily provoked and ready to fight anyone. Classmates called him McNasty. Most gave him a wide berth.\u201cHe cultivated the image,\u201d Robert Timberg wrote in a biography, \u201cJohn McCain: An American Odyssey\u201d (1995). \u201cThe Episcopal yearbook pictures him in a trench coat, collar up, cigarette dangling Bogey-style from his lips. That pose, if hardly the impression Episcopal sought to project, at least had a fashionable world-weary style to it.\u201dThat summer, he followed his father and grandfather into the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. He resisted the discipline. His grades were poor. He stood up to upperclassmen, broke rules and piled up demerits, though never enough to warrant expulsion. But he became a ferocious boxer, a magnet for attractive young women and one of the most popular midshipmen in his class.Mr. McCain possessed the rugged independence of a natural leader. It came out at parties and in carousing with friends. Caught by the Shore Patrol at an off-limits bar, he led a carload of drinking buddies in a daring escape. \u201cBeing on liberty with John McCain was like being in a train wreck,\u201d one recalled. In 1958, he graduated 894th in his class, fifth from the bottom.Accepted for flight training, the newly commissioned Ensign McCain learned to fly attack jets at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla. He also had flings with a succession of young women, from schoolteachers to strippers, and once with a tobacco heiress, \u201coften returning to base just in time to change clothes and drag himself out to the flight line,\u201d Mr. Timberg said.He liked flying, but his performance was subpar, sometimes careless or even reckless. In the 1960s he crashed in Corpus Christi Bay in Texas and Tidewater, Va., but escaped with minor injuries \u2014 and his flying skills improved over time. Early assignments were aboard aircraft carriers: the Intrepid in the Caribbean during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and the Enterprise in the Mediterranean.In 1965, Mr. McCain married Carol Shepp, a model. He adopted her two children, Douglas and Andrew, and they had a daughter, Sidney. After a long separation, the couple were divorced in 1980. He then married Cindy Lou Hensley, a Phoenix teacher whose father owned a beer distributorship. They had two sons, John IV and James, and a daughter, Meghan, and adopted a girl, Bridget, from a Bangladeshi orphanage.Senator McCain\u2019s survivors include his wife; his mother, who is 106; his brother; his sister, Sandy McCain Morgan; his seven children; and five grandchildren.Promoted to lieutenant commander in early 1967, Mr. McCain requested combat duty and was assigned to the carrier Forrestal, operating in the Gulf of Tonkin. Its A-4E Skyhawk warplanes were bombing North Vietnam in the campaign known as Operation Rolling Thunder. He flew five missions.Then, on July 29, 1967, he had just strapped himself into his cockpit on a deck crowded with planes when a missile fired accidentally from another jet struck his 200-gallon exterior fuel tank, and it exploded in flames. He scrambled out, crawled onto the plane\u2019s nose, dived onto a deck seething with burning fuel and rolled away until he cleared the flames.As he stood up, other aircraft and bomb loads exploded on deck. He was hit in the legs and chest by burning shrapnel. At one point, the Forrestal skipper considered abandoning ship. When the fire was finally brought under control, 134 men had been killed.Despite his misgivings, Mr. McCain volunteered for more missions and was transferred to the carrier Oriskany. On Oct. 26 he took off on his 23rd mission of the war, part of a 20-plane attack on a heavily defended power plant in central Hanoi. Moments after releasing his bombs on target, as he pulled out of his dive, a Soviet-made surface-to-air missile sheared off his right wing.He ejected as the plane plunged, but hit something as he exited. Both arms were broken and his right knee was shattered. He fell into a lake and, with 50 pounds of gear, sank 15 feet to the bottom, then pulled the inflating pins of his Mae West life jacket with his teeth and rose to the surface, gasping for air. Swimmers dragged him ashore, where he was set upon by a mob.Mr. McCain was stripped to his skivvies, kicked and spat upon, then bayoneted in the left ankle and groin. A North Vietnamese soldier struck him with his rifle butt, breaking a shoulder. A woman tried to give him a cup of tea as a photographer snapped pictures. Carried to a truck, Mr. McCain was driven to Hoa Lo, the prison compound its American inmates had labeled the Hanoi Hilton.There he was denied medical care. His knee swelled to the size and color of a football. He lapsed in and out of consciousness for days. When he awoke in a cell infested with roaches and rats, he was interrogated and beaten. The beatings continued for days. He gave his name, rank and serial number and defied his tormentors with curses.After two weeks, a doctor, without anesthesia, tried to set his right arm, broken in three places, but gave up in frustration and encased it in a plaster cast. He was moved to another site and tended by two American prisoners of war, who brought him back from near death.Commander McCain\u2019s prisoner-of-war status was widely reported around the world. Only after his captors learned that his father was an admiral was he given a modicum of medical treatment. Other prisoners said he spoke, incongruously, of someday being president of the United States.Once he was visited by a group of North Vietnamese dignitaries. A prisoner, Jack Van Loan, said Mr. McCain shrieked at them. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy that\u2019s all crippled up, all busted up, and he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to live to the next day, and he literally blew them out of there with a verbal assault,\u201d Mr. Van Loan told Mr. Timberg. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the example John set for the rest of the camp by doing that.\u201dIn March 1968, Mr. McCain was put in solitary confinement, fed only watery pumpkin soup and scraps of bread. It lasted two years. When Admiral McCain became the Pacific Theater commander in July, his son was offered early repatriation repeatedly. Commander McCain refused, following a military code that prisoners were to be released in the order taken. He was beaten frequently and tortured with ropes.Years after his confession to \u201cwar crimes\u201d and \u201cair piracy,\u201d Mr. McCain wrote: \u201cI had learned what we all learned over there: that every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.\u201dHis ordeal finally ended on March 14, 1973, two months after the Paris Peace Accords had ended American involvement in the war. The place he had lived longest in his nomadic life was Hanoi. At 36, his hair had gone white. He went home a celebrity, cheered in parades, showered with medals, embraced by President Richard M. Nixon and Gov. Ronald Reagan of California.For a Navy man who had always tried to live up to his father\u2019s accomplishments, the Silver and Bronze Stars, the Distinguished Flying Cross and other decorations he received were not enough. But a psychiatrist\u2019s report seemed to capture his happiest moment. \u201cFelt fulfillment,\u201d it said, \u201cwhen his dad was introduced at a dinner as \u2018Commander McCain\u2019s father.\u2019 \u201dAfter months of rehabilitation and recovery, he returned to duty and became the Navy\u2019s Senate liaison, as his father had once been. But he knew that his Navy future would be limited by his physical disabilities, and that he would never be an admiral like his forebears. With his mother\u2019s encouragement, he was already thinking about a political career when he retired as a captain in 1981.Setting his sights on a congressional seat, he settled in Phoenix and became a public relations executive for his father-in-law\u2019s beer distributorship. He developed contacts in the news media and business community, and got to know real estate developers and bankers like Charles Keating Jr.When Representative John Rhodes of Arizona retired after 30 years in Congress in 1982, Mr. McCain, in a campaign partly financed by his wife, easily won the seat in a Republican district. He embraced President Reagan\u2019s agenda of tax and budget cuts and a strong national defense, but voted to override Mr. Reagan\u2019s veto of sanctions against South Africa for its racist policies. He was re-elected in 1984.After Senator Barry M. Goldwater decided not to seek re-election as Arizona\u2019s conservative stalwart in 1986, Mr. McCain crushed Richard Kimball, a former Democratic state legislator, for the seat. He won appointments to the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee, and soon gained national attention.A longtime gambler with ties to the gaming industry, Mr. McCain helped write the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, codifying regulations for Native American gambling enterprises. He backed legislation, sponsored by Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, for automatic spending cuts in deficit budgets. He was shortlisted as a vice-presidential running mate by the 1988 Republican nominee, George Bush, who won the White House (with Senator Dan Quayle on the ticket).But Mr. McCain\u2019s rising political career was almost upended by scandal. He was one of five senators who took favors from Charles Keating to intercede with federal regulators on behalf of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, which collapsed with catastrophic losses. The scandal cost the government and investors billions, and Mr. Keating went to prison for fraud; the so-called Keating Five, cleared of wrongdoing by Senate investigators, were only rebuked for ethical lapses.In the years that followed, Mr. McCain reinvented himself as a scourge of special interests, crusading for stricter ethics and campaign finance rules, a man of honor chastened by a brush with shame.The Persian Gulf War in 1991 also helped restore Mr. McCain\u2019s tarnished image. As a television commentator, he showcased his military savvy and impressed Americans as an authoritative voice on foreign policy. While Mr. Bush lost the White House to Bill Clinton in 1992, Mr. McCain easily won re-election.After years of voting along party lines, Mr. McCain, in the 1990s, emphasized his independence. With the presidency in his distant sights, he challenged Republican leaders and Democrats and was harder to peg politically. He became a self-appointed Republican spokesman on national security \u2014 challenging the Clinton administration\u2019s intervention in Somalia, counseling against deploying American troops to the Balkans and sounding an early warning on North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions.Mr. McCain was a member of the Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, which found \u201cno compelling evidence\u201d that Americans were still alive in captivity in Southeast Asia. (Senator John Kerry, a Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran, was the chairman.) Veterans groups and families of long-missing troops rejected the report. He also pressed for full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, which were achieved in 1995.In the 1996 election, Mr. McCain appeared to be a favorite for the Republican vice-presidential slot, but former Senator Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, chose Jack Kemp, the former congressman and football star. They would lose to Mr. Clinton and Al Gore.Mr. McCain won re-election to a third term by a landslide in 1998, and a year later he published a memoir, \u201cFaith of My Fathers,\u201d which became a best seller in time for the 2000 election campaign and was later made into a television movie, starring Shawn Hatosy as Mr. McCain.Seeking the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, Mr. McCain pledged \u201ca fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests.\u201d Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was favored, but Mr. McCain won the New Hampshire primary, 49 to 30 percent. South Carolina\u2019s primary then loomed as crucial.It was one of the era\u2019s dirtiest campaigns. Anonymous smears falsely claimed that Mr. McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock, that his wife was a drug addict and that he was a homosexual, a traitor and mentally unstable. McCain ads portrayed Mr. Bush as a liar and called his religious supporters, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the televangelist Pat Robertson, \u201cagents of intolerance.\u201dMr. McCain later said he regretted calling a Confederate flag on the State Capitol in Columbia a \u201csymbol of heritage.\u201d Civil rights groups had denounced it as a symbol of slavery and oppression of African-Americans. \u201cI feared that if I answered honestly, I could not win the South Carolina primary,\u201d Mr. McCain admitted.Mr. Bush won the primary and the nomination, and narrowly defeated the Democrat, Vice President Gore, in the general election.After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. McCain supported the Bush administration\u2019s war on terrorism; its invasion of Afghanistan to suppress a fanatic Taliban regime and hunt for Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the terrorist attacks; and later the invasion of Iraq to depose President Saddam Hussein, the tyrant who was wrongly believed to have weapons of mass destruction.Rewarded for years of pushing campaign-finance reforms, Mr. McCain and Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, finally saw passage in 2002 of the McCain-Feingold Act. It banned a key source of financing for both parties, so-called soft money donated in unlimited amounts to build party strengths, and it limited donations for national candidates to \u201chard money,\u201d subject to annual limits and other rules. The law\u2019s effects became tangled in lawsuits, court rulings and financing schemes.As a torture victim, Mr. McCain was sensitive to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the fight against terrorism. In 2005 the Senate passed his bill to bar inhumane treatment of prisoners, including those at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, by limiting military practices to those permitted by the United States Army Field Manual on Interrogation. His 2008 bill to ban waterboarding as torture was adopted, but vetoed by President Bush.Mr. McCain wrote six books with his aide, Mark Salter, all with themes of courage. Besides his 2018 memoir, they were \u201cWorth the Fighting For\u201d (2002), \u201cWhy Courage Matters: The Way to a Braver Life\u201d (2004), \u201cCharacter Is Destiny: Inspiring Stories Every Young Person Should Know and Every Adult Should Remember\u201d (2005), \u201cHard Call: Great Decisions and the Extraordinary People Who Made Them\u201d (2007) and \u201cThirteen Soldiers: A Personal History of Americans at War\u201d (2014).In 1993, Mr. McCain gave the commencement address at Annapolis: the sorcerer\u2019s apprentice, home to inspire the midshipmen. He spoke of Navy aviators hurled from the decks of pitching aircraft carriers, of Navy gunners blazing into the silhouettes of onrushing kamikazes, of trapped Marines battling overwhelming Chinese hordes in a breakout from the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea.\u201cI have spent time in the company of heroes,\u201d he said. \u201cI have watched men suffer the anguish of imprisonment, defy appalling cruelty until further resistance is impossible, break for a moment, then recover inhuman strength to defy their enemies once more. All these things and more I have seen. And so will you. I will go to my grave in gratitude to my Creator for allowing me to stand witness to such courage and honor. And so will you.\u201cMy time is slipping by. Yours is fast approaching. You will know where your duty lies. You will know.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary omitted the names of three of Mr. McCain\u2019s survivors. In addition to his wife, children and grandchildren, he is survived by his mother, Roberta McCain; a brother, Joseph; and a sister, Sandy McCain Morgan.An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to the fire onboard the aircraft carrier Forrestal, on which Mr. McCain served, that killed 134 people. It was not the worst noncombat incident in American naval history; there were several other incidents with higher death tolls. The earlier version also misstated Mr. McCain\u2019s position on the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs. He was a member, not a co-chairman. And because of an editing error, the earlier version misstated the league in which the 1996 Republican vice-presidential nominee Jack Kemp had been a star before entering politics. It was the American Football League, not the National Football League.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Praises Manafort, Saying \u2018Unlike Michael Cohen\u2019 He \u2018Refused to Break\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday praised his just-convicted former campaign chairman for refusing to \u201cbreak\u201d and cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, expressing appreciation for the personal loyalty of a felon found guilty of defrauding the United States government.He compared Mr. Cohen unfavorably with Mr. Manafort, attacking Mr. Cohen as a bad lawyer who had caved to pressure from biased federal prosecutors while lauding Mr. Manafort as a \u201cbrave man\u201d with a \u201cwonderful family\u201d who had stood strong.The president played down the wrongdoing by both men, noting that the jury in Mr. Manafort\u2019s case convicted him of eight counts of fraud but did not reach a conclusion on 10 other charges.He was harsher on Mr. Cohen, writing that if anybody wanted a good lawyer, he \u201cwould strongly suggest\u201d not hiring him. But the president also claimed falsely that the felonies to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty were, in fact, \u201cnot a crime.\u201dAt the White House, the mood was somber as aides struggled to come to grips with news that raised profound questions about Mr. Trump and the future of his presidency, including whether he had lied to the American public, whether he would be impeached and whether he considered himself above the law.Pressed on those issues by reporters at a news briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, insisted there was no crisis afoot in the West Wing. She said neither Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction nor Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea had anything to do with Mr. Trump, and they did not have any bearing on him.\u201cThe president has done nothing wrong,\u201d Ms. Sanders said during the unusually subdued question-and-answer session. \u201cThere are no charges against him. There is no collusion.\u201dGrim-faced as she fielded a variety of questions about Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen and the implications of their misdeeds for the president, Ms. Sanders recited the three-part denial again and again, as if to will the issue away.A flow chart that shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer saw to it that a porn star and a former Playboy model received payments after alleging affairs with Mr. Trump.\u201cJust because Michael Cohen made a plea deal doesn\u2019t mean that implicates the president on anything,\u201d she said.Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes, one over a $130,000 payment he made to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The other was tied to an arrangement with a tabloid that bought the rights to a story about a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, and then killed it, paying her $150,000.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Mr. Trump \u2014 who could be heard in an audio recording released last month discussing with Mr. Cohen arrangements for the payment to be made to Ms. McDougal \u2014 said he had become aware of the payments only after they were made. He emphasized that the payments Mr. Cohen admitted to in his guilty plea did not come from campaign funds.\u201cMy first question when I heard about it was, \u2018Did they come out of the campaign?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBecause that could be a little dicey.\u201dIn fact, payments from either Mr. Trump\u2019s personal or corporate accounts could prompt campaign finance reporting requirements.Ms. Sanders said the president had not lied about the payments when he initially said he did not know about them. She called it \u201ca ridiculous allegation\u201d and refused to say whether the White House stood by its denial of the affairs, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve addressed this a number of times.\u201d\u201cHe had a massive campaign violation, but he had a different attorney general, and they viewed it a lot differently,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Obama, adding a jab at his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions.Mr. Trump was referring to a Federal Election Commission finding in 2013 that during Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign he did not file finance reports in a timely manner. Mr. Obama\u2019s violation was a civil one, unlike the felonies Mr. Cohen admitted to on Tuesday \u2014 making a campaign donation above the legal limit and doing so, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s words, \u201cto keep an individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign from publicly disclosing this information.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts on Wednesday seemed to raise the possibility of a presidential pardon for Mr. Manafort, and appeared intended to be a reminder of how highly he values loyalty.And in them, the president resorted to language more familiar to a police procedural than to the Oval Office, describing Mr. Manafort\u2019s refusal to \u201cbreak\u201d under pressure to cut a deal with prosecutors.Some legal experts said the president\u2019s words and his view on the predicaments of members of his inner circle were striking for their similarity to the culture of organized crime.\u201cBy crediting Paul Manafort for not \u2018breaking\u2019 and chastising Michael Cohen for showing an interest in cooperating, he\u2019s really adopting the language and the sentiment of prizing what the mob would call a \u2018stand-up guy\u2019 \u2014 someone who takes your rap and goes to jail because of your loyalty to the mob, rather than to your own family,\u201d said Daniel S. Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who worked on organized crime cases in the Southern District of New York. \u201cThe parallel is to a mob boss who expects the loyalty oath from his soldiers.\u201d\u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see in Trump\u2019s message here is that it\u2019s very important to enforce the laws only as they do not apply to him, and any laws that may apply to him, he has no interest in enforcing,\u201d Mr. Goldman added.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called for a delay in the confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh, and some rank-and-file Democrats said they would not meet with him.Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, who would lead impeachment proceedings, implored Republicans to reach across party lines to address what he called the \u201cculture of corruption\u201d around Mr. Trump.\u201cThe president of the United States is now directly implicated in a criminal conspiracy, numerous members of both his campaign and administration have been convicted, pleaded guilty to felonies, or are ensnared in corruption investigations, and the Judiciary Committee has real work to do,\u201d Mr. Nadler said.\u201cDemocrats are poised to take action to respond to this culture of corruption that has taken hold under Mr. Trump and Republican congressional majorities,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is not too late for my Republican colleagues to put our country ahead of their politics and join us in our work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Indictment of Duncan Hunter, Explained", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProsecutors claim Representative Duncan Hunter and his wife spent over $250,000 of campaign funds on personal items. Here is an explanation of the indictment filed on Tuesday.The 48-page indictment, handed down by a federal grand jury in San Diego, alleges a pattern of illegal behavior between 2009 and 2016 and makes Mr. Hunter, 41, the second Republican member of Congress to be indicted on corruption charges this month. On Wednesday, Mr. Hunter said he believed the indictment was a politically motivated attack.Here are some of the accusations from the indictment of Mr. Hunter.The indictment lays out the context within which prosecutors claim Mr. Hunter and his wife \u201cillegally converted and stole more than $250,000 in Campaign funds to purchase goods and services for their personal use and enjoyment.\u201d Prosecutors said the two were reckless spenders, living beyond their means and racking up steep debts before deciding to use the campaign\u2019s bank account. 16. Throughout the relevant period, the HUNTERS spent substantially more than they earned. They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period resulting in approximately $37,761 in \u201coverdraft\u201d and \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d bank fees. Their credit cards were frequently charged to the credit limit, often with five-figure balances, resulting in approximately $24,600 in finance charges, interest, and other fees related to late, over the limit, and returned payment fees.17. By virtue of these delinquencies \u2014 as well as notifications of outstanding debts and overdue payments from their children\u2019s school, their family dentist, and other creditors the HUNTERS knew that many of their desired purchases could only be made by using Campaign funds.Prosecutors said the Hunters spent campaign funds on expensive family vacations. 47) On or about October 22 to 24, 2011, in Los Angeles, California and elsewhere, the HUNTERS spent $432.81 in Campaign funds for a family vacation centered on a family member\u2019s participation in a dance competition.48) On or about October 24, 2011, in San Diego, California, DUNCAN HUNTER spent $344.56 in Campaign funds at Enterprise Rent-A-Car to rent a vehicle so that he could drive from Los Angeles International Airport (\u201cLAX\u201d) for a family member\u2019s dance competition in Orange County.In the fall of 2015, the family went to Italy, where they tried to use the United States Navy to justify their spending, prosecutors said. When that failed, prosecutors claim Mr. Hunter \u2014 a former Marine \u2014 had sharp words for the military. On or about November 19 to 29, 2015, the HUNTERS spent $14,261.33 (including airfare) in Campaign funds to pay for a family vacation to Italy.On or about November 23, 2015, in an attempt to justify the use of Campaign funds to pay for the family\u2019s trip to Italy, DUNCAN HUNTER attempted to set up a day tour of a U.S. naval facility in Italy. After Navy officials responded that they could only provide a tour on a particular date, DUNCAN HUNTER said he would discuss the proposed date with MARGARET HUNTER, then subsequently told his Chief of Staff, \u201ctell the navy to go f*** themselves [no alteration in original],\u201d and no tour occurred.Earlier that year they went to Hawaii, where they again mentioned the armed forces as part of the reason for the trip. Prosecutors said Mrs. Hunter advised her husband to claim that his spending was actually a charitable donation, apparently referencing one of the many organizations that serve wounded veterans.116) On or about March 20, 2015, when DUNCAN HUNTER told MARGARET HUNTER that he was planning \u201cto buy my Hawaii shorts\u201d but had run out of money, she counseled him to buy the shorts at a golf pro shop so that they could falsely describe the purchase later as \u201csome [golf] balls for the wounded warriors.\u201d119) On or about April 7, 2015, in Lahaina, Hawaii, the HUNTERS spent $6,288.74 in Campaign funds at the Aston Kaanapali Shores resort to pay for a family vacation.Prosecutors said the Hunters also used campaign funds to spend lavishly on gifts, meals and vacations for their friends and relatives. 121) On or about April 20, 2015, MARGARET HUNTER spent $995.50 in Campaign funds at United Airlines to buy tickets for her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend to fly to Warsaw, Poland. MARGARET HUNTER falsely told the Treasurer that they were related to Campaign trips to New Orleans and Kentucky.102) On or about October 22, 2014, in San Diego, California, DUNCAN HUNTER spent $204.34 in Campaign funds for two greens fees, food, and drinks at the Rancho Bernardo Golf Resort, during a personal golf outing with friends, including Individual lA. To conceal and disguise his illegal activity, he misled his Chief of Staff by describing his regular golf outing with Individual IA as \u201ca Christian thing\u201d with a supporter.The indictment accuses Mrs. Hunter of using a 2012 meeting of the National Republican Congressional Committee as a cover to buy plane tickets for at least four of her relatives.54) On or about January 12, 2012, in Alpine, California, MARGARET HUNTER spent $918.60 in Campaign funds at Expedia to fly her sister and two other family members to a funeral in Tucson. To conceal and disguise the illegal charges, she falsely told the Treasurer that they were for a \u201cflight to Baltimore for NRCC winter meeting.\u201d55) On or about January 22, 2012, MARGARET HUNTER spent $504.20 in Campaign funds to buy a roundtrip United Airlines ticket for her mother from San Diego to Chicago. To conceal and disguise the illegal charge, she falsely told the Treasurer that they were for a \u201cflight to Baltimore for NRCC winter meeting.\u201d98) On or about July 9, 2014, the HUNTERS spent $250 in Campaign funds at United Airlines to fly a family pet to Washington, D.C. for a family vacation.But many of the expenses outlined in the indictment point to a family struggling with debt and straining to maintain an upper middle class lifestyle. Prosecutors said the Hunters used some of the money to buy creature comforts. 75) On or about December 4, 2012, in San Diego, California, MARGARET HUNTER spent $145.46 in Campaign funds at Bloomingdale\u2019s to purchase cosmetics for personal use.82) On or about June 17, 2013, in El Cajon, California, DUNCAN HUNTER spent $163.53 in Campaign funds at Best Buy to purchase a pair of sports headphones for his personal use. At this time, the HUNTER family bank account had a negative balance and incurred three insufficient funds fees (totaling $102).But prosecutors said the family also spent campaign funds to keep their heads above water, using some of the money to keep their utilities from being shut off and to partially pay off overdue dental bills and tuition payments for their children. According to the indictment, Mrs. Hunter claimed much of that money had been given to charity, including Smiles for Life, which helps underprivileged children receive dental care.7) On or about August 5, 2015, in La Mesa, California, MARGARET HUNTER spent $700 in Campaign funds at a local dentist to continue to pay down the family's overdue balance. In order to conceal and disguise this illegal payment, she told the Treasurer that part of the payment was a charitable contribution for \"Smiles for Life.\" 138) On or about August 8, 2015, in Alpine, California, MARGARET HUNTER spent $300 in Campaign funds at the local water utility after the utility threatened to discontinue the HUNTERS' water service due to unpaid bills. 139) On or about August 12, 2015, in El Cajon, California, MARGARET HUNTER spent $3,500 in Campaign funds to pay the family's tuition bill at Christian Unified Schools- one of three different dates in 2015 that MARGARET HUNTER spent a total of $6,150 in Campaign funds to pay tuition. To conceal and disguise these illegal payments, the HUNTERS provided a number of conflicting explanations, including that the payments were charitable contributions. Advertisement"}

In the 1970s, most money flowing into developing countries was in the form of aid. That paradigm has been flipped on its head; the vast majority today is foreign direct investment.And yet, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation has remained largely the same. Other wealthy countries have created modern development finance institutions, but the United States has not.Development experts \u2014 some of whom have pushed for years to modernize OPIC \u2014 are the most surprised. They did not expect this kind of support from a White House that has proposed slashing foreign aid budgets or a president who has made derogatory comments about countries in Africa. But there are concerns that under its current chief executive, a businessman and big Republican donor, the agency could lose sight of its core mission to help poor countries develop.The changes are long overdue. Similar European institutions were established years ago. But that\u2019s not the main reason for this dramatic shift. The new OPIC is seen as a way to counter China\u2019s growing influence in Asia and Africa.The new agency has a powerful champion in OPIC\u2019s chief executive, Ray Washburne, who has close ties to the White House. A Texas-based restaurant and real estate investor, he was vice chairman of the Trump Victory Committee and head of the transition\u2019s commerce team. He meets regularly with the White House, and he asked for and received an enclosed area to process classified information, something no previous OPIC chief executive has had.In its first budget proposal, the Trump administration suggested eliminating OPIC. But Mr. Washburne made it clear that he wanted to build it. \u201cI had a lot of relationships up on the Hill, I had a lot of relationships within the White House from my experience working on the campaign,\u201d he told me in an interview in June. \u201cAnd so I was able to go in and really sell to the administration what OPIC is and should be and can be.\u201dMr. Washburne and OPIC\u2019s allies in Congress plan to roughly double its total spending cap to $60 billion, and want to give the new agency the ability to make equity investments and lend in local currency, allowing it to work with a wider range of funding partners and companies.Still, there are significant concerns among development experts about the future of the agency. They notice that Mr. Washburne talks about OPIC as a foreign policy tool, but he rarely talks about how the new agency will improve health, livelihoods or infrastructure. They worry that investment deals will not get the scrutiny they need, and that those close to the administration might get preferential treatment. The legislation proposed for the new OPIC also initially lacked specific language about the future of OPIC\u2019s environmental and social policies that protect local communities. (Those protections were added to the bill in committee.)Increasingly, poor countries want investment, not aid, from the United States. But with more money and more tools, the new OPIC must resist the temptation to focus on investment returns alone. If the agency veers away from its core mission, then the United States, and the world, would lose a potentially powerful tool for improving the lives of millions.Adva Saldinger is an associate editor at Devex.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Age That Women Have Babies: How a Gap Divides America", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nBecoming a mother used to be seen as a unifying milestone for women in the United States. But a new analysis of four decades of births shows that the age that women become mothers varies significantly by geography and education. The result is that children are born into very different family lives, heading for diverging economic futures.People with a higher socioeconomic status \u201cjust have more potential things they could do instead of being a parent, like going to college or grad school and having a fulfilling career,\u201d said Heather Rackin, a sociologist at Louisiana State University who studies fertility. \u201cLower-socioeconomic-status people might not have as many opportunity costs \u2014 and motherhood has these benefits of emotional fulfillment, status in their community and a path to becoming an adult.\u201d\u201cThese education patterns do help drive inequality, because well-educated women are really pulling ahead of the pack by waiting to have kids,\u201d said Caroline Hartnett, a sociologist and demographer studying fertility and families at the University of South Carolina. \u201cBut if going to college and achieving an upper-middle-class lifestyle seems unattainable, then having a family might seem like the most accessible source of meaning to you.\u201dCollege is a stronger factor than geography or home prices. The average age of first birth among college-educated women doesn\u2019t vary much between counties with large, expensive cities and those with smaller, more affordable ones. In Hennepin County, the home of Minneapolis, where Zillow says the typical home costs $259,000, the average age of first birth for a college-educated woman is 31. In Brooklyn, where the average home costs $788,000, it\u2019s 32.Counties with the oldest first-time mothersWhen do women enter motherhood in your county?The gulf aligns with other disparities in the way Americans live \u2014 including differing attitudes about the role of women.\u201cIn places where people have children earlier and younger, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re less happy, but they are less gender equal in terms of economics,\u201d said Philip Cohen, a sociologist studying families and social inequality at the University of Maryland.Ellen Scanlon, who lives in San Francisco, became a first-time mother three months ago at age 40. First she went to business school, built a career in finance and started a strategy consulting firm. She met her future husband when she was 31, but they were in no rush to start a family.\u201cWe were just having a really good time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love to travel, we were really happy we found each other, and I think I sort of believed you can have a baby when you want.\u201dBut after they married, when she was 36, they struggled with fertility. It took three and a half years of visiting specialists around the country before she became pregnant via in vitro fertilization.Being further along in her career gave her flexibility to take time off for treatments and a long maternity leave, she said: \u201cI have more confidence that it\u2019s not going to be that challenging to pull it back together.\u201dIt has also given her and her husband, who works in financial services, enough money to have already started a college savings account for their infant son, Lee, and to be able to enroll him in private school and to travel. \u201cWe\u2019re dying to take him places and just show him that the world is large,\u201d she said.Natalia Maani, an obstetrician at Starr County Hospital in Rio Grande City, Tex., where the average age of first birth is 22, said very few of her pregnant patients are married, and she can count on two hands the number of pregnancies that were planned. Many can\u2019t afford birth control, she said. Most wouldn\u2019t consider abortion, and there is no provider nearby. And the cultural norm is to start families young.\u201cPeople here don\u2019t have a population going from high school to college,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no thoughts about getting your degree, becoming independent or traveling the world.\u201dSadie Marie Groff, who lives in Missoula, Mont., was 20 when she had her first son, Dahvon. It wasn\u2019t planned, and she wasn\u2019t married. She had two more boys, Allen and Zayden, with a different man, who is now her husband.She hadn\u2019t thought much about college before becoming pregnant, she said, but her goal now is to get a degree in radiologic technology, once she has time to take courses. Now 28, she takes care of her children during the day and works three-hour shifts as a health aide at night.Being a young mother has benefits, she said: \u201cI still have a lot of energy to deal with them, and when they get older, I won\u2019t be too old.\u201dBut it has been financially difficult. When she was pregnant with her second baby, she temporarily moved into a home run by Mountain Home Montana, a nonprofit aimed at helping young mothers. It also provides child care and employment counseling, and she receives government assistance for housing and health care.The average age of first birth is based on birth certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Data is not shown for counties where there were fewer than 10 first births. Data from each year is averaged with the previous two years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anatomy of a Crime: Sex, Hush Money and a Trump Fixer\u2019s Guilty Plea", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe federal campaign finance and tax evasion case that is embroiling the White House began in the unlikeliest of places: the world of supermarket tabloids.It is populated by porn stars and Playboy models, shadowy \u201cstory brokers\u201d and the ultra rich and powerful, who can buy back their secrets on an underground exchange run by gossip scribes who set the rules, the prices and, frequently, the reputational toll.That world has now come to life on the stark pages of federal court documents that detail violations of campaign finance and tax laws, implicating President Trump and reprising Watergate-era talk of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and possible impeachment.The anatomy of the crime the court papers describe \u2014 stemming from hush money payments to two women who claimed they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump \u2014 has a reality-television twist that has come to typify the Trump presidency. One of the women, the pornographic film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, went public with her story earlier this year in a media blitz, and she was represented by a brash lawyer who says he now is considering running for president.\u201cYou have to go back to Watergate-era scandals to find similarly colorful and outrageous events,\u201d said Daniel A. Petalas, a former head of enforcement at the Federal Election Commission and a former Justice Department public corruption prosecutor. \u201cWhen political figures are engaged in conduct that might be tawdry or salacious, it\u2019s not unusual that the other participants have colorful histories and backgrounds themselves.\u201dLike so many political scandals before it, this one began with a typical worry for some candidates: that their history of extramarital affairs and other sexual behavior could undermine a bid for office.The trouble for Mr. Trump, some of which was first disclosed just before the 2016 election, began a decade earlier, shortly after the birth of his son with Melania Trump. Mr. Trump allegedly began affairs with Ms. Clifford, whom he met at a celebrity golf tournament; and Karen McDougal, then a Playboy model he met at the Playboy Mansion while filming an episode of his NBC hit \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201dMr. Trump had an ally in the nation\u2019s biggest tabloid news publisher, American Media Inc., which controls nearly every gossip magazine on checkout counter racks throughout the country, and is a magnet for people with embarrassing tales to sell about the rich and the famous.Its flagship, The National Enquirer, proved in 2008 that it could be as threatening to a politician as to a Hollywood star, when it uncovered an affair that John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate, had with a campaign worker that resulted in the birth of a child. Political supporters of Mr. Edwards helped finance the cover-up, leading to an unsuccessful yet groundbreaking campaign finance case that created a template for the charges against Mr. Cohen.The court documents filed Tuesday in connection with Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea provided a far more detailed account than previously known about the payments made to suppress women\u2019s stories about Mr. Trump that could have threatened his election prospects. The filings revealed the involvement of executives at The Trump Organization, who routed reimbursements to Mr. Cohen through a Trump trust using \u201csham invoices.\u201dFor the first time, prosecutors said that the tabloid publisher American Media Inc. had been involved in deals to buy the silence of both Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal. And as early as August 2015, prosecutors revealed, Mr. Cohen communicated with the chairman of American Media, David J. Pecker, who agreed to turn the organization\u2019s tip line into a trip wire that could detect potential trouble for Mr. Trump. Mr. Pecker agreed to \u201chelp deal with negative stories,\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201crelationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201dMr. Pecker made that promise, prosecutors said, \u201cin coordination with\u201d Mr. Cohen, \u201cand one or more members of the campaign.\u201dProsecutors and Mr. Cohen said that he undertook his work with A.M.I. at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction \u2014 an assertion the president denied, telling Fox News on Wednesday that he learned of the payments only later. In the campaign\u2019s early days in 2015, Mr. Trump was operating a bare-bones staff that included his communications director, Hope Hicks; his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; and, until that August, his longtime consigliere, Roger Stone.Prosecutors identified June 2016 \u2014 around the time Mr. Trump effectively clinched the Republican nomination \u2014 as the beginning of the plot to pay off Ms. McDougal. A fitness specialist and model by then, Ms. McDougal had been named Playboy\u2019s Playmate of the Year for 1998 but came from wholesome roots as a preschool teacher. Even in recent interviews, she has maintained that she admires Mr. Trump, saying she broke off their relationship in 2007 out of her own sense of guilt about being involved in an extramarital affair.She has said that she decided to sell her story in 2016 when another former Playboy model hinted at it on Twitter, causing her to worry that it would become public whether she liked it or not. After a friend convinced her that she might as well make money from it, she decided to approach the tabloids and hired a Los Angeles lawyer, Keith M. Davidson, to help her do it.Mr. Davidson\u2019s client list included professional athletes like Manny Pacquiao and Jalen Rose, but his work also brought him into the orbit of regular subjects of tabloid news such as the wrestler Hulk Hogan and the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d actor Verne Troyer. He had worked with A.M.I. and other gossip publishers, both in selling information and in seeking to block stories that might damage clients\u2019 reputations.According to prosecutors, when Ms. McDougal and Mr. Davidson approached American Media, Mr. Pecker, along with his top editorial executive, Dylan Howard, immediately informed Mr. Cohen. More important, the prosecutors allege, Mr. Cohen then urged A.M.I. to buy her story in order to suppress it, \u201cso as to prevent it from influencing the election.\u201dThe First Amendment gives media companies wide latitude to communicate with candidates and, several campaign finance law experts have said, even allows them to coordinate coverage with campaigns \u2014 which makes sense for a country that had a very partisan press corps at its founding.\u201cA media entity can talk with a campaign about coverage as part of its media function,\u201d said Trevor Potter, a founder of the Campaign Legal Center who helped write part of the campaign finance law.But a media company makes an illegal corporate contribution if it acts outside its \u201clegitimate press function\u201d in coordinating with a campaign to spend money to influence an election. Such activity \u201cis not like the action of a media company deciding what to cover and exercising editorial judgment,\u201d Potter said.And that\u2019s where, prosecutors allege, the relationship between Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump and potentially others in his campaign took an illegal turn.Speaking in court on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen said he arranged the payment \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office.\u201d Prosecutors said that A.M.I.\u2019s $150,000 agreement with Ms. McDougal came after Mr. Cohen promised the company that it would be reimbursed. Prosecutors report that Mr. Cohen effectively moved to do that several weeks later, setting up a shell company to buy the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story about Mr. Trump from A.M.I.The deal was coming together around the time that Mr. Cohen taped a conversation with Mr. Trump in which they appeared to come to a realization: As loyal as Mr. Pecker was, there was no guarantee he would always be in place to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets. As Mr. Trump said on the tape, which Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer released last month, \u201cMaybe he gets hit by a truck.\u201d At the last minute, according to prosecutors, A.M.I. backed out of the deal and instructed Mr. Cohen to destroy related paperwork. He did not. It is now in the possession of federal prosecutors.A.M.I. said at the time that neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Cohen \u201chas attempted to, or ever, influenced (or will ever influence) coverage at A.M.I.\u2019s publications. Period.\u201dDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s run through the Republican primaries, The National Enquirer routinely bashed his rivals and promoted his candidacy. Similarly, The Enquirer became a powerful political billboard for Mr. Trump during the general election campaign.\u201cYou could read horrible things about Hillary Clinton and wonderful things about Donald Trump, and people were exposed to this at many supermarkets,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center and professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication. \u201cYou might say nobody reads the tabloids, but actually most of us do \u2014 through inadvertent exposure.\u201dA.M.I. did not respond to requests for comment on the prosecutors\u2019 assertions about its role in the payments.Ms. Clifford met Mr. Trump in July 2006, at the American Century Championship golf tournament, where Mr. Trump also had an assignation with Ms. McDougal.She had starred in pornographic movies including \u201cSpace Nuts\u201d and \u201cLove Potion 69\u201d; Mr. Trump was on a top television show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d The idea that he would be president and she would pose a later legal threat would have seemed improbable as they spent one of their dates watching \u201cShark Week.\u201d (Ms. Clifford has said they had sex only once; Mr. Trump denies the affair.)But it was Ms. Clifford who helped blow open the case earlier this year, along with her aggressive, media-ready lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who could match Mr. Trump tweet for tweet, quip for quip \u2014 so much so that he says he is now considering a run for the presidency himself. Mr. Avenatti has been representing Ms. Clifford in a lawsuit to nullify her deal.In the fall of 2016, Ms. Clifford was discussing selling her story at an inopportune time for Mr. Trump, just after a recording leaked of raw \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d footage in which he boasted about groping women.Once again, the American Media trip wire alerted Mr. Cohen of trouble for Mr. Trump. Prosecutors reported Tuesday that an agent approached Mr. Howard, the A.M.I. editor, to tell him that Ms. Clifford was preparing to talk about her encounters with Mr. Trump. In fact, the prosecutors said, Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker connected Mr. Cohen with Mr. Davidson, the lawyer who represented Ms. Clifford then.Mr. Cohen initially struggled to come up with the $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford, which Mr. Trump did not readily provide. Ms. Clifford then considered selling her story elsewhere.Upon learning from Mr. Davidson about Ms. Clifford\u2019s plans, Mr. Howard texted Mr. Cohen, urging that they \u201ccoordinate something on the matter,\u201d or \u201cit could look awfully bad for everyone,\u201d the court papers said. Then, according to prosecutors, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard spoke with Mr. Cohen over an encrypted telephone line, persuading him to finalize the deal.The obscure shell company Mr. Cohen used to pay her, Essential Consultants L.L.C., has since been disclosed. But then it remained secret, even after a Wall Street Journal article about Ms. McDougal\u2019s deal with A.M.I., published days ahead of the campaign, noted that Ms. Clifford had spoken to the news media about selling her story but then disappeared.It wasn\u2019t until January 2017 that Mr. Cohen initiated the process of being repaid, presenting executives at the Trump Organization with records showing Essential Consultants\u2019 payment to Ms. Clifford.According to prosecutors, executives at the company signed off on paying Mr. Cohen $420,000, which included a $60,000 bonus, money to cover any taxes on the payment to Mr. Cohen and a reimbursement for undefined \u201ctech services.\u201d As prosecutors noted, Mr. Cohen would be paid in $35,000 installments. Mr. Cohen submitted invoices that falsely identified the payments as part of a \u201cretainer agreement.\u201dUpon receiving the first two invoices, a company executive whom prosecutors identified as \u201cExecutive-1\u201d forwarded the invoice to \u201canother executive of the company (\u2018Executive -2\u2019),\u201d and the fraudulent invoice was approved, according to the prosecutors. Several people familiar with the investigation said one of those executives was Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization chief financial officer. It is unclear who the other executive was.Even with the reimbursement, the campaign finance law views Mr. Cohen\u2019s initial payment as an illegal contribution, in excess of limits on donations of more than $2,700 in general elections.Yet Mr. Cohen appeared not to understand that when the issue of his payment to Ms. Clifford first came to the fore in January, after the news first surfaced in The Wall Street Journal that he had taken the lead in paying off Ms. Clifford. The following month he told The New York Times that he paid the money out of his own pocket.\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a statement then. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201dTestifying under oath on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen said he arranged the payment \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election,\u201d and told the judge he knew at the time that he was doing so in violation of campaign finance laws.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s what political courage and moral leadership look like, and why we can all learn something from McCain.Then a woman speaks up and says she can\u2019t trust Obama because he\u2019s an Arab.\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d McCain says. \u201cHe\u2019s a decent family man, citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d(When Cindy thanked him for sending flowers that had just arrived, with a card signed \u201cJohn,\u201d he impishly said it was nothing. Years later, she discovered that they had been from another man named John.)When he married Cindy, his children were angry (only at him; no one blamed Cindy) and none attended the wedding, but everyone forgave him soon enough. Not least because John McCain was always his own severest critic. He was contrite, and he blamed himself rather than others.That moral compass is what distinguished McCain, more than his war record, his wicked wit, his tireless travel schedule and his familiarity with far corners of the globe. (I happened to be in Moldova once when he visited. The difference was that he had been in Moldova so often, even though voters could never have found it on a map, that he seemed to know it like Phoenix.) Above all, what set McCain apart was that he was guided not by a weather vane but by deeply felt principles.Over many years I saw McCain repeatedly speak up on issues where there was zero political return. Whether it was human trafficking victims (also a great cause of Cindy McCain), Syrians being bombed, Rohingya facing genocide or terrorism suspects facing torture, McCain did not follow voters but tried to lead them; he tried to do the right thing.As much of the Republican Party in Congress was bullied into silent deference by Trump, even as members privately complained and rolled their eyes, McCain became particularly important for his periodic willingness to speak up. When Trump insulted Canada and antagonized Europe at the Group of 7 conference, McCain became the reassuring statesman who reminded the world that America is larger than its president. McCain tweeted: \u201cTo our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn\u2019t.\u201dWhen McCain was undergoing physical therapy after returning from Vietnam, another patient was a 12-year-old girl, Ann Jones, who was dying from a brain tumor. McCain went out of his way to comfort Ann, arriving early to chat with her and dropping by her home to cheer her up.After Ann died, her mother, Sylvia, lost touch with McCain, but years later she choked up as she told me how the war hero had taken the time to reach out to her daughter.\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, and I\u2019m not trying to promote John McCain politically,\u201d she told me. \u201cBut it tells you something about the character of this man. There was nothing in it for him to do this. It was only kindness.\u201dWashington is full of politicians who gauge which way the public is going and then try to rush out in front of it. McCain was different. Daring to be ornery to voters, he tackled impossible issues like Syria and campaign finance and immigration, and \u2014 somewhat inconsistently \u2014 worked ferociously hard to lead America. He was right some of the time, wrong some of the time, but he could be as heroically gutsy in American politics as in a North Vietnam prison, and that\u2019s why so many of us around the country today feel a great void in the political world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk and Tesla Resolved One Issue. Now for the Rest.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter deciding not to try to remove its shares from the market, the electric carmaker must focus on some stubborn challenges while facing new ones.So Tesla is no longer seeking to go private. Now what?On Monday, the electric carmaker began to take stock of the residual damage from its August whirlwind \u2014 including the prospect of harsher scrutiny of its bottom line and of its chief executive, Elon Musk. In the past, analysts, investors and even admirers of the company were sometimes willing to overlook quarterly losses and missed targets because of the persuasiveness of Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.\u201cNow that the going-private process is out the window, we can go back to valuing the company on fundamentals,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Company. Tesla\u2019s core auto business is \u201cextremely challenged,\u201d Mr. Osborne said, adding that he found it \u201chard to believe\u201d that Tesla would deliver on Mr. Musk\u2019s promise to generate a profit and positive cash flow in the current quarter.Other analysts voiced similar sentiments, noting damage to Mr. Musk\u2019s credibility and concerns over the distraction the going-private issue had caused.[Read more about how Mr. Musk came to the conclusion that going private was not the solution to his problems, from insiders\u2019 accounts.]Monday provided the first chance for investors to signal their reaction to the about-face, and they sent Tesla\u2019s stock lower than its Friday close, though not by much. It closed at $319.27, a decline of barely 1 percent. The shares had reached nearly $380 immediately after Mr. Musk\u2019s declaration on Aug. 7 before falling back, indicating doubt about his ability to carry off his plan. But they remain comfortably above the sub-$300 level where they were trading in July before Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement, and its declaration that it saw profitable quarters ahead.Of course, there are still the short-sellers \u2014 those betting against Tesla in the markets, whose sway was a major motivation for Mr. Musk to seek to flee the public markets. They have not been neutralized.And major questions remain, including how the company will manage its financial challenges as it scrambles to meet the production goals for the Model 3 sedan, the lower-priced offering it has called the key to its profitability, and the legal and regulatory issues that have kicked up by the going-private gambit. One of the most critical tasks is ramping up production of the Model 3. He has said the company needs to make 5,000 a week to become profitable, and it reported hitting that mark in the final week in June. Since then, however, analysts believe the Model 3 line has been operating at a slower pace on average.\u201cThe tent shows there\u2019s clearly an issue with throughput,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking cars in a tent obviously wasn\u2019t the way Tesla originally planned it.\u201dKarl Brauer, executive editor at Cox Automotive, a research firm, contrasted the length of time that had been needed for the Model 3 to reach full production capacity with the typical rollout of a new model by an established automaker. Tesla is still working out kinks more than a year after starting production.\u201cWith most automakers, it\u2019s normal that full capacity is not reached in the first month or even after three to six months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut certainly within a year, you\u2019re at high volume.\u201dAs more Model 3 cars have been delivered, questions about the quality of the cars\u2019 construction have cropped up. The investment bank UBS recently commissioned a team of engineers to deconstruct a Model 3 and reported uneven gaps between the car\u2019s steel panels, missing bolts and components held in place by plastic zip ties.Mr. Osborne said he had observed uneven panel gaps in new Model 3s himself. \u201cTesla\u2019s core competency is in design and battery technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are having trouble with manufacturability.\u201dOne photo circulating on Twitter showed a Model 3 with a brown interior panel on one door and a white one on another. A Tesla spokeswoman acknowledged the mistake and said the company had contacted the owner to resolve the matter. But she said the company had seen \u201chuge improvements in Model 3 quality\u201d and steady improvements in customer satisfaction since the start of the year, even as output increased.Tesla is a fast-growing company that needs huge amounts of cash to finance its production. If the company fails to sell enough Model 3 cars in the coming months, its cash might dwindle to a precarious level. But any problems with Model 3 production, or any shortfall in sales, could leave Tesla low on cash. The company may also need to find money in the next few months to repay holders of convertible bonds. If Tesla's stock is trading above a certain price, the company may be able to repay the holders in shares; otherwise, the holders may demand cash. Paying with cash instead of shares could require around $1 billion to repay bonds that fall due in November and March. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s interest in Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d declaration has not been put to rest with the decision to stay public. The uncertainty about regulatory penalties could seriously hinder raising capital and prompt Wall Street firms that arrange securities offerings to progress with caution. \u201cIt was clearly incomplete disclosure,\u201d Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said in an email. \u201cThe issue is going to be whether the S.E.C. decides it was fraudulent, whether it misled investors. The danger for Tesla is if the S.E.C. decides to go forward with a fraud case.\u201d Banks and other firms providing financing will want clarity about the potential course of the investigation, because underwriters and advisers would face legal penalties for any misleading or incomplete disclosures in the offering documents, Mr. Henning said. \u201cAs part of the due diligence, there will be a demand for lots of disclosure, which Tesla (and Musk) don\u2019t seem to like to do,\u201d he said. Tesla\u2019s directors may also have a more fundamental question to consider: whether Mr. Musk is the right person to lead the company. \u201cGiven the drama he\u2019s created, and the S.E.C.\u2019s investigation around that drama, the question is where the board goes next,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, a professor specializing in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThey have to decide what to do with him.\u201dDavid Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cohen Implicates President Trump. What Do Prosecutors Do Now?", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When a lawyer tells prosecutors that his client directed him to commit a crime and pleads guilty to related crimes himself, an indictment of the client is very likely to follow.The nation is about to find out whether there is an exception to that general rule when the client is the president of the United States.Although there is no explicit prohibition in the Constitution against indicting a president, the Justice Department has long taken the position that sitting presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.That would suggest that the extraordinary admissions and accusations from Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, will not result in criminal charges against Mr. Trump while he is in office. Mr. Cohen admitted to arranging payments to women to buy their silence about what they said were affairs with Mr. Trump, and he said Mr. Trump instructed him to pay the money to influence the election.If all of that is true, Mr. Trump committed serious crimes.\u201cThe plea, under oath, establishes that the president was a co-conspirator in the campaign violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty,\u201d said Philip Allen Lacovara, who served as counsel to special prosecutors investigating President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s role in the Watergate scandal.A flow chart that shows how Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer saw to it that a porn star and a former Playboy model received payments after alleging affairs with Mr. Trump.But under current Justice Department policy, Mr. Trump will not face prosecution at least until he leaves office.The third option is impeachment, and prosecutors may present the evidence they have gathered to the House for its consideration.Prosecutors in Manhattan, Mr. Lacovara said, \u201ccould seek permission from the deputy attorney general to do what we did in Watergate, which was to prepare a \u2018road map\u2019 of evidence bearing on the president\u2019s culpability and send it to the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment.\u201dBoth the Manhattan prosecutors handling the Cohen case and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties with Russia, are bound by Justice Department policies banning the prosecution of sitting presidents.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.This much seems clear: The president and other federal officials may be prosecuted after they leave office.However, \u201cwhether the Constitution allows indictment of a sitting president is debatable,\u201d Brett M. Kavanaugh, who served on the staff of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton and is now Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, wrote in a 1998 law review article. Mr. Kavanaugh, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, also concluded that impeachment, not prosecution, was the right way to address a sitting president\u2019s crimes.Professor Freedman wrote that granting sitting presidents immunity from prosecution was \u201cinconsistent with the history, structure and underlying philosophy of our government, at odds with precedent and unjustified by practical considerations.\u201dHe pointed out that other federal officials who are subject to impeachment, including judges, have been indicted while in office. Courts have rejected the argument that impeachment is the sole remedy for such officials.Since the president has the power to control federal prosecutions and to pardon federal offenses, Mr. Bork wrote, it would make no sense to allow the president to be prosecuted while he is in office: He should be prosecuted after he is removed from office and forfeits those powers. (Mr. Bork would go on to become a federal appeals court judge and an unsuccessful nominee to the Supreme Court.)A year later, Leon Jaworski, a Watergate special prosecutor, took a less categorical position.\u201cWe\u2019re talking potential years of jail time if he\u2019s not the sitting president but was instead a civilian candidate,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, the vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause, which filed campaign finance complaints based on the payments made to the women connected to Mr. Trump.Mr. Edwards\u2019s case \u2014 the first of its kind and therefore, the only actual template for the New York prosecutors \u2014 centered on some $1 million that two of his supporters provided to finance an elaborate scheme portraying Mr. Edwards\u2019s mistress, Rielle Hunter, as the lover of Mr. Edwards\u2019s aide Andrew Young.The Edwards prosecutors argued that the $1 million that Mr. Edwards\u2019s donors gave to the cover-up \u2014 which included a claim that Mr. Young was the father of the baby Ms. Hunter had with Mr. Edwards \u2014 was, in effect, a political donation.To bring criminal charges, prosecutors had to show that the money was spent primarily to protect Mr. Edwards\u2019s candidacy. In making his plea on Tuesday, Mr. Cohen said, outright, that his activity was to influence the election and that he did it at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction.Adam Liptak reported from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg from New York.Advertisement"}

Less than a minute after the opening whistle, he landed an echoing blow that floored his opponent. A thousand spectators roared. He had won.This is dambe, a generations-old West African style of boxing originally practiced by the Hausa people. It is making a comeback in Nigeria.Two groups are cultivating this fighting style, with the hope of taking it abroad. One is a grass-roots league of dambe clubs, called the Nigeria Traditional Boxing League Association. The other, Dambe Warriors, promotes the sport online and in live events.The groups are taking different approaches, but both face the difficulty of preserving dambe\u2019s traditions while appealing to a wide audience and reckoning with the sport\u2019s brutality.\u201cThis is a long journey,\u201d Faruk Bello, the league\u2019s president and one of its founders, said, \u201cbut we are so determined.\u201dIn dambe, a boxer wraps his stronger arm in cord for striking, the \u201cspear.\u201d He uses the other arm for defense, the \u201cshield.\u201d The goal is to knock over an opponent within three rounds.With roots in military practices, dambe grew into an event to celebrate harvests, naming ceremonies and funerals, said Aliyu Muhammad Bunza, a professor in the department of languages and culture at Federal University Gusau in Nigeria.

Split brows, broken noses, smashed teeth and knockouts are common. The destruction is written in scars on the faces of fighters who have spent years in the ring.\u201cIt\u2019s too brutal,\u201d Femi Babafemi, an amateur boxing coach, said. \u201cThose that are doing it are really endangering their lives.\u201dStill, dambe has become a full-time job for many fighters. Fans, ring owners and wealthy patrons support their favorite fighters. One established boxer, Auta Nafiu Abdullah, who has fought for seven years, said he earned, on average, about 100,000 Nigerian naira, or about $275, a month.The fights are frenetic and perilous.Boxers gather in fighting clans around a sand pit, taunting rivals and breaking suddenly into combat. Today, they head-butt and kick as well as punch. All the while, singers and drummers play mesmeric songs to embolden fighters.Bello, who started watching dambe 40 years ago, said he started the league in 2017 with fellow enthusiasts because he had grown fed up with what he saw as the declining quality of the sport.The league founded six clubs and designed a season of weekend tournaments in which teams pit their best boxers against one an other.Playing for a club appealed to Garkuwa Maichaga, who followed his brother into dambe at age 10. He joined the league after more than 20 years of navigating the dambe circuit alone, which he described as tiring and expensive.Along with a regular season, the league drafted a complete set of rules. It consulted with historians, fighters and fans to codify generations of tradition while introducing new regulations to rein in the sport\u2019s wilder tendencies.The league standardized uniforms, limited rounds to three minutes, created a system for scoring fights and even included a code of conduct for spectators that threatens rowdy fans with a red card and expulsion.\u201cWe want one day to have a conventional dambe whereby all countries of the world will be participating,\u201d Bello said.Four new clubs joined the original six in the second season. And the league reached out to groups in Niger to establish ties across the region.\u201cFrom Africa and on to the West,\u201d Bello said. He believes that with the right support, dambe will make the leap from regional martial art to Olympic sport. And he dreams of one day taking an exhibition fight to Las Vegas.But to create broad appeal, the league is gradually banning some customs that may prove difficult to export.For example, fighters wear amulets for protection and intimidation. They also rub a herbal mixture into rows of half-inch incisions cut up and down their arms, believing it to strengthen punches.For added safety, the league hired a doctor to monitor fights. It is reaching out to sportswear manufactures to create a glove that mimics the traditional hand wraps, only without the flesh-tearing cords. Weight categories will be added next season. So will health insurance and ambulance support, if the league can bring in more money.Without sponsorships, the league relies on selling tickets \u2014 usually less than 500 naira, or about $1.40, each \u2014 to fund the clubs. And its board members work day jobs to help finance operations.The pair behind Dambe Warriors, Chidi Anyina and Anthony Okeleke, share the same passion for growing the sport but see it as both an athletic pursuit and a spectacle. Drawing on their media and digital backgrounds, they promote dambe through YouTube and live events, while recasting it for a modern audience. The vision is to become \u201cthe U.F.C. of Africa,\u201d Okeleke said, referring to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.Today, the pair\u2019s YouTube channel\u2019s 21 videos have racked up 13 million views and more than 50,000 subscribers. The data revealed that more than 90 percent of the views came from overseas, mainly the United States, Brazil, Indonesia, India and the Philippines.To build a local audience, the pair hosted a fight in March on a beach in an upscale neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub. They wanted to catch the attention of the city\u2019s upwardly mobile and bring the sport into the south from its historic home in the north.This was also a chance to put their own spin on dambe, Anyina said, \u201cto elevate it.\u201dThey hosted a second fight in Lagos in June and are planning to tour the north. Once they \u201cown it\u201d in Nigeria, they will use data from YouTube to choose the best destination for their first overseas event.But as they look abroad, they are encountering a problem similar to the one facing Bello and the league. \u201cWe are having to battle between keeping that whole traditional essence of the game of dambe and selling it to a global audience,\u201d Anyina said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have easy answers.\u201dThey are determined to preserve the spectacle of dambe \u2014 the sand, the hand wraps and the way boxers spray mouthfuls of water on each other to cool off \u2014 but believe adding a clearer scoring system and fight schedule will help outsiders engage.\u201cWe\u2019ll try to just balance the new, modern structure to their unique style,\u201d Okeleke said.Jirgi Bahago, a boxer who has fought for 15 years, said that since the Lagos event, he had received more calls to compete than ever before. And Aminu Kaura Goje, owner of a dambe ring where Anyina and Okeleke have filmed fights, said the pair had introduced a new audience to the sport by putting it online.The sport is still teeming with potential, Anyina and Okeleke said, listing opportunities that they are pursuing, including broadcast deals, brand partnerships, merchandising and documentaries.\u201cIt\u2019s way bigger than us,\u201d Okeleke said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "LeBron or Not, the Cleveland Cavaliers Get Millions for Arena Renovation", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesNortheast Ohio offers a tale of two legacies.LeBron James departed for Los Angeles earlier this summer and left behind a spectacular gift for his hometown Akron, Ohio: a new elementary school for at-risk children and tens of millions of dollars for college scholarships.An hour\u2019s drive to the north, the Cavaliers lost that same superstar. But Dan Gilbert, the team\u2019s billionaire owner, and N.B.A. executives can take solace in having capitalized on James\u2019s success to pull off a perfectly legal shakedown of a not-so-economically-healthy city.With arm-twisting and attacks on ministers and community organizers and hints that they just might depart, the Cavaliers and their allies last year persuaded county and city governments to underwrite most of a $140 million upgrade of the team\u2019s Quicken Loans Arena.So it goes with that peculiarly American institution known as stadium socialism. As a postmodern Karl Marx might write: Team owners of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but the public\u2019s money.Aspects of the financing look a touch shaky. City and county leaders plan to use a portion of the tax on Cavaliers playoff tickets to help pay off the arena bonds. That looks like a dodgy bet right now as the Cavaliers, shorn of James, may not even make the playoffs.The Cavaliers advise no worries. They say they will front the money if the city and county have a shortfall \u2014 so long as the money is paid back to the team later. Further, they have argued that money poured into the arena has seeded the rebirth of the downtown, and that public funds are being used to upgrade and update public arenas.Cleveland is a pleasant lakeside city, and some of its neighborhoods and the downtown corridor have experienced a handsome revival. Its coffers are not overflowing, however, and a majority of citizens and neighborhoods barely scrape by. Cleveland\u2019s poverty rate stands at 36.2 percent. More than half of its children live in poverty. The infant mortality rate is three times higher than that of New York City.As for Cuyahoga County, 18.3 percent of its residents live in poverty, above the national rate. It is also $1 billion in debt. The county executive Armond Budish declared in 2016 that \u201cour credit card is maxed out.\u201d He ruled out more county spending projects.Not so long after that he endorsed the arena deal.Mayor Frank G. Jackson pushed the arena deal through the City Council and beamed afterward. This deal, he said, is \u201cone of the best I\u2019ve seen in my 27-year career in public office.\u201dBest sports deal is an intriguing term of art in Cleveland, which over the years has poured roughly $800 million of public money into its stadiums and arenas. Gilbert and his comrade sports billionaires \u2014 Jimmy Haslem, who bought the Browns and the existing deal for Browns Stadium in 2012 from the Lerner family, and Larry Dolan, owner of the Indians \u2014 control nearly all revenues reaped at these public buildings, and receive many tens of millions of dollars for naming rights.A few years ago, the owners joined to push a referendum to persuade voters to extend a countywide sin tax on cigarettes, beer and liquor. That effort cost the owners a small bag of dough, about $3 million.It was the wisest of investments.The referendum passed, and it will sluice $262 million into a fund to polish the stadiums. Will Tarter, a public-spirited budget analyst, recently examined this fund and found that Cleveland\u2019s teams were pulling down on that money with startling rapidity. The Cavaliers will soon burn through well over half their 20-year allotment.No worries. There\u2019s always more money where that came from.I should note that Gilbert takes pride in his good works: The Cavaliers run a literacy program, underwrite a modest scholarship program and give away a fair number of tickets to local children and sort of hold down ticket prices. To help sell the arena rehabilitation, the Cavaliers agreed to refurbish basketball courts in 22 community centers.That builds a future market, and that\u2019s grand. The bigger play, however, is drawing down the big public dollars.Cleveland voters are not passive observers having their pockets picked. City residents voted thumbs down on the sin tax, which passed on the back of votes from better-heeled precincts of Cuyahoga County.This brings us to the Quicken Loans upgrade saga. A peripatetic lawyer and activist, Peter Pattakos, fought against the tax. When he heard that the Cavaliers were circling back to the public dining table to fix the arena, he got busy.Greater Cleveland Congregations, an ecumenical group of churches and synagogues affiliated with the Industrial Areas Foundation, perhaps the nation\u2019s finest organizing group, took to the streets. If we\u2019re to underwrite this arena, the congregations said, Gilbert should agree to pour an equal sum into community services.City law allows for a referendum if 6,000 citizens sign petitions. The congregations and labor and community allies came in with 20,603 signatures. But when they walked the petitions into the council clerk, she refused to accept them.No, no, please, go away.Pattakos quickly filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court, arguing that the council had no choice but to accept legal petitions.Cleveland\u2019s powers-that-are waxed furious. To talk of a referendum, the Cavaliers\u2019 lawyers argued in a brief, is \u201cnonsensical. It is a done deal.\u201d Opponents were demonstrating their \u201clack of understanding of this complex web of agreements.\u201dA who\u2019s who of wealthy worthies supported the Cavaliers, their legal briefs brimming with harrumphs.The Ohio Supreme Court rejected these arguments and ordered the council clerk to accept the petitions on the novel legal principle that the law is the law. More fury followed. Gilbert announced that he would pull out of the deal. The N.B.A., which in city after city acts as a partner in these arena shakedowns, said it could not entertain Cleveland\u2019s bid to host the 2020 or 2021 All-Star games.Powerful people called board members of synagogues and churches in Greater Cleveland Congregations. Democratic Congresswoman Marcia Fudge accused the group of \u201cstrong arm tactics\u201d that have \u201cno good place in community organizing.\u201d The local paper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, did a hair-on-fire dance on behalf of Gilbert.Not long after, the congregations cut a sad little deal for a couple of mental health centers and withdrew their petitions. Cleveland was safe again for sports billionaires. \u201cIt underlines how much corporate money has changed the way laws and policy are made in this country,\u201d Pattakos says.There is only one near certainty: Long before the bonds are paid off, the Cavaliers will demand a new arena and the dance will start all over again.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

The Pain Is Far From Over.", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 When Dimitris Zafiriou landed a coveted full-time job two months ago, the salary was only half what he earned before Greece\u2019s debt crisis. Yet after years of struggling, it was a step up.\u201cNow, our family has zero money left over at the end of the month,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou, 47, a specialist in metal building infrastructure, said with a grim laugh. \u201cBut zero is better than what we had before, when we couldn\u2019t pay the bills at all.\u201d\u201cAny society that lost a quarter of its economy will have severe social problems,\u201d Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview. \u201cBut things are improving, and people can see that they are improving.\u201dA newly stable economy has prompted a return to hiring at the Greek construction company where Mr. Zafiriou recently landed work. But his monthly pay of \u20ac800 is far below the \u20ac1,500 he used to earn, at a construction firm where he was employed for 20 years. When the crisis hit, that firm delayed paying employees, first by two months, then four \u2014 a practice that became common at many businesses.His wife, Sotiria, went unpaid for almost a year in 2013, after the Greek supermarket chain where she worked declared bankruptcy. Another company bought it, and her monthly salary of \u20ac1,100 was cut to \u20ac800. She was eventually paid about half of what she was owed. But Mr. Zafiriou said he never received nearly \u20ac13,000 in back pay from his old firm.The family\u2019s bills quickly became insurmountable. They could no longer pay for electricity or a loan on their modest two-bedroom apartment in Keratsini, a working-class suburb of Piraeus, near Athens. The only thing shielding them from eviction \u2014 along with thousands of Greeks in similar straits \u2014 was a law forbidding banks from repossessing most borrowers\u2019 primary homes.The family slashed spending on clothing and groceries, and halted therapy for their daughter, Anamaria, 13, who has dyslexia. Low on cash, Mr. Zafiriou sold all of their gold jewelry, except for the cross used at Anamaria\u2019s christening.With his new job, things are looking up. The couple has rehired a tutor for Anamaria, and Mrs. Zafiriou no longer needs to shop for the very cheapest produce or meat. The primary aim is to pay down all the family\u2019s debts as quickly as possible, even if that leaves nothing at the end of the month.\u201cGreece is getting better,\u201d Mr. Zafiriou said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean things have turned around.\u201dThat outlook has lent a sense that the crisis may at last be fading.Other jobs are being created as manufacturers shift sales outside the Greek market, stoking a rise in exports, which now make up a third of economic activity, up from a quarter before the crisis.Mr. Vasiliou said he turned a profit last year for the first time since the crisis, and added 25 employees to his 143-person work force. All but 10 are on permanent contracts, averaging \u20ac1,100 a month \u2014 a decent salary in today\u2019s economy.Yet for the vast majority of workers, Greece\u2019s labor market remains a rough-and-tumble landscape.Today, a growing share of jobs are minimum wage. At least half involve temporary or part-time contracts. While that helps lower unemployment figures, many private-sector employees now earn less-than-poverty wages, according to the O.E.C.D., as do nearly half of Greek households with two children. Others work even more precariously with no contract at all, as employers seek to evade paying overtime and social security charges.It is a sign of the uneasy nature of Greece\u2019s recovery that, even with a coveted full-time contract, Mr. Zafiriou, the construction worker, remains wary. He has been working since June, but many companies have shed employees just before their one-year work anniversary, after which they would have become harder to fire.For those who fell further during the crisis, even getting to that point seems out of reach.Mrs. Pavlioti, a former supervisor at a Greek polling company, never dreamed she would need social assistance. Her daughter was born at the start of the crisis, but by the time her maternity leave ended, the company had downsized and she could not find other work. Her husband lost his job as a security guard. The financial loss strained their marriage, and she filed for divorce \u2014 something increasing numbers of Greeks are resorting to since the crisis began.Eventually, she found informal work cleaning houses and caring for the elderly, including changing their adult diapers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I had fallen so far,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said, fighting back tears. \u201cIt shook my self-image and confidence.\u201dPraksis offers job counseling, as well as psychological and financial support. It still is not enough. As a single mother, Mrs. Pavlioti needs state-financed child care, but does not qualify because her divorce is pending.The longer she stays out of the formal job market, the harder it is to get back in. Recently she took a job as a babysitter with flexible hours, earning \u20ac450 a month \u2014 enough to pay the rent and bills, though not much else.\u201cThe end of the bailout makes no difference in our lives,\u201d Mrs. Pavlioti said. \u201cWe are just surviving, not living.\u201dMaria Louka and Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Gerrymandered Congressional Map. Again.", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA panel of three federal judges again declared North Carolina\u2019s congressional district map to be unconstitutional, ruling on Monday that it was gerrymandered to unfairly favor Republican candidates.The decision, which may have significant implications for control of Congress after the midterm elections, is likely to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which for the moment is evenly split on ideological lines without a ninth justice to tip the balance.Though North Carolina\u2019s voters tend to divide about evenly between the two parties, Republicans currently hold 10 of the state\u2019s 13 House seats. A redrawn district map may put more of the seats within Democrats\u2019 reach.But the Supreme Court declined in June to hear an appeal in the case, sending it back for reconsideration under guidelines it had set out in a different case about who had legal standing to challenge the map.The judges left open the possibility that they could order new maps to be drawn before the 2018 election, either by the North Carolina General Assembly or by a special master appointed by the court.The ruling sets up a delicate tactical question for the Supreme Court, which has never ruled a partisan gerrymander to be unconstitutional, passing up three separate opportunities to do so in its last term. With the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy at the end of July, the court is now divided between four conservatives who have expressed skepticism about the court\u2019s ability to tinker with political maps, and four more liberal justices who have argued that it has that ability.A 4-to-4 vote would leave the lower court\u2019s ruling intact.The swing vote on the issue would probably be Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whom many voting-rights advocates see as the only prospect on the court \u2014 and a slim one, at that \u2014 for a fifth vote to outlaw partisan gerrymanders.Of the welter of cases on the issue that have moved through the federal courts in recent years, the North Carolina case is perhaps the starkest. The state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature redrew the House map in 2016 under orders from a different federal court, which had ruled that some districts drawn in 2011 were racially gerrymandered, a practice the Supreme Court has already ruled unconstitutional.The 2011 map had turned a 7-to-6 Democratic edge in the state\u2019s House delegation to a 9-to-4 Republican one. The redrawn map in 2016 \u2014 the one at issue now \u2014 produced a 10-to-3 ratio, but the legislature explicitly said that it had been drawn not to disadvantage minority groups, but to hurt Democrats.\u201cI propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats,\u201d David R. Lewis, a North Carolina state representative who helped lead the remapping, said in 2016.The three-judge panel ruled in January, though, that the change in motive did not make the map acceptable. It found that the legislature\u2019s intent was \u201cto \u2018subordinate\u2019 the interests of non-Republican voters and \u2018entrench\u2019 Republican domination of the state\u2019s congressional delegation,\u201d a view they reaffirmed on Monday.The chief author of the panel\u2019s latest opinion, Judge James J. Wynn of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, said the legislature\u2019s \u201cinvidious partisanship runs contrary to the Constitution\u2019s vesting of the power to elect representatives in \u2018the people.\u2019\u201dThe three judges left open, for the moment, what would happen next. They gave the parties in the case until the end of this month to file briefs on whether the court should allow the existing map to be used one more time, in the midterm election, or should order that it be redrawn by mid-September.With the election less than three months distant, Judge Wynn noted, a court normally would allow one more use of the old map, so as not to disrupt election preparations, especially since North Carolina has already held primaries for the races.But the state\u2019s election plans are already frozen by another bitter court battle, this one over Republican lawmakers\u2019 efforts to place six state constitutional amendments on the November ballot. Among other things, those measures would strip the state\u2019s Democratic governor of some powers to appoint judges and would allow the legislature to devise a new voter ID law to replace one struck down in the courts, which ruled it an effort to depress minority voting.It was conceivable, Judge Wynn wrote, that the state could hold a fresh primary election for House seats in November using a new map, and then conduct a special election to choose the delegation before the next Congress convenes in January 2019. He also raised the possibility of forgoing primaries, as the state does with some other offices.The ruling promised to further roil the political scene in a state with one of the deepest partisan divides in the nation, and where both liberals and conservatives receive support from well-financed national groups.Redistricting has been contentious in North Carolina for decades. In the years before 2010 when Democrats controlled the General Assembly, the Democratic-drawn boundaries were regularly challenged by Republicans, by critics of gerrymandering and by the Justice Department, which deemed some of their plans to be in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act.Since the Republicans took control in 2010, their legislative boundary maps have prompted numerous court challenges from Democrats and advocacy groups.Registered Democrats actually outnumber Republicans in the state by a significant margin, though many of those Democrats are conservatives who have tended to vote Republican in recent years. President Trump carried the state by about 3.7 percentage points in 2016.With this week\u2019s ruling, North Carolina now faces the possibility that its House delegation will be more evenly split, but it also faces the possibility of electoral chaos, according to Gerry Cohen, who worked for more than three decades as the director of bill drafting for the General Assembly.If changes are made this year, Mr. Cohen said, significant bureaucratic miracles will have to be performed to meet a deadline of Sept. 22 for mailing absentee ballots to voters in the military and overseas.Imagine it, Mr. Cohen said: New districts will have to be drawn. The courts \u2014 and perhaps the Supreme Court \u2014 will need time to rule on them. A filing period for candidates will have to open and close. The state will have to update its rolls to assign millions of voters to their new districts. And ballots will have to be printed. All before Sept. 22.\u201cI\u2019m very sympathetic to the plaintiffs here, but it would be insane,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, to try to meet that timetable.He said that while the ruling could eventually help Democrats, it also introduces new political questions. If the next delegation is chosen in a special election in early 2019, as the court suggested may be an option, Democrats may struggle to turn out voters, as they historically have in special elections. Alternatively, if the seats are filled in open races without a primary, numerous candidates could be on the ballot from the same party, splitting the vote.Though the state\u2019s existing map was drawn aggressively to protect Republican incumbents, rising liberal opposition to President Trump and the emergence of several strong Democratic candidates already have some House Republicans on the defensive.Representatives Ted Budd and George Holding, for example, were facing closely contested races, and Democrats were even better positioned to capture a Charlotte-to-Fayetteville seat after the Republican incumbent, Robert Pittenger, lost his primary earlier this year to a lightly funded opponent.Under a new, less Republican-friendly map, more seats could become competitive, especially in Charlotte and the Research Triangle, the state\u2019s main population centers, where the current boundaries tend to minimize the voting impact of African-Americans and white liberals.An earlier version of this article misstated the usual number of Supreme Court justices whose assent is required for the court to hear a case. It is four, not five.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Are Changing Trade With China. Here Are 2 Emerging Endgames.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The United States and China have sparred repeatedly over trade, in a tit-for-tat skirmish that has shown little sign of abating. High-level talks have stalled, while both sides have been threatening further tariffs in recent days.But beneath the acrimony, two potential paths for China seem to be emerging, according to participants in the trade negotiations and their advisers. Both would deliver trade wins for President Trump and his more moderate advisers, while also letting President Xi Jinping of China push ahead with his ambitious industrial plan to build national champions in cutting-edge technologies.A stalemate appears the most likely endgame, with new American and Chinese tariffs staying in place for months or even years. So far, the United States has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese technology goods and $3 billion of Chinese steel and aluminum, with another $16 billion in the offing. China has responded in kind, outlining its own plan on Wednesday for measures on $16 billion of American goods.China\u2019s stance now is that a resolution of trade tensions must not block its further economic progress, but adjustments to Made in China 2025 could happen. The latest trade figures, which came out Wednesday, show that Chinese exports continue to surge, giving Beijing some confidence. \u201cThe red line is China\u2019s right to develop, not the concrete industrial policies and measures regarding Made in China 2025,\u201d said He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official who remains one of China\u2019s top trade experts.To Mr. Trump and his aides, China is trade enemy No. 1. In making their case, they point to large, persistent trade deficits, as well as state-owned banks funding potential rivals to American giants in high tech and advanced manufacturing. They also worry that China is engaged in a rapid military buildup that would give Beijing ever more heft in Asia and around the world.The tariffs address part of the president\u2019s concerns, mainly by reducing American companies\u2019 dependency on Chinese suppliers.Hundreds of Western companies already have been reconsidering China\u2019s role in their supply chains, according to several people involved in such decisions. Executives are increasingly looking for ways to transfer the final assembly of goods to factories outside China, mainly in low-wage countries elsewhere in Asia or in Mexico.Doing the final assembly outside of China will allow companies to bypass the new American tariffs. It could also start to cut the deficit with China over the next couple years.But these moves may not do much to the overall trade deficit of the United States, rearranging it instead to other countries. Companies are just relocating the last steps in production plans to places like Indonesia and Taiwan rather than bringing them back to the United States, where blue-collar labor is costly. Beijing will also retain a lot of leverage, given that the manufacturing of a long list of components, from wires and screws to electric motors and digital controls, will most likely remain in China.Star Rapid, a company in Zhongshan, China, makes prototypes of products for more than 400 American companies in sectors like electronics, auto parts and medical devices. It has noticed that while many companies are looking at ways to change locations for final assembly, not one seems to be moving the production of entire supply chains. The components typically account for much if not most of the value in products.\u201cThey\u2019re not looking at taking it out of China,\u201d said David Hunter, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at where can they do the final transformation.\u201dDuring second-quarter conference calls by 192 American and European companies that mentioned tariffs, 17 percent of them said that they had already begun switching suppliers, according to an analysis by Panjiva, a trade data consulting firm. About 14 percent had begun moving some of their own operations.The Trump administration can afford to stand firm. The American economy has been strong. And the tariffs that American companies face are more than offset by new tax cuts.Washington may find it has other headaches if tariffs persist. Some China experts worry that the administration\u2019s trade stance could antagonize Chinese policymakers, pushing them toward a more confrontational approach on other issues.They point out that President Xi has assigned the task of defusing a trade war to a team of fairly moderate, Western-educated officials. Failure to reach a deal could weaken these moderates and further embolden hard-liners who advocate continuing China\u2019s broad military buildup and its deployment of ever-harsher domestic security.\u201cWe really need to find a way to embrace China, and encourage the moderate voices here,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a Beijing lawyer and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.While China is not willing to go nearly that far, it could offer some concessions that might provide an ostensible victory.China has expressed a willingness to change parts of its industrial policy that violate global trade rules. But China\u2019s program falls into some gray areas.While the World Trade Organization has many rules to prevent governments from subsidizing companies directly, the rules are more vague on whether a state-run banking system can provide preferential loans. Such loans have been the core of Chinese industrial policy for many years, and continue to be under Made in China 2025.China has also begun exploring ways for Made in China 2025 to finance more research and development, instead of paying for the immediate construction of a lot of factories. World Trade Organization rules allow research subsidies.The dilemma is whether any of these tweaks to Made in China 2025 would make much of a difference and appease the Trump administration.China may also be signaling a willingness to compromise on tariffs. For much of the trade war, Beijing has matched Washington dollar for dollar on retaliatory measures. The United States and China will each have tariffs in place soon on roughly $50 billion of goods. For the United States, it amounts to a little less than one-tenth of imports from China. For China, it is about one-third of imports from the United States.Last week, China shifted tack. Faced with American threats of tariffs on two-fifths of China\u2019s exports to the United States, or $200 billion a year, Beijing responded with a threat of tariffs on two-fifths of American exports to China, or $60 billion a year. The change raised the question of whether China might be willing to accept a compromise on tariffs linked to the share of total trade that is taxed in each direction.China has not yet made any such offer, and on Wednesday the country\u2019s commerce ministry announced that it would keep pace with the Trump administration\u2019s next round of tariffs \u2014 on $16 billion of imports a year that are to take effect on Aug. 23.Beijing\u2019s more cautious approach to the greater threat, of tariffs on another $200 billion in annual imports, was also just practical: China does not even import that amount of goods from the United States annually.\u201cIt\u2019s just not a game changer,\u201d Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm, said of the trade dispute. \u201cThe trade war, as currently constituted, can go on for some time, and both economies can muddle through it without even strong effects.\u201dAna Swanson contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

In Australia, an indoor ski slope is going up near the beaches of the Gold Coast. In the Czech Republic, a spa with Chinese medicine is under construction in the southern wine country.All three projects fall under Beijing\u2019s ambitious effort to build geopolitical and economic ties around the world \u2014 and all three stray from its original mission.But five years in, smaller, less impactful projects are finding cover under the umbrella of Belt and Road, using the program to slip past restrictions on foreign investment. Beijing has discouraged, and in some cases blocked, deals in the real estate and entertainment industries, part of a broader crackdown on profligate spending by Chinese companies overseas.That hasn\u2019t discouraged some companies.\u201cThere are wacky deals that occur under the banner of Belt and Road because this is how every entrepreneur signals that they are in line with the leadership\u2019s political objectives,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an independent economic research firm.\u201cIt certainly is a very capacious arena for opportunists, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mr. Kroeber added.In addition to straying into entertainment venues, the Belt and Road mission is sprawling geographically. Initially focused on countries along the ancient trade route that once carried travelers including Marco Polo east, the program\u2019s official scope has been extended to Africa and South America.Australia, however, has yet to be included. That is not stopping Songcheng Performance Development, the company building the indoor ski slope, part of a huge amusement park and entertainment complex on about 100 acres of land along the eastern Gold Coast.\u201cWe will offer local cultural park performances such as the story of how Captain Cook discovered Australia,\u201d Zhang Xian, the chief executive of Songcheng, recently told investors.China\u2019s Ministry of Culture, though, has named Australia Legend Kingdom a top priority.The company had long harbored ambitions to expand into Australia, according to Roland Evans, Songcheng\u2019s representative there. It spotted an opportunity when President Xi announced the Belt and Road plan in 2013.Songcheng\u2019s plans for the park have not been finalized, but an early proposal includes condominiums for as many as 2,000 residents, and theaters to accommodate musicals and shows about Chinese and Australian history. The company wants the indoor ski hill to be the world\u2019s biggest.Supporters of the myriad cultural projects that fall under the Belt and Road umbrella \u2014 and there are many such proponents in China \u2014 argue that amusement parks and theaters can underpin China\u2019s diplomatic push much as ports and infrastructure do.\u201cOne of the goals is cultural exchange along the Belt and Road to improve our soft power,\u201d said Chen Shaofeng, vice dean of the Institute for Cultural Industries at Peking University. \u201cIt also provides a strategic support for economic cooperation.\u201dThose are lofty goals for what critics say is basically big-ticket spending overseas.Some companies involved in the initiative have said that they receive preferential financing from state-backed banks. Others say they are getting government support to help train employees and promote the new business ventures overseas.Betop Entertainment, which is building the sense-of-flight theater in Thailand, has been successful in getting political buy-in for its project.Its new theater will be in the beach resort town of Pattaya and will feature scenes of Thailand. It will be the company\u2019s first venture outside China, where it owns so-called flying theaters \u2014 viewers are strapped into hydraulic chairs that shake and rattle as images fly overhead \u2014 in 27 cities, said Li Dan, a company official.\u201cIt fits the policy\u201d of the Belt and Road initiative, Ms. Li noted. \u201cIt is best to go in the same direction as government policies.\u201dThere are pitfalls to using the Belt and Road name, though. Some Chinese companies have begun to face hurdles with their projects overseas.RiseSun Real Estate Development has been trying to build a sprawling spa and Chinese-medicine complex in Pasohlavky, a small town in the South Moravia region of the Czech Republic. A government mock-up of the plans, first announced during a state visit to China by the Czech president, Milos Zeman, in 2015, shows more than two dozen buildings along the banks of the Nove Mlyny reservoirs.But the project has come under local scrutiny.The publicly listed Chinese company has said that while construction for the spa had not yet started, it was \u201cdefinitely in the process of being approved.\u201d Officials in Pasohlavky offer a different account, saying that RiseSun is only one of multiple groups of investors interested in buying the land.The local authorities say they have yet to make a final decision. Some residents have expressed unease about a Chinese investor, said Martina Dominova, the town\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe town hall even received hateful messages,\u201d Ms. Dominova said. \u201cThey have accused us of selling off the republic to the Chinese.\u201dHana de Goeij contributed reporting from Prague.Advertisement"}

She added that Mr. Seabrook had decided to sell his power \u201conce he saw an opportunity to get paid.\u201dMr. Seabrook, who had led the Correction Officers\u2019 Benevolent Association for more than 20 years, is being tried on charges of honest services wire fraud and conspiracy.In Mr. Seabrook\u2019s first trial, Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s testimony seemed to dominate the case, as he spent six days on the witness stand, describing how he had ingratiated himself with influential New York political figures, like Mayor Bill de Blasio, as well as police officials and Mr. Seabrook.Mr. Rechnitz testified last year that he and a friend, Jeremy Reichberg, helped to raise thousands of dollars for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s first mayoral campaign and that Mr. de Blasio, as a candidate, had visited his office and given him his personal email address and cellphone number.Mr. de Blasio \u201ctold me to call if there\u2019s anything I need, always be in touch,\u201d Mr. Rechnitz testified, adding, \u201cHe really appreciated my support and friendship.\u201dIn the weeks after Mr. de Blasio became mayor-elect, Mr. Rechnitz said he called him weekly. \u201cHe took my calls,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, we were friends.\u201dMr. Rechnitz eventually became entangled in federal and state investigations into Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign financing \u2014 both inquiries were closed without charges being brought \u2014 as well as the prosecution of members of the Police Department accused of taking bribes.After the campaign financing probes were closed, Mr. de Blasio said that he, his staff and his colleagues had \u201cacted in a manner that was legal and appropriate and ethical throughout.\u201dMr. de Blasio has also said that he did not know Mr. Rechnitz and Mr. Reichberg well, describing them as \u201cpart of a slew of people who suddenly wanted to be connected to our world when I won the election.\u201dMs. Pomerantz, the prosecutor, acknowledged in her opening statement that Mr. Rechnitz was \u201ca criminal\u201d who had paid for favors from law enforcement and lied repeatedly to friends, family and business associates. \u201cWe are not asking you to like Jona Rechnitz,\u201d she said.It was Mr. Rechnitz who testified at the first trial that he had bought the Ferragamo bag, placed the $60,000 inside and delivered it to Mr. Seabrook.On Thursday, Ms. Lynaugh, the defense lawyer, told the jury that the only evidence to support the bribery allegation was Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s word. \u201cAt bottom,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is a one-witness case.\u201d She called Mr. Rechnitz a man who would lie about anything \u201cto save his own skin.\u201dProsecutors have said that in late 2013, Mr. Seabrook told Mr. Rechnitz while the two were traveling together in the Dominican Republic that he had worked hard to invest the union\u2019s money and it was time \u201cNorman Seabrook got paid.\u201dWith Mr. Rechnitz helping to orchestrate the scheme, the government said, Mr. Seabrook agreed to direct the union money to the hedge fund, Platinum Partners, in exchange for kickbacks of $100,000 to $150,000 per year.A co-defendant of Mr. Seabrook\u2019s in the first trial, Murray Huberfeld, Platinum\u2019s founder, pleaded guilty in May to one count of wire fraud conspiracy.One piece of evidence that Ms. Pomerantz told the jury about on Thursday that had not been presented at the first trial was that Platinum Partners had gone bankrupt and the union had lost all but $1 million of its $20 million investment.After the opening statements were completed and the jury had been excused, another prosecutor, Martin S. Bell, rose and complained that Mr. Seabrook had uttered an expletive during the prosecution\u2019s opening. \u201cI could hear it,\u201d Mr. Bell said.Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said he had not heard the remark, but warned Mr. Seabrook to remain impassive throughout the trial, regardless of how he felt. Mr. Seabrook said he understood.As the trial adjourned for a lunch break, Mr. Seabrook denied to a reporter that he had made the remark. Later, after the trial\u2019s first day had ended, Mr. Seabrook was asked in the hallway how he felt.

That puts the Big Apple in a unique position to address a diversity problem that plagues the tech industry on the opposite coast.\n \nFrom fashion to finance, New York tech is a melting pot of startups, established companies and industries. And the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program channels the variety of backgrounds, perspectives and professions to foster multidisciplinary thinkers who can diversify an overwhelmingly white and male tech industry in the United States.A focus on diversity attracts tech talent to the city, according to a 2018 survey by the nonprofit Tech: NYC, with 89 percent of respondents citing the diverse population as a draw and 74 percent citing the variety of industries to choose from as a lure.\n \n\u201cDiversity is very important for innovation, as people with different perspectives, training, backgrounds and cultures come together to look at the same problem differently,\u201d said Erik Grimmelmann, president of the nonprofit NY Tech Alliance.In New York\u2019s tech sector, gender, ethnic and racial diversity start in the classroom. The Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management and Cornell Tech started the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program in 2014, taking up temporary residence in Google office space in New York and officially relocating to Cornell Tech\u2019s 12-acre campus on Manhattan\u2019s Roosevelt Island in fall 2017. The program has since attracted women, minorities and international students with resumes and interests from an array of backgrounds.\u201cThe amazing thing about building an [academic program] from scratch is that you can be really deliberate about important things like diversity,\u201d said Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, which supports the city\u2019s tech sector.The Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was built around the concept that the best leaders and innovators have a variety of skill sets, and that they seek out unique perspectives in others. That\u2019s evident in the way student teams in the program\u2019s Studio curriculum mimic the most successful tech companies, said Mukti Khaire, the Girish and Jaidev Reddy Professor of Practice at Cornell Tech and the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.Some projects might see a computer scientist paired with, say, a market expert and a designer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than to show students that diversity is important in these teams for really creative problem solving,\u201d Khaire said.John Quinn, who graduated in spring 2018, said he had to up his game academically and creatively because of the mix of races, ages and backgrounds. Quinn\u2019s career was on track, with him working in digital payments at MasterCard in Dublin, his hometown. But he realized tech expertise alone wasn\u2019t enough to continue advancing at the company. Now, with a Johnson Cornell Tech MBA, he\u2019s starting a new role at MasterCard\u2019s NYC Technology Hub.For Quinn, diversity and inclusion workshops on campus were also eye openers.\u201cIt was amazing how honest people could be,\u201d he said, referring to sessions in which women and minorities spoke about the challenges they face in tech. \u201cIt will make me a better co-worker and a better manager to be aware of these things.\u201dNew York\u2019s large and diverse network of students, workers and entrepreneurs attracts tech professionals who might otherwise have headed to Silicon Valley. On the West Coast, \u201cYou get a lot of homogeneity in thought and how people approach problems,\u201d said David Cheng, a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad.That\u2019s a big reason Cheng, a former software engineer and consultant in Washington, chose New York to start a mobile speech therapy app he developed with classmates. Just last year, Speech Up won Cornell Tech\u2019s Startup Award, which included workspace at its Tata Innovation Center, where students and companies work to bring new ideas to market.Cheng, who attended speech therapy sessions as a child, said he was drawn to New York because so many of its industries are reinventing themselves through tech. \u201cBeing part of the community that is doing that is something that really appealed to me,\u201d he said.Kendall Jakes, also a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad, said the program\u2019s multicultural and multidisciplinary approach attracted her as well. She worked for a Chicago food company in a role that combined technology and business. But as she looked into M.B.A. programs to help with her next career, she found most wanted to put her in either a tech or a business \u201cbucket.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t how the world works. Why should we be siloed?\u201d said Jakes, now a technical solutions specialist at Microsoft\u2019s New York office, adding that the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was a place where she was totally accepted.Jakes also said she loved that her class was 40 percent female, a contrast to the broader U.S. tech workforce, which is 76 percent male. \u201cWe were a force to be reckoned with,\u201d she said.New York\u2019s thriving tech industry is no Silicon Valley, and that\u2019s just fine, said Grimmelmann, the NY Tech Alliance president.\u201cOut West, it\u2019s all tech, all the time,\u201d he said. Conversely, New York mixes tech with other disciplines and radically changes them. FinTech, EdTech and HealthTech, for example, are flourishing in the city.Diversity in industries, cultures and backgrounds creates the best innovators and leaders, said Samuels, Tech:NYC's executive director. \u201cThe most successful employees,\u201d she said, \u201care the ones who are really good at problem solving and can navigate a fast-growing company \u2014 versus stay in your lane and do your own job.\u201dJakes agrees. In New York \u2014 and in the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program \u2014 she doesn\u2019t feel pigeonholed, she said, but rather celebrated for being a \u201ccreative techie.\u201d\u201cI love the energy here,\u201d Jakes said. \u201cThat\u2019s something really different about New York.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "What\u2019s Next for Manafort and Cohen?", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, two major developments unfolded involving people close to President Trump.So what happens now? We\u2019ll help you sort out what the big day in court means for Mr. Cohen, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Trump.Mr. Manafort\u2019s trial in Virginia was the first of two criminal cases against him. On Tuesday, a jury convicted him of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. The judge declared a mistrial on the remaining 10 counts.A mistrial makes no judgment on Mr. Manafort\u2019s guilt. In this case, it simply means that jurors could not agree on a verdict on those charges.Prosecutors have the option to bring the remaining charges against him again, until a verdict is reached.Regardless, he will face sentencing on the charges he was convicted of Tuesday.A sentencing date has not yet been set. The most serious charge of which he was convicted carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.It\u2019s possible Mr. Manafort could try to lessen his sentence by cooperating with the special counsel.Mr. Manafort also faces a second criminal trial next month in Washington on other charges brought by the special counsel, including obstruction of justice, failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money. If convicted, he could face additional punishment.Yes. Legally, the president has the power to pardon federal crimes.But some legal experts say that such pardons, coupled with other actions, could increase Mr. Trump\u2019s risk of prosecution for obstruction of justice. Abuse of the pardon power could also be grounds for impeachment. More on that later.For months, federal prosecutors in Manhattan had been examining Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal business dealings and his role in helping to arrange financial deals with women connected to Mr. Trump.On Tuesday, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, as well as multiple counts of tax evasion and bank fraud.Mr. Cohen made the extraordinary admission that he had arranged payments to the two women: Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels; and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model.In both cases, Mr. Cohen said that he made payments at the behest of the president to shield him from politically damaging disclosures.Mr. Cohen will be sentenced on Dec. 12 before Judge William H. Pauley III. Though he faces a total of up to 65 years on all eight counts, the plea agreement provides for a far more lenient sentence.Since Mr. Cohen, like Mr. Manafort, was convicted of federal crimes, he also could be pardoned by Mr. Trump.Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction was a win for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, if only in denying the president more ammunition for his campaign to discredit Mr. Mueller.And even the president\u2019s staunchest defenders acknowledged privately that the legal setbacks he suffered on Tuesday could open fissures among Republicans on Capitol Hill and expose Mr. Trump to the possibility of impeachment.In addition, both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen could now have incentive to cooperate with prosecutors, said John P. Carlin, a former federal prosecutor who also served as chief of staff for Mr. Mueller when he was director of the F.B.I.\u201cDefendants have cooperated after conviction hoping to get a lesser sentence,\u201d he said.One collateral effect of Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement is that it may allow Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, to proceed with a deposition of Mr. Trump in a lawsuit that Ms. Clifford filed accusing the president of breaking a nondisclosure agreement concerning their affair.The lawsuit had been stayed by a judge pending the resolution of Mr. Cohen\u2019s criminal case. Mr. Avenatti wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that he would now seek to force Mr. Trump to testify \u201cunder oath about what he knew, when he knew it and what he did about it.\u201dIf Mr. Mueller believes he has enough evidence to charge Mr. Trump with a crime in federal court, the special counsel could ask a grand jury to indict him. But he would have to get permission from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation.If Mr. Mueller finds wrongdoing, he has a variety of options short of indictment, including writing a lengthy report. Congress could then use the findings and begin impeachment proceedings if it sees fit.Separately, Mr. Trump could be indicted after he leaves office.The Constitution says that a president can be removed for \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which members of Congress can essentially define themselves.The process would begin with House Judiciary Committee hearings, followed by a panel vote to move articles of impeachment to the House floor. How this would be handled would almost certainly depend on whether Democrats or Republicans control Congress in January, after November\u2019s midterm elections.Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wisconsin Faces a Political Crossroads Tuesday. Which Way Will It Go?", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMAZOMANIE, Wis. \u2014 The most memorable part of Scott Walker\u2019s run for president in 2016 was how he ended it: By dissing Donald J. Trump, his chief rival in a crowded race.Mr. Walker, Wisconsin\u2019s two-term governor, said he was bowing out to help \u201cclear the field\u201d so a \u201cpositive, conservative alternative\u201d could emerge to Mr. Trump. The remark was self-serving \u2014 the Walker campaign was broke \u2014 but he had a point: Republicans never coalesced around an opponent to Mr. Trump, who went on to become the first Republican presidential nominee to carry Wisconsin since 1984.Mr. Walker is still Wisconsin\u2019s governor, still harboring national ambitions, and Wisconsin Democrats and Republicans have only grown more divided over Mr. Trump and the state\u2019s place in national politics. Those dynamics are now on display as Wisconsin prepares for a major primary election on Tuesday: Mr. Walker\u2019s bid for a third term is at stake; Wisconsin Democrats\u2019 desire to deal blows to Trump Republicanism is intense; Republicans are deeply concerned about their future hold on state government; and the very identity of the state, which swings between progressivism and conservatism, feels up for grabs.\u201cThis just wasn\u2019t what Wisconsin was, not what it used to be,\u201d said Sally Mather, 69, a retired social worker, who sat in the back room of a cafe in Mazomanie, a village of 1,700, last week.\u201cWe keep ourselves sane with this,\u201d Ms. Mather said of all the postcards. \u201cBut if Wisconsin is going to go back to the way it used to be, it\u2019s going to be up to the grass-roots. We\u2019ve got to get back to being decent.\u201dWisconsin\u2019s urgent struggle to define \u2014 or redefine \u2014 its political direction is part of a larger identity crisis that has rippled across the Upper Midwest since 2016. Like Wisconsin, union-rich Michigan had been seen as a given for Democrats in presidential years, but narrowly sided with Mr. Trump, revealing the possibility of a shifting set of concerns and priorities and a changed political landscape. Minnesota, which is also holding primary elections on Tuesday, stayed in the Democratic column in 2016, but Mr. Trump lost by a far slimmer margin than expected, setting off a flurry of re-examination there.Much is at stake for Democrats in November. Losing Ms. Baldwin\u2019s seat would mark an end of any real sense that Wisconsin remains purple, and that possibility has stirred more urgency for both parties. On the flip side, the prospect of regaining some measure of influence \u2014 if not the governor\u2019s job, then control of the State Senate \u2014 would give Democrats a stake in state policy that they have been all but excluded from since Mr. Walker arrived.For people like Mary Sole, 69, of Spring Green, the entire agenda was dismal, distressing.\u201cWisconsin had defined itself as progressive on issues like paying for schools and good health care,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s who we were, and that\u2019s all been erased.\u201dBut Ben Huth, a Republican who runs a sewer cleaning business and lives in Merton, west of Milwaukee, said his circumstances have improved over the last decade \u2014 simple as that.Unemployment in Wisconsin has fallen below 3 percent. Mr. Walker has boasted of the expansion of high tech manufacturing and job training and apprenticeship programs. The governor has also pushed efforts to keep young, graduating Wisconsin residents from leaving for places like Chicago, and to lure millennial Midwesterners to Wisconsin.Ground has been broken on the Foxconn project, which is described as the largest economic development project in the state\u2019s history. Plans call for eventually employing as many as 13,000 workers.\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to argue with things going well,\u201d Mr. Huth, 50, said.\u201cMy company has grown,\u201d he continued. \u201cMore employees. More sales. I\u2019m not worried about a blue wave. As far as I\u2019m concerned, people are going to ride this red wave. Why wouldn\u2019t they?\u201dStill, in Tuesday\u2019s primary, Democrats face a dizzyingly long list of candidates to be the nominee to take on Mr. Walker. Residents here complain that the list is both too long and too uninspiring, and a question lingers: Can any of these people actually beat Mr. Walker?\u201cIt\u2019s like a game of eeny, meeny, miney, moe,\u201d said Katy Connors, who is 67 and a retired school guidance counselor. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dBeneath a picnic shelter in a Kenosha park last weekend, Mr. Evers stepped to the front of a small gathering of local Democrats who had been raffling off baskets of wine, homemade potholders and jam.A large sign on the picnic tent offered an image of a donkey cruising along on a surfboard beside a rush of ocean water. \u201cRIDE THE BLUE WAVE,\u201d it read. Yet not everyone here seemed certain that Mr. Walker could be beaten, even now.After all, in only two terms in office, Mr. Walker has survived three elections. In 2012, with emotions as high as ever and Democrats marching in the Capitol over labor union limits, Mr. Walker won a recall election. Later that fall, Mr. Obama won the state.\u201cWisconsin has changed a lot,\u201d said Bobbie James-Wirth, 57, a Democrat who lives in Milwaukee. \u201cPeople are hurting out here and they feel like they\u2019ve been forgotten. So this could be the year Walker gets beat \u2014 but I just don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Walker has no significant opposition from within his own party on Tuesday. Still, last week, he was out campaigning, pointedly critiquing his Democratic challengers during a news conference for their views on lowering the prison population, then heading off on a campaign bus tour through the state \u2014 20 cities in five days.\u201cWe expect,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is going to be a close race.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mulvaney Looks to Weaken Oversight of Military Lending", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is planning to suspend routine examinations of lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act, which was devised to protect military service members and their families from financial fraud, predatory loans and credit card gouging, according to internal agency documents.The proposal surprised advocates for military families, who have urged the government to use its powers to crack down harder on unscrupulous lenders. The consumer bureau conducted dozens of investigations into payday and other lenders during the Obama administration without any significant legal opposition, and no lenders are currently challenging its oversight based on the law, according to administration officials.The bureau will still bring individual cases against lenders who are found to charge in excess of the annual interest rate cap of 36 percent mandated under the law, and continue to supervise lenders under other statutes. But it will scrap supervisory examinations, which are the most powerful tool for proactively uncovering abuses and patterns of illegal practices by companies suspected of wrongdoing, former consumer bureau enforcement officials said.John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney, said the rule change came from a top-to-bottom review of the bureau\u2019s procedures geared at curtailing what the administration, along with lending industry executives, have criticized as overly aggressive enforcement by the bureau\u2019s first director, Richard Cordray.Instead of conducting examinations that might find similar patterns, the bureau will now rely solely on complaints funneled through its website, hotlines, the military and people who believe they have been victims of abuse.\u201cIt will go from a proactive system to something that is completely reactive,\u201d said Christopher L. Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who served in a variety of top positions at the bureau from 2012 to 2016. \u201cOver time, it is going to have a real impact on the lives of these people who devote their lives to the service of our country.\u201dMr. Czwartacki, who said Mr. Mulvaney is urging Congress to quickly pass a measure that would give him the power to resume supervisory examinations, noted that the agency\u2019s goal was \u201cto protect service members, but we also have to abide by the law.\u201d\u201cWe are 100 percent committed to seeing that happens,\u201d he added.But the banking and payday industries are likely to fight any such legislation and quick passage is anything but guaranteed. The industry has been lobbying to loosen enforcement for years, in part by trying to exempt an array of fees from the 36 percent rate cap.\u201cIt\u2019s basically about greed,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who is a co-sponsor of the bill. \u201cThe industry has been pushing for this because they want to make more than 36 percent \u2014 I mean, who needs more than 36 percent to make a profit?\u201d\u201cWe need a constant and systematic review of these companies \u2014 not just individual cases brought by the executive officer of a unit, reporting one incident at a time,\u201d said Mr. Reed, who observed financial abuses firsthand when he served as a company commander in the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, N.C. in the 1970s.Many service members enter the military in their late teens or early 20s with little credit history, and are often targeted by auto loan financiers, credit card companies and retail stores that hide high financing costs behind low down payments and short-term teaser rates.The first head of the board\u2019s service member lending division was Holly Petraeus, who worked with the Pentagon to close loopholes in the law, resulting in a slate of rules changes in 2015 that restricted the amounts and rates of auto, payday and tax-refund anticipation loans.Earlier versions of this article misidentified the Consumer Bankers Association. It is a trade association that represents only banks, and not auto, payday and other retail lenders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Saudi Aramco Is Said to Postpone Its Potentially Record-Breaking I.P.O.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant has suspended its plans to go public, a decision that puts on hold what would have been by far the biggest initial offering on record \u2014 or perhaps signals its cancellation.The company, Saudi Aramco, and its advisers are instead focusing on buying a stake in Sabic, a huge Saudi chemical producer, people briefed on the matter said Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. The shift in focus to a deal for Sabic, one of the people added, means the earliest that work could resume on a Saudi Aramco stock sale will be late next year.The delay cast more doubt on the future of what is meant to be not just a landmark deal for financial markets but one of the biggest milestones in Saudi Arabia\u2019s history.The kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had hoped to use the billions of dollars the I.P.O. would raise to finance his Vision 2030 plan, an ambitious effort to wean his country off its dependence on oil. Among the plan\u2019s expensive elements is the creation of a $500 billion city called Neom, meant to run entirely on clean energy and be serviced by robots.But the plans to take the state-owned oil monopoly public have been bedeviled by the sheer complexity of the undertaking. Though Prince Mohammed had hoped for a $2 trillion market value for Saudi Aramco, oil industry experts called that too high. And legal advisers have grappled with potentially thorny issues, including the possible pitfalls that could arise from choosing a foreign exchange on which to offer shares.In a statement, Khalid Al Falih, the Saudi energy minister and the company\u2019s chairman, said the I.P.O. had not been called off.\u201cThe government remains committed to the I.P.O. of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,\u201d he said. \u201cThis timing will depend on multiple factors, including favorable market conditions.\u201dThe statement also suggested that an important acquisition would come first.Buying part of Sabic, a giant in its own right, could make Saudi Aramco a more valuable company while the petrochemical industry is growing around the world. That, in turn, could help the oil company draw even more interest in a public offering.Sabic, which earned a net profit of nearly $5 billion in 2017, produced more than 70 million tons of petrochemicals and five million tons of steel last year, according to Middle East Petroleum and Economic Publications, which tracks the industry.Saudi Aramco has been trying to move into the sector, which it believes could provide a hedge against an eventual decline in demand for oil as a fuel. This month, Saudi Aramco\u2019s board approved $14 billion in petrochemical projects and project expansions, including a large refinery in Texas and a joint venture with the French giant Total in Saudi Arabia.The two companies have grown closer recently, including by starting plans for a joint chemicals plant in 2025. And Sabic would give Saudi Aramco invaluable expertise in the petrochemicals sector.\u201cSaudi Aramco has been quite deliberate in adding refineries, terminals and, more recently, chemical plants,\u201d said Osmar Abib, a managing director at Credit Suisse who has been closely following the proposed public offering. \u201cIt is all with the key objectives of securing more access to markets and enhancing overall returns.\u201dBut skeptics of a Sabic transaction worry that Saudi Aramco would be taking on a financial burden by paying tens of billions of dollars for a stake in the chemical company. And adding on a big petrochemical business might reduce the overall profitability of Aramco, which is believed to enjoy among the world\u2019s lowest costs for extracting the oil it produces.In any case, any eventual listing of Saudi Aramco shares will now have to wait until the Sabic acquisition is completed.But the decision to pause planning for a public offering of Saudi Aramco \u2014 and the pivot toward the transaction with Sabic \u2014 prompted some analysts to suggest that a public listing may be doomed.Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University, said he still suspected Prince Mohammed \u201cdreams of a diversified Saudi economy.\u201d\u201cAramco is still likely to play a big role in this goal, but Aramco might not do this through an I.P.O.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certainly other ways to raise capital.\u201dStanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Evidence Against Manafort Is \u2018Overwhelming,\u2019 Prosecutors Say", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 The evidence against Paul Manafort is \u201coverwhelming,\u201d a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in his fraud trial on Thursday, saying that he hid more than $16 million in income and fraudulently obtained $20 million in bank loans even though, as a trained lawyer, \u201cMr. Manafort knew the law.\u201dOn the final day of the trial, the lead prosecutor, Greg D. Andres, cast Mr. Manafort as a bright and highly capable political consultant, steeped in tax law and financial matters and fluent in terms like \u201cwrite-offs\u201d and \u201cdistribution\u201d income. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a clerical decision. It wasn\u2019t \u2018forgot to check a box,\u2019\u201d Mr. Andres said. \u201cWhen you follow the trail of Mr. Manafort\u2019s finances, it is littered with lies.\u201dOver 12 days in court, the prosecution called 27 witnesses and offered 388 photographs, emails and other documents as evidence of a scheme by Mr. Manafort to finance a life of opulence through sustained and sprawling fraud. But in their closing statement, Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers implied that the real issue was why he was in the courtroom to begin with.Only after the special counsel took an interest in him, they argued, did bank executives and accountants begin to raise questions about irregularities in his financial records, tax returns or loan applications.Investigators for the special counsel were \u201cgoing through each piece of paper and finding anything that doesn\u2019t match up to add to the weight of evidence against Mr. Manafort,\u201d said Richard Westling, one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers. Mr. Manafort was even charged, he said, with fraudulent statements in an application for a loan that was never granted.\u201cWhat would be the motivation?\u201d Mr. Westling asked. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to determine what was behind that.\u201dThe dueling summations ended in a heated confrontation over whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers had crossed a line in seeking to sow doubt about the prosecutors\u2019 motivations. While the fraud charges against Mr. Manafort are not related to Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference in 2016, as Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman he might know about Moscow\u2019s efforts to influence the campaign.Without saying so directly, the defense lawyers made clear that Mr. Manafort was a Republican, telling jurors that he had worked on the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Gerald R. Ford and George Bush. Though they did not mention Mr. Trump by name, they said that Mr. Manafort had no income in 2016 because he had volunteered for \u201ca presidential campaign.\u201dAfter prosecutors protested, Judge T.S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria instructed the jury to \u201cignore any argument about the Justice Department\u2019s motive or lack of motive in bringing this prosecution.\u201dIn a tacit acknowledgment that his criticism of prosecutors during the trial might influence the verdict, Judge Ellis also told the panel \u201cnot to construe any comments the court has made\u201d as his opinions.The trial is the first major courtroom test for Mr. Mueller\u2019s team. The other Americans charged thus far by the special counsel have all pleaded guilty without going to trial. If he is found guilty, Mr. Manafort, 69, could spend the rest of his life behind bars. The most serious of 18 charges against him carry a maximum sentence of 30 years.His wife, Kathleen, was in the courtroom on Wednesday to hear the closing arguments, as she has throughout the trial, but his two daughters were absent.Kevin Downing, one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers, told the jurors on Wednesday that they should completely discount Mr. Gates as a witness, saying he was guilty of \u201cmultiple lifetimes of fraud.\u201dProsecutors relied on Mr. Gates, Mr. Downing said, only because they were \u201cso desperate\u201d to catch Mr. Manafort. He added, \u201cHow he was able to get the deal he got, I have no idea.\u201dThe defense argued that Mr. Gates was the only witness to testify that Mr. Manafort knowingly and willfully engaged in fraud to hide his income and deceive banks. In fact, they said, Mr. Manafort only misinterpreted or overlooked complex financial regulations, such as the requirement to report foreign bank accounts to federal authorities.Mr. Andres acknowledged to the jury that Mr. Gates was a flawed witness. \u201cWe are not asking you to take Rick Gates\u2019s testimony at face value,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not asking you to like him either.\u201d When Mr. Manafort enlisted Mr. Gates to help him execute a fraud scheme that spanned more than seven years, he said, \u201che didn\u2019t choose a Boy Scout.\u201dBut he also told the jury that it could convict Mr. Manafort on the basis of his own words, highlighting emails and documents that Mr. Manafort personally wrote or signed. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the star witness in this case is the documents,\u201d he said.Even though the bank records, loan applications and emails were voluminous, he said, \u201cMr. Manafort\u2019s scheme, when you break it down, was not that complicated.\u201d Mr. Manafort deliberately deceived his bookkeeper and tax accountants, Mr. Andres argued, so he could evade taxes on $16.5 million in income and then tricked banks into loaning him millions when \u201che was going broke and he couldn\u2019t pay his bills.\u201dWith the stroke of a pen, Mr. Andres argued, Mr. Manafort achieved financial magic, making mortgages and other debts disappear, turning a rental apartment into a second residence, changing a loan into income and back again, and disguising a near-bankrupt political consultancy into one whose income was \u201con the upswing.\u201dHe repeatedly asked the jurors, who are to begin their deliberations Thursday morning, to rely on their common sense when confronting book after exhibit book of financial documents. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, a loan is not income. Income is not a loan. You don\u2019t need to be a tax expert to understand that,\u201d he said.He told them to ask themselves why Mr. Manafort would pay an accounting firm $100,000 a year to pay his bills, but pay more than $15 million in personal expenses himself out of 31 foreign bank accounts in Cyprus and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. \u201cThe answer? He wanted to hide those accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cUse your common sense.\u201dAlthough defense lawyers suggested that some of the signatures on Mr. Manafort\u2019s foreign bank accounts appeared to be forged, Mr. Andres insisted that Mr. Manafort personally controlled the foreign bank accounts through which $60 million in income flowed between 2010 and 2014.Some of Mr. Manafort\u2019s lies, he said, were \u201cnothing short of absurd.\u201d For instance, he said, in order to qualify for a better mortgage rate, Mr. Manafort \u201creminded\u201d his daughter and son-in-law that bank officials believed they were living in a SoHo apartment that was in fact a rental. \u201cIf you are living in a residence, do you need to be reminded?\u201d he said.But Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers argued that he was being singled out for discrepancies that typically might only lead to more questions from bank officials, or perhaps a tax audit. If every loan applicant who mischaracterized a rental apartment as a second residence was charged, Mr. Westling said, courthouses would be overflowing with defendants in bank fraud cases.Mr. Downing suggested that Mr. Manafort did not hide his income from tax authorities, but simply tried to defer it to pay later. \u201cIt goes on all the time,\u201d Mr. Downing said.He also said the prosecutors were oversimplifying complex issues that confused even Mr. Manafort\u2019s own tax accountants, including in what cases he was required to declare that he had foreign bank accounts. \u201cAny idea that has been given to you by the office of special counsel that this stuff is straightforward and simple is just not true,\u201d Mr. Downing said.He said the F.B.I. had known about Mr. Manafort\u2019s foreign bank accounts as long ago as 2014, when the Ukrainian authorities sought the F.B.I.\u2019s help in investigating payments from the previous government to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm. Yet Mr. Manafort only came under investigation more than two years later, he said, hinting that the special counsel\u2019s office had an ulterior motive.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect date.

{"Headline": "Demystifying Online Privacy, Through the Story of the Man Who Took On Silicon Valley", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI usually think of myself as a politics reporter, the job I\u2019ve had, on and off, for most of my career. But in the last year or so, I\u2019ve had to add another title, one I never thought I\u2019d have: tech reporter.My colleagues and I have reported extensively over the last year on the enormous power wielded by tech companies over politics and commerce and on the ways in which that power can be abused. Our reporting has shed light on how poorly tech companies protect the integrity of their platforms and of the data you hand them for free, with profound consequences.Yet both Facebook and Google, and the broader tech industry of which they are a part, have escaped any major regulation or seriously punitive government action in the United States. (In Europe, Google was recently hit with a $5 billion fine for antitrust violations.) Even after a cascade of scandals, Washington had done almost nothing. Why?Mr. Mactaggart, who last year began organizing to pass a California ballot initiative restricting the abuse of personal data, turned out to be an ideal way to answer the question. For one thing, his campaign was happening in real time, and as a political neophyte, he was encountering Silicon Valley\u2019s political machine for the first time, much as most readers would be. Mr. Mactaggart was not an expert on privacy when he started; he was a wealthy real estate developer from Oakland, whose main interaction with people in the tech world was at Bay Area birthday parties and his neighborhood dog run. He more or less fell into a rabbit hole and became a little obsessed. That journey allowed me to turn an arcane and often boring subject into a compelling yarn; his education \u2014 as a political campaigner and as a consumer \u2014 becomes the reader\u2019s.That was important for me, too, as a reporter. I often write about complex policy issues, and questions surrounding data collection, advertising and privacy can be challenging to unspool in a compelling, accessible way.I used to write about campaign finance; that\u2019s a complicated topic, too, and it was easy to lose readers\u2019 attention. But writing about data and privacy is harder. Presidential campaigns lend a certain innate drama to stories about donors and fund-raising. Tech and social media, while in one sense nearer to people\u2019s daily lives, can seem distant and abstract. For those who have no background in programming or data science, the industry they animate can seem impenetrable.This is no accident. One reason Big Tech faces so little resistance from policymakers is that Silicon Valley\u2019s business seems so daunting. I find that Big Tech\u2019s lobbyists and \u201cthought leaders\u201d \u2014 and some journalists \u2014 implicitly and sometimes explicitly promote the idea that policymakers are too dumb, slow or unsophisticated to understand how it all works, let alone regulate something like data collection practices. This notion also helps insulate the industry from accountability.The story of how Mr. Mactaggart forced California lawmakers to pass a landmark consumer privacy law is, in part, a story of the power of this idea \u2014 and also of its flimsiness. The law he helped pass is not a panacea, and won\u2019t solve every problem raised by the encroaching powers of Big Tech. Some critics believe the law doesn\u2019t go far enough. (And many in the industry believe it goes way too far.) But the fact of it \u2014 the political proof of concept \u2014 has already stirred intense debate and pressure to produce even more protections for consumers, not only in other states but in Washington.That matters not only for consumers, but also for readers. Mr. Mactaggart is a smart guy, and he had time and resources most people don\u2019t. But he\u2019s not an expert on politics or technology. If he can figure it out, so can you.Advertisement"}

Dr. Rosenthal was an emergency room doctor before becoming a journalist.N.Y.U.\u2019s plan was a noble attempt to redress this problem. But the medical school got it wrong. And N.Y.U. can look within \u2014 to its own law school, in fact \u2014 for a far better solution.Instead of making medical school free for everyone, N.Y.U. \u2014 and all medical schools \u2014 should waive tuition only for those students who commit to work where they are needed most.The N.Y.U. law school is a model. It has long had a program that attracts the best and the brightest to the low-wage corners of the legal profession: Each year, 20 students who commit to a career in public service pay no tuition, while those whose ambition hews toward corporate law are charged full freight.I know that many young people are not sure of their chosen path when they enter medical school. But there are simple ways to adjust the concept.How about all medical schools commit to forgiving or paying back the loans of young doctors who go into lower-paying fields or set up practice in underserved areas \u2014 and keep doing so as long as they stay there? So if a student chooses to become an ear, nose and throat surgeon in suburban New York or a private cardiologist in Miami, fine. He or she can pay back what has been borrowed. But if that doctor chooses to deliver babies in rural Oklahoma or practice pediatrics on the South Side of Chicago, then he or she should get to keep every penny of salary.The real goal is not short-term payback but to enable and support young doctors who feel that treating patients is a calling, regardless of the patients\u2019 ability to pay. Still, if we want to train the best, most-caring doctors to take the jobs we most need, we have to come up with a fairer way to finance medical education. The titans of medical education should step up to the plate. N.Y.U. took a shot but missed the mark, despite all the hoopla surrounding its announcement and the framing of its offer as generous philanthropy to the tune of $600 million. Every academic medical center should see training the medical work force America needs not as charity but as an obligation, a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d of the highest order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "National Enquirer Had Decades of Trump Dirt. He Wanted to Buy It All.", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal investigators have provided ample evidence that President Trump was involved in deals to pay two women to keep them from speaking publicly before the 2016 election about affairs that they said they had with him.But it turns out that Mr. Trump wanted to go even further.He and his lawyer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, devised a plan to buy up all the dirt on Mr. Trump that the National Enquirer and its parent company had collected on him, dating back to the 1980s, according to several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.The existence of the plan, which was never finalized, has not been reported before. But it was strongly hinted at in a recording that Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer released last month of a conversation about payoffs that Mr. Cohen had with Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s all the stuff \u2014 all the stuff, because you never know,\u201d Mr. Cohen said on the recording.The move by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen indicated just how concerned they were about all the information amassed by the company, American Media, and its chairman, David Pecker, a loyal Trump ally of two decades who has cooperated with investigators.The people who knew about the discussions would speak about them only on condition of anonymity, given that they are now the potential subject of a federal investigation that did not end with Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea.Lawyers for Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen declined to comment for this article as did American Media.It is not known how much of the material on Mr. Trump is still in American Media\u2019s possession or whether American Media destroyed any of it after the campaign. Prosecutors have not said whether they have obtained any of the material beyond that which pertains to Ms. McDougal and Ms. Clifford and the discussions about their arrangements.For the better part of two decades, Mr. Pecker had ordered his staff at American Media to protect Mr. Trump from troublesome stories, in some cases by buying up stories about him and filing them away.In 2016, he kept his staff from going back through the old Trump tip and story files that dated to before Mr. Pecker became company chairman in 1999, several former staff members said in interviews with The New York Times.That meant that American Media, the nation\u2019s largest gossip publisher, did not play a role during the election year in vetting a presidential candidacy \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 made for the tabloids.In August 2016, American Media acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her career as a fitness specialist. But American Media never published her allegations about a relationship with Mr. Trump.Shortly after American Media completed the arrangement with Ms. McDougal at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest, a troubling question began to nag at Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, according to several people who knew about the discussions at the time: What would happen to America Media\u2019s sensitive Trump files if Mr. Pecker were to leave the company?Mr. Cohen, those people said, was hearing rumors that Mr. Pecker might leave American Media for Time magazine \u2014 a title Mr. Pecker is known to have dreams of running.There was perennial talk about American Media\u2019s business troubles. And Mr. Trump appeared to take a world-wearier view of the wisdom of leaving his sensitive personal secrets in someone else\u2019s hands:\u201cMaybe he gets hit by a truck,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Pecker in a conversation with Mr. Cohen, musing about an unfortunate mishap befalling his good friend.When The Times first reported that the recording had been discovered by the F.B.I., people close to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump initially described it in the narrow context of Ms. McDougal\u2019s deal.But Mr. Cohen, in fact, indicates in the audio that he and Mr. Trump are speaking about an arrangement involving far more.\u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info, regarding our friend David,\u201d Mr. Cohen says in reference to Mr. Pecker.The plan got far enough along that Mr. Cohen relays in the recorded conversation that he had discussed paying for all the information from American Media with the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg.\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up,\u201d he says, adding about Mr. Pecker, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay him something.\u201dIn the end, the deal never came together.When Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty, prosecutors said in court documents that Mr. Cohen and American Media did enter into a deal in which Mr. Cohen agreed to pay the company $125,000 for the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story.After the deal was signed but before Mr. Cohen paid, prosecutors said, American Media backed out of the arrangement and warned Mr. Cohen to shred the paperwork (he did not).Prosecutors said there had been discussions between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Cohen in which Mr. Cohen said American Media would be reimbursed for the payment to Ms. McDougal.The notoriously frugal Mr. Trump balked at doing so, causing Mr. Pecker anxiety about explaining the payout to his board, according to a person briefed on the discussions. It was unclear whether Mr. Trump ever provided a reimbursement.Mr. Weisselberg ultimately provided information about Mr. Cohen under a deal that protected him from self-incrimination. As prosecutors continue in their investigation, Mr. Weisselberg could serve as a particularly helpful guide through the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.Mr. Pecker, whose company is expected to be of continued interest in the investigation, has a similar arrangement with prosecutors. Potentially as worrisome for Mr. Trump and his advisers, Mr. Pecker could be a particularly knowing guide through any other potentially illegal efforts made to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy from his own less savory exploits.He added, \u201cLook to whom the government is reportedly giving immunity to. Those individuals are the ones who would have knowledge about what, if anything, the campaign at the highest, or lowest, or any level in between had on this issue.\u201dPeople with knowledge of American Media\u2019s operations, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, described the files on Mr. Trump as mostly older National Enquirer stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s marital woes and lawsuits; related story notes and lists of sensitive sources; some tips about alleged affairs; and minutia, like allegations of unscrupulous golfing.Many of the older National Enquirer stories are often not accessible through Google or databases like Nexis.Several former American Media staff members said that at the very least, the material the company had on Mr. Trump would have put its flagship, The Enquirer, in a prime position to dominate on coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s scandalous past.Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Unbearable\u2019 Noise and Dust: Kushner Companies Accused of Driving Out Tenants in Brooklyn Building", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the Kushner Companies bought the building at 184 Kent Avenue in Brooklyn in 2015, there were 316 rent-stabilized tenants, seemingly protected from eviction and large rent increases.By June of this year, there were 71 left, according to documents filed with the state attorney general.There is a natural attrition at any rental complex, but rent-regulated units are usually so prized that the turnover is about 3 or 4 percent a year, according to Richard LeFrak, a third-generation landlord. That percentage might be slightly higher where the tenants are largely young people.But the exodus of 245 rent-regulated tenants in a building in less than three years allowed the Kushners to promote those apartments as condominiums and to sell, so far, roughly 130 units for tens of millions of dollars.\u201cAnytime we lose rent-protected units, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Stephen T. Levin, the city councilman who represents Williamsburg and other parts of Brooklyn. \u201cWe have an affordable housing crisis. It\u2019s also harder and harder to find middle-income housing on the open market.\u201dThe Kushners denied the charges that they deliberately drove out renters. In a statement, the Kushner companies insisted that they took all the appropriate precautions to protect existing tenants, including daily vacuuming, mopping and daily air scrubbing. State officials are investigating the tenants\u2019 claims.This is not a story of low-income families being forced out of their homes. But it is a classic tale of gentrification and profit-taking on the Brooklyn waterfront over the past two decades. First, small manufacturers, breweries and sugar mills made way for artists and musicians who remade industrial buildings into lofts. They, in turn, were replaced by young professionals buying pricey apartments in the renovated factories or in the new glassy towers that have sprung up.The building at 184 Kent opened in 1915 as a warehouse for Austin, Nichols & Company, one of the world\u2019s largest wholesale grocers, at a time when Williamsburg and Greenpoint were working waterfront neighborhoods.The building, which covers an entire block, was designed by Cass Gilbert, the architect who designed the Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan. It was a rare American example of the Egyptian Revival style, with concrete walls and tall, narrow windows.Austin, Nichols & Company maintained its headquarters on Kent Avenue through the 1950s.In 1985, Louis Kestenbaum and Meyer Hirsch, two Williamsburg landlords, bought the warehouse for $56,000, according to city records. They immediately obtained a $4 million bond from the city\u2019s Industrial Development Agency to renovate the building for tenants that manufactured and distributed women\u2019s clothing and health and beauty aids.At the time, it was city policy to preserve industrial jobs on the waterfront.But before Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s group paid off the $4 million bond in 2001, it had converted a portion of the third floor of the building into loft-like apartments for artists, filmmakers and others, in violation of the building\u2019s zoning. The city cited him for 50 violations in 2000 and issued a stop work order.He soon got a variance from the city for plans to carve the building into large apartments. He made plans to add a glassy, six-story addition on the roof and install large picture windows.But preservationists objected, and, with broad support, the city\u2019s Landmarks Commission voted in September 2005 to list the warehouse as a city landmark.That led to a remarkable showdown.City Councilman David Yassky, whose political campaigns received generous contributions from the Kestenbaums, said that the landmark status would impede development, and at his prompting the City Council overturned the landmark designation.At the same time, the city, no longer interested in preserving aging industrial buildings, rezoned the Williamsburg-Greenpoint neighborhoods for residential development, and the value of waterfront properties skyrocketed.Indeed, two months before the Council vote, Mr. Kestenbaum had signed a contract to sell 184 Kent Avenue to Jason Halpern of JMH Development for $61.8 million, according to city records. The tenants \u2014 the artists and filmmakers \u2014 were evicted.Beginning in 2006, Mr. Halpern began knocking out the center of the building to create a central courtyard and 338 apartments, some with terraces. He built several penthouses and outdoor space on the roof. Mr. Halpern did not return requests for comment.In contrast to Mr. Kestenbaum, Mr. Halpern sought to have the Austin, Nichols Warehouse listed on the National Register of Historic Places (much less restrictive than city landmark designation). Afterward, he received $34 million in historic preservation tax credits for the renovations. He later said he would not have been able to complete the project without the tax credits.Mr. Halpern, who lived in a seventh-floor penthouse, also received tax breaks worth, so far, about $10 million under the city\u2019s J-51 housing program, according to the Department of Finance. Under the program, the city grants landlords property tax breaks for new boilers, elevators and other building improvements. In return, the apartments must adhere to rent-stabilization laws, which restrict rent increases and require landlords to offer renewal leases.Barth and Rosa Bazyluk arrived in 2010. \u201cIt was really nice for the price,\u201d said Mr. Bazyluk of their one-bedroom apartment overlooking the courtyard. Their rent started at $2,350. \u201cFor what we were paying, we thought we got a good value.\u201dEric Barna, a doctor of internal medicine and another plaintiff who moved to the building in 2012, left a \u201ccookie-cutter high-rise in Manhattan\u201d for what he described as a less expensive, but still luxury, apartment in a building with industrial chic and great amenities.But the city and the country were in a deep recession by then and leasing was slow. To fill the building, Mr. Halpern gave tenants leases at rents substantially lower than permitted under rent stabilization. In New York real estate this is called a \u201cpreferred rent.\u201dStill, the rents for many apartments were more than $3,000.In early 2015, Jared Kushner, then chief executive of Kushner Companies, along with LivWrk, a real estate company and frequent Kushner partner, and, Rockpoint Group, a real estate investor that put up most of the money for the project, bought the warehouse for about $275 million. Their plan was to convert it to condominiums.In May of that year, the Kushners filed a certified rent roll with the attorney general\u2019s office, which oversees condominium conversions, indicating that there were only 22 vacant apartments in the building.That meant there were 316 rent-stabilized tenants who could not be evicted.The Kushners quickly raised rents to the highest legal limits. A tenant living in a one-bedroom apartment said his rent increased to $4,000 from $3,200. He was angry, but after talking to lawyers, he said, he learned that it was legal.Then the Kushners started what was essentially the third gut renovation of 184 Kent Avenue, this time to make it attractive to higher-income residents. The work started in the lobby, hallways, courtyard and rooftop before moving on to vacant apartments, where new, higher-end fixtures were installed in the bathrooms and kitchens.\u201cYou could see the practically new sinks and toilets being carried out,\u201d said Dr. Barna. \u201cYou had to live through drilling throughout the day and a parade of construction workers up and down the corridor.\u201dThe noise and the dust were relentless, the tenants say.\u201cThe cabinets were literally shaking on the walls,\u201d said Jens Mebes, a creative director for commercials who has lived in the building since 2014 and is a plaintiff. \u201cThe hammering. I\u2019d literally find myself coming home for work and wondering, what is this fine film on the kitchen counter. It goes into the furniture. Your clothes. I thought, maybe it\u2019ll be O.K. But there was just no care for the tenants who still lived in the building.\u201dErin A. Simmons, a lawyer who bought her apartment there in 2017, is sympathetic to the complaints outlined in the lawsuit. Ms. Simmons said, \u201cThe noise and dust during demolition were unbearable. I was forced to buy industrial air filtration units and began to rely on daily doses of Visine and allergy medications to address my aggravated dust allergy.\u201dThe Bazyluks gave up and moved to Westchester in December, when Ms. Bazyluk was pregnant.\u201cIt takes a lot for someone born and raised in New York City to throw in the towel on a rent-stabilized apartment,\u201d Mr. Bazyluk said. \u201cWe lived in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City. But at that point, we didn\u2019t want to put up with the noise, the dust and the lack of response from management anymore.\u201dMs. Simmons and other tenants contend that some of those measures, including plastic walls that zipped up in front of apartment doors designed to seal out construction dust, didn\u2019t start until after tenants organized and brought their complaints to the owner.The city\u2019s Department of Buildings said that although it responded to more than two dozen complaints at the building in 2017 and 2018, it found \u201cno violations.\u201dBut five current and former tenants have joined the lawsuit since it was filed last month.The tenant group negotiated a 20 percent discount on the purchase price for their units, which did not include new wood floors, designer refrigerators and stoves and new bathroom fixtures being installed in vacant apartments. A few bought their units, but many did not. Throughout 2016 and 2017, dozens and dozens of tenants left.At one point, the Kushners estimated that their profit on the sale of the apartments would be $70 million, according to a filing with the state attorney general.The growing number of vacancies were \u201cvery noticeable,\u201d Mr. Mebes said. \u201cI\u2019d have friends over for a barbecue on the roof and they\u2019d say, Wow, it\u2019s all emptied out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Blasts N.F.L. Players as Protests Resume During Anthem", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe morning after a handful of N.F.L. players renewed their protests against social inequality and police brutality by raising fists or kneeling during the playing of the national anthem, President Trump renewed his criticism of their actions.The N.F.L.\u2019s 2018 preseason began in earnest on Thursday with the first full slate of games, and the question that has dogged the league all summer \u2014 will players continue social justice protests during the playing of the national anthem \u2014 was answered loud and clear.Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the most outspoken players in recent years, was joined by his teammate De\u2019Vante Bausby in raising a fist while the anthem was played. As had been customary in the past, Chris Long, a veteran defensive end, stood next to Jenkins with a hand on the defensive back\u2019s shoulder.In the only reported instance of players kneeling, Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson of the Miami Dolphins took a knee during the anthem before their team\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while their teammate Robert Quinn raised his fist.President Trump, who has been vocal in his opposition to using the anthem as a stage for protest, responded on Friday morning with a pair of tweets blasting Jenkins, Stills and others who didn\u2019t stand at attention.Stills and Wilson, though, received praise on social media from Colin Kaepernick, the inactive player whose protests as a member of the San Francisco 49ers started this movement.Stills told reporters after the game that he and Wilson had not coordinated a demonstration in advance of the game.\u201cIt just happened that way,\u201d Stills said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on a knee, most of the time I\u2019m praying, and thank God for having Albert next to me. Being a part of this protest hasn\u2019t been easy. I thought I was going to be by myself out there. Today I had an angel with me with Albert being out there. I\u2019m grateful he sees what\u2019s happening, and he wants to do something about it as well.\u201dElsewhere, four members of the Jacksonville Jaguars (Telvin Smith, Jalen Ramsey, Leonard Fournette and T.J. Yeldon) waited in the tunnel until after the anthem had concluded before their team\u2019s game against the New Orleans Saints, and three members of the Seattle Seahawks (Quinton Jefferson, Branden Jackson and Duane Brown) did the same before their team\u2019s game against the Indianapolis Colts.In a notable shift, however, the 49ers, who had been one of the more active political teams in previous years, did not appear to have any players kneeling during the anthem before their game against the Dallas Cowboys. Marquise Goodwin, a wide receiver, had his right arm raised for the duration of the song.That Jenkins went back to demonstrating was not surprising after his strong reaction to recent changes in the league policy regarding behavior during the anthem.The protests came less than three months after the league, without consulting the players\u2019 union, updated its rules to obligate players to stand on the field during the national anthem, or remain in the locker room. Previously, players were obligated to be on the field but were only encouraged to stand.In response to backlash from the president and some fans, the league tightened its policy, which now includes potential fines against teams whose players protest. The league has allowed teams to decide on their own whether they want to penalize players directly.It is unclear whether the protests on Thursday will continue in the weeks ahead. Some players may have just wanted to show their displeasure with the new policy, while others may have wanted to stand up to President Trump.No players protested when the N.F.L. kicked off its 2018 season last week when the Baltimore Ravens and the Chicago Bears played in the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio.At the same time, teams issued their own proclamations. Last month, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said that he expected everyone on his team to stand for the anthem and not stay in the locker room. His son Stephen added that players who did not follow the team\u2019s directive would be cut.Other owners have been more conciliatory. Jed York, whose family owns the San Francisco 49ers, abstained from voting on the new policy. Chris Johnson, the acting owner of the Jets, said players who protested would not be penalized.\u201cI\u2019m coaching football,\u201d he told The Palm Beach Post. \u201cI\u2019m not dealing with all of this.\u201dThe players who protested on Thursday may not be penalized. After the N.F.L. Players Association filed a grievance in July arguing that the new policy violated the N.F.L.\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, the league agreed to freeze the enforcement of the policy while it tries to work out a potential solution with the union.Meanwhile, Kaepernick, the player who was the first to protest in 2016, has not returned to the N.F.L. He filed a grievance against the league, accusing the owners of conspiring to keep him out of job.Eric Reid, Kaepernick\u2019s teammate on the 49ers who also regularly knelt during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 and 2017, is also unsigned. He, too, has filed a grievance against the league.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Follow the Money (Then Take a Picture)", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "With \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d the filmmaker Lauren Greenfield looks back at 30 years of chronicling the rich \u2014 and predicting our cultural future.Supported byPerhaps because she has spent her career watching the rich, the photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield is herself rich to watch. At a party after the New York premiere of her new documentary \u2014 \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d about the perils of capitalism \u2014 Ms. Greenfield was wired, welcoming and constantly working. She snapped pictures of the well-heeled crowd as she hugged her way around the room, occasionally misplacing a glass of white wine, in a churn of compliments and gossip.Ms. Greenfield, 52, paused to note that one prominent guest had left the festivities early: Jacqueline Siegel, the star of her best-known documentary, \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d about the construction of a $100 million house amid last decade\u2019s financial crisis. Ms. Greenfield observed that in the intervening years, Ms. Siegel\u2019s bosom seemed to have grown inexplicably, much like the national economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said, \u201cfor the excess of the new American dream.\u201d (Through a spokesman, Ms. Siegel, a self-professed patron of cosmetic procedures, denied that she has recently augmented her breasts.)Over the last 30 years, Ms. Greenfield has become America\u2019s foremost visual chronicler of the plutocracy, and those who hope to join its ranks. Her ultra-saturated, up-close, unsparing images have appeared in the pages of The New York Times Magazine, GQ and The New Yorker, as well as museum exhibitions and theatrical documentaries. Ms. Greenfield\u2019s lens has fallen on affluent teens playing hooky, rappers and the strippers they shower $100 bills on, investors in exile, hedge-funders in denial, Iceland\u2019s teetering banking system, abandoned mansions in Dubai and countless other icons of the world\u2019s mounting financial inequality.In an interview in July, Ms. Greenfield noted that critics have occasionally dismissed her work as marginal. And yet her fascination with materialism has often placed her ahead of the cultural curve. In 1992, she photographed bored teenagers at a fancy Los Angeles school dance; two of them were the then-unknown Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. In 2007, Ms. Greenfield began work that eventually led to \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d putting her in an ideal position to document the global housing crash.Even the election of a reality-show celebrity as commander-in-chief is a \u201cweird validation of what I\u2019ve been looking at and why it\u2019s important,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cWhen Kim Kardashian was photographed with Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d she added, referring to an Oval Office meeting that took place in May, \u201cit looked like it could have been an ad for my movie.\u201dArriving in theaters nationwide on Aug. 3, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is a 105-minute collage of a documentary that weaves together still images, news clips, original interviews and footage of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s own family. It argues that the unceasing pursuit of fame and fortune has \u201cbecome the new American dream\u201d (it\u2019s a favorite phrase), replacing the Horatio Alger allegory of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.Ms. Greenfield is well aware that she didn\u2019t invent this notion. In a gold-hued, 503-page monograph also titled \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d that Phaidon published in 2017, Ms. Greenfield quotes the writer Fran Lebowitz: \u201cOh please, Americans do not hate the rich; they want to be them. Every American believes that they are the impending rich, and that will never change.\u201dMs. Greenfield began work on the documentary in 2014 after performing \u201can archaeological dig into my own work\u201d \u2014 re-examining more than 500,000 images and 650 hours of audio/video footage archived at her Venice, Calif., home. She and her husband-slash-co-producer, Frank Evers, pitched the project to Amazon Studios. \u201cLauren had all of this material, so they saw a through line from the Reagan \u201980s to Trump, with her as our narrator and guide,\u201d Mr. Evers said.Amazon turned out to be a cosmically appropriate partner. On the same day that \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d had its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in July, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, became \u201cthe richest man in modern history,\u201d according to Bloomberg, with an estimated net worth of $150 billion.Ms. Greenfield herself isn\u2019t particularly rich, and she seems determined not to absorb the aspirational codes she has spent her life decrypting. Over lunch in July at Freds, the restaurant on the top floor of Barneys New York (not her idea, she\u2019d like to note), she ordered a salad with canned tuna in lieu of fresh. She dressed straightforwardly in a black T-shirt, her Gucci eyeglasses the only suggestion of status. When her salad arrived, Ms. Greenfield apologized and used her fingers to flick a garnish of raw onions directly onto the table.She had brought her Canon camera, which she plunked down next to her plate; a luxury department store is basically her Serengeti. But she decided not to photograph anyone that day. She hadn\u2019t gotten permission, so the security guards would have likely intervened. Despite being a sly documentarian of strangers at times, Ms. Greenfield doesn\u2019t easily fade into the background. With her minimalist black wardrobe, giant smile and short stature, she\u2019s like a version of her profession out of \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d: a slightly glamorous, vaguely academic photographer-mom.Ms. Greenfield grew up in communes on the West Side of Los Angeles. Her mother, a psychologist, leaned into the counterculture of the 1970s, joining an \u201ceating collective\u201d and refusing to buy Ms. Greenfield brand-name clothes. She appears in \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d telling her daughter, \u201cThe things you didn\u2019t have were the things that I didn\u2019t believe in.\u201dWhat the family valued was education, and when Ms. Greenfield was in the 11th grade, she enrolled at the private Crossroads School in nearby Santa Monica, where she befriended some of the city\u2019s wealthiest teens. That ignited her obsession with \u201cmaterialism and class,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my parents had rejected it so much.\u201dIn 1983, Ms. Greenfield matriculated at Harvard, where her parents had studied, and where she encountered both Mr. Evers and a student body of immense privilege. While traveling around the world her junior year, studying film and anthropology, Ms. Greenfield met the pioneering French photographer Jean Rouch, who is credited with helping invent the style known as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and after returning to Cambridge she changed her major to visual studies.Ms. Greenfield then trained under Barbara Norfleet, who in the mid-1980s released \u201cAll the Right People,\u201d a book of reportage photography focusing on East Coast elites. At the time, such creatures would mostly appear in staged portraits or respectfully edited party pictures, but Ms. Norfleet wanted to capture them and their rituals in the wild. \u201cI realized the rich were, in many ways, this undercover group,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s hugely important, because they have so much influence.\u201dEncouraged by Mr. Evers, who had been hired at Columbia Pictures, Ms. Greenfield applied to film schools a few years after graduation, but she wasn\u2019t admitted anywhere. She concentrated on still photography, earning assignments with National Geographic. Her first project, about a Mayan tribe in Mexico that her mother was studying, was spiked. But after rereading \u201cLess Than Zero,\u201d Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s 1985 novel of California excess, she pursued an idea about her own native culture: a portfolio chronicling Crossroads and other deluxe schools, where students attended five-figure bar mitzvahs, drove Range Rovers and cavorted with celebrity progeny like Kate Hudson.Ms. Greenfield turned the resulting images into her first monograph, \u201cFast Forward,\u201d which earned her gallery representation and the attention of magazine photo editors. She traveled to the wealthy suburb of Edina, Minn., to record popular cliques enamored with Abercrombie & Fitch; and to Milan, where white teenage boys had co-opted the bandannas, baggy jeans and aesthetics of American gang culture. One fellow photographer told Ms. Greenfield that she ran the risk of pigeonholing herself, but she ultimately decided to \u201ckeep peeling back that onion,\u201d she said.Her pictures, relying on candy colors, awkward compositions and voyeuristic access, synced with the work of other rising photographers in the 1990s, including David LaChapelle and, a bit later on, Ryan McGinley. They also drew the attention of Sheila Nevins, the former HBO documentary president. In 2002, she hired Ms. Greenfield to make her first feature-length film, \u201cThin,\u201d an unrelenting account of four patients at an eating-disorder treatment center in Coconut Creek, Fla.To call any of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s portrayals flattering would be inaccurate. (Ms. Siegel\u2019s husband sued the director for defamation after the \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, but the director won $750,000 in legal fees after an arbitrator ruled that everything in the film was true.) And she seems to have a knack for convincing people to be radically, unappealingly honest. Her subjects must find that cathartic. Many have agreed to sit with her repeatedly over the years, including for \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d and Ms. Greenfield has stayed close with several of them, even those she\u2019s captured in harsh light.One of them, a Las Vegas party host named Tiffany Masters, flew to New York to attend the \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d premiere. Sipping an espresso martini at the after-party, she described how Ms. Greenfield has caught her in various unfavorable ways: in the act of pulling her skirt down, for example, or recording a fatty \u201cflap over the bra.\u201d Nonetheless, Ms. Masters said, she doesn\u2019t fault the artist. \u201cLauren has the ability to shoot the truth,\u201d she said.Long pause. \u201cNo.\u201dWhy not?Another long pause. \u201cThey\u2019re unfiltered,\u201d Ms. Masters said. \u201cThey\u2019re raw. They\u2019re uncensored. But they\u2019re human.\u201dMs. Greenfield joined the ranks of prominent documentarians in 2012, after \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d grossed $2.4 million in ticket sales. The movie centered on Ms. Siegel and her husband, David, a time-share tycoon, as they attempted to build one of the largest houses in America. During filming, the couple halted construction when Mr. Siegel became a victim of the real estate bubble. \u201cHe\u2019s been to Donald Trump\u2019s office a couple of times trying to get help,\u201d Mr. Siegel\u2019s son says in the movie. In \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d Ms. Siegel returns to claim she once dated Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the one percent for their own sake,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we\u2019re all engaged, like Jackie and David, in wanting a little bit more.\u201d Ms. Greenfield is convinced that few people learned their lesson in the 2008 crisis, and she has spent a decade worrying about a modern-day version of the Fall of Rome. In the film, Chris Hedges, a former New York Times journalist, warns that \u201csocieties accrue their greatest wealth at the moment they face death.\u201dRather than lampoon the rich, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d attempts to examine how avarice has destroyed lives across economic strata. The film intercuts a history of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s career with the stories of more than a dozen characters, as they reveal in broad strokes the ways in which the desire for more (money, beauty, attention, success) has tainted society. There\u2019s an Icelandic fisherman who becomes a banker and installs a waterfall in his home, only for the country\u2019s economic collapse to send him back to the seas; an adviser who charges outrageous sums to teach aspirational Chinese how to pronounce luxury brand names in English; an adult film actress, once paid $30,000 by Charlie Sheen, who\u2019s had three nose jobs in attempt to escape her past. Much of the footage is wealth porn. Some is actual porn.Another character, Florian Homm, sobs on camera about the ways greed isn\u2019t good. (A former financier, he was accused of defrauding his investors, causing $200 million in losses, and was wanted by the F.B.I.) \u201cIt\u2019s light finance, with heavy repercussions,\u201d Mr. Homm said in an interview. \u201cBut Lauren leaves the viewer to make their own assessments.\u201dAfter \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, one of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s Harvard film professors, Robb Moss, told her that all of her work \u201cwas actually about addiction.\u201d But an inherent challenge in chronicling any form of addiction is the risk of glorifying it. If \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is Ms. Greenfield\u2019s effort to decry incessant capitalism, it also puts the behavior on a podium.Her editors encouraged Ms. Greenfield to add her own story to the film. She interviewed her parents and her two teenage sons, Noah and Gabriel, about her own compulsion: working too much. The \u201cgeneration\u201d in the title is a reference to these scenes, which tie the movie together and provide emotional heft. Ms. Greenfield, who often interviews her subjects for hours at a time, doesn\u2019t shy from emotional inquiries into her own inadequacies as a mother. In one clip, a 16-year-old Noah tells Ms. Greenfield that because she was so often away on assignments, Mr. Evers did the bulk of raising him, and that \u201cthe damage has already been done.\u201dBoth Mr. Evers and Ms. Greenfield were initially reluctant to include her story in the film. \u201cBut Lauren realized that she herself was very much a part of this wealth culture,\u201d Mr. Evers said. \u201cShe wanted audiences to realize they were complicit, too.\u201d Ms. Greenfield became more comfortable with appearing in her own work after trying it in a 2014 ad she created for the feminine-care brand Always. The spot featured the director interviewing children about gender stereotypes, showing how the phrase \u201clike a girl\u201d \u2014 as in \u201crun like a girl\u201d or \u201cfight like a girl\u201d \u2014 transforms into an insult as kids age. The campaign has become Ms. Greenfield\u2019s most-watched product, after airing during the 2015 Super Bowl and amassing more than 200 million views.\u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d which Ms. Greenfield has also turned into a traveling museum exhibition, doubles as a retrospective and a farewell to her focus on still photography. \u201cPrint is dying,\u201d she said, and magazines are commissioning fewer shoots, unable to finance the weeks of travel that her style of reportage requires. In the future, she said, she will concentrate on documentaries. Her next project is with Showtime; Ms. Greenfield would reveal only that it is set in Asia.Her current film ends with a dose of unexpected brightness, returning to characters who have forsaken their love of money for actual, human love. But ultimately, the takeaway from Ms. Greenfield\u2019s decades of work seems to be that it\u2019s up to future generations to decide how to spend their money \u2014 and if you ask her son Noah for his take, the kids are not all right.\u201cThat\u2019s what I realized from the film,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are spending like nobody cares, and that\u2019s exactly how it was in 2008.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veteran, Maverick, Candidate: Key Moments of John McCain\u2019s Public Life", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. McCain was frequently referred to as a \u201cmaverick,\u201d an image he cultivated to advance his political goals, including two failed presidential runs. After those defeats, he became known as a conservative lion of the Senate, who \u2014 despite his famous temper \u2014 believed that partisan disputes and civility could coexist in Washington.Here is a look at Mr. McCain\u2019s public history.Mr. McCain became a high-profile prisoner of war after his Navy plane was shot down over Hanoi in 1967. The son of the commander of American forces in the Pacific, he was held in North Vietnam\u2019s \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d prison complex for five and a half years.Injuries he suffered at the hands of torturers left him with lifelong physical disabilities, but Mr. McCain turned down an offer of early release because he did not want to harm morale among his fellow prisoners or give North Vietnam a propaganda coup.In the wake of the scandal, Mr. McCain made campaign finance reform one of his signature issues. For several years, he worked alongside Senator Russ Feingold, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, to pass the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. Also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, it banned large campaign contributions to national party committees but permitted them to outside groups.Mr. McCain\u2019s long-shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 was propelled largely by his reputation for personal integrity and candor (he called his campaign bus \u201cthe Straight Talk Express\u201d). But it fell apart after a brutal and racially charged primary fight in South Carolina.The whisper campaign helped George W. Bush gain an edge over Mr. McCain, although he denied involvement in the attacks. Mr. McCain dropped out of the race in March 2000 after his loss in South Carolina was compounded by a string of disappointments on Super Tuesday.Mr. McCain won his party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2008 but failed to match the charisma of the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and to respond to the outbreak of the financial crisis that spawned the great recession.He chose Sarah Palin, then the Alaska governor, as his running mate, a bid to inject energy into his campaign that backfired. Ms. Palin\u2019s inexperience raised questions about Mr. McCain\u2019s judgment and highlighted the fact that at 71 he would have been the oldest president to take office.But he returned to bipartisanship as the political environment became more polarized. He worked with a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of Eight, in a failed push for immigration reform and opposed Republican efforts to change the Affordable Care Act by threatening a government shutdown.Mr. McCain had a strained relationship with Donald J. Trump, who mocked his military service and time as a prisoner of war when he told an audience in 2015: \u201cHe is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201dMr. McCain endorsed Mr. Trump in 2016, saying he would respect the will of primary voters, but withdrew that endorsement after a video surfaced on which Mr. Trump bragged about sexual assault. Mr. McCain said that neither he nor his wife would vote for Mr. Trump.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Belgium Has a New Fee for Journalists. The Media Is Not Amused.", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Journalists who cover the regular gatherings of the leaders of European Union countries got a rude surprise this week from the Belgian government: Most of them will have to pay for the right to do their jobs.Before they are allowed to cover European Council summit meetings in Brussels, journalists have to undergo background checks conducted by the countries where they live. Naturally, the largest number of them, about 1,000, live in Belgium, where the European Union is headquartered, and a new law there requires the journalists to reimburse the government for the cost of the checks \u2014 50 euros, or about $58, for a credential that lasts for six months.The press corps here is not amused.\u201cThis is unprecedented and completely unacceptable,\u201d said Tom Weingaertner, president of the International Press Association in Brussels. \u201cThe state is in charge of ensuring security and press freedom and we are not prepared to pay twice for this,\u201d referring to reporters who already pay Belgian taxes as residents.\u201cThere is no other democratic country, as far as we are aware of, that is asking for a similar fee,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a restriction of press freedom and it sets a very big precedent.\u201dNATO, which is also based in Brussels, said it is not sure whether the fee will also apply to credentialing for its summit meetings.\u201cThe taxation rage in Belgium is incredible,\u201d said Jean Quatremer, a French journalist who has covered the European Union in Brussels for over two decades. He described the country as \u201ca dysfunctional state\u201d where citizens do not feel any ownership of the notoriously clogged public administration.\u201cAll the expatriates living in Belgium can speak of how the Belgian government complicates their work in general,\u201d he added.\u201cOf course the government will retreat and say \u2018Oh, we\u2019re sorry, we hadn\u2019t foreseen this,\u2019 but it shows to what extent this country, which has done everything to have all the common institutions of the E.U. here in Brussels, has still not understood that it is the capital of Europe.\u201dThe fee imposes a particular burden on freelancers, who represent a large part of the international press corps in Brussels, and small media companies. They may have to reassess whether they can afford to keep covering the institutions.It does not apply to journalists who live outside Belgium but go there to cover European Union or NATO meetings; their countries do not charge for their background checks. (Similarly, journalists covering the White House must undergo background checks, but do not pay for them.)Several journalists\u2019 associations said they wrote a letter of complaint to the Belgian government on Tuesday, objecting to being included in the fee system.A press officer for the European Council, Romain Sadet, said that Belgian authorities had only notified council officials of the law after it passed Parliament in February. Despite several expressions of concern by the council about press freedom and discrimination against small news organizations, he said, \u201cwe are not aware of any changes in the position of the Belgian authorities or its legislation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Ex-Lawyer, Investigated for Bank Fraud Over $20 Million", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal authorities investigating whether President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, committed bank and tax fraud have zeroed in on well over $20 million in loans obtained by taxi businesses that he and his family own, according to people familiar with the matter.Investigators are also examining whether Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance or other laws by helping to arrange financial deals to secure the silence of women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump. The inquiry has entered the final stage and prosecutors are considering filing charges by the end of August, two of the people said.Any criminal charges against Mr. Cohen would deal a significant blow to the president. Mr. Cohen, 52, worked for the president\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, for more than a decade. He was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal and visible aides and called himself the president\u2019s personal lawyer after Mr. Trump took office.The bank loans under scrutiny, the total of which has not been previously reported, came from two financial institutions in the New York region that have catered to the taxi industry, Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union, according to business records and people with knowledge of the matter, including a banker who reviewed the transactions.Federal investigators in New York are seeking to determine whether Mr. Cohen misrepresented the value of his assets to obtain the loans, which exceed $20 million.They are also examining how he handled the income from his taxi medallions and whether he failed to report it to the Internal Revenue Service.The two lenders were cited in the search warrants for raids that federal agents conducted this spring on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, home and a hotel room where he was staying, several of the people familiar with the matter have said.Sterling received a grand jury subpoena seeking records related to the loans, one of the people said.There is no indication that either bank suffered a loss as a result of the loans or that Mr. Cohen missed payments, which are ordinarily important aspects in a bank fraud case. While bank fraud without a loss is rarely charged on its own, it is sometimes charged in conjunction with other crimes, which may be what happens in Mr. Cohen\u2019s case.At this late stage of the inquiry, it is still possible that Mr. Cohen may plead guilty rather than face an indictment. He has hinted publicly and has stated explicitly in private that he is eager to tell prosecutors what he knows in exchange for leniency.A cooperation agreement would likely include a provision that Mr. Cohen also provide information to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating possible involvement by the Trump campaign in Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.It is unclear whether the prosecutors and Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers have had detailed discussions about a potential cooperation deal, but it is unlikely that the government would bring charges without having done so.But if a plea deal is not reached, either because Mr. Cohen and prosecutors cannot agree on the terms or because prosecutors determine he does not have valuable information or is not credible, the government would likely seek to bring charges well before the midterm elections.If the matter is not finalized by the end of August, prosecutors probably will wait until after the election, one of the people familiar with the inquiry said in recent weeks. That schedule would conform with the Justice Department\u2019s informal policy of avoiding bringing politically sensitive cases that could influence voters close to an election.Mr. Cohen and his lawyers declined to comment on the investigation when contacted over the weekend and last week.Federal officials in New York and Washington also would not comment.The investigation began under Mr. Mueller, who then referred the evidence to the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan. That office is now leading the inquiry along with the F.B.I. and I.R.S., which have conducted an extensive review of Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal business activities.Days after the search, Mr. Cohen went to court in an attempt to limit the evidence prosecutors could review, claiming much of what was seized was covered by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Trump joined the effort.During that litigation, prosecutors revealed that they had been investigating Mr. Cohen for fraud for \u201cmonths\u201d and had previously obtained a search warrant for his email accounts.At the time, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers came to view the investigation into Mr. Cohen as more dangerous to the Trump presidency than Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.In recent decades, Mr. Cohen has had a wide range of personal business interests, in addition to his work for the Trump Organization. He was a real estate investor, had a personal injury law practice and was involved with a gambling boat in Florida.But federal investigators appear to be especially focused on his work as an investor in taxi medallions, the permits that drivers need to legally operate yellow cabs in New York City.A review of court filings, business and property records and interviews with people with knowledge of the matter has provided the clearest picture to date of the scope of that inquiry.The search warrants for the Cohen raids sought records and communications relating to the two financial institutions, Sterling National Bank and the Melrose Credit Union, as well as documents regarding the payments to women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, among other materials, several people with knowledge of the inquiry have said.The investigation into possible bank fraud has focused at least in part on a series of loans for more than $20 million that the two institutions made in December 2014, according to a review of business records and interviews with people with knowledge of the matter.Publicly filed financing statements indicate that Mr. Cohen used 32 taxi medallions as collateral for the Sterling loans. The medallions were then valued at more than $1 million each, and generated more than $1 million a year in income.The loans were made to 16 separate companies controlled by Mr. Cohen and his family, each company owning two taxi medallions, the person who reviewed the transactions said. Mr. Cohen and his wife also personally guaranteed the loans, according to the filings.The tax fraud aspect of the investigation has been focused in part on whether Mr. Cohen properly reported the income from the medallions, which was sometimes in cash, people with knowledge of the matter said.One witness who could provide evidence about the possible bank and tax fraud is Evgeny Freidman, Mr. Cohen\u2019s longtime friend and former business associate who began cooperating with federal prosecutors this spring.Mr. Freidman, known as the Taxi King for his once vast and longtime holdings in that industry, managed taxi medallions owned by Mr. Cohen and his family between 2012 and 2018. In 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman, a lawyer who was disbarred earlier this year, had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. New York City regulators have barred him from continuing to manage medallions.Mr. Freidman was facing up to 25 years in prison in an unrelated state fraud case in Albany involving his taxi business. But he struck a deal with state prosecutors under which he avoided prison in return for cooperating with federal authorities investigating Mr. Cohen.Several people with knowledge of the matter have said investigators are focusing, in part, on precisely what was done with the monthly payments of the income from the taxi medallions that Mr. Freidman made to Mr. Cohen, what representations Mr. Cohen made to the banks about those payments, and whether they were reported on Mr. Cohen\u2019s taxes.Mr. Freidman\u2019s lawyer, Patrick J. Egan, said on Friday, \u201cIt would be against Mr. Freidman\u2019s interest to make a public statement regarding an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201dAndrew MacMillan, a spokesman for Sterling, declined to comment, and a spokesman for Melrose did not respond to a message seeking comment.A Long Island accountant who worked for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Freidman could also provide testimony about the payments, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The accountant, Jeffrey A. Getzel, has testified before the grand jury hearing evidence against Mr. Cohen.Mr. Getzel\u2019s lawyer, Peter J. Larkin, declined to comment.It is unclear whether prosecutors might seek to charge Mr. Cohen with conduct related to the presidential campaign or his work for Mr. Trump.Legal experts have said that the payments to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump could become part of a campaign finance case. Neither woman, after being paid, spoke publicly about Mr. Trump in the weeks before the election.The audio was not protected by attorney-client privilege, and Mr. Davis said at the time he released it to contradict a claim that Mr. Giuliani made about what Mr. Cohen had said on the recording.The company, which publishes The National Enquirer, bought the rights to her story and declined to publish it, a practice known in the tabloid industry as \u201ccatch and kill.\u201dCorporations are prohibited from spending money to influence campaigns in coordination with candidates.Prosecutors could also charge that a $130,000 payment to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, better known by her stage name of Stormy Daniels, was improper.Mr. Cohen, who once said that he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Mr. Trump, also hinted he might help prosecutors during an interview on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d in July, saying \u201cI put family and country first.\u201d\u201cTo be crystal clear,\u201d he added, \u201cmy wife, my daughter and my son, and this country, have my first loyalty.\u201dJim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Partisanship, Parasites, and Polarization", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre direct-marketing scams destroying the republic? A serious question.Opinion ColumnistAnd lately I\u2019ve been wondering if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to America. How much of our political sickness is the result of a parasitic infection? What I have in mind specifically is an infestation of direct-marketing scams that exploit and reinforce political partisanship, largely on the right, basically to sell merchandise. I\u2019ll come back to that. First, some notes on political economy.As Olson pointed out, the same goes for political action. Just because a political candidate\u2019s victory would be good for, say, farmers doesn\u2019t mean that farmers will give him or her money; each individual farmer will have an incentive to free ride on everyone else\u2019s contributions. So political action is normally undertaken by individuals or small, organized groups that stand to benefit directly. Either that, or it\u2019s a byproduct of other activities that are advantageous for their own reasons and can also be harnessed for political action, like memberships in trade associations or unions.So a lot of political action is driven by people trying to shape policy in a way that benefits them personally. But what the Shapiro/brain pills story drives home to me is that there\u2019s another important factor in our current political scene: the use of political action as a marketing ploy, by people out to make a buck selling stuff that has little to do with politics per se. Dear Reader, I\u2019m going to tell you something, but you must promise to keep it quiet. You have to understand that the \u201celite\u201d would not be at all happy with me if they knew what I was about to tell you. That\u2019s why we have to tread carefully. You see, while most people are paying attention to the stock market, the banks, brokerages and big institutions have their money somewhere else . . . [in] what I call the hidden money mountain . . . All you have to know is the insider\u2019s code (which I\u2019ll tell you) and you could make an extra $6,000 every single month. And some of the most influential voices on the right haven\u2019t just sold advertising space to purveyors of snake oil, they\u2019ve gotten directly into the snake-oil business themselves.Thus:  Why should marketing scams be linked to political extremism? It\u2019s all about affinity fraud: once you establish a persona that appeals to angry, aging white guys, you can sell them stuff that will supposedly protect their virility, their waistline, and their wealth. Now, normally we think of individuals\u2019 views and interests as the forces driving politics, including the ugly polarization increasingly dominating the scene. The commercial exploitation of that polarization, if we mention it at all, is treated as a sort of surface phenomenon that feeds off the fundamental dynamic. But are we sure that\u2019s right? The Alex Joneses, Ben Shapiros, and Fox Newses of the world couldn\u2019t profit from extremism unless there were some underlying predisposition of angry old white guys to listen to this stuff. But maybe the commercial exploitation of political anger is what has concentrated and weaponized that anger. In other words, going back to where I started this essay, maybe the reason we\u2019re in a political nightmare is that our political behavior has, in effect, been parasitized by marketing algorithms. Anyway, I think it\u2019s really important to realize the extent to which peddling political snake oil, whether it\u2019s about the economy, race, the effects of immigration, or whatever, is to an important extent a way to peddle actual snake oil: magic pills that will let you lose weight without ever feeling hungry and restore your youthful manhood.

{"Headline": "Kushner Companies and Michael Cohen Accused of Falsifying Building Permits to Push Out Tenants", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles Kushner, the developer whose son Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to President Trump, and Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal lawyer, face scrutiny in New York for claims that they falsified construction permits in an attempt to remove rent-regulated tenants from buildings scattered across the city.On Monday, the city\u2019s Department of Buildings cited Kushner Companies for 42 violations in which it submitted false permit information at 17 buildings, where many of the tenants were protected from steep rent increases and eviction. The fines total $210,000.A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies said Monday that the violations were \u201cpaperwork errors.\u201d The company can contest the citations before an administrative judge. \u201cIn no case did the company act in disregard of the safety of our tenants,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Christine Taylor.Tenant activists also issued a report on Monday based on city and state records that suggested that an investment group led by Mr. Cohen had also falsified construction permits by claiming that three buildings in Manhattan were vacant or without rent-regulated tenants, when they were occupied and many tenants had rental protections.Landlords are required in New York City to disclose whether tenants in their buildings are rent regulated to obtain a construction permit. This requirement is designed to safeguard rent-regulated tenants from harassment. Unscrupulous landlords sometimes push out rent-protected tenants so they can sharply increase rents on those units.Critics, however, complain that numerous violations slip through the cracks between the separate data systems used by city and state agencies.At 172 Rivington Street, for example, the Cohen group indicated that there were no rent-regulated tenants in the 20-unit building, after the company purchased it in October 2011 for $2.1 million. But records indicated that there were 19 protected tenants there, but only 11 remained after the Cohen group sold the building three years later for $10 million.Tenants living in Mr. Cohen\u2019s buildings repeatedly filed complaints about noise and dust related to construction work, according to the report by Housing Rights Initiative, a nonprofit tenant advocacy group.The Cohen group held the buildings for only a few years and then sold them for a combined $17 million profit.Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.The tenant group issued a similar report about the Kushners in the spring after sifting through public records from the Department of Buildings, the Finance Department and the state\u2019s Homes and Community Renewal agency, which oversees rent-regulated tenants. Up until 2015, when the city and state agencies formed a Tenant Harassment Task Force, there had been little coordination among them.Neither Mr. Cohen nor the Kushner Companies have been cited for tenant harassment.Aaron Carr, executive director of Housing Rights Initiative, said that the group\u2019s analysis \u201csuggests that Mr. Cohen had commenced a deliberate campaign to systematically harass tenants out of their apartments using destructive, hazardous and illegal construction practices, so he could dramatically raise rents.\u201dBut the report also provides a \u201cwindow into the dysfunction at city and state agencies,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Department of Buildings approved falsified permits,\u201d he said, \u201cdespite receiving complaints from tenants in those very same buildings.\u201dRecords indicate a steep decrease in the number of rent-regulated tenants in the buildings owned by Mr. Cohen and the Kushners.But the city would not know whether some number of tenants were paid cash by the landlord to leave, a common practice used by building owners to empty apartments.Mr. Cohen purchased 237 Henry Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for $3.35 million in August 2013. Construction work in the building commenced almost immediately. The new owners claimed on permit applications that the building was vacant, although all 20 apartments in the building were occupied by rent-regulated tenants.After the Cohen group sold the building for $9 million, records indicate there were five rent-regulated tenants left.Advertisement"}

Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wants to make sure Democrats emphasize bread-and-butter issues like the rise in prescription drug prices. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m not looking for is retribution,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get to regular order, I swear to God.\u201dEarlier this month, after the ProPublica revelation that Mar-a-Lago members were dictating Veterans Affairs policy, the House Democrats Julia Brownley and Annie Kuster wrote a letter calling for an investigation by the department\u2019s inspector general. \u201cTaxpayers want to know that their tax dollars are going to high-quality care for our nation\u2019s heroes, not to line the pockets or egos of President Trump\u2019s billionaire boys club,\u201d Brownley said at the time. In a Democratic House, Brownley and Kuster would be in line to run key Veterans Affairs subcommittees, where they\u2019ll be in a position to demand answers. \u201cThe goal, obviously, will be to get to the truth,\u201d said Brownley.Cummings, meanwhile, said he plans a two-lane process, combining attention to national issues that transcend Trump with scrutiny of the administration. \u201cWe are in a fight for the soul of our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I understand that for me to effectively do that second lane that I just talked about \u2014 voting rights and all those good things, prescription drugs \u2014 I need to have the democracy intact.\u201d The Trump administration, he said, needs to be exposed, which might mean hearings into the way Trump is profiting off the presidency, or on abuses of the security clearance process. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to have to do is try to create a new but appropriate sense of what is normal,\u201d Cummings said. Over the last 19 months, we\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cThis is not normal\u201d a lot. If Democrats lose in November, it will remain an impotent mantra of the resistance. If they win, it becomes an accusation backed by subpoena power. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Trump Administration Is Remaking the Courts", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "FeatureThanks to ruthless discipline \u2014 and a plan long in the making \u2014 the G.O.P is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary.Supported byThe Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, as it is officially known, has played a crucial role in putting conservative jurists on the bench. As White House counsel, McGahn is responsible for helping Trump select his judicial nominees. And, as he explained in his speech that November afternoon, he had drawn up two lists of potential judicial appointments. The first list consisted of \u201cmainstream folks, not a big paper trail, the kind of folks that will get through the Senate and will make us feel good that we put some pragmatic folks on the bench.\u201d The second list was made up of \u201csome folks that are kind of too hot for prime time, the kind that would be really hot in the Senate, probably people who have written a lot, we really get a sense of their views \u2014 the kind of people that make some people nervous.\u201d The first list, McGahn said, Trump decided to \u201cthrow in the trash.\u201d The second list Trump resolved \u201cto put before the U.S. Senate\u201d for a confirmation vote. The president, McGahn assured his audience, was \u201cvery committed to what we are committed to here, which is nominating and appointing judges that are committed originalists and textualists.\u201dAs White House counsel, McGahn has exercised an unprecedented degree of control over judicial appointments. In previous White Houses, both Republican and Democrat, judicial nominations were typically crowdsourced among officials from different parts of the administration. Under George W. Bush, for instance, there was a judicial-selection committee made up of people from the offices of the White House counsel, political affairs and legislative affairs, as well as officials from the Justice Department. This tended to produce a leveling effect. \u201cYou killed nominees by committee,\u201d says one Republican involved in judicial confirmations. Under Trump, the job belongs exclusively to the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, with McGahn and his deputy, Robert Luther, and about 10 associate counsels identifying and then scrutinizing candidates. This process is unique in White House history. Instead of engaging in the typical legislative horse-trading for nominating judges \u2014 promising a senator, for instance, that the president will support the nomination of the lawyer who served as the senator\u2019s campaign-finance chairman in exchange for a yes vote on the administration\u2019s agriculture bill \u2014 the Trump White House has given the counsel\u2019s office near-absolute authority. In a White House known for chaos and dysfunction, the counsel\u2019s office, under McGahn, is generally viewed as an island of competence. \u201cThe White House is like a Dante\u2019s \u2018Inferno\u2019-strange comedy,\u201d says one leading conservative lawyer who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, \u201cbut the people in the counsel\u2019s office are like the A-Team.\u201d That many of the lawyers in the counsel\u2019s office are also Federalist Society members \u2014 as elite Republican lawyers today often are \u2014 has given McGahn a handy rebuttal to the complaint that Trump has outsourced his judicial-selection process to the group. \u201cFrankly,\u201d McGahn has said, \u201cit seems like it\u2019s been insourced.\u201dWhile Trump has lagged behind other presidents in political appointments, the streamlining of the judicial-selection process has helped him deliver a historic number of judges to the federal bench. In 2017, the Senate confirmed 12 of Trump\u2019s appeals court picks \u2014 the most for any president in his first year in office. This year, the Senate has already confirmed 12 appellate judges and, according to a Republican Judiciary Committee aide, hopes to confirm at least four more. The White House refers to every new batch of judicial appointees Trump selects as \u201cwaves\u201d \u2014 in early June, it announced the \u201cFifteenth Wave of Judicial Nominees\u201d\u2014 as if they\u2019re soldiers landing on the beaches of Normandy.Trump\u2019s appointees have tended to be unusually well credentialed and conservative. Republicans like to emphasize their academic and professional bona fides \u2014 the summa cum laudes, the Phi Beta Kappas, the Supreme Court clerks \u2014 and jokingly celebrate their \u201cdeep bench\u201d of candidates. Democrats, for their part, prefer to focus on the appointees\u2019 ideology. \u201cIf someone had said or written something half as controversial as these Trump nominees, they never would have been picked by President George W. Bush,\u201d says Kristine Lucius, a former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee aide and now the executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cWhat once would have been disqualifying\u201d \u2014 a nominee\u2019s stated views on contraception or gay rights or consumer protection \u2014 \u201cis now motivating this president.\u201d Or perhaps, the nominees\u2019 views are what\u2019s motivating many conservatives to go along with Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 which is what\u2019s motivating Trump.When it comes to Trump\u2019s judicial appointments, the public has been understandably focused on the Supreme Court, with first Neil Gorsuch and now Brett Kavanaugh receiving most of the attention. When one of Trump\u2019s lower-court nominees has managed to penetrate public consciousness, it has usually been an outlier, like Brett Talley, whom Trump picked last year for an Alabama Federal District Court judgeship. Talley, who had never tried a case and whom the American Bar Association rated unanimously \u201cnot qualified,\u201d ultimately withdrew his nomination after it was discovered that he was a member of a ghost-hunting group and had apparently defended the honor of the early Ku Klux Klan on an Alabama Crimson Tide football fan message board.More representative of Trump\u2019s judicial appointees are judges like James C. Ho. Born in Taiwan, Ho moved to the United States as a toddler. He graduated from Stanford and the University of Chicago law school before going on to clerk for Clarence Thomas at the Supreme Court. After working in George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department, he succeeded Ted Cruz as Texas solicitor general. Ho is as pure a product as exists of the conservative legal movement created by the Federalist Society. Last October, Trump nominated Ho to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In December, he was confirmed by the Senate. And in April, Ho issued his first opinion \u2014 a blistering dissent in a campaign-finance case after a Fifth Circuit appellate panel ruled, 12 to 2, that the City of Austin, Tex., could prohibit individuals from donating more than $350 per election to municipal candidates. Ho used his dissent not only to voice his disapproval of campaign-finance laws but also to criticize those that regulated gun purchases and protected abortion; he even threw in a swipe, in a citation, at the Supreme Court\u2019s Obamacare ruling. Lamenting a government that has grown so large that it \u201cwould be unrecognizable to our founders,\u201d Ho wrote: \u201cIf there is too much money in politics, it\u2019s because there\u2019s too much government. The size and scope of government makes such spending essential.\u201dTo be sure, Ho\u2019s was a dissenting opinion, but what so cheered members of the conservative legal movement is that it was likely the first of many, because Ho is only 45. And because there will be more and more judges like Ho on the federal bench, it\u2019s only a matter of time before such opinions will no longer be dissents. Indeed, after just 18 months, Trump has \u201cflipped\u201d two circuits \u2014 the Sixth and Seventh \u2014 from what Trump\u2019s supporters in the conservative legal movement consider \u201cliberal\u201d to more properly conservative. Two more \u2014 the Eighth and the 11th \u2014 are on the verge of tipping. Even circuits that are decidedly liberal are undergoing significant changes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really important for the Second and the Ninth Circuits to have between two and four really good, high-octane intellectual conservative jurists,\u201d explains a person close to the judicial-nominations process, \u201cbecause dissents provide a signaling function to the U.S. Supreme Court, and those are very important circuits.\u201dIn short, a radically new federal judiciary could be with us long after Trump is gone. Brian Fallon, a veteran Democratic operative who leads Demand Justice, a group formed to help Democrats with research and communications in the judicial wars, says, \u201cWe can win back the House this November, we can defeat Trump in 2020 and we\u2019ll still be dealing with the lingering effects of Trumpism for the next 30 or 40 years because of the young Trump-appointed judges.\u201dAnd if Trump is re-elected? Newt Gingrich, who during the 2016 campaign began emphasizing the importance of judges to Trump, posits: \u201cHe could, by the end of his time in office, be the most important president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in shaping the judiciary.\u201dBut by the time the Republican presidential primaries began in early 2016, Leo\u2019s thinking about Trump had evolved. Trump, by then, had established himself as a plausible candidate, maybe even a front-runner. That March, Leo was part of a small group of Washington Republicans, including Gingrich and the Heritage Foundation president at the time, Jim DeMint, who met with Trump for a lunch at the Jones Day law firm, where McGahn was a partner. When the meal was over, Leo, McGahn and Trump broke off from the larger group for a private meeting. Reaching into his suit-jacket pocket, Leo presented Trump with a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that McGahn had asked him to bring \u2014 a combination of federal judges and State Supreme Court justices who Leo believed would be suitable successors to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died the previous month.\u201cI was really hoping for 12,\u201d Trump told him.\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got eight,\u201d Leo replied.\u201cCan\u2019t we find more?\u201d Trump asked.\u201cWe can try,\u201d Leo pledged.Trump, Leo recalls, had a question about the State Supreme Court justices on Leo\u2019s list: Do they make \u201cthe final decision\u201d? Leo explained that sometimes they do and sometimes they don\u2019t, depending on whether the issue before them involves the United States Constitution. He asked why Trump wanted to know. \u201cBecause when you have to make a final decision, and it is the real final decision, you own it,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cAnd like a businessman, when you own something that you do, you take it very seriously, and it has consequences.\u201d\u201cIt was an interesting insight that I hadn\u2019t really thought of,\u201d Leo told me. We were sitting at Morton\u2019s, the venerable Washington steakhouse, where Leo, an owlish man in his 50s who wears a pocket watch, keeps a wine locker. \u201cIt was, I think, the best conversation I have ever had in my professional life with a Republican presidential candidate on the issue of judges,\u201d he marveled.It\u2019s hard to take that claim at face value. In 2016 alone, Leo discussed judges with Jeb Bush \u2014 who, as governor of Florida, appointed more than 100 of them \u2014 and Ted Cruz, who clerked for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, argued nine cases in front of the Supreme Court and himself is a member of the Federalist Society. A mere two weeks after Trump shared his insights about the judiciary with Leo, he told an interviewer that he planned to appoint Supreme Court justices who \u201cwould look very seriously at her\u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2014 \u201cemail disaster.\u201d A few months after that, Trump promised a group of congressional Republicans that he would protect \u201cArticle XII\u201d of the Constitution \u2014 an article that doesn\u2019t exist.Trump might not have known much about the law, but he needed, as Gingrich told me, to create the impression that he \u201cwould be reliable in terms of conservative judges, because that would calm down and consolidate a very large bloc of his coalition.\u201d That is, what mattered to the Federalist Society \u2014 and the Heritage Foundation \u2014 was that Trump take their advice on judicial nominees. In an interview with Breitbart in June 2016, Trump pledged, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by Federalist Society.\u201dLeo also figured out what mattered to Trump. \u201cLeonard is smart,\u201d says David Lat, the founding editor of the influential legal website Above the Law and a former Federalist Society member. \u201cHe knows the way to Trump\u2019s heart is through his ego.\u201d And perhaps his pocketbook. In May, McClatchy reported that a mysterious $1 million donation to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee in December 2016 \u2014 made by a company called BH Group L.L.C. that was apparently formed to hide the source of the donation \u2014 was tied to Leo. (When I asked him about the McClatchy report, Leo declined to comment.) \u201cLeonard had an instinct,\u201d Gingrich says, \u201cthat this could be the great opportunity to redevelop conservatism on the courts.\u201dFor most of the organization\u2019s first three decades, its dominant philosophical emphasis was on judicial restraint: the idea that judges shouldn\u2019t overrule majority-passed, democratically enacted laws \u2014 that they shouldn\u2019t, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky, a Pomona College professor and the author of the 2015 book \u201cIdeas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution,\u201d puts it, \u201cmove the law too far, too fast.\u201d This philosophy emerged largely as a reaction to liberal rulings by the Warren and Burger courts \u2014 as well as those of lower-court judges \u2014 who, conservatives complained, tried to \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d on civil rights and civil liberties. But within the Federalist Society and the larger conservative legal movement, there was an emerging faction that favored a more aggressive approach. These libertarian legal theorists, led by the Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett, subscribed to the judicial philosophies of originalism and textualism, which hold that judges should interpret the Constitution according to the meaning of its plain text, instead of its intent or purpose, and, more important, should not hesitate to overturn any law that deviates from that text.Originalists and textualists gave intellectual and theoretical ballast to this approach in the academy. But they didn\u2019t achieve critical mass in the larger conservative legal movement until 2012, when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing the majority opinion. \u201cConservatives were so disappointed they had to stop and think, How did this happen?\u201d says Barnett, who helped mount the challenge to the constitutionality of Obamacare by invoking the commerce clause. \u201cAnd how did it happen at the hands of a chief justice who was a Bush appointee and who had been signed off on by the Federalist Society?\u201d The conservative legal movement\u2019s long-held devotion to judicial restraint began to founder. \u201cNow the situation has reversed itself,\u201d Barnett told me. \u201cThe originalism side, and invalidating laws if they\u2019re unconstitutional, has the upper hand.\u201dCritics of the Federalist Society contend that the group actually favors judicial activism: Judges who will take a stance on social issues, particularly on abortion. Many of the group\u2019s members question the legal basis for Roe v. Wade and whether a right to privacy exists in the Constitution, as Roe held it does. Leo was hailed by the conservative legal activist and writer Ed Whelan in National Review in 2016 for being \u201cmore dedicated to the enterprise of building a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade\u201d than anyone else in the United States. Yet Leo accuses Democrats of \u201cscare tactics\u201d when they charge that Trump seeks to appoint judges who will outlaw abortion. Similarly, Trump, who at one point during the 2016 campaign pledged that Roe would be overturned because he would put \u201cpro-life justices on the court,\u201d maintains that he did not bring up the topic of abortion in his interviews with Brett Kavanaugh.The Federalist Society \u2014 and the Trump administration \u2014 are more forthright about the ways in which they hope originalism and textualism may apply to other arenas, particularly government regulation. \u201cThe greatest threat to the rule of law in our modern society is the ever-expanding regulatory state,\u201d McGahn declared in his November speech to the Federalist Society, \u201cand the most effective bulwark against that threat is a strong judiciary.\u201d He added, \u201cRegulatory reform and judicial selection are so deeply connected.\u201d This idea is now at the heart of the Federalist Society, whose members believe that federal agencies have become an unaccountable \u201cfourth branch\u201d of government \u2014 and that their bureaucrats, oftentimes experts in their fields, should no longer be shown any deference by the courts in how they apply laws enacted by Congress, but should instead be restrained from doing anything beyond what the law, as Congress wrote it, stipulates. The originalists and textualists now favored by the Federalist Society and the Trump administration are decidedly disinclined to defer to executive-branch agencies, whether it\u2019s the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, when it comes to interpreting arguably (and often necessarily) ambiguous statutes about the environment or public health or workplace safety. Unless Congress explicitly mandates it, originalists and textualists believe, agencies can\u2019t do it.Gorsuch is said to have risen to the top of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court list in large part because of a 2016 concurring opinion he wrote as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in which he forcefully attacked what\u2019s known as \u201cChevron deference\u201d \u2014 a term that stems from a 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., that instructed courts to grant policymaking flexibility to government agencies. Similarly, Don Willett, whom Trump appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and who is on the president\u2019s Supreme Court list, became a Federalist Society favorite largely because of a 2015 concurring opinion he wrote as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. In Patel v. Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, Willett struck down a state licensing requirement that mandated 750 hours of training for eyebrow threaders, denouncing what he described as a \u201cnonsensical government encroachment\u201d on \u201coccupational freedom\u201d and economic liberty. And when the White House rolled out Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court in early July, it circulated a memo to business groups that, according to Politico, praised the 75 times Kavanaugh, as a Court of Appeals judge, overruled federal regulators on cases involving issues like clean air, consumer protection and net neutrality in order to protect \u201cAmerican businesses from illegal job-killing regulation.\u201d \u201cThe Federalist Society has embraced judicial activism,\u201d Hollis-Brusky says. \u201cThey\u2019re just calling it a different name.\u201dThe ascendant wing of the Federalist Society has, according to critics, effectively managed to change how Washington operates, by shifting power away from the executive and legislative branches and toward the courts. It also represents something of a long-term strategy by the Republican Party. \u201cBy appointing judges who\u2019ll narrowly interpret congressional regulations and statutes,\u201d Hollis-Brusky says, \u201cyou\u2019re gambling that you won\u2019t be in power politically but that your judges will be on the bench and take a more active role in shaping laws over the next 30 years.\u201dThe appellate courts are especially important in this effort. Although the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, its caseload, which was not huge to begin with, has become even smaller in recent years \u2014 declining from about 150 cases a term in 1980 to just 79 in the term that ended in June. The appeals courts, by contrast, collectively hear and decide thousands of cases each year. \u201cThe Courts of Appeals are the regional Supreme Courts of the nation,\u201d says Sheldon Goldman, a University of Massachusetts at Amherst professor and a scholar of the American judiciary, \u201cand are of greater importance, in many respects, than the Supreme Court.\u201d Nan Aron, the president of the liberal judicial group Alliance for Justice, says liberals don\u2019t always recognize the centrality of the appeals courts. \u201cThey\u2019re making the law of the land in critically important areas,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s not lost on the Republicans. That\u2019s why they have their eyes on the prize.\u201dAnd never have they been as focused as they have been under Trump, who, according to Randy Barnett, \u201chas made as good a selection of judges as any Republican president in my lifetime.\u201d Even Leo, who has enjoyed unrivaled influence for more than two decades, seems impressed by his \u2014 and the conservative legal movement\u2019s \u2014 good fortunes in the Trump era. \u201cThis administration,\u201d he said that afternoon at Morton\u2019s, \u201cis trying to hit as many triples and home runs as possible.\u201dFrom the moment Obama entered the White House, McConnell led Senate Republicans in a disciplined, sustained, at times underhanded campaign to deny the Democratic president the opportunity to appoint federal judges. McConnell\u2019s first move came six weeks after Obama\u2019s inauguration, in the form of a letter, signed by all 41 Republican senators, which warned the new president that if he did not consult with \u2014 and, more crucial, receive the approval of \u2014 home-state senators for his judicial nominees, then the Republicans would filibuster, insisting on 60 votes to end debate. \u201cThey were very clear from the beginning that they were going to make this as difficult and as partisan as possible,\u201d says Christopher Kang, who worked on judicial nominations in the Obama White House Counsel\u2019s Office.Republican approval would be conveyed by one of the Senate\u2019s many cherished procedural instruments known as a \u201cblue slip.\u201d The blue slip is literally a slip of paper that a senator returns to the Judiciary Committee signaling that a given nominee in his or her state should receive a hearing. First introduced in 1917, the blue slip has been accorded varying weights by different Judiciary Committee chairmen, but when Obama took office, the committee\u2019s chairman was Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. Leahy, a strong institutionalist and protector of the Senate\u2019s prerogatives, viewed the blue slip as something akin to a Holy Writ. If a home-state senator, a Republican or a Democrat, did not want a judicial nominee to have a hearing, Leahy would not schedule one \u2014 essentially putting a hold on the nomination. In doing so, Leahy told me, he was giving \u201creal meaning to \u2018advise and consent\u2019\u2009\u201d and ensuring that the Senate kept \u201cits institutional independence and didn\u2019t become a rubber stamp.\u201dEven without Leahy\u2019s strict blue-slip policy, Obama would probably still have sought Republican approval for his judges. He was less interested in making the judiciary more liberal than in making it more diverse. It was important, Obama once told The New Yorker, for minorities \u201cto see folks in robes that look like them.\u201d Surely, there were African-American, Latino, Asian, gay and female judges with moderate records and temperaments whom Republican senators could support. \u201cWe were in the business of picking judges,\u201d says Michael Zubrensky, a former Department of Justice official who worked on judicial nominations in the Obama administration, \u201cnot picking fights.\u201d The fundamental battles Obama wanted to wage with Republicans involved legislation, not a long game with the courts.When Republican senators dragged out their consultations with the Obama administration on judicial nominees, the Obama White House did not press them; when a blue slip was finally returned and the Judiciary Committee held a hearing and voted a nominee out of committee, Senate Democrats would often take their time before scheduling a floor vote, which Republicans would usually insist couldn\u2019t be held until after the maximum 30 hours of debate. \u201cJudges at that time were sort of an afterthought,\u201d recalls Brian Fallon, who was then an aide to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cIt was viewed as something you got around to scheduling when you were in between big pieces of legislation and you needed some filler on the floor.\u201dThe combination of Republican intransigence \u2014 \u201cYou had all of these nominees piling up on the calendar,\u201d Kang says, \u201cbecause Republicans felt any day without an Obama judge in place was a better day for them\u201d \u2014 and Democratic dawdling meant that even though Democrats enjoyed a Senate majority, Obama, several months into his second term, had more than 60 unfilled judicial vacancies that lacked even a nominee. \u201cIn retrospect, I think we all didn\u2019t react with enough alarm when it was happening,\u201d Fallon says. \u201cWe indulged it for far too long in the Obama years, and now our chickens are coming home to roost.\u201dThe issue came to a head in the fall of 2013 over three vacancies in particular \u2014 all of them on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Senate Republicans had been unable to prevent the nominees from receiving a hearing, because there were no home-state senators to withhold blue slips. But when the Senate\u2019s majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, brought each of the three nominees to the floor, Republican senators, who by then numbered 45, refused to give them a vote. The Republicans didn\u2019t object to the nominees themselves; all three were considered moderate and eminently qualified. Rather, the Republicans argued that the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s caseload was so meager that the judgeships should be eliminated. Reid decided to invoke what was known as the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d doing away with filibusters for most nominations by presidents, including those to the lower courts.With the filibuster for lower-court judicial nominations eliminated, Obama was able to score more than 100 judicial confirmations in just over a year. Then and now, Republicans denounced Reid\u2019s triggering of the nuclear option. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d Mitch McConnell warned in 2013, \u201cand you may regret this a lot sooner than you think.\u201d But with Leahy leading the Judiciary Committee, Republican senators, even without the filibuster, still maintained some leverage \u2014 and whenever possible, they used their blue slips to bottle up Obama\u2019s judicial nominations. Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, both Georgia Republicans, held up Jill Pryor\u2019s nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit for two years, finally returning their blue slips only after Obama agreed to nominate one of their picks to another 11th Circuit vacancy and three of their picks to district court judgeships. Democrats might have played hardball with the nuclear option, but they still shrank from a fight, either because they agreed with Leahy that the blue slip was an important procedural safeguard or because they didn\u2019t have the stomach to pressure him to change his stance.Republicans weren\u2019t as squeamish. After taking back the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, McConnell, now the majority leader, began a near blockade of Obama\u2019s judicial appointments. In Reagan\u2019s final two years in office, 66 of his district court and 15 of his appeals court nominees were confirmed. Clinton managed 57 and 13 in his last two years. George W. Bush had 58 and 10. In Obama\u2019s final two years, 18 of his district nominees and just one of his appellate court nominees were confirmed \u2014 the lowest number since Harry Truman was president.Although Proxmire and Nelson were both Democrats and a Democrat was president when the commission was created, the process also worked in times of divided government. In 2003, when Senate Democrats and George W. Bush were battling over his judicial nominees, Wisconsin\u2019s two Democratic senators, Herb Kohl and Russell Feingold, both supported Diane Sykes, Bush\u2019s choice for a Seventh Circuit seat. \u201cThere are a number of topics on which we do not see eye to eye,\u201d Feingold said in introducing Sykes at her Judiciary Committee hearing, but her \u201cnomination is the result of a collaborative bipartisan process.\u201d (Today, Sykes is on Trump\u2019s list of Supreme Court candidates.)To fill the Seventh Circuit vacancy in 2010, the commission recommended six candidates to replace Terence Evans, who was taking senior status. Kohl and Feingold forwarded the names to Obama for consideration. In July, Obama nominated Victoria Nourse, a University of Wisconsin law professor and former Senate Judiciary Committee staff member for Joe Biden. She was a fairly typical Obama nominee, in that she was a woman (42 percent of Obama\u2019s judges were women, the highest percentage of any president) and a moderate (besides working for Biden, Nourse worked on the Judiciary Committee with Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican). She was also typical in that the Obama administration and Senate Democrats didn\u2019t seem to afford her nomination much urgency. At the end of 2010, Nourse still had not been scheduled for a confirmation hearing.This would prove to be a problem when, in November of that year, Feingold lost his re-election campaign to Ron Johnson, a Republican businessman and Tea Party candidate. Although Feingold had returned his blue slip for Nourse, as well as for a nominee to a district court, Johnson, upon joining the Senate, essentially took them back. In Wisconsin, legal experts chalked up Johnson\u2019s move to inexperience. \u201cEverybody just assumed that once he got up to speed, he would see these were quality nominees and would support them,\u201d says Michelle Behnke, a former state bar president who served on the commission. But Johnson was simply adhering to the Washington Republican playbook, outlined by McConnell in his original letter about judges to Obama two years earlier. Nourse says she repeatedly sought a meeting with Johnson so he could review her credentials, but he rebuffed her entreaties and refused to return her blue slip. In early 2012, after 18 months of waiting, Nourse withdrew her nomination. Johnson, meanwhile, said he wanted Wisconsin to come up with a new system for recommending judges, but he and Kohl couldn\u2019t agree on what it would look like. The Obama administration declined to nominate anyone until they could.In 2012, Representative Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, was elected to succeed Kohl in the Senate. One of her first acts was to meet with Johnson to start filling Wisconsin\u2019s judicial vacancies. Johnson insisted on a new nominating commission with a different structure. No longer would the state bar or the state\u2019s law school deans participate, nor would a senator whose party was in the White House be able to appoint more members. Instead, the commission would consist of six members, three appointed by each senator. Under the commission\u2019s new rules, a judicial candidate needed five votes to be recommended for a judgeship; the commission was required to recommend four to six candidates. Baldwin agreed to Johnson\u2019s stipulations, and in April 2013, the commission was formed.The commission began soliciting applications for the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit seat in 2014, which by then had been vacant for more than four years. By the end of 2014, the commission had reviewed numerous applications for the position and interviewed eight candidates, but only two, a Madison lawyer named Don Schott and a Milwaukee Circuit Court judge named Rick Sankovitz, received the requisite five votes. Months later, when the commission was still at an impasse, Baldwin sent the White House the names of the eight candidates interviewed. Johnson and his commissioners cried foul. \u201cIn our view, there\u2019s no sense in which they were finalists,\u201d says Rick Esenberg, one of Johnson\u2019s commissioners.Rather than take advantage of the deadlock to nominate a \u201cfinalist\u201d of whom the commission\u2019s Republican members disapproved, the Obama administration sought to defuse tensions and quickly settled on Schott, one of two candidates who had received five votes, as its likely nominee. In late July 2015, the White House initiated Schott\u2019s F.B.I. background investigation and American Bar Association evaluation, which were concluded by early September. It stood to reason that Johnson would support Schott\u2019s nomination \u2014 after all, he had been recommended by the commission Johnson established \u2014 but the White House wanted to make sure before it went ahead with it. Johnson dragged his feet. First, according to a former government official familiar with the process, Johnson asked to see Schott\u2019s F.B.I. file. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any other instance in which a Senate office made that request\u201d before a nomination was made, the official says. When the Obama administration wouldn\u2019t give Johnson Schott\u2019s F.B.I. file, Johnson insisted on interviewing Schott himself. But then he didn\u2019t schedule an interview. Finally, Schott flew to Washington in early November to meet with Johnson. In January 2016, six years after the Seventh Circuit seat became vacant, Johnson told the White House that Schott was acceptable, and Schott was quickly nominated.Then came another round of delays. First, Johnson didn\u2019t return his blue slip for Schott until March. Next, Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, stalled on scheduling a confirmation hearing. Finally, in May, Schott was given a hearing. Baldwin appeared to introduce him and speak on his behalf to the committee. Johnson did not attend. Although he had returned his blue slip, he refused to offer Schott any support. \u201cI have recommended the committee consider it,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cWhat I am not going to do is publicly go out and make any other statements beyond that.\u201d Nonetheless, in June, the Judiciary Committee voted 13 to 7 to advance Schott\u2019s nomination. By now, however, there were only five months until the presidential election, and with McConnell already refusing to give Merrick Garland a hearing for his Supreme Court nomination, it seemed unlikely that he would schedule a floor vote for Schott. The White House and Baldwin pressed him; Johnson did nothing. In November, when Trump was elected and Johnson was re-elected, Schott still hadn\u2019t been given a vote. His nomination was dead.The most crucial procedural maneuver, however, involved the blue slip. When Grassley became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2015 after Republicans took back the Senate, he publicly indicated (in a column in The Des Moines Register) and privately said (in a conversation with Leahy, according to Leahy) that he would afford blue slips the same weight as his Democratic predecessor. If both home-state senators didn\u2019t return their blue slips, the nominee wouldn\u2019t receive a hearing. Sure enough, in Obama\u2019s final two years in the White House, Grassley denied hearings to four appellate court and five district court nominees who didn\u2019t receive blue slips. (A Grassley spokesman maintains that the nominees didn\u2019t receive hearings \u201csolely\u201d because of unreturned blue slips.) Although this benefited Republicans, it was viewed not as partisan but as principled; Grassley, in his sixth term and having just turned 80, was, like Leahy, an avowed institutionalist.Then, last November, 10 months into Trump\u2019s presidency, Grassley took to the Senate floor to announce that he had a new, more nuanced view of the blue slip. While he would be \u201cless likely\u201d to grant a hearing to a district court nominee who didn\u2019t have support of their home-state senators, he would no longer allow a home-state senator to \u201cwield veto power\u201d over appellate nominees. \u201cCircuit courts cover multiple states,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cThere\u2019s less reason to defer to the views of a single state\u2019s senator for such nominees.\u201dGrassley\u2019s decision to disregard blue slips worries Leahy, who contends that it eviscerates the Senate\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role. If a home-state senator can no longer put a hold on a nominee for an appellate judgeship, what\u2019s to stop a president from nominating a judge who isn\u2019t even from that state? \u201cDepending on who\u2019s in the majority and who\u2019s president,\u201d Leahy told me, \u201cthey might decide, \u2018We\u2019ve got to make this Texas court a little bit different, so we have this New Yorker who\u2019d make a good judge down there,\u2019 and nominate them and get them confirmed.\u201d As to whether he regrets adhering to that principle, Leahy said: \u201cThe only regret I have is that the Republicans haven\u2019t stuck to the position they claimed was the right position when there was a Democratic president. I\u2019m old-school. I believe in senators sticking to their commitments.\u201dGrassley maintains that he still takes the Senate\u2019s advise-and-consent role seriously. \u201cMy blue-slip policy is consistent with its traditional application as a way of promoting consultation with home-state senators,\u201d he told me in a statement. \u201cI find it a bit ironic that the same senators who opted to change the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule in 2013 to silence the voices of 41 senators are now calling for the ability of a single senator to obstruct the Senate\u2019s mere consideration of judicial nominees.\u201d According to a Republican Judiciary Committee aide, Grassley has required that McGahn show him consultation logs \u2014 a ticktock of every communication the White House Counsel\u2019s Office has with home-state senators about judicial nominations \u2014 to be assured that there\u2019s meaningful home-state consultation. But as Senate Democrats note, \u201cmeaningful consultation\u201d is in the eye of the beholder. \u201cWe\u2019ve never relied on a chairman\u2019s view of whether a senator was consulted before,\u201d one Democratic aide says. \u201cIt was up to the senator about whether they were consulted.\u201d Democrats charge that Grassley is not really concerned about the opinions of home-state senators. \u201cIf it\u2019s what Donald Trump wants, they\u2019re going to go along with it,\u201d Leahy says. \u201cThat seems to be the standard.\u201dWhile Grassley and the White House have sought the input of some Democratic senators on judicial nominations from their states \u2014 notably those in the Democratic leadership, like Chuck Schumer, Richard Durbin and Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee \u2014 they have, more often than not, steamrolled the rest of them.When Senator Al Franken of Minnesota announced in September that he wouldn\u2019t return his blue slip for David Stras, Trump\u2019s first choice for a seat on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, McGahn informed him that Stras would be nominated anyway. Then Grassley held a hearing for Stras, clearing the way for his confirmation. (Stras was confirmed in January, after Franken resigned; Franken\u2019s successor, Tina Smith, voted against him.)Similarly, Oregon\u2019s Democratic senators, Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, both refused to return their blue slips for Ryan Bounds, Trump\u2019s nominee for a judgeship on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Bounds had concealed newspaper columns he wrote as a Stanford undergraduate in the 1990s, in which he railed against \u201crace-focused groups\u201d on campus and likened the university\u2019s multicultural efforts to Nazi Germany. Nonetheless, Bounds received a Judiciary Committee hearing in June and was voted out of committee on an 11-to-10 party-line vote. His nomination was withdrawn minutes before a floor vote, when Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, announced that he wouldn\u2019t vote for Bounds on account of those columns.During the transition, Trump\u2019s advisers turned their attention to Wisconsin\u2019s Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacancy. Leonard Leo and several others recommended Mike Brennan for the spot. A Milwaukee lawyer and a founding member of that city\u2019s Federalist Society chapter, Brennan had been the chairman of an advisory committee that helped Gov. Scott Walker select his own state-level judges, many of whom had won plaudits from conservatives. In March 2017, seven weeks into Trump\u2019s presidency, the White House Counsel\u2019s Office interviewed Brennan for the appellate judgeship. This was somewhat awkward, because Johnson and Baldwin had intended to use their beleaguered commission to help fill the vacancy. Johnson prevailed upon the White House to hold off on making a nomination until the commission could review candidates, and in April it began accepting applications.Brennan applied. So, surprisingly, did Schott. According to those familiar with the commission\u2019s deliberations, which are confidential, Schott initially received the same five votes he did two years earlier, but when the Republican commissioners realized that Brennan had fallen short of the required five votes \u2014 receiving just four \u2014 two commissioners changed their votes, and Schott finished with just three. If in 2014 the commission was able to give Johnson and Baldwin only two names, this time it came up with zero. In June, Schott was invited to Washington to interview with the White House Counsel\u2019s Office. Five weeks later, Trump nominated Brennan for the vacancy.Johnson hailed the move, but Baldwin cried foul, noting that the commission hadn\u2019t recommended any candidates for the Seventh Circuit, nor did she believe that she had been sufficiently consulted by the White House Counsel\u2019s Office about Brennan. She said she wouldn\u2019t return her blue slip. But under Grassley\u2019s new blue-slip policy, that didn\u2019t matter. In January, the Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing for Brennan. Two weeks later, the committee approved Brennan\u2019s nomination 11 to 10 on a party-line vote. And in May, Brennan\u2019s nomination came before the full Senate, which approved it 49 to 46. After 3,044 days of sitting vacant, Terence Evans\u2019s Seventh Circuit seat was finally filled.Leo, McGahn and others have done a remarkable job of persuading the president that their intellectual judicial philosophy of originalism and textualism is in perfect sync with his visceral preferences that judges be \u201ccourageous\u201d and \u201cnot weak.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see how, in Trump\u2019s mind, declaring war on \u201cthe administrative state\u201d might dovetail neatly with his desire to go after the \u201cdeep state.\u201d \u201cA lot of the things that make Trump so loathsome as a person and a politician,\u201d David Lat notes, \u201care why he\u2019s been nominating judges who are such great conservatives.\u201dSo far, Trump appears to be pleased with the decisions of the judges he has appointed. In June, after the Supreme Court decided 5 to 4, with Gorsuch in the majority, that the president does have the authority to ban travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries, reversing two lower-court rulings, Trump tweeted: \u201cSUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!\u201dYet despite Trump\u2019s record on judicial appointments, some in the conservative legal movement remain uneasy. \u201cHe\u2019s been great, and everything\u2019s good,\u201d one prominent conservative legal activist says, \u201cbut what happens if the Senate goes 50-50? What happens if Don McGahn gets replaced by Judge Napolitano?\u201d Or what happens when an originalist judge does something that goes against Trump? When Neil Gorsuch was awaiting confirmation to the Supreme Court, he told a Democratic senator that Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban were \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d According to The Washington Post, Trump contemplated withdrawing his nomination because Gorsuch was not \u201cloyal.\u201d But after reading Gorsuch\u2019s note thanking him for the nomination \u2014 \u201cYour address to Congress was magnificent,\u201d Gorsuch wrote \u2014 he decided to stay the course.For the moment, Trump may believe that originalism and textualism cut in his favor, but there is no guarantee this will always be the case. While a president with an intellectual commitment to originalism and textualism would most likely be philosophical about a ruling from a like-minded judge that runs counter to his political or personal interests, this doesn\u2019t describe Trump. He would almost certainly interpret such a ruling as evidence of a judge\u2019s \u201ccowardice\u201d and \u201cweakness.\u201d Yet Trump can\u2019t simply fire the offending judge the way he fires a secretary of state; these are lifetime appointments and thus, unlike so many others whom Trump has ushered into power, judges are protected from his capriciousness. Earlier this year, McConnell, looking back on Trump\u2019s achievements in 2017, noted that the tax bill was \u201chugely important,\u201d but added that once Democrats took back control of the White House or Congress, they would revisit the tax code. By contrast, he said, \u201cthe thing that will last the longest is the courts\u201d \u2014 whether Trump ultimately wants them to or not.An earlier version of this article failed to attribute a characterization of the political leanings of several United States Courts of Appeals. It is President Trump\u2019s supporters in the conservative legal movement who believe that the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Circuit Courts were \u201cliberal\u201d prior to recent appointments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Imran Khan\u2019s First Test: Pakistan\u2019s Troubled Economy", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The economic mess awaiting Pakistan\u2019s new leader could take the thrill out of his election victory.So what\u2019s a new prime minister to do?But the task will be made more difficult because Pakistan has sandwiched itself between two financial powers: China, from which it has borrowed heavily, and the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund, which might be its short-term savior.Pakistan has taken out billions in Chinese loans and run up a huge import tab bringing in bulldozers, train carriages and building materials as part of a Chinese-funded master plan to revamp its ports, roads and railways.Economists agree that for Pakistan\u2019s economy to develop beyond rice and textiles, its main exports, it needs new infrastructure \u2014 a lot of it.But in the meantime, the Chinese plan is pushing Pakistan\u2019s deficits to unsustainable levels. The country\u2019s debt is rising rapidly and it is running out of hard currency to pay its bills. Pakistani economists say that Mr. Khan\u2019s team will have no choice but to beg the monetary fund for a multibillion-dollar bailout, one of more than a dozen that Pakistan has received since the late 1980s.That prospect doesn\u2019t make the United States super happy.Mr. Pompeo objected to the idea of money from the fund being used by Pakistan to pay back Chinese loans.\u201cThere\u2019s no rationale for I.M.F. tax dollars \u2014 and associated with that American dollars that are part of the I.M.F. funding \u2014 for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,\u201d he said.Pakistan\u2019s economy, it seems, has become yet another battlefield between the United States and China.Despite its troubles, last year the Pakistani economy grew at more than 5 percent, faster than most Western economies.But things could change quickly if Mr. Khan\u2019s government doesn\u2019t get a rescue package soon, experts said. Among the concerns are soaring inflation, bank runs, capital flight and new import controls that would make it more difficult to buy items like computers and spare auto parts.But how he handles the cold, hard numbers of Pakistan\u2019s up-and-down economy, more than anything else, will determine his success.This past week, Mr. Khan has continued his quest to win over enough independent lawmakers and those from smaller parties to form a coalition government.That is going to be hard to deliver if Pakistan goes hat in hand to the monetary fund, as many expect. Considered the lender of last resort, it can be a stern taskmaster.In return for lending Pakistan upward of $10 billion, the fund would most likely require more fiscal discipline. That could mean Pakistan would have to reduce public spending and increase the amount of taxes it collects. Both could be a drag on growth and are not exactly the moves a populist prime minister would like to make during his first days in office.Pakistani economists say Mr. Khan faces a tightrope in trying to reconcile the fund\u2019s demands with the goals of China\u2019s infrastructure plans.\u201cThese are our two masters,\u201d said Turab Hussain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. \u201cHow do you serve both?\u201dThough China is a member of the monetary fund and one of its biggest contributors, it has a different philosophy when making its own loans. Getting paid back is not its only, or maybe even primary, goal.As it seeks new markets for its construction companies and new pathways to ship its goods, China is financing ambitious infrastructure projects across Central and South Asia. Beijing also views these projects as a way to project its power and secure allies.The goal of the monetary fund, by contrast, is to stabilize distressed economies and help countries avoid unsustainable financial imbalances. It structures loans with strict conditions to increase the chances the country will clean up its finances and be able to pay back its loans.While Chinese loans don\u2019t have the same strings attached, they still have strings. In Pakistan, much of the profit from new power plants and roads goes straight back to Chinese companies.\u201cPakistan is clearly falling to the China side,\u201d said Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist for Oxford Economics, a global research firm.Even with a bailout from the monetary fund, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing.\u201dMeher Ahmad contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan, and Peter Goodman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Restraint Chairs and Spit Masks: Migrant Detainees Claim Abuse at Detention Centers", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVERONA, Va. \u2014 Guards at a juvenile detention center for troubled immigrant teenagers had many ways of handling serious problems. At times, they resorted to the chair. Other times, the mask.According to migrant teenagers and a former worker, the high, hard-backed metal chair had wheels so it could be tilted and moved like a dolly through the halls of the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, a northwest Virginia facility that houses American and undocumented migrant youths who have emotional, behavioral and psychological issues.Teenagers as young as 14 were strapped to the chair \u2014 some stripped down to their underwear \u2014 with their feet, arms and waist restrained by cushioned leather straps and loops, they said.Those who guards feared might spit on staff, said one former worker, got the mask \u2014 a mesh hood that covered their entire faces and heads. Sometimes, the detainees said, they were forced to wear it while in the chair.Uses of the chair and mask are among the more extreme examples of complaints that have emerged from inside a handful of detention centers that house teenage migrants with a history of violence, mental health problems or, in some cases, gang affiliation. A few hundred a year are held in this separate network of jail-like facilities that also hold American juveniles who have been sent there for a range of behavioral issues and crimes, including assault and murder.The centers have tougher security measures than the immigrant-only shelters where the vast majority of the migrant teenagers are sent after entering the country illegally, either on their own or with their families.For years, the government has sent the most troubled migrant youths to these more restrictive facilities, and many complaints about these sites came well before the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration. Others, though, have been lodged in the wake of the recent surge of detained immigrant children and teenagers, accusations that include use of the restraint devices, injections of psychotropic drugs and long periods in solitary confinement.In sworn statements at the center of a class-action lawsuit against the Shenandoah Valley facility and the government commission that receives millions of federal dollars to run it, six former detainees paint a hellish portrait of daily life inside.\u201cThey locked me in a room that was 8x10, or maybe 8x16, for 23 hours a day, all by myself,\u201d said one detainee identified only as R.B. in the suit. Originally from Guatemala and now 18 and living with his mother in Texas, he had a pre-existing mental illness and was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley facility because of \u201cbehavioral problems,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He said he often got into fights with other detainees and guards because he felt so isolated and angry over his fate. Punishment was the chair and mask, he said.Every year, according to federal figures, between 25,000 and 60,000 immigrant children who are without a parent or guardian are apprehended at the southwest border. The vast majority, including those separated from their families, are sent to federally financed shelters across the country, while a smaller number are found to have emotional disorders or other mental health and behavioral issues and are sent to more specialized facilities, such as the Shenandoah Valley center.Of the more than 100 migrant youth sites overseen by federal officials in 17 states, about 15 are known as residential treatment centers, staff-secure facilities and secure facilities. The local, state and federal standards and policies by which they must abide vary by state.Most of the centers existed long before unaccompanied migrant youths began flooding the border: They originally were opened to hold emotionally disturbed and convicted American juveniles brought to them by the criminal justice system. But as the number expanded beginning about six years ago, many won federal contracts to also treat immigrant children, and have done so while continuing to hold local teenagers.These restrictive detention centers are challenging to run in the best of circumstances and can present dangers to the detainees and employees. One former Shenandoah employee said in an interview that fights between detainees in rival gangs were common, and another former worker said he was jumped and struck repeatedly by several juveniles at once.At the Yolo County Juvenile Detention Center near Sacramento, the population has been so difficult to supervise that earlier this year, the county probation chief recommended the county end its $2.9 million federal contract to house migrant teenagers. Instead, it received an additional $2.2 million in federal funding through January 2019 to bulk up its staff. There is now one guard for every four inmates, he said, one case manager for every six, and one licensed therapist for every eight.\u201cThey were hitting our officers, spitting, throwing urine on them, they were head butting, we had a lot of assaults on officers,\u201d said Brent Cardall, the probation chief, adding that the center uses spit masks and pepper spray but not a chair to restrain detainees.Over all, the facility can house up to 24 immigrant inmates. It usually holds about half that number of local youths sentenced there for crimes like murder, assault or \u201cextreme drug use,\u201d Mr. Cardell said.Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement \u2014 the agency responsible for the care and housing of migrant youths \u2014 said in a statement that federal officials take appropriate action when there are allegations of abuse.\u201cOur office also conducts federal monitoring visits and medical reviews, and takes seriously the responsibility of caring for each child,\u201d Mr. Wolfe said.Far north of the border where they were first apprehended, behind the walls of a taupe building with tidy landscaping in the verdant Shenandoah Valley west of Charlottesville, detainees at the center of the lawsuit described being beaten while handcuffed, slammed against walls, stabbed with pens, subjected to anti-Latino and other racist remarks, and forced to spend hours strapped to the restraint chair.One 15-year-old from Mexico, identified by the initials J.A., said that staff members, who never told him why he was transferred there, pushed him to the floor, handcuffed him, took off his clothes, put a spit mask over his head and strapped him to the restraining chair \u2014 all because he did not want to go to his room.In interviews, two former employees of the Shenandoah Valley facility, which has received $31.4 million in federal contracts since 2009, said the use of the chair and the mask was carefully monitored, and they were used only as a last resort. They disputed any suggestion that their treatment of the migrant youths was abusive, cruel or unlawful.But detainees in the lawsuit said that the chair was used often on them and other children, and that they were tied to it for varying lengths of time, from 30 minutes to \u2014 in at least one case \u2014 two and a half days. One detainee, an 18-year-old Guatemalan who immigrated with his mom at a young age and was sent to the detention center after running away from home and being caught by immigration authorities, said he and other migrants were not allowed to take bathroom breaks, so they urinated on themselves while strapped in the chair.\u201cThey had me in that chair for a good hour, but they don\u2019t check the time,\u201d said another former detainee identified by the initials of D.M., a Honduran who was apprehended after he illegally crossed the southwest border when he was 15, and has bipolar disorder and other mental health issues. He was detained at the Shenandoah Valley site starting in 2014 and said he was there at least 11 months.\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a crisis, the bag is the least helpful thing,\u201d said D.M., now 20, referring to the spit mask. \u201cThey just grab the left side of your head and they force it over you. You can\u2019t move to resist. The first thing that came to my head when they put it on me was, \u2018They are going to suffocate me.\u2019\u201dAfter news reports in late June about abuse allegations, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ordered officials at two state agencies to investigate the claims in the lawsuit. Officials and a child protective services worker interviewed all detained migrants and reviewed their case files.The detention center \u2014 operated by the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center Commission, a three-county, four-city agency \u2014 said in a statement that it \u201ctakes all allegations of misconduct very seriously, including the complaints of abuse described in the pending federal lawsuit.\u201d The center concluded, after a thorough investigation, that the allegations lacked merit.As of late June, 22 of the facility\u2019s 58 beds were occupied by immigrant youths. In congressional testimony earlier this year, Kelsey Wong, a program director, said the center serves an average of 92 migrants every year, and about 300 youths in total.Interviews with the former employees echoed some of the accusations made by the young migrants, including that staff members punished the children with extensive periods in isolation. One of them said staff members often put juveniles in a restraining hold that occasionally left both the detainees and the workers with bruises.They described the center as a tense place where they feared for their own safety and defended its handling of the migrants, saying nothing they witnessed amounted to excessive force.One of the former employees, a youth worker who spent about three years there several years ago, said use of the restraint chair required approval from a top manager, and was used only when a detainee was believed capable of hurting himself or herself. Once, he said, the chair was used on an immigrant detainee who hit a window with his fist so hard that it cracked, and threatened to jump off his bunk to injure himself.\u201cIt\u2019s not something that has any place at all, in our view, in a well-run juvenile facility,\u201d said Jason Szanyi, deputy director of the Center for Children\u2019s Law and Policy, who has worked with officials in more than 100 juvenile detention centers around the country.On a two-lane road south of Houston, where the sprawling metropolis peters out into the Brazoria County countryside, the Shiloh Treatment Center makes its headquarters in a small complex of white trailer-like structures set amid a landscape of cattle and horses grazing in the heat.Allegations of abuse have persisted over the years at Shiloh, which has received about $30 million in federal contracts for migrant youth services since 2009. It remains part of the federal migrant youth shelter system, even after Representative Pete Olson, a Republican from Texas, called for it to be closed, citing years of troubling reports.Jeri Yenne, the longtime Republican district attorney for Brazoria County, has said three deaths of local youths from 2001 to 2010 at Shiloh and its nonprofit sister facility Daystar were \u201cattributable to restraint holds\u201d used by staff members. After the third death in 2010, state child welfare officials investigated, resulting in one child abuse finding and two child neglect findings against two Daystar employees. Texas officials revoked Daystar\u2019s license.Because of the deaths, as well as other incidents, Ms. Yenne contacted federal officials in 2011 and asked them to consider reducing the number of immigrant children they place at Shiloh.With a licensed capacity to hold 44 children, Shiloh had about 25 undocumented teenagers in July. In legal filings from earlier this year in an ongoing class-action lawsuit, young migrants allege that staff members have engaged in physical and verbal abuse, forced them to take medication and, in some cases, overmedicated them.In a statement posted recently to its website, the center said it has been investigated, but \u201cthe children have been found to be properly cared for and treated.\u201dJudge Gee also ordered that migrants be told why they were sent to Shiloh, or any of the other more restrictive facilities, and that they be given access to drinking water, as many claimed they were not.One boy, identified as Julio Z., attested that a staff member at Shiloh \u201coften refused to allow Julio and other class members to leave their living quarters to obtain drinking water,\u201d the July 30 order states. On one occasion, the boy tried to leave and a staff member threw him to the ground, injuring one of his elbows.The government has until Aug. 10 to work out the details of the transfers.Jess Bidgood reported from Verona, Va., and Manny Fernandez and Richard Fausset from Houston.

Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged affairs with a pornographic film star and a former Playboy bunny have become national news, joined by figures from publications typically more associated with supermarket checkout lines than the White House briefing room.This week, Kristin M. Davis, a former high-class procuress from New York, is set to become a witness for the federal prosecutors who are looking into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. If you have been wondering about how Ms. Davis found herself enmeshed in the Russia investigation, here are a few answers to some questions you may have.A former finance worker and a twice-failed candidate for elected office, Ms. Davis, 43, is perhaps best known as the \u201cManhattan Madam\u201d \u2014 a name used to describe her by The New York Post and The Daily News, for whom she offered tantalizing grist at the height of her fame in the early 2000s. After serving in the back office at a hedge fund, Ms. Davis tried her hand at a more lucrative venture: running an escort service that she called \u201cWicked Models.\u201dProsecutors have not said what information they think Ms. Davis can provide about ties between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid, but one obvious nexus between Ms. Davis and the president is Mr. Stone, who served them both as a political strategist over the years.A self-described \u201cdirty trickster\u201d with a career in politics that reaches back decades to his work as a teenager for Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee to Re-Elect the President, Mr. Stone has been a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump. It is in that role that he has found himself in the cross hairs of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.It\u2019s hard to say at this point, but Ms. Davis may be able to help investigators sort through Mr. Stone\u2019s confusing and complicated ties to the two entities \u2014 WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 \u2014 that are at the center of the hacking of Democratic emails and political documents, and their subsequent leak to the public.Mr. Stone has nonetheless claimed Ms. Davis is unlikely to be helpful to Mr. Mueller. \u201cShe knows nothing about Russian collusion,\u201d he said last week.If Mr. Stone is ultimately charged with a crime, it would mean another person close to Mr. Trump had been felled by Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. But beyond Mr. Stone\u2019s actions, prosecutors are presumably also interested in what Mr. Trump knew about the hacks and leaks and when he knew it. Mr. Stone might be a key witness.\u201cI will tell you this, Russia: If you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Mr. Trump said that day during a news conference in Florida.Is it possible that the former madam of a high-end escort service (who, like Mr. Trump, was long a fixture of New York\u2019s gossip pages) might have information touching on the country\u2019s national security?Only time will tell.Advertisement"}

What I\u2019d like to say is, \u201cNobody is going to get pardoned during the investigation,\u201d\u2019\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, adding that he reassured the president that his power to pardon was not in jeopardy.Mr. Trump agreed with his assessment, Mr. Giuliani added. \u201cAs far as I know, he hasn\u2019t changed his mind,\u201d he said, adding that granting pardons to former aides convicted in the Russia investigation would be politically imprudent.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.By signaling that he might eventually consider pardoning him, Mr. Trump could alter the legal calculations of Mr. Manafort, who faces a second trial next month in Washington. If Mr. Manafort were to count on a pardon, he could choose to endure the sentencing and second trial, rather than cooperate with the special counsel, though it is not clear Mr. Manafort has anything to offer investigators.Mr. Dowd has denied having those conversations. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to investigators and agreed to help Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.Mr. Trump complained in an interview broadcast Thursday on Fox News that \u201cit almost ought to be illegal\u201d to cooperate with the government, adding that \u201ccampaign violations are considered not a big deal, frankly.\u201dMr. Trump also said Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201cnever took control\u201d of the Justice Department and that Mr. Manafort was \u201cbrave.\u201d\u201cOne of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

She was held in pretrial detention until December, when she was released but ordered to remain in the country.Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, welcomed the decision, calling it \u201ca step toward improving our relations with Turkey.\u201d But he insisted that further steps must follow, pointing to at least seven other German citizens who are jailed in Turkey for what Berlin considers political reasons.Ms. Tolu reminded her supporters on Monday that the court\u2019s decision to allow her to leave the country would have no effect on the trial against her and other journalists, including her husband. The trial is scheduled to continue on Oct. 16.Mr. Brunson and Mr. Kilic were among the 11 rights activists detained in a flurry of arrests after a failed coup against Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government in 2016.They all faced charges of aiding terrorist groups, in particular the movement led by Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in exile in the United States whom Ankara accuses of initiating the coup attempt. The United States has repeatedly refused Turkey\u2019s requests to extradite Mr. Gulen.Mr. Erdogan is set to visit Berlin next month, and talks between the ministers of finance and transport are scheduled before then, German officials said.

{"Headline": "Influence of Big-Money Donors Declined in 2017 Mayoral Election", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonations of $175 or less by city residents are eligible to receive a six-to-one match of publicly financed campaign cash, creating an incentive for candidates to reach out to small donors.Under the matching funds program, which is intended to magnify the importance of smaller contributions, if a city resident donates $10 to a campaign that qualifies for matching funds, the candidate gets $70.Amy M. Loprest, the executive director of the campaign finance board, said that the high percentage of small contributors shows the system is working.\u201cThe campaign finance program continues to provide the incentive to candidates to reach out to voters to give small contributions and it gives the contributors the incentive to give to those candidates,\u201d she said. Citing a study showing that people who gave money to candidates were much more likely to vote, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important part of civic engagement that you provide the incentives for individuals to become contributors.\u201dThe commission is proposing to increase the public funds match to eight to one, while changing the donation limits. In citywide races, such as mayor and public advocate, the match would apply to the first $250 donated by city residents. The current $175 threshold for matching funds would continue to apply to donations to City Council and borough president candidates, under the commission\u2019s proposals.The commission is expected to meet in September to finalize its recommendations. Currently, the city\u2019s campaign finance system is enumerated in laws passed by the City Council. The commission would enshrine the system, along with the new limits, in the City Charter, which functions as a kind of constitution for city government.The charter commission has also proposed lowering the maximum allowable contributions significantly. Under its proposals, donors to mayoral candidates taking part in the matching funds program could give no more than $2,000 to a candidate; in the last election, the maximum donation was $4,950. It would also set lower maximum donation limits for candidates to other offices.The report from the Campaign Finance Board, which is required to produce an analysis every four years, calls for similar changes to the matching funds program. It argues that the changes are needed before the 2021 election, when no incumbents will be running for mayor or other citywide posts and most City Council seats will be up for grabs because of term limits. Those conditions will be similar to the 2009 race, when the percentage of smaller contributions dipped and the importance of large donations jumped.The proposed changes would further bolster the influence of small donors, the report said.Yet even last year, with its high percentage of small donors, large contributors continued to carry outsize weight in the election, according to the board report.The board reported that 13,767 people made donations of $175 or less to mayoral candidates participating in the matching program, for a total of $783,699. In contrast, 656 people gave the maximum donation of $4,950, for total contributions of $3.2 million.The board also found that for the first time ever, political campaigns in the city took in more donations made by credit card than by check, a sign of how online fund-raising is changing the way campaigns reach out to donors.In total, Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Malliotakis received $5.9 million in matching funds. Several other candidates participated in the program during the primaries, but none of them raised enough money to qualify for matching funds (the program requires candidates to reach certain fund-raising levels in order to receive the funds). Other candidates, such as Bo Dietl, who ran as an independent, did not participate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steel Giants With Ties to Trump Officials Block Tariff Relief for Hundreds of Firms", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two of America\u2019s biggest steel manufacturers \u2014 both with deep ties to administration officials \u2014 have successfully objected to hundreds of requests by American companies that buy foreign steel to exempt themselves from President Trump\u2019s stiff metal tariffs. They have argued that the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers.To date, their efforts have never failed, resulting in denials for companies that are based in the United States but rely on imported pipes, screws, wire and other foreign steel products for their supply chains.The ability of a single industry to exert so much influence over the exclusions process is striking even in Mr. Trump\u2019s business-friendly White House, given the high stakes for thousands of American companies that depend on foreign metals. But the boundaries of trade policy are being tested by the scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s multifront trade war with allies and adversaries alike, which includes tariffs on up to $200 billion worth of goods from China and possible tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, even from allies like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan, is just one part of that battle. But it has drawn a strong rebuke from foreign governments, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, including automakers, beverage companies, farm equipment manufacturers and food packagers, who say it will inflict financial pain on companies that employ millions of American workers.Since May, companies have filed more than 20,000 requests for steel tariff exemptions. As of the end of July, the Commerce Department had denied 639 requests.Half of those denials came in cases where United States Steel, Nucor or a third large steel maker, AK Steel Holding Corporation, filed an objection, a New York Times analysis shows. Nearly all of the rest were in cases where the company applying for an exclusion erred in its submission, Commerce Department officials say.Department officials said on Friday that they have not granted a single steel exclusion request that drew an objection. They have granted 20 aluminum exclusions over an objection, because the objecting company did not actually cite the product in question.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has defended the exclusion process and said the steel makers\u2019 ability to provide products should be taken into account.\u201cIf a product is available in enough quantity and quality to meet demand, the objection is generally sustained,\u201d Mr. Ross said in an email. \u201cEach situation is treated individually. If no objection has been filed, and there is no specific national security issue regarding the import, we generally grant the exclusion request.\u201dMr. Trump has made no secret that he wants to boost American steel makers, and several of his top administration officials have deep ties to the steel industry. As the head of a private equity fund, Mr. Ross bought and operated several steel companies, which he later sold at a profit, and he sat on a steel company\u2019s board of directors until his confirmation.Nucor has played a role in one-quarter of the denials. In most cases, at least one other company also objected to a request that drew an objection from the three large steel makers.\u201cThe tariffs are working,\u201d said John Ferriola, Nucor\u2019s chairman, chief executive and president. \u201cThey are protecting our national security and stimulating additional domestic steel production.\u201dThe rejected companies do not agree.In a 31-page objection filed in May, United States Steel officials said, \u201cThere is no national security interest in drawing further foreign Turkish investment into the United States to produce a product that is already produced in the United States, and for which substantial excess capacity exists.\u201dMr. Johnson said the company requested an exclusion so it could have time to build a United States-based factory that could produce what it now imports. The investment would create more than 170 jobs, on top of the 264 people Borusan Mannesmann now employs in Texas.He said the objections were an obvious attempt to block the competition that would come from his company\u2019s proposed new mill in Texas. \u201cI\u2019d be doing exactly what they\u2019re doing, if I were them,\u201d he said.The tariffs are beginning to reap dividends for the steel industry \u2014 a development that Mr. Trump frequently boasts about.Some companies that have been denied exclusions have been forced to enter negotiations with Nucor over supplying steel products that are subject to tariffs or dropping its objections to their requests, according to a lawyer who works with those companies.Critics say the exclusions process has overwhelmed Commerce Department staff members, who do not have the resources to sift through thousands of complicated requests and objections and judge them on their merits. They say the default position is to simply listen to a company that objects, regardless of whether the objection is legitimate.In April, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Ross urging him to improve the process and expressing concern about whether the Commerce Department was taking steps to prevent the program \u201cfrom being abused for anticompetitive purposes.\u201dThe three large steel makers are by far the most aggressive objectors in the exclusions process. Nucor and United States Steel have each filed more than 1,000 objections, some of which overlap. AK Steel has filed nearly 700 objections.Steel makers\u2019 objections to others\u2019 requests take a variety of forms. Sometimes, the steel makers allege the company seeking an exclusion made an error in its filings. Sometimes, they criticize companies for choosing not to produce steel in the United States and instead buying it from overseas producers; one company\u2019s decision to cease domestic production of steel slab \u201cdirectly undermines U.S. steel production and should not be rewarded with the requested product exclusions,\u201d Nucor wrote in a comment.Often, the steel makers claim that an American mill is producing the product in question, or could produce it if asked. \u201cNucor can offer a substitute for the requested product out of stock immediately (i.e., within 8 weeks),\u201d the company wrote in response to an exclusion request from Houston-based SEBA Tubular, which had sought to import steel bars from Turkey, citing insufficient supplies from American mills. \u201cTo the extent that further manufacturing is required, Nucor can ship/deliver the product within the above-referenced time frames.\u201dThe SEBA request was denied. Company officials did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Ferriola, the Nucor chairman, said his company generally objects to exclusion requests if it produces the product in question or a substitute, or if it believes that granting the exclusion would undermine national security. \u201cWe should be able to compete against any steel maker in the world, but we cannot compete against those who dump artificially cheap steel into our market at prices that are lower than our cost of production,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why Nucor continues to assess market conditions, and will be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases and objecting to exclusion requests, when and where it is appropriate.\u201dAsked if the company\u2019s success in blocking exclusion requests was related to the investment in Mr. Navarro\u2019s film, a company spokeswoman, Katherine Miller, said in an email that \u201cas America\u2019s largest steel producer, we have been actively engaged in the trade arena for almost two decades. Over this time, we have been outspoken that our government must take a much tougher line with countries that continuously violate the rules of free trade. The documentary produced seven years ago provided another medium to discuss this critical economic issue.\u201dA United States Steel spokeswoman, Meghan M. Cox, noted that the company has filed comments on \u201cless than 10 percent of the total requests posted by the Commerce Department\u201d and \u201conly on those tariff exclusion requests that are for products that we make.\u201d\u201cWith the restart of one blast furnace earlier this year and preparations for another blast furnace restart in October underway at our Granite City Works,\u201d Ms. Cox said, \u201cwe are willing and able to support substantial proportions of increased domestic demand for many steel products.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Supported byTurkish banks are pulling back on credit to consumers and businesses. Power plants have shut down because of the soaring cost of imported fuel. Building projects in Istanbul stand half finished after their backers ran out of money.Mr. Sarialioglu, who is also president of the Istanbul chamber of pharmacists, said he has been getting calls from other pharmacists concerned that wholesalers will cut off supplies of crucial medications because they can no longer make a profit. Drug prices are set in Turkey, so the sharp drop in the lira has made it costly to import pharmaceuticals.\u201cStarting in September, we may have problems,\u201d Mr. Sarialioglu said. \u201cAn urgent solution is needed.\u201dIt has never been easy doing business on the edge of the war zone, in a country with its own rough politics, eye-popping inflation and volatile currency.But in recent weeks the challenges facing Turkish banks and businesses have acquired a new level of intensity that is visible from the streets of Istanbul to the global financial markets. After losing a quarter of its value in a matter of days this month, the currency had recovered some ground before falling again on Friday. Its latest decline came as other emerging market currencies, like the South African rand and the Indian rupee, lost ground as well.The lira\u2019s plunge in value, exacerbated by a dispute with the United States over a detained pastor, has exposed economic pressures that have been gathering for years. And some economists say that they could be reaching a breaking point. Over the past decade, businesses gorged on cheap debt, which is harder to pay back as the lira falls, while banks handed out credit cards like party favors. \u201cA recession is inevitable,\u201d said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. \u201cThe question is whether it\u2019s going to be a soft landing or a hard landing.\u201dTurkey\u2019s problems are so acute, Professor Demiralp said, that only drastic measures would stabilize the lira and contain official inflation of almost 16 percent. She said that the central bank would need to raise the official interest rate to around 28 percent, from 17.75 percent. But the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is widely perceived as controlling the central bank, has shown no willingness to allow even a more modest rate increase or to curtail government spending on public works.In a conference call with investors Thursday, Berat Albayrak, the Turkish finance minister, insisted that the banking system was healthy and promised measures that would bring inflation down to single digits. Mr. Albayrak offered few specifics, according to reports in Turkish and international media. And he ruled out assistance from the International Monetary Fund \u2014 a step many analysts say will be essential to stabilize the economy.Yet there is no sign that Mr. Erdogan is ready to allow measures that would restore investor confidence. Nafez Zouk, chief emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics in London, said he did not think the lira\u2019s recent rally would last.\u201cAs soon as the next big thing hits the headlines,\u201d Mr. Zouk said, \u201cwe are going to be back to square one.\u201dA recession would bring to an end nearly two decades of uninterrupted growth in Turkey. Most young people don\u2019t remember the last serious downturn in 2001. Since then, the country has cut poverty in half, brought millions of people into the middle class and, until recently, been embraced as a darling of international investors. But the growth was built largely on a construction boom fueled by easy credit and government spending. The success story is looking increasingly unsustainable.Even for Turks used to double-digit inflation and wild currency swings, the latest crisis has an ominous feel.On a street called Nur-u Osmaniye, steps from Istanbul\u2019s famous grand bazaar, Arthur Kosaryan nodded toward a large empty storefront opposite the jewelry shop where he works. The space once housed one of Istanbul\u2019s finest antiques shops, Mr. Kosaryan said. But the landlord demanded the rent in dollars.First a wave of terrorist bombings and an aborted coup in 2016 drove away tourists. Then, the lira began a slide early this year that wiped out nearly half its value. The shop owner could no longer afford to pay the rent and went out of business.\u201cIn this volatility people stopped buying things,\u201d Mr. Kosaryan said. \u201cThey are waiting for prices to calm down.\u201dMr. Dalbeler did not say, but some Turkish managers may also be wary that expressions of pessimism would be perceived as unpatriotic in a country where the government has been known to seize assets of people considered disloyal.Even by Turkish standards the steel industry is in a tough spot, as Mr. Dalbeler conceded. President Trump imposed a 50 percent tariff on Turkish steel after talks broke down to win the release of the detained pastor, Andrew Brunson.\u201cThere is no way in the steel business you can compete when you have such a disadvantage,\u201d said Mr. Dalbeler, who is also a board member of the Turkish Steel Exporters\u2019 Association, an industry group.Years ago, Mr. Dalbeler said, Iraq was the Turkish steel industry\u2019s biggest market. But the Arab Spring \u2014 seen here as the consequence of American policy \u2014 led to civil war in Syria and severely undercut the Middle East as a market for steel. Turkish steel producers, who specialize in the reinforcing bars used in construction as well as pipes used by the oil industry, adapted in part by increasing sales in the United States.Now they will adapt again, said Namik Kemal Ekinci, head of a separate industry group that represents steel exporters. \u201cWe will be able to find new markets,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump and his advisers, he added, imposed tariffs because they were \u201cjealous of our steel industry.\u201dOn Thursday Istanbul was noticeably calmer than late last week. The lira traded at 5.75 to the dollar, compared with 7 to the dollar at the beginning of the week.In a narrow shop in Istanbul where he trades gold and silver, Gabriel Saglamoglu was defiant. \u201cThe Turkish economy is not going to be destroyed by a single tweet,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement last week on Twitter that he would impose higher steel tariffs.Business was frenzied a few days earlier, Mr. Saglamoglu said, as Turks bought precious metals as a hedge against the turmoil. But things have calmed down in part because of a pledge by Qatar to invest $15 billion in the Turkish economy, he said.But economists considered Qatar\u2019s show of solidarity insignificant in proportion to Turkey\u2019s problems. Loans taken out in dollars are the main source of concern, since a falling lira makes them more expensive.The country\u2019s companies will require $200 billion in financing from foreign banks and investors during 2018 to roll over existing debt, according to estimates by Oxford Economics. Lenders\u2019 willingness to provide that financing is in serious doubt. On paper the number of bad loans in Turkey has not reached alarming levels. But several large Turkish companies have already asked banks for help restructuring their debts in recent months. Economists worry that others could run into trouble and banks may not be able to offer a lifeline.The currency crisis has already begun to reveal the economic weaknesses that had been concealed by breakneck growth. Several Turkish power plants have shut down temporarily because of the soaring cost, in lira terms, of imported fuel, though there have not yet been any blackouts. Companies are finding it more difficult to afford factory machinery and hospitals have been forced to buy cheaper X-ray machines.The pharmacist, Mr. Sarialioglu, who remembers when Ivanka Trump visited the Trump-branded complex in Istanbul several years ago, said he worried about shortages of cancer drugs. They are almost always imported. The Turkish government regulates the cost of drugs, leaving no room for suppliers to raise prices.An earlier version of this article misstated Ugur Dalbeler's position with the Turkish Steel Exporters' Association, an industry group.

{"Headline": "A Rare Moment of Unity, in Celebration of John McCain", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 John McCain on Friday made his final visit to the Capitol he ruled as a commanding presence for more than three decades to be grieved and celebrated by colleagues past and present. He would have loved it.Much of official Washington joined current members of Congress and dozens of former colleagues from the House and Senate under the Capitol dome to pay tribute to the late senator, congressman, war hero and failed but proud presidential contender.The service was imbued with the dignity, seriousness and respect \u2014 as well as the capacity to embrace with affection someone of a different political ideology \u2014 that are so lacking in American politics these days. And that seemed to be the point.Mr. McCain\u2019s death is giving Americans \u2014 even those who might have disagreed strenuously with him \u2014 an opportunity to recognize someone for a selfless life of service to his country at a time when many are disillusioned and dispirited about politics in both substance and tone.\u201cA lot of people in the country are looking for a person who can be held up as an exemplary public servant,\u201d said John E. Sununu, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire, in giving his view of why Mr. McCain\u2019s death is resonating so strongly across the country.President Trump was not welcome at the event, and his glaring absence was strongly felt. No one had to say it aloud, but the days-long national farewell for Mr. McCain has taken on the distinct feel of a sharp counterpoint to Mr. Trump \u2014 an outpouring of appreciation for a unique political figure, a political rival whom Mr. Trump belittled and whose record of service he initially failed to acknowledge upon his death.\u201cI prayed at the coffin that our nation live up to his integrity, honesty and idealism,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said after the emotional service, which left some of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest colleagues drained.As Mr. McCain himself often said, he was not without his flaws. But he was a public figure who pursued his goals with principle and an intensity that his colleagues envied. They assembled in recognition of his special stature.\u201cMany of us wish we had the courage to have played the role John McCain played,\u201d said Connie Mack III, a Florida Republican who entered the House with Mr. McCain in 1983 and later served with him in the Senate.There was no small amount of political intrigue at the ceremony as those attending noted carefully who was on hand from the Trump administration \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator now under intense fire from the president; Rod J. Rosenstein, the No. 2 at the Justice Department and the official responsible for the special counsel inquiry; the chief of staff, John F. Kelly; the president\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway; and a retinue of national security officials whose ties to Mr. McCain go much deeper than with Mr. Trump.Many on hand stole glimpses of the Trump officials as the ceremony proceeded.\u201cWhat a lot of drama,\u201d said one current senator who preferred not to be named discussing the atmospherics of such a solemn event. But that was another aspect of the service that would have appealed to Mr. McCain, himself the instigator of much Capitol Hill drama over the years.Vice President Mike Pence, who in his job also serves as president of the Senate, represented the White House and took pains to point out that \u201cthe president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served our country throughout his life, in uniform and in public office.\u201dMr. Pence also managed to work in a plug for tax cuts by commending Mr. McCain \u2014 whom Mr. Pence worked with as a House member to ban earmarks and instill some fiscal discipline \u2014 noting that his support for \u201climited government, for tax reform, and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure.\u201dBut it was left to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan to convey the deep admiration of most in Congress for Mr. McCain \u2014 though not without the de rigueur acknowledgment of Mr. McCain\u2019s famous temper and the difficulties he could present when others were trying to coax him into a compromise.\u201cHe treated every issue with the intensity the people\u2019s business deserved,\u201d said Mr. McConnell, who clashed fiercely with Mr. McCain over changes in campaign finance law but reconciled with him in recent years. \u201cHe would fight tooth and nail for his vision of the common good. Depending on the issue, you knew John would either be your staunchest ally or your most stubborn opponent.\u201d\u201cI will miss a dear friend whose smile reminded us that service is a privilege,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cand whose scars reminded us of the great cost that brave souls pay for our freedom.\u201dMr. Ryan remembered his own fights with Mr. McCain, recounting that \u201cwith John it was never feigned disagreements. The man didn\u2019t feign anything. He just relished the fight.\u201d\u201cThough the highest office eluded him,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201che attained what is far more enduring, the abiding affection of his fellow citizens and an example for future generations.\u201dThe line of admirers that formed outside the Capitol in scorching heat for the chance to pass by Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin clearly underscored how he had won the affection of citizens who, for a few days at least, had their faith in the spirit of public service renewed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are We Talking About Impeachment?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf campaign finance violations qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors, elections won\u2019t be able to settle anything.Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness and a contributing opinion writer.My inbox was full on Wednesday. Michael Cohen. Paul Manafort. Collusion! Corruption! Grifter! Crook! These were the words that kept popping up in emails from people who see Cohen\u2019s plea deal as a vindication of their deeply held opinions of the president. Trump supporters who emailed me had a different set of themes: Mueller, Clinton, Obama, double standards, conspiracy \u2014 all the way up to ruling-class privilege.More to the point, since when did campaign finance violations become this country\u2019s idea of an impeachable offense? There is simply no precedent for imposing the political equivalent of the death penalty in such cases. The Obama campaign paid $375,000 in fines for its violations of election law. A similar case was unsuccessfully brought against the former Senator John Edwards for payments he made to keep an adulterous affair secret while he was running for president. Given all this, and Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president, we are left with a situation in which Democrats seeking adjudication of their allegations would have to pursue impeachment in the House and, if they were successful there, a subsequent trial in the Senate. But any such action is fraught with political peril. Turning the midterms into a referendum on impeachment could easily backfire. Campaign finance laws exist to ensure that the ability to influence elections is contained within prescribed boundaries. In other words, any violation of those laws represents illegal influence on an election. But if campaign finance violations now become impeachable offenses, what does the future hold? For one thing, elections wouldn\u2019t be able to settle anything. If a new precedent is set lowering the bar for removing a president from office, we will see more attempts to invoke that precedent and nullify elections. This would simply repeat what is happening now: an attempt to change a political conflict into a legal one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What if the Economy and Markets Are Even Better Than They Look?", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesYou won\u2019t lose much money if you\u2019re prepared for the worst.But what if the good times that are evident in important sectors of the markets and the economy just keep rolling, at least for a while?That bullish possibility has arguably been underplayed, given the strength of the current numbers. And there is a strong, contrarian case that failing to appreciate the power of the current economy and markets will have serious implications that transcend finance and affect politics, too, generally helping Republicans and hurting Democrats.Consider, first, that after months of setbacks, the American stock market reached new highs repeatedly over the last few weeks. In fact, it was one of the best Augusts the stock market has had in years.That statistical snapshot depicts a stock market and an economy that are prospering. Barring an unexpected event, the simplest prediction is that we\u2019ll have more of the same. Why, then, are so many people worried that bad times are coming?In addition, the risk that the markets and economy will be derailed by a truly major political, constitutional, military or trade crisis during the Trump administration, while difficult to quantify, cannot be easily dismissed. There are many potential calamities to choose from. Any one of them could lead to an economic disaster.But timing is everything. Even if you are convinced that disaster is coming, deciding exactly when to take risk out of your portfolio matters tremendously.From a purely financial standpoint, staying on the sidelines in the current bull market has been excruciatingly costly. From the beginning of this year through Thursday, for example, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 9.9 percent. If the market keeps powering ahead, and you avoid stocks entirely because you are afraid of a crash, you will fall further behind.There are political implications, too. There are already ample reasons to suspect that the current strength of the market and the economy is hurting Democrats in their efforts to regain control of Congress in the November midterm elections.Using only economic variables and data from elections over the last century, Professor Fair projects that the Democratic Party is likely to win 50.74 percent of the two-party popular vote for the House. \u201cIt is probably less than what the Democrats need to gain control of the House, although I do not have an equation that translates the vote share into House seats,\u201d he said on his website.In an interview, Professor Fair explained: \u201cI don\u2019t attempt to convert the popular vote into an actual forecast, state-by-state, with all the gerrymandering and other factors that are so important. I leave that to the political scientists.\u201dThe second quarter G.D.P. growth \u2014 a variable in his equation that captures the good feelings generated by the economy and the stock market \u2014 had the effect of subtracting about 1 critical percentage point from the Democratic share in his projection. Another strong showing in the current quarter, which he defines as an annual growth rate of at least 3.2 percent, would move the Republicans ahead in the popular vote in November, according to his algorithm.But he is the first to admit that his equations don\u2019t capture the inimical style of President Trump. For the last presidential election, for example, Professor Fair\u2019s algorithm indicated that economic as well as political factors strongly favored the Republican Party. His projections said Republicans would capture 56 percent of the popular vote, giving its presidential candidate a landslide victory. Professor Fair was off by 7.1 percentage points (though he did project a Trump victory, unlike most forecasters).\u201cHad the Republicans nominated a more mainstream candidate, they may have done much better \u2014 much closer to what the equation was predicting,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d and combative approach to politics could reduce the Republican tally again in the midterm elections, according to Professor Fair, and swing the vote to the Democrats. \u201cI just have no way of capturing that,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s unconventional approach to the presidency is undoubtedly making it more difficult, as well, to accurately assess the trajectory of the markets and the economy themselves.Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst, made that point in a series of reports in August. Mr. Yardeni, who describes himself as \u201ca conservative-leaning fellow,\u201d said that on contentious issues, from tax cuts to trade disputes to deregulation, financial markets have been \u201cgiving quite a bit of weight to the possibility that this all will lead to less protectionism and greater global prosperity\u201d \u2014 and to a rising stock market.That\u2019s not my baseline assumption, but it could happen. What if the stock market keeps ascending, the economy continues to grow, and Mr. Trump and a flock of Republicans do their utmost to take credit for it?I\u2019m hedging my bets.An earlier version of this article misstated the return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index from the beginning of the year through Aug. 30.

{"Headline": "As Trade War Intensifies, China Moves to Bolster Its Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 As China\u2019s economy slows and the trade war with the United States intensifies, Beijing\u2019s economic bosses are swinging into action.\u201cIt\u2019s a line in the sand for the leadership\u201d of China, said Hao Hong, the research director for the international operations of the Bank of Communications, a Shanghai-based financial institution.China is taking action as its problems mount. On Thursday the United States formally enacted its previously threatened tariffs on $16 billion in Chinese-made goods. Beijing said it would immediately retaliate with its own tariffs and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The moves intensify a trade war that has already affected more than $100 billion of goods and cast a shadow over growth prospects for China and the world.China is playing a difficult game. It must deal with its weakening economy without worsening its onerous debt problems. At the same time, it has to shore up the situation at home if it hopes to continue to retaliate against President Trump\u2019s trade war broadsides.So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China\u2019s vast, $12 trillion economy. But the trade war complicates China\u2019s deeper problems with its onerous debt levels. China has worked to wean its economy off its dependence on borrowing, but the resulting slowdown in growth has undercut that effort, leading Beijing to relent somewhat from the initiative. Should the trade war take a greater toll, China could direct its banks to expand lending further.\u201cThe Chinese government always oscillates between maintaining stability and achieving quality growth,\u201d said Zhigang Tao, a Hong Kong University economist. \u201cWhen you see the government switch to stimulus, it generally means the government cares about stability.\u201dChina\u2019s softening economy has led some within the Trump Administration to believe Beijing is vulnerable, which could lead the White House to escalate the trade war even further. Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, pointed out during a Cabinet meeting last week that China\u2019s own official statistics for business investment, retail sales and industrial production have shown weakness in recent months.\u201cRight now, their economy looks terrible,\u201d he said during the meeting, which was open to the media.The city of Harbin, a provincial capital in northeastern China, ran out of money last month to pay pensioners, and had to rearrange its finances to pay them later. Corporate bond defaults have increased this year, although they are still low by international standards. The country\u2019s banks acknowledged last month a fairly sharp uptick in nonperforming loans, although that was partly driven by tighter auditing standards.Signals of serious financial and economic weakness have prompted the Beijing authorities to rush out their series of measures since the end of July.China is taking steps to make sure its companies and spenders have enough money. The central bank announced on Aug. 10 that it would make sure enough credit reached companies. China\u2019s banking regulator announced on Aug. 11 and again over the weekend that it wanted the country\u2019s state-controlled banking sector to provide ample credit to exporters, small and medium-size businesses and infrastructure projects.The authorities are also encouraging local projects. The Finance Ministry is helping deeply indebted local governments borrow far more money this autumn so that they can restart stalled infrastructure projects. China\u2019s central planners have allowed a series of big local government projects to proceed that had previously been blocked because of debt concerns. This includes the construction of five subway and light rail lines in Changchun, a big industrial city in northeastern China where Toyota, the Japanese automaker, has extensive facilities.The financial markets are getting a boost as well.Meanwhile, the stock market has risen in a move that analysts say has been helped by intervention from big, government-connected investors, a group sometimes known as the National Team. On Friday, Chinese share prices fell to their lowest closing level since early 2016. But through Thursday, the Shanghai stock market had risen almost 2 percent this week.Other data show how China is trying to pull off a difficult balancing act. Even as Chinese officials push for more lending, a broader measure of borrowing showed the overall flow of fresh credit slowed in July. That suggested lingering effects from the authorities\u2019 previous efforts to crack down on some of the murkier parts of the vast but rickety Chinese financial system.Tolerating even more borrowing by heavily indebted local governments is a short-term measure that could create long-term problems.\u201cThe focus is no longer on deleveraging, but on transferring leverage from one sector to another,\u201d said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist.The injections of money by the government into the economy now may offset the withdrawal of money last spring during the deleveraging campaign, but may not be enough to spur an actual boom in the debt-laden Chinese economy, said Rodney Jones, a principal at Wigram Capital Advisors, a Beijing economic research firm.\u201cI\u2019m really skeptical that stimulus creates a surge of growth like we have seen in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI think stimulus takes out some of the downside.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukrainian Separatist Leader Is Killed in Restaurant Bombing", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 The leader of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, a Russian-backed separatist enclave in eastern Ukraine, was killed on Friday when a bomb exploded at a restaurant where he was having dinner, an attack that threatened to set off an escalation of the Ukraine war.The spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, blamed the Ukrainian government, saying that \u201cthere is every reason to suggest that the Kiev regime stands behind this murder.\u201d And Russia\u2019s speaker of Parliament suggested that because the victim, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, was one of the parties who signed a peace agreement with Ukraine called Minsk II, that pact was no longer valid.Ukrainians say Mr. Zakharchenko, a former electrician, filled a mostly figurehead position for the Russian security service agencies that manage and finance the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and they attributed his death to infighting in the rebel ranks or a Russian targeted killing.Mr. Zakharchenko became the latest in a long list of separatist leaders to die in mysterious assassinations. He had reportedly dined often at the restaurant, which was paradoxically called Separ, short for separatist.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia issued a statement that stopped short of directly blaming the Ukrainian government. \u201cThe despicable murder of Aleksandr Zakharchenko is once again evidence that those who chose the path of terror, violence and fear don\u2019t want to find a peaceful, political resolution to the conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are making a dangerous bet on destabilizing the situation.\u201dMr. Zakharchenko, a native of eastern Ukraine who had worked in the region\u2019s mines, was elevated to the leadership role in 2014, putting a local face on the rebellion by replacing a Russian citizen. Infighting soon ensued within the separatists\u2019 leadership.Russian Cossacks, who had sought to carve out their own separatist ministates in the area, were repressed in internecine fighting on the pro-Russian side that by some estimates killed about 100 people.Cossack supporters blamed Russian government-backed forces for several assassinations and attacks, lending credence to the idea that Russia has used targeted killings to retain control over local militias in eastern Ukraine.In 2016 and 2017, two separatist field commanders, Arsen Pavlov, who went by the nom de guerre Motorola, and Mikhail Tolstykh, known as Givi, were killed in assassinations. Then, too, the Russian and Ukrainian authorities blamed one another.In spite of nearly irrefutable evidence of Russia\u2019s military intervention, including a recently released video by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe showing a Russian military convoy crossing the border between Russia and Ukraine, the authorities in Moscow have steadfastly denied any military role in the conflict. The United States and European Union countries brushed aside these denials and imposed sanctions on Russia.The Minsk II peace accord, reached in 2015, tamped down the violence but never stopped the war, which is fought in trenches along a front line between Ukrainian-controlled territory and the two breakaway regions, known as the Donetsk and Luhansk people\u2019s republics.The war has killed more than 10,300 people and was an early phase of what has become a broader conflict between Western nations and Russia in Syria and over Russian meddling in United States elections.Advertisement"}

But his appearance before a judge was a remarkable reversal of fortune for the man who styled himself Mr. Trump\u2019s attack dog and fixer, a man quick with a threat of a libel suit or a promise to destroy journalists who vexed him or his boss. Mr. Cohen was forced to abase himself before a roomful of reporters, admitting to a wide range of serious wrongdoing, including tax evasion and bank fraud \u2014\u00a0while also directly implicating the president of the United States in federal campaign finance violations.In the most explosive admissions, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to committing two federal campaign finance violations on behalf of \u2014 and, according to Mr. Cohen, testifying under oath, \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of\u201d \u2014 President Trump. The charging document describes a scheme to pay off Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, and the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels to buy their silence about their claims of affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen admitted to arranging for American Media, Inc. \u2014 publisher of The National Enquirer \u2014 to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 to keep her story quiet to protect the Trump campaign, thus causing a prohibited corporate campaign contribution. Mr. Cohen also admitted to arranging to pay Ms. Daniels $130,000 for her silence. Because the payment was intended to influence the election by protecting Mr. Trump, this constituted an illegal contribution far in excess of the personal contribution limits. Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement wasn\u2019t a necessary element to Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea, but he supplied it anyway. That implicates the president directly in what might be called \u201ccollusion\u201d: a conspiracy to commit a series of federal crimes, albeit not, in this case anyway, with Russians.But judges can, and often do, give credit for cooperation, and the government can always decide to recommend a lighter sentence later. And federal prosecutors clearly hope that Mr. Cohen will cooperate \u2014 his testimony that Mr. Trump directed his crimes was gratuitous unless prosecutors intended to lock him into that story for possible future use.Mr. Cohen could also provide information to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and testify before a congressional committee investigating the president\u2019s conduct. Mr. Davis suggested Tuesday night that Mr. Cohen has information about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian agents, and perhaps even about Mr. Trump\u2019s foreknowledge and approval of Russian hacking of Democratic servers. That\u2019s dynamite, and much closer to the Russian conspiracy that Mr. Trump has steadfastly denied.If Mr. Cohen has this great dirt, why hasn\u2019t Mr. Mueller already locked him in with a cooperation agreement? Mr. Mueller is a cautious man; Mr. Cohen, manifestly, is not. If the special counsel enlisted Mr. Cohen formally, that agreement would come with all of his credibility problems and tendency to act impetuously. Now Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea has thoroughly rattled the administration. Mr. Trump and his gaffe-prone lawyer Rudy Giuliani react badly to pressure and will most likely respond with incriminating statements. And Mr. Mueller will no doubt be watching. This is what federal prosecutors do best: provoke foolish reactions. Ken White is a former federal prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney at Brown White & Osborn LLP in Los Angeles.

Now he was giving away much of that wealth \u2014 some $500 million worth of GoPro stock \u2014 to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, an organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that would house the assets of the newly formed Jill and Nicholas Woodman Foundation.The executive basked in prestige and gratitude. The Chronicle of Philanthropy named Mr. Woodman one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s most generous donors\u201d that year, placing him alongside established philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg.But four years on, there is almost no trace of the Woodman Foundation, or that $500 million. The foundation has no website and has not listed its areas of focus, and it is not known what \u2014 if any \u2014 significant grants it has made to nonprofits. An extensive search of public records turned up just one beneficiary: the Bonny Doon Art, Wine and Brew Festival, a benefit for an elementary school in California.Instead, the Woodman Foundation essentially exists as an account within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is not required to disclose details about how, if at all, individual donors spend their charitable dollars. Mr. Woodman, GoPro and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation all declined to discuss the Woodman Foundation.If the benefit to the needy is difficult to see, the benefit to Mr. Woodman is clear. After GoPro\u2019s initial public offering, he faced an enormous tax bill in 2014. But by donating via the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, he eased his tax burden in two ways. First, Mr. Woodman avoided paying capital gains taxes on that $500 million worth of stock, a figure that most likely would have been in the tens of millions of dollars. He was also able to claim a charitable deduction that most likely saved millions of dollars more, and probably reduced his personal tax bill for years to come.Mr. Woodman achieved this enticing combination of tax efficiency and secrecy by using a donor-advised fund \u2014 a sort of charitable checking account with serious tax benefits and little or no accountability.Donor-advised funds, or D.A.F.s, allow wealthy individuals like Mr. Woodman to give assets \u2014 usually cash and stock, but also real estate, art and cryptocurrencies \u2014 to a sponsoring organization like the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Fidelity Charitable or Vanguard Charitable. But while donors part ways with their money, they don\u2019t give up control. The sponsoring organizations make grants to hospitals, schools and the like only at a donor\u2019s request. So while donors enjoy immediate tax benefits, charities can wait for funds indefinitely, and maybe forever.For these reasons and more, D.A.F.s have become one of the most controversial issues in the charitable world.Proponents say D.A.F.s have democratized giving, because they are simple to create and the individuals who use them are more generous than those who establish family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d said Greg Avis, interim president of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \u201cThe donor has a tax benefit, and the beneficiaries are the nonprofits.\u201dBut to critics, D.A.F.s represent the worst of philanthropy today \u2014 a system of guaranteed perks for the rich and uncertainty for the rest.Unlike family foundations, which are required to distribute 5 percent of their assets each year and have historically been the way wealthy donors disbursed their philanthropic firepower, D.A.F.s have no distribution requirements, meaning that billions of dollars earmarked for charity can sit idle for decades. And because organizations that manage D.A.F.s are not required to report which funds give money to which causes, it is impossible to know how much money individual donors are giving away to nonprofit organizations.That D.A.F.s have become so popular with Silicon Valley billionaires has only added to their intrigue. Society is still reckoning with the dark sides of social media and online privacy, and there is concern that D.A.F.s \u2014 a dream vehicle for the overnight wealthy \u2014 may prove to be another instance of techno-optimists disrupting a system with unintended consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re a fraud on the American taxpayer,\u201d said Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey\u2019re a way for the affluent to have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dApproaching the Silicon Valley Community Foundation after a tech windfall has become a familiar pattern. In December 2012, just months after Facebook went public, Mr. Zuckerberg donated $500 million of Facebook shares to the group. In 2014, soon after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton donated a combined $846 million to the foundation. In both cases, the establishment of D.A.F.s allowed the men to reap a substantial tax advantage just when they needed it most.Some of this money is put to swift use. Mr. Zuckerberg has used his D.A.F. to give away tens of millions to schools and hospitals in the San Francisco area. Mr. Hastings has used his D.A.F. to give to the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley and the United Negro College Fund. In each case, the donors voluntarily publicized their gifts.Organizations that manage D.A.F.s say most of their account holders, anonymous though they may be, are similarly generous. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation distributed $1.3 billion during the last fiscal year to groups including the South San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Schwab Charitable, another big sponsor of D.A.F.s, said it distributed nearly $2 billion during the last fiscal year, making some 420,000 grants to nonprofits including Feeding America, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.Yet in the case of Mr. Woodman, there is reason to question how much money was made available for charity. He established his D.A.F. the day after GoPro stock approached its highest-ever price, about $95 per share. From a financial perspective, Mr. Woodman could not have timed his gift more perfectly.News of his donation sent GoPro shares tumbling as much as 14 percent the next day, as investors interpreted the move as a lack of confidence in the stock. By the end of the year, GoPro had lost more than a third of its value. By the end of 2015, the stock traded near $18 a share. Today, GoPro stock is worth less than $6 a share.\u201cSmart donors have been playing timing games with the charitable deduction for a long time,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a tax professor at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Columbus School of Law. \u201cIn this case, he potentially gets a very large deduction and gives nothing away. That\u2019s a disturbing public policy issue.\u201dOn Reddit, Mr. Woodman suggested that his wealth was reaching charities: \u201cThe Foundation has gone on to fund causes supporting women and children and will continue to do so!!!!\u201d Just how much money has gone to which organizations, of course, remains a mystery.When it comes to D.A.F.s, the United States tax code rewards the promise of good intentions. Wealthy donors \u2014 including many of the Silicon Valley billionaires who have asked the public to trust them with their digital lives \u2014 pledge to distribute their funds to charity once they get their tax break. But in the absence of rules requiring donors to give their money away, it is hard to know what public good comes in exchange for those lucrative write-offs.Skeptics see a system ripe for abuse. Donors might wait years to engage in meaningful philanthropic activity, or decide to simply leave the fund for their children to manage.\u201cWe\u2019ve put this rule in place that says you get maximum tax benefits when you make a donation,\u201d said Ray Madoff, a professor at the Boston College Law School and a vocal critic of donor-advised funds. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do anything with it.\u201dMs. Norley of Fidelity Charitable argues that on balance, account holders are generous. At her organization, roughly a quarter of the assets held in D.A.F.s have been distributed to nonprofits in each of the past two years. Other sponsor organizations report similar distribution rates.Yet such statistics can be skewed. In many instances, these figures include transfers from one D.A.F. to another. In the most recent fiscal year, for instance, Vanguard Charitable sent more than $15 million from its D.A.F.s to Fidelity Charitable. Sponsor organizations say this is simply a matter of wealthy donors adjusting their accounts. But it also creates the illusion of meaningful philanthropic activity where there is none.And while the overall payout rate at an organization that manages D.A.F.s may be substantial, the numbers could be warped by a few donors who give away huge sums, while a majority of donors give away virtually nothing at all.Critics argue that some sponsor organizations even have an incentive to keep funds undisbursed to charities. That is because D.A.F.s have emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for financial firms.For example, Fidelity Charitable, which is structured as an independent public charity, pays millions in annual fees to Fidelity Management, the big asset manager. Fidelity Management then invests the billions of dollars held in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s D.A.F.s, making money there as well. Vanguard, Schwab and Goldman Sachs all get millions in fees from their affiliated public charities. The more money held in D.A.F.s, the greater the potential earnings for the financial groups.The fact that D.A.F.s have become a profit center for Wall Street firms is a perversion of the philanthropic system, critics say.\u201cThe charitable deduction is not meant to give tax breaks to very wealthy people. It\u2019s meant to encourage giving to worthy nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, an attorney who worked for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, when Mr. Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got instead is a huge warehousing of funds with massive amount of fees being extracted by Wall Street.\u201dFidelity and Goldman brush off such criticism as misinformed, arguing that they are simply providing a valuable service to their clients by streamlining their charitable giving and offering them legal tax benefits. Some D.A.F. sponsors have rules in place that require accounts to disburse at least some money every few years.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Karey Dye, president of the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund, where Laurene Powell Jobs and the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer recently established D.A.F.s. \u201cPeople have irrevocably given money away to charity. Most often they are wanting to give money away to things that are meaningful to them and make a difference.\u201dAt the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the drive to accumulate assets appears to have been particularly intense. Former and current employees said the former chief executive, Emmett Carson, wanted to make the organization one of the largest sponsors of D.A.F.s in the country, and engaged in an arms race of sorts to woo big donors.In spite of his ouster, Mr. Carson appears to have succeeded in his goal. Thanks to big gifts from tech billionaires like Mr. Woodman and Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and the relatively new practice of accepting highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation is now one of the largest such groups in the country, with more than $13 billion in assets.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Washington has tried to take action. The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, was the first law to specifically address D.A.F.s. It established some basic rules that barred self-dealing, but stopped short of more fundamental changes, such as mandated distribution requirements or less generous tax breaks.\u201cWe were basically trying to undo a giveaway by the government,\u201d said Mr. Zerbe, who worked on that bill while he was at the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I\u2019m never convinced we can totally keep the weasels down the hole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lobbyist Sam Patten Pleads Guilty to Steering Foreign Funds to Trump Inaugural", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 An American lobbyist on Friday admitted brokering access to President Trump\u2019s inauguration for a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch in a scheme that highlighted the rush by foreign interests to influence the new administration.As part of a plea agreement under which he pledged to cooperate with federal prosecutors, the lobbyist, Sam Patten, pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent for a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party, and to helping the Ukrainian oligarch who had funded that party illegally purchase four tickets to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.Although the charges were not brought by the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Robert S. Mueller III, they stem from his team\u2019s work, and overlap substantially with its continuing investigation, suggesting that Mr. Patten could be a useful witness.The charges against Mr. Patten also represented the first public acknowledgment that prosecutors are looking into efforts by foreign interests to funnel money into Mr. Trump\u2019s political operation, including his inaugural committee.Prosecutors did not present any evidence that the inaugural committee was aware of the scheme. Questions to representatives of the inaugural committee on Friday about the illegal purchase of tickets went unanswered.During his campaign, Mr. Trump flouted traditional foreign policy by praising President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and suggesting that if elected he might be willing to ease sanctions levied against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine.That alarmed allies of Petro O. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian president, who is generally regarded as more pro-Western, and it emboldened his pro-Russian opponents, who had held power from 2010 to 2014 partly through the efforts of Mr. Manafort and his former right-hand man, Rick Gates.Forced into the opposition, the oligarchs formed a political party called Opposition Bloc, which worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates in 2014, before largely shifting its political consulting and lobbying business to a company started by Mr. Patten and Konstantin V. Kilimnik. He is a Russian national who had worked closely with Mr. Manafort in Ukraine and is suspected by the United States of having ties to Russian intelligence.Prosecutors contend that Mr. Patten should have disclosed the work, which included lobbying and public relations assistance intended to \u201cinfluence United States policy,\u201d with the Justice Department pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Mr. Patten also attended an unspecified inaugural event with the oligarch, according to prosecutors. They contend that Mr. Patten arranged for the purchase of four tickets for $50,000 by funneling the oligarch\u2019s money through an American \u201cstraw\u201d purchaser in violation of rules barring the inaugural committee from accepting money from foreign nationals.Mr. Patten\u2019s lawyer declined to comment after a Friday court hearing in which Mr. Patten entered his guilty plea. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He was released after the hearing and awaits sentencing.Prosecutors did not identify the American who purchased the tickets, the oligarch or Mr. Patten\u2019s Russian business partner by name.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.And the description of the oligarch matches that of Serhiy Lyovochkin, who serves in the Ukrainian parliament and is an official in the Opposition Bloc, according to interviews and documents. Prosecutors say that Mr. Patten arranged meetings with congressional officials for the oligarch, and one former congressional aide recalled being introduced to Mr. Lyovochkin by Mr. Patten.Prosecutors also said that Mr. Patten helped the oligarch draft and place an op-ed in an American media outlet in February 2017 \u201cto address concerns regarding Ukraine\u2019s ability to work effectively with the new United States administration.\u201dA representative of U.S. News said editors had not been contacted by anyone in law enforcement about the op-ed.Mr. Lyovochkin surfaced prominently in the financial fraud trial last month of Mr. Manafort. Mr. Gates, Mr. Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman and Mr. Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man, testified that Mr. Lyovochkin was one of a clutch of oligarchs who paid Mr. Manafort more than $60 million to promote pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine.With Mr. Manafort\u2019s help, Mr. Yanukovych was elected president of Ukraine in 2010, a position he held for four years until he fled to Russia amid a popular uprising against his regime\u2019s corruption.Mr. Gates testified that Mr. Lyovochkin wired millions of dollars to Mr. Manafort\u2019s secret bank accounts from bank accounts in Cyprus held in the names of two shell companies to Mr. Manafort\u2019s secret bank accounts. Like the other Ukrainian oligarchs who financed Mr. Manafort\u2019s work, Mr. Lyovochkin was one of the top officials in Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government.After Mr. Yanukovych was forced out of office, the oligarchs regrouped into an opposition force, continuing to pay Mr. Manafort for a time to help promote their views in the West.Mr. Patten traveled in the same lucrative foreign consulting circles as Mr. Manafort, but people who know them said their primary connection was through Mr. Kilimnik.Mr. Patten was born into elite Washington, as a grandson of the Georgetown socialite Susan Mary Alsop.He worked in Washington Republican politics, including for the State Department under President George W. Bush, and briefly for Senator Susan Collins of Maine.But Mr. Patten really made his name in international political consulting, coming to specialize in representing clients in former Soviet states. He worked with Mr. Kilimnik in the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute in the early 2000s.In Ukraine, Mr. Patten and Mr. Kilimnik worked on the 2014 campaign of the former boxer Vitali Klitschko for mayor of Kiev, which was also supported by Mr. Lyovochkin.And Mr. Patten also worked extensively for interests in Kazakhstan.Mr. Patten also had a yearslong business relationship with Cambridge Analytica, the political data firm that worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Starting in 2014, the firm used Mr. Patten as a consultant for election campaigns and other projects in Africa, Europe and the United States, according to a person with direct knowledge of his activities.During the same year, Cambridge Analytica sought to drum up business in Russia, approaching the Russian oil giant Lukoil.In a Facebook post, Mr. Patten said he deeply regretted his failure to register as a foreign agent and was \u201cashamed\u201d that he had undermined much of his life\u2019s work, which he said had largely focused on promoting democracy abroad.Eileen Sullivan and Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

At some point, being good with money requires something a bit more difficult: earning more of it. As awkward as the conversation can be, making more money often means asking for more money. But for many of us, the idea of asking for a raise is unimaginably awkward. It feels audacious and greedy, like you might as well be asking for a kidney or firstborn child.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re limited to that opportunity to discuss your salary and seek an adjustment,\u201d Ms. Smiley said.\u201cYou want to enter a salary negotiation on a high note, with indisputable evidence of the value you\u2019re contributing to the company,\u201d Ms. Smiley said.

You also want to show you\u2019re engaged, Ms. Smiley said. Try something like: \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying my work. Leading the Big Win Project was especially rewarding.\u201d From there, go in for the ask. If you\u2019re looking for a raise to match a new or enhanced role at your company, here\u2019s what you can say: \u201cTaking into consideration my experience and the responsibilities of this position, my salary expectation is X dollars.\u201d If you\u2019re simply asking for a raise in your current role, this will do: \u201cBased on my successful track record in this role, I\u2019m requesting a salary lift of X percent.\u201dAgain, speaking up can often be more difficult for women or people who aren\u2019t socialized to be assertive.

Or speaking up when you want a different table at a restaurant. Get comfortable asking for small things, which will make it easier to ask for something big, like a raise.\u201cAnd make sure you book another review in six months to discuss progress and compensation.\u201d Set the expectation that once you further develop these skills, it will be time to revisit the compensation conversation.Remember, this can be a difficult conversation to have.

{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Big Banks Have Stranglehold on Consumers, Government Says", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Australia\u2019s four biggest banks have used their dominant position to exploit customers, deliver inferior products, charge exorbitant fees and block competition, according to a new government report calling for more competition and integrity in the industry.\u201cPower needs to be put back in the hands of the customer,\u201d the country\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, said on Friday in prepared remarks introducing the report. \u201cToo often, we have also become willing participants in a game where the deck is stacked against us.\u201dThe report calls for more transparency to empower consumers, and urges regulators and banks to prioritize competition, not just stability.The recommendations, however, represent a market-based tweak rather than a major overhaul, and many legal and financial experts questioned whether the government\u2019s approach would be sufficient to restore public trust.\u201cI suspect we\u2019re going to end up with no major change,\u201d said Cameron Murray, an economist at the University of Queensland and an author of a book on Australian banking, \u201cGame of Mates.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t address it \u2014 this banking cartel \u2014 by imagining there\u2019s some arrangement where it\u2019s not a cartel and that some sort of free-market competition will occur.\u201dAnd now, after 26 years without a recession in the country, with pressure for growth intensifying as the real estate market cools, the banking industry\u2019s everyday practices \u2014 along with incidents of malfeasance \u2014 have prompted intense outrage and demands for change.Banks and other major financial institutions were also found to have charged customers for financial advice when they knew it would not be given; to have forged documents; and to have repeatedly failed to verify customers\u2019 living expenses before lending them money.They also sold insurance to people they knew could not afford it, and lied to industry regulators, who have generally been too weak to do much about it, according to the findings and experts.The cavalier behavior, experts say, is a byproduct of the dominance of Australia\u2019s biggest banks.Australia established a policy of prioritizing the country\u2019s four largest homegrown banks with a so-called four pillars policy, which was instituted in 1990 to prevent any merger between Australia\u2019s major banks: National Australia Bank; the Commonwealth Bank, which was owned by the government until 1996; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, otherwise known as ANZ; and Westpac.The banking business evolved with all four growing together. They operated with a heavy reliance on mortgages and on neighborhood branches, experts say, making it harder for international players to break in.Regulators have long complained about lacking the resources to police the banks, even as they grew and developed a vast array of products that were often hard to differentiate or understand.\u201cThere is evidence that they have sustained prices above competitive levels, offered inferior quality products to some groups of customers (particularly those customers unlikely to change providers), subsumed much of the broker industry and taken action that would inhibit the expansion of smaller competitors in some markets,\u201d the report said. \u201cAll are indicators of the use of market power to the detriment of consumers.\u201dMr. Morrison put it more bluntly: \u201cBanks have made this mess for themselves. They should play a key role in cleaning shop.\u201dHe warned that change had already arrived, and would be accelerating.He said the commission\u2019s recommendation for banks to create an \u201cintegrity officer\u201d to monitor mortgage brokers was \u201can interesting idea\u201d that could have broader application.He also noted that the banking sector would soon have to embrace transparency for its customers.Other financial information, like mortgage information, will follow.\u201cThe solution is the empowerment of the customer,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cGiving them better information, giving them access to their own data, and giving them the chance to go out and get a better deal.\u201dThe changes are also part of an effort to open up the banking sector to new competitors, including online start-ups. This year, the government passed legislation to ease restrictions on use of the word \u201cbank,\u201d which had been allowed only for financial institutions with more than 50 million Australian dollars, or about $37 million, in capital.That change has led to at least 58 new entrants, Mr. Morrison said.But some experts and former officials question whether increased transparency and encouraging competition would check the banks\u2019 behavior.Former regulators in Australia argue that the banking laws and enforcement mechanisms still do not include the kinds of financial penalties that would alter behavior. The only way to make the big banks and other financial players behave is with the realistic threat of punishment and large penalties, according to one former official now working in the industry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.Experts with experience in Australian banking and finance agree. The country, they note, is still too cozy in its culture when it comes to who manages and regulates finance, and nothing in the current plan seeks to significantly change that.\u201cWe need to think about how to construct regulatory institutions that have an incentive to enforce the rules we create,\u201d said Mr. Murray, the \u201cGame of Mates\u201d author. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think about how we structure those organizations better, and how we source expertise.\u201dHe added: \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s better to source expertise abroad, from people who are familiar with banking systems in Asia or Europe, and who can come down here and have no trouble cracking down on ANZ or Westpac because they\u2019re not mates.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the governmental body that identified patterns of systemic abuse by banks, insurance and other Australian financial firms. It was a royal commission, not a parliamentary group.Lewis Fischer and Jacqueline Williams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Do You Get Better Schools? Take the State to Court, More Advocates Say", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy his own account, Alejandro Cruz-Guzman\u2019s five children have received a good education at public schools in St. Paul. His two oldest daughters are starting careers in finance and teaching. Another daughter, a high-school student, plans to become a doctor.But their success, Mr. Cruz-Guzman said, flows partly from the fact that he and his wife fought for their children to attend racially integrated schools outside their neighborhood. Their two youngest children take a bus 30 minutes each way to Murray Middle School, where the student population is about one-third white, one-third black, 16 percent Asian and 9 percent Latino.\u201cI wanted to have my kids exposed to different cultures and learn from different people,\u201d said Mr. Cruz-Guzman, who owns a small flooring company and is an immigrant from Mexico. When his two oldest children briefly attended a charter school that was close to 100 percent Latino, he said he had realized, \u201cWe are limiting our kids to one community.\u201dNow Mr. Cruz-Guzman is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit saying that Minnesota knowingly allowed towns and cities to set policies and zoning boundaries that led to segregated schools, lowering test scores and graduation rates for low-income and nonwhite children. Last month, the state\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the suit could move forward, in a decision advocates across the country hailed as important.The case is part of a wave of lawsuits over the quality of schools in more than a half-dozen states. The suits could serve as road maps for advocates in other states amid a nationwide teachers\u2019 movement and a push in some state legislatures for more school funding.The legal complaints have different areas of focus \u2014 from school funding to segregation to literacy \u2014 but all of them argue that the states are violating their constitutions by denying children a quality education.\u201cThe courthouse doors are in effect open again,\u201d said David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center, which has argued school funding cases in New Jersey and has filed amicus briefs in several of the current cases. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing are the beginnings of a broader conversation about what the right to an education should look like.\u201dBut almost every state constitution guarantees the right to an adequate education. Now, the questions making their way from campuses to the courts concern what an adequate education should consist of, and to what extent factors like money and demographics make a difference.The lawyers who brought the federal literacy case in Michigan plan to file an appeal, and are pursuing a similar, state-level claim in California. They argue that poor students are not getting the basic reading and writing skills necessary to function as citizens in a democratic society.In New Mexico last month, a state district court judge ruled that the state is underfunding schools, particularly those that serve large numbers of Native American, Hispanic and low-income students. The judge set a deadline of April 15 for the state to establish a new funding system for schools and even suggested which taxes could be raised to do so. She listed preschool, summer school, after-school programs and literacy programs as those that should be expanded. The state is expected to appeal the decision.Part of what has changed is the evidence used in such cases. Over the past 10 years, as most states set new academic standards, test score data has revealed how many children are attending schools that fail to meet more challenging academic goals.In New Mexico, which has one of the highest child poverty rates in the nation, three-quarters of fourth and eighth graders are not proficient in reading, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. A growing body of research suggests that both more funding and greater racial and socioeconomic integration of schools can help improve those numbers.Not all experts are persuaded by such research. Eric Hanushek, an economist who testified on behalf of the state in the New Mexico case, said that, nationally, education spending has increased over the past two decades without significant improvements in student achievement. He argued that instead of lowering class sizes or raising teacher pay across the board, only the most effective teachers should be paid more.\u201cI don\u2019t think that these are constitutional issues,\u201d said Mr. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. \u201cHow do you make sure you spend money well?\u201dHe said he was more sympathetic to the argument that desegregation could raise student achievement, but he was skeptical that a large-scale solution could be found.Daniel Shulman, the lead lawyer in the Minnesota desegregation suit, said he was looking at remedies such as a regional busing program, similar to the ones used, successfully, by some North Carolina counties in the decades after Brown v. Board of Education, the United States Supreme Court decision in 1954 declaring that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.\u201cIf the entire seven-county area is part of a remedy, there won\u2019t be white flight,\u201d Mr. Shulman said. \u201cWhere are they going to go?\u201dNot all Twin Cities education reformers are enthusiastic about the case. Charter school leaders are especially nervous, since many of their schools serve student bodies that are close to 100 percent nonwhite and poor in urban areas, or, in the suburbs, overwhelmingly white. The lawsuit says that the state has erred in exempting charter schools from desegregation requirements.Khulia Pringle is an education consultant and former charter school teacher whose daughter attended a St. Paul charter school that was overwhelmingly black and low income. She said such schools can be \u201cculturally affirming\u201d to nonwhite children like her daughter, who may face discrimination from white teachers and administrators in traditional schools.\u201cIf schools in urban areas need more resources, then they should get more resources. It shouldn\u2019t take busing kids to white schools to get those resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sends a message to black children that the only way you\u2019re going to succeed is to get bused to a white school, leave this ghetto and get out of your neighborhood.\u201dSome longstanding desegregation programs, like one in Hartford, Conn., bus white children to magnet schools in nonwhite neighborhoods, in addition to busing nonwhite and poor children to suburban schools. Ms. Pringle said she had no problem with such a plan, but only if it were voluntary and driven by family choice \u2014 not an integration mandate from the courts.\u201cThe focus shouldn\u2019t be \u2018Let\u2019s get the white kids into this black school,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIf white kids are going to go, they are going to go because it\u2019s a good school.\u201dJustice Natalie E. Hudson, the Minnesota Supreme Court judge who wrote the majority opinion last month allowing the case to move toward trial, suggested that a segregated school system could not be constitutional, even if the causes of segregation look very different today than they did in past decades.\u201cIt is self-evident that a segregated system of public schools is not \u2018general,\u2019 \u2018uniform,\u2019 \u2018thorough\u2019 or \u2018efficient,\u2019\u201d Justice Hudson wrote, quoting the state Constitution. \u201cWe will not shy away from our proper role to provide remedies for violations of fundamental rights merely because education is a complex area.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indonesia\u2019s Presidential Race Takes Shape, in Shadow of Hard-Line Islam", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s presidential election next year will be a rematch of the contentious 2014 contest, and analysts fear it will see a return of the smear campaigns and appeals to sectarian intolerance that marred that vote.On Friday, President Joko Widodo and his 2014 opponent, the former army general Prabowo Subianto, both filed paperwork declaring their intent to run in the election next April. Friday was the deadline for candidates to register, and no others did.Analysts of Indonesian politics said they feared the election would be blighted by social media campaigns of the kind seen in 2014, which falsely asserted that Mr. Joko was an ethnic Chinese Christian. (He is a Muslim of Javanese descent.) The small but influential ethnic Chinese community is resented by many Indonesians, and it has suffered persecution and state-sponsored discrimination in the past.\u201cThey will be looking around for sure to pick up on some religious-based scandal,\u201d said Stephen Sherlock, a professor of politics at the University of New South Wales who studies Indonesia.\u201cWhat we have been doing is four years of proof \u2014 and proof is not fiction,\u201d Mr. Joko said Friday at the office of the General Elections Commission in Jakarta after submitting the paperwork declaring his intent to run. \u201cThis is the foundation that has been built, that still needs to be connected, that still needs to be continued.\u201dRecent surveys have put the president far ahead of Mr. Prabowo, by margins of 15 to 20 percentage points. But Mr. Basuki, the president\u2019s now-jailed ally, also had a double-digit poll lead in his campaign for re-election as Jakarta\u2019s governor before Islamic groups began campaigning against him in earnest.The Islamic organizations seized on a lighthearted reference to a Quran verse that Mr. Basuki made during a speech, as part of an argument that it was acceptable for Muslims to vote for a non-Muslim candidate. The Islamic groups staged large street demonstrations in Jakarta against the governor, including one in November 2016 that became violent.Mr. Prabowo and his political ally Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former president, were widely suspected of orchestrating the protests against Mr. Basuki to embarrass and weaken Mr. Joko, allegations that both men denied. (Mr. Yudhoyono\u2019s son, Agus Yudhoyono, had also been a candidate in the Jakarta governor election.)Some analysts saw the campaign against Mr. Basuki as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the presidential contest.Mr. Joko selected Ma\u2019ruf Amin, a prominent conservative Islamic scholar and cleric, as his running mate, seemingly in hopes of warding off attacks from hard-line activists. Mr. Ma\u2019ruf, 75, is the chairman of the Indonesia Ulema Council, the country\u2019s largest body of clerics, which supported the prosecution of Mr. Basuki.\u201cWe fight for all Indonesians regardless of their ethnicity, ethnic group, religious group, whatever their race,\u201d Mr. Prabowo said Friday after filing his campaign paperwork. \u201cAll Indonesians, our people, we will defend, we will fight for their rights.\u201dDuring the 2014 campaign, Mr. Joko was accused of being a member of the Indonesian Communist Party, which was banned in 1965 after an attempted coup. Hundreds of thousands of people accused of being communist sympathizers were killed by the military and armed vigilante groups in the years that followed.Some analysts expect the election to hinge less on religious sentiments than on the economy, which has been growing at an annual rate of about 5 percent \u2014 a disappointing figure, for Indonesia \u2014 amid shrinking foreign and domestic investment.Economic inequality has also deepened since Mr. Joko\u2019s first term, said Didik J. Rachbini, a prominent economist who founded the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance in Jakarta.\u201cIt\u2019s consumers who are contributing to the 4.9 percent or 5 percent growth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not from the budget and not from investment. Economic growth otherwise the past three years has been almost nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the U.S. Is Fighting Russian Election Interference", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Trump administration officials warned on Thursday that Russia is trying to interfere in November\u2019s midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election and vowed to combat Moscow\u2019s aggression.\u201cThis is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus,\u201d said the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.Here is what you need to know about Russia\u2019s interference and American efforts to fight it.Russia is trying to spread propaganda on hot-button issues using social media, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has said, highlighting what he called persistent and pervasive efforts. Moscow\u2019s strategy, he said, is to exacerbate sociopolitical divisions.Mr. Coats again singled out Russia on Thursday, saying its disinformation campaign is ongoing. \u201cWe continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States,\u201d Mr. Coats said at the White House. Mr. Wray also cited attempts to manipulate news stories, spread disinformation and escalate divisive issues.Intelligence and law enforcement officials are also looking out for voter suppression efforts, illegal campaign financing, hacks targeting elected officials and voting infrastructure, he said.As for computer security, experts see political campaigns as vulnerable, particularly in state and local elections, where campaigns frequently lack the money and expertise to forestall attacks. Microsoft detected spear-phishing attacks, apparently by Russian intelligence, targeting computers of two 2018 election candidates, a senior company official said last month; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat seeking re-election, said last week that her Senate office computer network was one of them.\u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong. But I think we\u2019ll see attacks on campaigns in which the Russians in particular have already stolen information,\u201d said Eric Rosenbach, an intelligence veteran and cybersecurity expert at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.Nationally, the two major political parties stepped up security after the 2016 breach of computers at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Voting machines, often described as old, insecure and lacking a paper trail, are more secure than widely understood. Four in five Americans vote on machines that incorporate paper ballots or backups. Many state voter-registration databases also have been hardened against outside attack since 2016. While it is possible to hack voting devices to rig an election, experts say, intruding into enough of them to change the outcome would be extremely difficult.Election officials and the Department of Homeland Security set up a council to coordinate the response to threats, and the department offers security scans, equipment and other services to election officials nationwide. Top state election officials are gaining security clearances to see and assess threats, and in February, all 50 states and more than 1,000 localities opened a center to exchange data. Virtually every state has taken steps to lock down its election processes.A public-private committee has also approved a new standard for voting equipment that will significantly improve security. More voting machines than ever have verifiable paper backups, and nearly all should have them by 2020, said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. States also are adopting more advanced auditing techniques for vote counts.The most important work the intelligence community has done, according to current and former officials, is to penetrate foreign networks and spy on Russian groups conducting the attacks. The agencies have also monitored networks in the United States to try to detect information campaigns as they begin.\u201cThey are gathering intelligence,\u201d said Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department official who is now a partner at Perkins Coie. \u201cThey are trying to figure out what our adversaries are planning and what is being done. That includes penetrating foreign networks and other kinds of spying they do. And they are doing surveillance on U.S. networks to detect influence of all kinds.\u201dIntelligence agencies are working more closely with technology companies, though some firms have said too little intelligence has been shared, hampering Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to detect threats and warn Americans.Mr. Coats has said the intelligence agencies and White House consider threats to the electoral system a top priority. Mr. Coats has called not just on technology companies to boost protections but also to make sure Americans take steps to verify the information they consume. \u201cIt is essential that we all apply critical thinking to all sorts of information,\u201d he said.Mr. Coats\u2019s appearance at the White House was important for informing the public, said Laura Rosenberger, a former Obama administration official and the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cBuilding resiliency in the population is really important to inoculate against the effect of some of this,\u201d she said.Cybersecurity experts praised Thursday\u2019s briefing as an important step to bringing high-level focus to the fight against interference. But they said that to deter Russia, Moscow needs to believe that the United States will impose costs beyond the sanctions and other punishments it has doled out, and that requires Mr. Trump to make clear he will act against interference.\u201cIf you are going to stop what is going on, that could require a presidential-level decision,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said.An earlier version of this article misspelled on a second reference the last name of a former Justice Department official. He is Michael Sussmann, not Sussman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Benefits by Bankrolling an Anti-Migrant Effort. Niger Pays a Price.", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "Niger has been well paid for drastically reducing the number of African migrants using the country as a conduit to Europe. But the effort has hurt parts of the economy and raised security concerns.Supported byDIRKOU, Niger \u2014 The heavily armed troops are positioned around oases in Niger\u2019s vast northern desert, where temperatures routinely climb beyond 100 degrees.While both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have branches operating in the area, the mission of the government forces here is not to combat jihadism.Instead, these Nigerien soldiers are battling human smugglers, who transport migrants across the harsh landscape, where hundreds of miles of dunes separate solitary trees.The migrants are hoping to reach neighboring Libya, and from there, try a treacherous, often deadly crossing of the Mediterranean to reach Europe.The toll of the military engagement is high. Some smugglers are armed, militants are rife and the terrain is unforgiving: Each mission, lasting two weeks, requires 50 new truck tires to replace the ones shredded in the blistering, rocky sand.But the operation has had an impact: Niger has drastically reduced the number of people moving north to Libya through its territory over the past two years.The law\u2019s effect has been significant. At the peak in 2015, there were 5,000 to 7,000 migrants a week traveling through Niger to Libya. The criminalization of smuggling has reduced those numbers to about 1,000 people a week now, according to I.O.M. figures.As a result, the overall flow of people has now gone into a notable reverse: For the last two years, more African migrants have been leaving Libya to return to their homelands than entering the country from Niger, according to the I.O.M.One of Niger\u2019s biggest bus companies, Rimbo, used to send four migrant-filled buses each day from the country\u2019s capital in the south, Niamey, to the northern city of Agadez, a jumping off point for the trip to the Libyan border.Now, the company has signed a two-year contract with the I.O.M. to carry migrants the other way, so they can be repatriated.On a recent breezy evening in Niamey, a convoy of four Rimbo buses rolled through the dusty streets after an arduous 20-hour drive from Agadez, carrying 400 migrants. They were headed back home to countries across West Africa, including Guinea, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.For leaders in Europe, this change in migrant flows is welcome news, and a testament to Niger\u2019s dedication to shared goals.\u201cNiger really became one of our best allies in the region,\u201d said Raul Mateus Paula, the bloc\u2019s ambassador to Niger.But the country\u2019s achievement has also come with considerable costs, including on those migrants still determined to make it to Libya, who take more risks than ever before. Drivers now take routes hundreds of miles away from water points and go through mined areas to avoid military patrols. When smugglers learn the military is in the area, they often abandon migrants in the desert to escape arrest.This has led to dozens of deaths by dehydration over the past two years, prompting Niger\u2019s civil protection agency and the I.O.M. to launch weekly rescue patrols.The agency\u2019s head, Adam Kamassi, said his team usually rescues between 20 to 50 people every time it goes out. On those trips, it nearly always finds three or four bodies.The crackdown on human smuggling has also been accompanied by economic decline and security concerns for Niger.The government\u2019s closure of migrant routes has caused an increase in unemployment and an uptick in other criminal activity like drug smuggling and robbery, according to a Niger military intelligence document.\u201cI know of about 20 people who have become bandits for lack of work,\u201d said Mahamadou Issouf, who has been driving migrants from Agadez to southern Libya since 2005, but who no longer has work.Earlier this year, the army caught him driving 31 migrants near a spot in the desert called the Puit d\u2019Espoir, or Well of Hope. While the army released him in this case, drivers who worked for him have been imprisoned and two of his trucks impounded.The military intelligence document also noted that since the crackdown, towns along the migrant route are having a hard time paying for essential services like schools and health clinics, which had relied on money from migration and the industries feeding it.For example, the health clinic in Dirkou, once a major migrant way station in northern Niger, now has fewer paying clients because the number of migrants seeking has dwindled. Store owners who relied on the steady flow of people traveling through have gone bankrupt.Hassan Mohammed is another former migrant smuggler who lost his livelihood in the crackdown.A native of Dirkou, Mr. Mohammed, 31, began driving migrants across the desert in 2002, earning enough in the process to buy two Toyota pickup trucks. The smuggling operation grew enough that he began employing his younger brothers to drive.Today, Mr. Mohammed\u2019s brothers are in prison, serving the six-month sentences convicted smuggler drivers face. His two pickup trucks are gathering dust, along with a few dozen other confiscated vehicles, on a Niger army base. With no income, Mr. Mohammed now relies on the generosity of friends to survive.Not all the migrants returning through Niger end up in their home countries, but remain in the country, competing for scarce jobs.With Europe as a primary beneficiary of the smuggling crackdown, the European Union is eager to keep the effort in place, and some of the bloc\u2019s aid finances a project to convert former smugglers into entrepreneurs. But the project is still in its pilot stage more than two years after the migrant crackdown began.Ibrahim Yacouba, the former foreign minister of Niger, who resigned earlier this year, said, \u201cThere are lots of announcements of millions of euros in funding, but in the lived reality of those who are in the industry, there has been no change.\u201dThe crackdown has also raised security concerns, as France has taken additional steps to stop migration along the Niger-Libya border that go beyond its asylum-processing center.From its military base in the northern Nigerien outpost of Madama, France funded last year an ethnic Toubou militia in southern Libya, with the goal of using the group to help stop smugglers, according to Nigerien security officials.This rankled the Nigerien military because the militia is headed by an ex-Nigerien rebel, Barka Sidimi, who is considered a major security risk by the country\u2019s officials. To military leaders, this was an example of a European anti-migrant policy taking precedent over Niger\u2019s own security.A French military spokesperson said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have information about the collaboration you speak of.\u201dDespite the country\u2019s progress in reducing the flow of migrants, Nigerien officials know the problem of human smugglers using the country as a conduit is not going away.\u201cThe fight against clandestine migration is not winnable,\u2019\u2019 said Mohamed Bazoum, Niger\u2019s interior minister.Even as Libya has experienced a net drop in migrants, new routes have opened up: More migrants are now entering Algeria and transiting to Morocco to attempt a Mediterranean crossing there, according to Giuseppe Loprete, who recently left his post after being the I.O.M.\u2019s director in Niger for four years.But despite the drawbacks that come with it, the smuggling crackdown will continue, at least for now, according to Mr. Bazoum, the interior minister. Migrant smuggling and trafficking, he said, \u201ccreates a context of a criminal economy, and we are against all forms of economic crime to preserve the stability and security of our country.\u201dFor Mr. Mohammed, the former smuggler, the crackdown has left him idle and dejected, with no employment prospects.\u201cThere\u2019s no project for any of us here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on. I only sleep and wake up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

At a time of confusion and nastiness over immigration, it is worth recalling that he joined with Senator Edward Kennedy in 2005 and then again in 2007 to push a grand compromise that paired stronger controls at the border with a path to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 or so million undocumented immigrants.At a time when the political system is once again drowning in money from special interests, it is worth recalling that back in the early 2000s he co-wrote, with Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, a landmark bill to tighten the post-Watergate campaign finance reform laws.The campaign finance reform effort eventually succeeded, named for a companion bill in the House sponsored by Chris Shays, a Republican from Connecticut, and Marty Meehan, a Democrat from Massachusetts. The climate and immigration bills did not succeed, partly for want of Republican support. But even in defeat, Mr. McCain, through his willingness to tackle thorny and even politically toxic issues, gave hope for the future. His example still does.A military man to the core, and the son and grandson of two decorated admirals, Mr. McCain held views on foreign and defense policy that were relentlessly hawkish; he lobbied hard for the ruinously misguided invasion of Iraq, as well as the bombing of Libya. At the same time, and despite his brutal treatment as a prisoner of war, he strongly supported Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s efforts to normalize relations with Vietnam.Mr. McCain\u2019s decision against demanding an eye for an eye when Mr. Bush and his henchmen savaged him and his family in the South Carolina primary campaign, one of the most vicious and depressing in modern times, earned him further credit. Yet he lost it all, and then some, when he deployed the same tactics against Barack Obama in the 2008 campaign. Having stood up at one point to a woman who called Mr. Obama an untrustworthy \u201cArab\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain seized her microphone and said: \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. He\u2019s a decent family man, citizen\u201d \u2014 he then allowed his own campaign, and himself, to descend to the same debased level, portraying Mr. Obama as a shadowy, untrustworthy and even unpatriotic figure. No campaign decision drew more criticism than his ill-considered selection of a running mate in Sarah Palin, whom he hardly knew and who went so far as to charge Mr. Obama with \u201cpalling around with terrorists.\u201dMr. McCain\u2019s final years in the Senate were a similar mix of independence and fealty to party norms. Last summer, he dramatically entered the Senate chamber and cast a decisive vote against the administration\u2019s ghastly health care bill, partly on grounds that it had been concocted in haste and without hearings and had thus failed the basic requirements of sound legislative process. But not long afterward, he voted in favor of a similarly ill-conceived, backward-looking tax bill. (Mr. McCain was absent for medical reasons when the bill came up for final passage three weeks later and he did not cast a vote).That vote provided precisely the kind of opportunity for one last display of the adventurous bipartisanship for which Mr. McCain was so well known. It was not to be. Still, there had been plenty such moments in a long and distinguished career. Mr. McCain was a charming, imperfect man, driven by a code of honor and self-aware enough to know when he had violated it. A Senate where the phrase \u201chappy warrior\u201d is an oxymoron will miss him.An earlier version of this editorial stated that Senator McCain voted for the 2017 tax bill. Mr. McCain voted yes on a preliminary version of the bill but did not cast a vote on final passage because he was absent for medical reasons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Pitch to Take Tesla Private Has Wall Street Salivating", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExecutives at banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are discussing ways a deal could be structured, angling to land the potentially prestigious assignment of taking the maker of electric cars off public markets, according to people familiar with the discussions. Bankers and lawyers on Wall Street said any deal is likely to be valued at $10 billion to $20 billion.Some of Tesla\u2019s big institutional investors \u2014 including Fidelity and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2014 also were blindsided by Mr. Musk\u2019s comments, according to people close to those companies.On Wednesday, officials from the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla officials to inquire about Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. The S.E.C. officials asked Tesla about the veracity of Mr. Musk\u2019s comments and why the company did not make an announcement via a regulatory filing. Tesla shares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday.The S.E.C. declined to comment on its inquiry. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the inquiry.A deal to take Tesla private could generate a gusher of fees for Wall Street, and bankers are scrambling to position themselves for an assignment. One way to do that is to come up with possible structures for a deal that they can pitch to Tesla and its advisers.The traditional way for a publicly traded company to go private is through a leveraged buyout, in which private equity firms or other investors purchase all of the outstanding public shares with money they have borrowed from banks or other sources.But investment bankers said on Wednesday that a leveraged buyout of Tesla \u2014 which in theory could cost as much as $70 billion if all of Tesla\u2019s shares were bought at the price of $420 a share that Mr. Musk floated \u2014 is likely a nonstarter. The company, which has never turned a profit, is burning through cash so quickly that it would be hard to find banks or bond investors willing to lend tens of billions of dollars to finance a private buyout.\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t work as it is,\u201d said Ronald A. Kahn, the head of the debt advisory and valuation practice at Chicago-based investment bank Lincoln International. \u201cWhy would anyone even give him a few billion more?\u201dThat does not mean, however, that a deal to take Tesla private is off the table.One structure being studied by banks and Tesla, according to people familiar with the matter, is a transaction that would reduce the number of shareholders to such a degree that Tesla\u2019s shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange and the company no longer would be required to make quarterly filings with the S.E.C.That would be expensive \u2014 it could cost $10 billion to $20 billion \u2014 but much less so than a full leveraged buyout, these people said.How might such a transaction work?One possibility is a maneuver called \u201cgoing dark.\u201d In this situation, Tesla could buy out many but not all of its shareholders to reduce the total number of investors who hold Tesla stock. One way to make that math work would be to persuade as many small shareholders as possible to sell their holdings.The largest shareholders of the company \u2014 including Mr. Musk, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, who collectively own about 45 percent of Tesla shares \u2014 would not need to sell their stakes under that arrangement.Tesla\u2019s shares would no longer be listed on the Nasdaq, but investors could buy or sell them on loosely regulated, over-the-counter markets that are typically the domain of small companies. Because shares on these exchanges are generally traded less heavily than those on larger public markets, it would likely be harder for investors to bet against, or short, Tesla\u2019s stock, which is one of the rationales Mr. Musk outlined on Tuesday for taking the company private.There are many potential problems with this approach. For example, institutional and individual investors are likely to object to holding Tesla shares that do not trade on mainstream national exchanges. In addition, index funds that own Tesla stock could probably not hold the shares if they were not part of benchmarks like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Going-dark transactions traditionally have been the province of tiny companies, said Gilbert J. Bradshaw, a New York lawyer who works with small companies and has written about companies going dark.\u201cI don\u2019t know of any large company that has done a voluntary deal like this,\u201d he said.Kate Kelly, Landon Thomas Jr., Matt Phillips, Emily Flitter and Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cynthia Nixon Says She Can Win. But Who Are Her Voters?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBonsu Thompson was, by his own admission, an unlikely host for a fund-raiser for Cynthia Nixon\u2019s campaign.Mr. Thompson, a writer and producer, had never organized an event for a candidate before. Usually, he found politics distasteful. \u201cFolks who know me know that I\u2019m not exactly a political person,\u201d Mr. Thompson told the crowd of roughly 150 people gathered on the Bowery Hotel\u2019s rooftop for the Aug. 1 event.\u201cPolls are not capturing who the new electorate is,\u201d Ms. Nixon said. \u201cWe have a younger, more progressive, more diverse electorate. Those are the people that are going to turn out for me.\u201dL. Joy Williams, a senior adviser to the campaign, described the approach as seeking out the voters that most campaigns left \u201con the table.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten people who say, \u2018No one has ever knocked on my door for a campaign,\u2019\u201d Ms. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s really engaging those pockets all across the state that exist, engaging them because no one has ever engaged them in a real discussion.\u201dDismissing the polls in favor of anecdotes about \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cexcitement\u201d may seem like at best an excuse and at worst a delusion for a candidate who is 30 points behind. Ms. Nixon herself has acknowledged her path to victory is narrow. But there are reasons to not completely discount her approach.Much of the campaign\u2019s attempts to woo disengaged voters has unfolded digitally. The campaign has blasted registered Democrats with text messages and recruited longtime Instagram followers for canvassing shifts.Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign page has run more than twice as many Facebook advertisements as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s has since May, according to the social media site\u2019s political advertisements archive, although the governor\u2019s team said those numbers did not account for how many people actually saw each post. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, has lavished $5 million on television advertisements in the last month alone \u2014 more than twice the total amount of money Ms. Nixon has raised overall.\u201cYou don\u2019t approach them by putting up TV ads on \u2018Jeopardy,\u2019\u201d Christine Marinoni, Ms. Nixon\u2019s wife, said of the Nixon campaign\u2019s target voters. Ms. Marinoni, a former education organizer, has played a key role in shaping the campaign\u2019s outreach efforts. \u201cThey\u2019re online 24-7, and they\u2019re on in a very specific way, and you have to be smart about how to find them.\u201dAt the Bowery Hotel event, when Jumaane D. Williams, Ms. Nixon\u2019s chosen candidate for lieutenant governor, asked the crowd \u2014 mostly millennials, many nonwhite \u2014 if any had received a call from Siena, the college that conducted several of the recent polls, no one raised a hand. Few seemed to understand what or who Siena was.But there is also reason to be skeptical of the campaign\u2019s optimism. While Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign, with its potent blend of celebrity and \u201cblue wave\u201d rhetoric, has attracted an unusual amount of attention for a rookie candidacy, much of that attention may not translate into ballots.Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign has boasted of a record number of individual contributions, but nearly half of her donors do not live in New York State, according to campaign finance filings. One attendee at the Bowery Hotel said Ms. Nixon had helped inspire her to pay more attention to politics, but noted that she was a Canadian citizen. One of the event\u2019s hosts, Shariffa Ali, said she had just received her artist\u2019s visa as an immigrant from Kenya.Other candidates around the country have cited Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win as a blueprint for their own campaigns, but few have matched her success, despite also promising to engage new voters.And the progressive blocs that Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign has declared will drive her to victory are not united in their support. After the national progressive group Indivisible endorsed Ms. Nixon, several local branches issued an open letter of dissent: In their Facebook groups, members worried about Ms. Nixon\u2019s lack of governing experience. Prominent women\u2019s and gay rights groups have backed Mr. Cuomo.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to fish where the fish are,\u201d said Peter Warren, acting chairman of the Albany chapter, of Ms. Nixon\u2019s perceived focus on voter-dense New York City. But as a result, he said, \u201cthe interest was not red-hot\u201d in issuing an endorsement.The criticism that Ms. Nixon has focused too much on city dwellers is a common one, albeit one her team dismissed, citing visits to Syracuse to discuss immigration policy and to Hoosick Falls on environmental issues.Ms. Nixon may also benefit from voters who are not so much pro-Nixon as anti-Cuomo, as the governor\u2019s gun control policies have made him deeply unpopular in rural areas, including among Democrats. Although Ms. Nixon largely shares Mr. Cuomo\u2019s views on gun control and has called for further restrictions, the Siena polls have consistently shown her with more support upstate than downstate.That diverse amalgam of New Yorkers \u2014 those tired of Mr. Cuomo, those who have never heard from Mr. Cuomo, those thrilled about Ms. Nixon \u2014 is who Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign is relying on next month. \u201cTo a certain extent, the larger conversation on who the typical voter is for the campaign, is sort of an outdated model,\u201d Ms. Williams said.But no matter the mold of voter, first they will have to turn out. Ms. Ali, one of the hosts of the Bowery hotel fund-raiser, acknowledged that one event might not be enough to drive her friends to the polls.\u201cI think there were some people who were there that night who were like, \u2018Hm, O.K., I\u2019m here for Shariffa. I\u2019m here to support my friend. And it also happens to be a Cynthia Nixon event,\u2019\u201d she said.But even if they did not end up voting for Ms. Nixon \u2014 as Ms. Ali, here on an artist\u2019s visa, would not be able to do \u2014 she was excited about the potential to start a political conversation.\u201cLike many of my peers, I\u2019d been sort of apathetic in the sense that I actually have no sway,\u201d Ms. Ali said. \u201cNow that I know this is possible, and I do have some kind of influence, I would like to try and see how many more young people I can encourage to get involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When he saw the tracks outside the refuge (lingering snow and ice made some of them easier to spot) he decided to map those as well. He found that they were up to half a foot deep.Dr. Nolan, a former research professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks who has mapped changes in land and glaciers for years, said he was not taking sides in the fight over drilling in the refuge, \u201cbut I want to make sure that whatever happens out here happens in the most responsible way.\u201d\u201cLeaving grid marks all over \u2014 that to me is unacceptable,\u201d he said.Environmental and conservation groups, which have fought to preserve the 19-million-acre refuge for decades, say that seismic testing, not to mention eventual drilling and production of oil and gas, could irreversibly alter the 1002 Area and potentially affect the habitat and behavior of caribou, polar bears and other animals there.That plan proposes that testing begin this winter, when ice and snow provide some protection to the tundra, and resume, if necessary, the following winter. In addition to special trucks that vibrate the ground, the effort would include movable fuel tanks as well as housing and other facilities for two crews of 160 workers each. In the plan, the company said it and its partners were \u201cdedicated to minimizing the effect of our operations on the environment.\u201dBy producing three-dimensional images of the subsurface, the testing would help oil companies determine whether there are enough reserves to make it worth buying leases to drill in the area.The approval process includes conducting an environmental assessment, a less-thorough appraisal than an environmental impact statement, or E.I.S., although the bureau can require an E.I.S. later if the initial review finds the work could result in significant impacts.Ms. Ellis-Wouters said there would be a 30-day public comment period when the assessment is finished. She said there was no time frame for a decision as yet.But Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization in Washington, said the bureau seemed intent on moving quickly so that testing could begin this winter, part of an overall push to conduct lease sales within a few years.Dr. Nolan has financed his mapping project himself, spending about $30,000 on fuel for his single-engine Cessna, among other expenses. To make his map he uses a method called photogrammetry, combining tens of thousands of digital aerial photographs, each with precise location data, to form a three-dimensional map of the land surface.Dr. Nolan said he hoped to sell the finished product to oil companies, environmental groups and government agencies. \u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing it now to support rational decision-making when it comes to oil and gas stuff.\u201dHe said he thought the seismic work could be done differently to reduce impacts \u2014 perhaps using less elaborate, and heavy, facilities for the crews. \u201cThis is a place where we\u2019re supposed to do things different and better,\u201d he said.Sue Natali, an ecologist at Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts who studies Arctic tundra and permafrost, said that depressions, even shallow ones, can have cascading effects. \u201cThe ground sinks, so it gets wetter,\u201d she said. Since water carries and conducts heat, the land thaws more and then sinks more. \u201cThe impact can last for a very long time,\u201d she said.\u201cThe issue is, you\u2019re causing connections and movements of water across the landscape that perhaps weren\u2019t happening before,\u201d Dr. Natali added.Ms. Ellis-Wouters, the bureau spokeswoman, said that hydrological and visual impacts, as well as effects on vegetation, would be considered in the review. \u201cThe visual impacts are only detected from the air,\u201d she added.She said the bureau expected that more advanced 3-D testing technology would result in less surface impact than the work done in the 1980s.Dr. Nolan acknowledged there was little time to pressure the Bureau of Land Management or exploration companies to change their approach. Still, he said, the existence of his new map may have an effect.\u201cI hope the oil and gas people understand that someone\u2019s watching,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you know someone is watching you get on better behavior.\u201dA picture with an earlier version of this article was credited incorrectly.

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks Democrats at Rally, but Mostly Steers Clear of Scandals", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 President Trump invoked on Tuesday fears of immigrant crime and angry mobs as he began a weekslong push to try to preserve the Republican majority in Congress as the party braces for midterm losses amid a cascade of scandals involving members of his inner circle.\u201cA vote for any Democrat in November is a vote to eliminate immigration enforcement, to open our borders and set loose vicious predators and violent criminals,\u201d Mr. Trump told thousands of supporters during a rally in Charleston, W.Va. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all over our communities. They will be preying on our communities.\u201dIn a wide-ranging, more than hourlong speech that touched on the potency of his political endorsements, his love of coal and promises to build a border wall \u2014 with a paean to his mother\u2019s turkey recipe thrown in \u2014 Mr. Trump worked the crowd into a frenzy, repeatedly demonizing Democrats as coddlers of lawbreakers who would take the country down a dangerous path.\u201cThe Democrat Party is held hostage by the so-called resistance: left-wing haters and angry mobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to tear down our institutions, disrespect our flag, demean our law enforcement, denigrate our history and disparage our great country \u2014 and we\u2019re not going to let it happen.\u201dBut the rally offered a vivid tableau of an extraordinary period in Mr. Trump\u2019s already tumultuous tenure. The president is growing more defiant by the day even as the scandals appear to pose an increasingly serious threat to him, embarking on a cross-country tour in an urgent push to bolster his party\u2019s chances of keeping control of Congress.As Mr. Trump made his way to Charleston on Air Force One, news of Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction and Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea dominated Fox News on the in-flight monitors. The president touched only glancingly on the issue in front of his enthusiastic crowd and never named either man. But he did denounce \u201cfake news and the Russian witch hunt,\u201d and taunted the team run by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, which secured the convictions against Mr. Manafort.\u201cWhere is the collusion?\u201d Mr. Trump shouted as his supporters cheered. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re still looking for the collusion. Where is the collusion? Find the collusion.\u201dBut he quickly pivoted to border security, which he said was \u201cat the beating heart of this election.\u201d\u201cDemocrats want to turn America into one big, fat sanctuary city for criminal aliens, and honestly, honestly, they\u2019re more protective of aliens \u2014 the criminal aliens \u2014 than they are of the people,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He led the crowd in a chant of \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d repeating his false claim that the wall along the Southwest border was already being built \u2014 Congress has banned the allocation of border security funding to construct anything but existing barriers \u2014 and promising that it would soon be finished.\u201cThat wall is coming along,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s going to be finished, and it\u2019s going to be very, very effective.\u201dWhen Patrick Morrisey, the state attorney general who is Mr. Manchin\u2019s Republican challenger, led a chant of \u201clock her up\u201d \u2014 referring to Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign rival \u2014 the president egged on the crowd, pumping his fist rhythmically with the shouts.Mr. Trump repeatedly denounced Democratic congressional leaders and said supporting Mr. Manchin would hand them control of Congress.Trump has tweeted support of many candidates who have gone on to win primaries. But his backing may prove harmful when Democratic voters weigh in.\u201cThere\u2019s no worse nightmare for West Virginia this November than Chuck Schumer running the Senate and Nancy Pelosi, with Maxine Waters, running the House,\u201d the president said, naming the top Democrats in the Senate and the House, along with Ms. Waters, a 14-term congresswoman whom he has derided as crazy and \u201clow I.Q.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also added new material to his stock of well-worn rally staples. He regaled the crowd with the story of how, he said, he had jawboned NATO allies into paying more for their own defense. In doing so, he confirmed reports \u2014 which the White House had previously refused to do \u2014 that he had privately threatened to withdraw from the trans-Atlantic alliance at a summit meeting in Brussels last month.Mr. Trump said an unnamed leader of another country had asked him, \u201cWould you leave us if we don\u2019t pay our bills?\u201d\u201cNow, they hated my answer,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI said: \u2018Yes! I will leave you if you don\u2019t pay your bills.\u2019\u201dThen, he added, \u201cyou could see those checkbooks came out for billions of dollars.\u201d But while NATO member countries have increased their military spending over the past year in part as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s relentless focus on what he calls their delinquency, none pledged any additional money after his closed-door outburst in Brussels.And Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent claim that NATO allies are in debt to the United States for the cost of the alliance is a misstatement. The funding in question is a target agreed upon by all member countries in 2014 that each should move toward spending 2 percent of their own gross domestic product on defense by 2024.Still, Mr. Trump used the story to underscore a familiar talking point, saying, \u201cWe are a country that has been ripped off by everybody, and we\u2019re not going to be ripped off anymore.\u201dMr. Trump also threw in some bizarre flourishes, at one point comparing the time it takes to cut a good trade deal with the patience required to roast fowl.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to take time \u2014 it\u2019s got to gestate, right? The word gestate. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re cooking a chicken,\u201d the president mused. \u201cTime, time, turkey for Thanksgiving. My mother would say, \u2018Oh, eight hours.\u2019 I said, \u2018Eight hours?\u2019 She made the greatest turkey I\u2019ve ever had. It takes time.\u201dBefore Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to West Virginia, White House officials outlined what they said was an aggressive midterm campaign effort that would capitalize on the president\u2019s ability to draw crowds to rallies \u2014 held largely in deeply conservative states where he is already popular \u2014 and put his muscle behind the Republican National Committee\u2019s fund-raising efforts.In a phone call with reporters, multiple senior officials familiar with the president\u2019s plans for the midterms said Mr. Trump would be participating in at least eight rallies over the next six weeks and as many as 16 fund-raisers, which officials said had raised more than $227 million for the Republicans so far this election cycle.Mr. Trump will visit at least seven states \u2014 and as many as 15 \u2014 in the next six weeks, the officials said, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Kentucky and Tennessee. Most are not traditional battleground states, but several are home to Democratic senators who face difficult re-election fights. At recent campaign rallies, in stops in places like Indiana and North Dakota, the president has seemed to relish taking punches at those vulnerable Democrats, with the constant rallying cry that they are obstructing his agenda.On Tuesday in Charleston, Mr. Trump lauded the power of his endorsement, claiming that he single-handedly turned around the fortunes of Republicans whose popularity had been lagging before he announced his support.\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to brag about it, but man, do I have a good record of endorsements,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He cited as an example Representative Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is facing Adam Putnam, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, in a primary contest next week for governor.Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Charleston, W.Va., and Katie Rogers from Washington.Advertisement"}

Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia\u2019s Ex-Leader Najib Razak Is Charged With Money Laundering", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Malaysian authorities charged Najib Razak, the former prime minister, with three counts of money laundering on Wednesday, the latest escalation in an inquiry involving billions of dollars diverted from a state investment fund.The charges came a day after Malaysia\u2019s attorney general announced that a $250 million yacht, which prosecutors say was bought with money stolen from the fund, had been returned to Malaysia from Indonesia, where it was seized in February.The new charges are linked to three electronic transfers worth a total of $10 million from a onetime unit of the investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, that prosecutors say were made into Mr. Najib\u2019s bank accounts.That is only a small fraction of the fraud alleged to have been carried out. United States prosecutors have said that at least $4.5 billion from the fund, known as 1MDB, was laundered through American financial institutions and misspent by Mr. Najib, his family and associates.Court documents show that the first of the three wire transfers to Mr. Najib\u2019s accounts from SRC International, the onetime unit of the state investment fund, occurred in 2014, two years after SRC was placed under the Finance Ministry\u2019s jurisdiction.On Wednesday, Mr. Najib\u2019s lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, told reporters that the money-laundering charges had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with 1MDB because SRC was not part of the fund when the transfers were made.\u201cI hope they are not arranging the coincidence of the yacht arriving in Klang with the sudden decision to charge my client today,\u201d Mr. Shafee added, referring to Port Klang, where the yacht has been impounded.N. Surendran, a former lawmaker who advises Lawyers for Liberty, a Malaysian advocacy group, said that the earlier breach of trust charges against Mr. Najib were related to the same money transfers cited in the charges brought Wednesday. \u201cIt is almost certain there will be more charges looking at the large amounts and various transactions involving 1MDB monies,\u201d he said.Mr. Najib set up the investment fund in 2009, the year he became prime minister, to promote economic development.With corruption accusations swirling around the fund in recent years, Mr. Najib\u2019s onetime mentor, Mahathir Mohamad, successfully ran against him in the May election, promising to bring him to justice.A spokesman for Mr. Najib has called the arrest \u201cpolitically motivated and the result of political vengeance\u201d by Mr. Mahathir and his governing coalition, many of whose leaders spent decades in the opposition.Prosecutors say $250 million more was used to buy Equanimity, the yacht that Malaysia\u2019s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said Tuesday had been returned to Malaysia.Mr. Thomas said Tuesday in a statement that the Indonesian authorities had seized the yacht at the request of the United States Department of Justice, \u201cwhich asserted ownership of the yacht on behalf of Malaysia and 1MDB because monies belonging to us were used to purchase it.\u201dOn Friday, a judge was scheduled to rule on whether to uphold an interim court order restricting what the Malaysian news media can report about the case. A judge issued the order last month after Mr. Shafee, Mr. Najib\u2019s lawyer, argued that it was necessary for a fair trial, but Mr. Thomas has said it violates Malaysian laws on free speech.Sharon Tan contributed reporting from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cohen Wasn\u2019t Alone: Records Suggest Others Had Role in Hush Money Arrangements", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen wasn\u2019t the only one.The court filing in the case of Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s self-described fixer, indicates for the first time that others at Mr. Trump\u2019s company had a role in the financial arrangements used to silence women who claimed that they had affairs with him, after the hush money payments were made.Two senior Trump Organization executives had involvement in the financial arrangements, according to the 22-page court filing.Separately, one or more members of the 2016 Trump campaign were cited as having worked to identify stories about Mr. Trump\u2019s romantic entanglements \u201cso they could be purchased and their publication avoided,\u201d the filing said.Mr. Cohen, the filing said, \u201ccoordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls,\u201d about the nature and timing of the payments, which were made to influence the election.The people are not identified in the documents.It is unclear whether they face any sort of legal risk, but the filing does raise questions about the conduct of the Trump Organization itself.Mr. Cohen paid Stephanie Clifford, an adult film actress, $130,000 to ensure that she would not speak publicly about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump, and he was then reimbursed through the Trump Organization.The court filing, which outlines campaign finance violations and other crimes to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty, traces the reimbursement through the company.It begins when Mr. Cohen requested it, submitting a bank statement from a shell company he created to mask the payment\u2019s connection to Mr. Trump, and ends with the Trump Organization\u2019s monthly disbursements to Mr. Cohen.The reimbursement was processed using unusual accounting practices, a nonexistent retainer agreement, and equally unusual tax decisions, helped along the way by Trump Organization executives who, it seemed, at best, looked the other way.A representative of the Trump Organization declined to comment on Wednesday.The plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty.Mr. Cohen made the statement about Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the payments to the two women \u2014 Ms. Clifford and a former Playboy playmate \u2014 as he pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes.One of those charges stemmed from the $130,000 payment he made to Ms. Clifford, who is better known as Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 presidential election.Prosecutors said Trump Organization executives were involved in reimbursing Mr. Cohen for that payment, accepting his phony invoices that listed it as a legal expense. The other charge concerned a complicated arrangement in which a tabloid bought the rights to the story about the former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, then killed it.Jenny Johnson Ware, a criminal tax lawyer in Chicago, called the Trump Organization practices highly unusual.\u201cObviously, they are trying to hide something,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a normal way to do this and then there\u2019s the way they did it.\u201dThe company recorded the reimbursement to Ms. Clifford as legal fees, which legal experts characterized as unusual.Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford $130,000, but he was ultimately reimbursed $420,000 by the Trump Organization.Here\u2019s why: Mr. Cohen received a $60,000 bonus, and the company allocated about $180,000 to cover the taxes that Mr. Cohen had to pay on the hush money.There was also an additional $50,000 that Mr. Cohen received after putting in a claim for \u201ctech services.\u201dThat related to work that Mr. Cohen \u201csolicited\u201d from a technology company during the campaign, the court filing said.Several current and former prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers said that if the officials at the Trump Organization were aware of what the payments were for, they could possibly be criminally culpable.And they said that if the $420,000 in payments to Mr. Cohen, which were recorded as legal expenses, were written off as a tax deduction, as would be the general practice, it could lead to criminal tax charges.But one person with knowledge of the company\u2019s operations and familiar with the details surrounding the payments said neither of the two executives were aware of what the payments were for and that the payments were not deducted from the Trump Organization\u2019s taxes.The person said only the first two of the 12 monthly $35,000 payments to Mr. Cohen were paid by a trust that owns the company; the other 10 were paid from Mr. Trump\u2019s personal accounts.But the person, who would only discuss the payments on the condition of anonymity, could not say who approved the reimbursement; why it was approved if no one knew what it was for; why the payments were recorded as legal expenses; and why, even though they were recorded as such, they were not deducted from the company\u2019s taxes.Ms. Ware, the criminal tax lawyer, said, \u201cIt would be highly unusual to record it as legal fees and then not deduct it.\u201dIndeed, a staple of law enforcement news conferences \u2014 a senior official intoning, \u201cthe investigation is continuing\u201d \u2014 was noticeably absent on Tuesday when the deputy United States attorney, Robert Kuhzami, concluded his remarks announcing Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea.Jesse Drucker and Ben Protess contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Hours later, Mr. Bennett\u2019s lawyer, Gordon K. Sattro, said that her denial was false and that he was working with his client on a statement. By Wednesday morning, Mr. Bennett and his advisers had still not issued one.The responses were the first public comment from either side since The Times approached the actors with questions about documents showing that Ms. Argento had arranged to pay $380,000 to Mr. Bennett, after he notified her last November that he would sue over their May 2013 encounter in a California hotel room. The age of consent in that state is 18.Ms. Argento, who for five days has not responded to The Times\u2019s requests for comment, forcefully denied Tuesday that she had assaulted Mr. Bennett.\u201cI am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false,\u201d she said in a statement circulated on social media. \u201cI have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.\u201dHis claim, she said, \u201cconstitutes a longstanding persecution.\u201dThe Times had been sent documents, through encrypted email by an unidentified party, that included a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of Mr. Bennett and Ms. Argento lying in bed. As part of their agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic.\u201cWe are confident in the accuracy of our reporting, which was based on verified documents and multiple sources,\u201d said Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for The Times. \u201cIt is worth noting that Ms. Argento, her lawyer and agent were contacted repeatedly and given four days to respond to the story.\u201dThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said Monday that it was aware of Mr. Bennett\u2019s claims and had reached out to the young actor and his representatives in order to document any possible criminal activity. Mr. Sattro, the actor\u2019s lawyer, said he had not yet responded to the inquiry.The documents obtained by The Times included a letter to Ms. Argento from Carrie Goldberg, her lawyer in the matter, that characterized the $380,000 payment as \u201chelping Mr. Bennett.\u201dIn her statement on Monday, she said Mr. Bourdain had helped her navigate the claim and finance the payments, which began with a $200,000 lump sum in April.Ms. Argento said in the statement that Mr. Bennett was in trouble financially and knew Mr. Bourdain \u201cas a man of great perceived wealth and his own reputation as a beloved public figure to protect.\u201dMr. Bourdain, she said, feared the publicity that the claim might bring and suggested the matter be handled privately.\u201cWe decided to deal compassionately with Bennett\u2019s demand for help and give it to him,\u201d Ms. Argento wrote. \u201cAnthony personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life.\u201dKimberly Witherspoon, Mr. Bourdain\u2019s longtime agent and a spokeswoman for his wife, Ottavia Busia, from whom he was separated, would not comment on Ms. Argento\u2019s statement.In the agreement between the two actors, $10,000 payments were to be made monthly, with the final payment due on Oct. 1, 2019, according to a schedule of payments included in the agreement.Mr. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement on Monday saying that \u201cthe sheer duplicity of her conduct is quite extraordinary and should demonstrate to everyone how poorly the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were actually vetted and accordingly, cause all of us to pause and allow due process to prevail, not condemnation by fundamental dishonesty.\u201dIn November, a month after Ms. Argento first spoke out about her experience with Mr. Weinstein in a New Yorker article, Mr. Bennett sent her a notice of his intent to sue over what he said was a case of sexual battery in a hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, Calif. The aftermath of the 2013 encounter had left him betrayed and precipitated a number of emotional problems, according to the notice of intent; the document was sent to Richard Hofstetter, Mr. Bourdain\u2019s longtime lawyer, who was also representing Ms. Argento at the time.The notice asked for $3.5 million in damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, lost wages, assault and battery. It said that Mr. Bennett had made more than $2.7 million in the five years before the 2013 meeting with Ms. Argento, but that his income has since dropped to an average of $60,000 a year, which he attributed to the trauma that followed the sexual encounter with Ms. Argento.Ms. Argento, who is divorced and has two children, was both a mentor and a mother figure to Mr. Bennett, the notice said.Mr. Bennett was 7 when he was cast in \u201cThe Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,\u201d a 2004 film Ms. Argento directed, starred in and helped write. It depicts the relationship between a prostitute played by Ms. Argento and her son, played by Mr. Bennett and two other actors.

{"Headline": "When It Comes to a Trade War, China Takes the Long View", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyYe Fangsu, a retired Shanghai schoolteacher, doesn\u2019t need any lessons about the dangers of trade wars. For nearly 60 years, she has lived in the former French Concession, a leafy part of Shanghai whose name itself carries the humiliation of China\u2019s biggest trade war. The \u201cconcession\u201d was one of many slices of territory, including Hong Kong and parts of other port cities, that China was forced to hand over to foreign powers after its defeat in the mid-19th-century Opium Wars. \u201cChina was so weak and backward then,\u201d Ye said, shaking her head as she offered me slices of apple and pear on a hot July afternoon. \u201cWe had to give in.\u201dThe first salvos of today\u2019s trade war have barely been felt yet in China. But for many Chinese, there\u2019s a sense of history repeating itself. The Opium Wars, as every Chinese schoolchild is reminded, began as a British attempt to pry open the Chinese market. Much as it does today, China in the 17th and 18th centuries ran a huge trade surplus with the West, exporting large quantities of tea, porcelain and silk but importing little in return. (It balanced its current-account surplus by buying up loads of Latin American silver; these days, Beijing has piled up $1.2 trillion in United States government securities.) By hooking China on opium, British and American merchants redressed the trade imbalance even as they weakened the country\u2019s social fabric. The Chinese revolted, but they were no match for Western gunboats \u2014 leading to the unequal treaties that have fueled China\u2019s sense of historical grievance and patriotic ambitions ever since.Ye Fangsu was a teenager in 1949 when Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist troops marched into Shanghai, the vanguard of a revolution that vowed to end China\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation.\u201d Now 84 and widowed, Ye says she was \u201cangry\u201d when she learned from state-run media about the United States\u2019 punitive trade tariffs on Chinese products. \u201cIt just seems like the foreigners are bullying us again,\u201d she told me. But this time will be different, she said, pointing out that rather than panic or surrender, China\u2019s leaders announced a reciprocal \u201ccounterattack\u201d aimed at products, like soybeans and pork, meant to hit the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s rural base. \u201cWe\u2019ve become strong now, and our leaders are more tenacious. They won\u2019t back down.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to understand why Trump and his advisers believed China might blink first. The country exports nearly four times more taxable goods to the United States than it imports ($505 billion compared with $130 billion in 2017), so it could never keep up with Washington in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Moreover, the Chinese economy is slowing, weighed down by debt and unemployment and dependent on the American market. Still, in targeting China\u2019s high-tech industry, Washington seemed to forget that Beijing has more than a trillion dollars in reserves to cushion the blow and that 21st-century supply chains are truly global. The Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that 87 percent of the high-tech Chinese products hit by United States tariffs get some of their parts or financing from companies based outside China. American tariffs, in other words, could inflict even greater pain on allies like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan \u2014 and on the United States itself. As the Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng put it, \u201cThe U.S. is opening fire on the world and on itself, too.\u201dChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have been less scattershot. By taking aim at soybeans and pork, Beijing struck at Trump country in the Midwest, while going after a smaller export like Kentucky bourbon hit the district of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cChina targets Trump\u2019s interest groups with surgical precision,\u201d a former government official in Shanghai told me. \u201cThat\u2019s China\u2019s institutional advantage. It understands America, but the United States doesn\u2019t really understand how China operates politically.\u201d So far, the United States is feeling the brunt of the trade war: Soy and pork exports to China have collapsed, and China has scuppered one major tech deal: Qualcomm\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover of the Dutch chip maker NXP Semiconductors. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, residents seem almost oblivious to the trade war, as if it were a storm on a distant horizon. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d says a waitress at a local dumpling shop. \u201cBut the price of soy sauce hasn\u2019t gone up yet.\u201dThe United States would be wise not to underestimate China\u2019s resolve. President Xi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, has staked his legitimacy on restoring China\u2019s greatness. Backing down is not an option for him; he can\u2019t afford to look weak in a face-off with China\u2019s biggest rival. Xi may hope the trade war eases up after the midterm elections, but he seems ready to dig in. \u201cIf it comes down to a war of attrition, China will win,\u201d says James L. McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cAt the end of day, we may end up making China great again.\u201dChinese leaders have so far been careful not to rouse much nationalist fervor, however. In disputes with other countries \u2014 France, Japan and, most recently, South Korea \u2014 Beijing ramped up the hostility, orchestrated street protests and even encouraged consumer boycotts. The trade war has evoked a more measured response. Some Chinese-language articles online have highlighted China\u2019s historical grievances \u2014 \u201cNever Forget the Eight Lessons of the Opium War,\u201d one reads \u2014 but the official tack has been to calm public opinion. \u201cDon\u2019t attack Trump\u2019s vulgarity,\u201d a government guidance memo instructed media outlets earlier this summer, according to the website China Digital Times. \u201cDon\u2019t make this a war of insults.\u201dIf the trade war persists, China could make life even more difficult for American companies by adding to the web of nontariff barriers (red tape, for example) or by supporting a consumer boycott. American-owned subsidiaries in China sold $280 billion worth of goods and services there in 2017, more than double the amount of United States imports, and famous brands like Apple and Starbucks make about 20 percent of their revenue in China. As vulnerable as those companies might be, China has no interest, yet, in alienating its biggest market. \u201cAt some point, Chinese leaders may want to get nationalistic and stir up anger against U.S. companies, but that\u2019s a dangerous road,\u201d McGregor says. \u201cRight now, Chinese leaders are just studying the battlefield. They are not running around with shock and awe.\u201dAs the trade war escalates, in fact, China is seeking to shift the blame and portray itself suddenly as a champion of openness. In the past month, Beijing has approved two major deals \u2014 with Tesla and the German chemical giant BASF \u2014 that give those companies what the foreign business community has long desired: full ownership without the need for a local joint-venture partner. Xi Jinping also held a rare meeting with American and European business executives, though his words on the trade war were defiant. In the West, he reportedly told them, \u201cyou turn the other cheek. In our culture, we punch back.\u201dBack in Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession, Ye Fangsu walked me to the gate of her lane. Across the street stands an old factory that has been transformed into a cluster of hip new restaurants and marketplaces, selling everything from Japanese tapas to French pastries. Two young Chinese men with fancy fade haircuts parked their BMW and wandered in. \u201cChina is rich now,\u201d Ye said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are better.\u201d Her neighborhood, once a symbol of China\u2019s weakness, is now evidence of its economic vitality. By her street-level calculus, that means China may have the strength, this time, to stand up to the West.Advertisement"}

New economic data on Tuesday showed slower growth in investment and consumer spending, and there are fears that the financial crisis in Turkey could spread.China\u2019s leaders have argued that they can outlast Mr. Trump in a trade standoff. Their authoritarian system can stifle dissent and quickly redirect resources, and they expect Washington to be gridlocked and come under pressure from voters feeling the pain of trade disruptions.But the Communist Party is vulnerable in its own way. It needs growth to justify its monopoly on power and is obsessed with preventing social instability. Mr. Xi\u2019s strongman grip may be hindering effective policymaking, as officials fail to pass on bad news, defer decisions to him and rigidly carry out his orders, for better or worse.Some inside the government have argued China should be more aggressive and put Mr. Trump on the defensive, while others have proposed concessions to address American complaints, said Chen Dingding, a professor of international relations at Jinan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.He said the debate was \u201ca healthy development\u201d because it would \u201cinform the public and make policymakers better.\u201d\u201cAll of this coming together suggests Xi\u2019s grip on authority has been loosened,\u201d said Willy Wo-lap Lam, a longtime observer of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cHe\u2019s unable to fill his function as the final arbiter who settles differences among his closest advisers.\u201dEven so, the government last month requested that dozens of research institutes and universities each submit analyses on how different regions and industrial sectors would be affected if the trade war worsened and what the impact would be on unemployment and the financial markets.China sold roughly $500 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total exports and about 4 percent of national economic production.If the United States imposes tariffs on all Chinese goods, even pessimistic Chinese economists contend the country might suffer only a 1 percent drop of output from lost exports. China so dominates some industries, such as smartphone manufacturing, that tariffs may not do much damage. In other industries, China might lose business to rivals like South Korea but find opportunities to export its goods to other markets.While factories that make price-sensitive electronics and other electrical products are already beginning to lose orders, China is so competitive across so many sectors that exports to the United States are actually still rising despite the relatively limited tariffs that have taken effect.The worst case for China, however, is that the trade war undermines economic confidence. The nation\u2019s housing market teeters on a mountain of debt, and low-interest loans from state banks have built overcapacity in many industries. The worry is that prolonged trade tensions could cause money to rush out of China despite currency controls and prompt much bigger financial and economic troubles.To the extent there has been finger-pointing in the establishment, the focus appears to be less on China\u2019s trade practices than on its propaganda message. Some analysts have argued that the trade war could have been avoided if Beijing had refrained from triumphalist rhetoric about China\u2019s rise as a global power. That rhetoric is closely associated with Mr. Xi himself.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of second-guessing about whether the great leader played his cards right,\u201d said Jerome Cohen, faculty director of the United States-Asia Law Institute at New York University.A group of alumni from Tsinghua, one of China\u2019s most prestigious universities, recently circulated a petition calling for the dismissal of a well-known economist on the faculty who is an ardent defender of Mr. Xi\u2019s policies. They accused the scholar, Hu Angang, of misleading the leadership by arguing last year that China had already surpassed the United States as an economic and technological power.\u201cA slowing economy and friction with the United States provides an opportunity for people to push back,\u201d said Trey McArver, a partner with Trivium China, a research consultancy in Beijing and London.As the trade dispute festers, Chinese business leaders have been circumspect, saying almost nothing about it publicly for fear of angering Beijing. It is clear, though, that they and government officials were caught off guard.\u201cOutside of government negotiators, few people took this possibility very seriously until July 6,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to the date when tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods took effect.Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the assumption that Beijing could avoid a trade war \u201csuffused every conversation\u201d he had with officials earlier this year.\u201cThey were wrong, and they are smarting over that, trying to find north and recalibrate,\u201d he said.Tensions inside the government flared into the open last month when Xu Zhong, the research director of China\u2019s central bank, published an essay rebuffing calls to bolster the economy by issuing more money. He castigated the Finance Ministry instead for a \u201cdearth of effective fiscal policies,\u201d referring to extra government spending and tax cuts.Soon afterward, the cabinet ordered more infrastructure spending to shore up growth. In the past week, the central bank has also pumped tens of billions of dollars into the economy and driven short-term interest rates down sharply.Presented with a choice of fiscal or monetary stimulus, the leadership in effect avoided making a decision by choosing both, despite the risk of exacerbating the nation\u2019s budget deficit and chronic debt problems.Mr. Xi is presumably at the center of such decision-making. He has surrounded himself with officials who built their careers in part on their ability to deal with the United States and who might be damaged politically if the trade war goes badly for China.The leadership can still divert criticism by blaming the United States. So far, it has not ratcheted up anti-American propaganda beyond the usual volume nor encouraged protests or boycotts of the sort directed at Japan in the past.Asked on a recent afternoon about the trade tensions, a worker making digital control panels at a factory in the southern city of Zhongshan paused before she replied. \u201cIf we are going to fight a trade war,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if my job may be affected, I will still support our country.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research from Shanghai, and Olivia Mitchell Ryan from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Too Little Too Late\u2019: Bankruptcy Booms Among Older Americans", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a rapidly growing share of older Americans, traditional ideas about life in retirement are being upended by a dismal reality: bankruptcy.The signs of potential trouble \u2014 vanishing pensions, soaring medical expenses, inadequate savings \u2014 have been building for years. Now, new research sheds light on the scope of the problem: The rate of people 65 and older filing for bankruptcy is three times what it was in 1991, the study found, and the same group accounts for a far greater share of all filers.Driving the surge, the study suggests, is a three-decade shift of financial risk from government and employers to individuals, who are bearing an ever-greater responsibility for their own financial well-being as the social safety net shrinks.Cheryl Mcleod of Las Vegas filed for bankruptcy in January after struggling to keep up with her mortgage payments and other expenses. \u201cI am 70, and I am working for less money than I ever did in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThis life stuff happens.\u201d\u201cYou can manage O.K. until there is a little stumble,\u201d said Deborah Thorne, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Idaho and an author of the study. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even take a big thing.\u201dThe forces at work affect many Americans, but older people are often less able to weather them, according to Professor Thorne and her colleagues in the study. Finding, and keeping, one job is hard enough for an older person. Taking on another to pay unexpected bills is almost unfathomable.Bankruptcy can offer a fresh start for people who need one, but for older Americans it \u201cis too little too late,\u201d the study says. \u201cBy the time they file, their wealth has vanished and they simply do not have enough years to get back on their feet.\u201dThe data gathered by the researchers is stark. From February 2013 to November 2016, there were 3.6 bankruptcy filers per 1,000 people 65 to 74; in 1991, there were 1.2.Bankruptcy filings per 1,000 people, by age18 to 2425 to 3435 to 44108Percentagechange64\u201377%\u201340%\u201364%2\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u20191645 to 5455 to 6465 to 74108+66%6\u20132%+204%42\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916Bankruptcy filings per 1,000 people, by age18 to 2425 to 3435 to 4445 to 5455 to 6465 to 74108+66%Percentagechange6\u20132%+204%4\u201377%\u201340%\u201364%2\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916\u201991\u201916Source: The Federal Reserve\u2019s survey of consumer finances, via the Consumer Bankruptcy ProjectNot only are more older people seeking relief through bankruptcy, but they also represent a widening slice of all filers: 12.2 percent of filers are now 65 or older, up from 2.1 percent in 1991.The jump is so pronounced, the study says, that the aging of the baby boom generation cannot explain it.Although the actual number of older people filing for bankruptcy was relatively small \u2014 about 100,000 a year during the period in question \u2014 the researchers said it signaled that there were many more people in financial distress.The next generation nearing retirement age is also filing for bankruptcy in greater numbers, and the average age of filers is rising, the study found.Given the rate of increase, Professor Thorne said, \u201cthe only explanation that makes any sense are structural shifts.\u201dMs. Mcleod said she had managed to get by for a while after separating from her husband several years ago. Eventually, though, she struggled to make ends meet on her income alone, and she fell behind on her mortgage payments.She collects a small Social Security check and works at an adult day care center for people with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems. For $8.75 an hour, she makes sure clients participate in daily activities, calms them when they are irritated and tries to understand what they need when they have trouble expressing themselves.\u201cWhen I moved here from Los Angeles, I was wondering why all of these older people were working in convenience stores and fast-food restaurants,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t make enough in retirement to support themselves.\u201dMs. Mcleod said she hoped that filing for bankruptcy would help her catch up on her mortgage so she could stay in her home. \u201cI am too old to move out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cI am trying to stay stable.\u201dMedicare beneficiaries\u2019out-of-pocket spending, by age74%Average 2013 health care spendingas a share of Social Security income41%40%35%34%Median 2013 health care spendingas a share of total income22%16%14%12%12%AllBeneficiariesUnder6565-7475-8485 andoverMedicare beneficiaries\u2019out-of-pocket spending, by income78%Average 2013 health care spendingas a share of Social Security income42%42%41%38%37%Median 2013 health care spendingas a share of total income26%20%18%14%11%7%Under$10$10 to$20$20 to$30$30 to$40$40 to$50Over$50Income ranges in thousandsMedicare beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, by age74%Average 2013health care spendingas a share ofMedian 2013health care spendingas a share ofSocial Security incometotal income41%40%35%34%22%16%14%12%12%AllbeneficiariesUnder6565-7475-8485 andoverAllbeneficiariesUnder6565-7475-8485 andoverMedicare beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket spending, by income78%Average 2013health care spendingas a share ofMedian 2013health care spendingas a share ofSocial Security incometotal income42%42%41%38%37%26%20%18%14%11%7%Under$10$10 to$20$20 to$30$30 to$40$40 to$50Over$50Under$10$10 to$20$20 to$30$30 to$40$40 to$50Over$50Income ranges in thousandsFor about one in three older people who receive Social Security benefits, their monthly check accounts for 90 percent of their income, according to the Social Security Administration. Spending by those over 65 by income is based on Medicare beneficiaries, most of whom are 65 and over; the remainder are younger and disabled. | Source: Kaiser Family FoundationTheir latest study \u2014which was posted online on Sunday and has been submitted to an academic journal for peer review \u2014 is based on a sample of personal bankruptcy cases and questionnaires completed by 895 filers ages 19 to 92.The questionnaire asked filers what led them to seek bankruptcy protection. Much like the broader population, people 65 and older usually cited multiple factors. About three in five said unmanageable medical expenses played a role. A little more than two-thirds cited a drop in income. Nearly three-quarters put some blame on hounding by debt collectors.The study does not delve into those underlying factors, but separate data provides some insight. The median household led by someone 65 or older had liquid savings of $60,600 in 2016, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, whereas the bottom 25 percent of households had saved at most $3,260.That doesn\u2019t provide much of a financial cushion for a catastrophic health problem. Older Americans typically turn to Medicare to pay their medical bills. But gaps in coverage, high premiums and requirements that patients shoulder some costs force many lower-income beneficiaries to spend more of their own income on those bills, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.By 2013, the average Medicare beneficiary\u2019s out-of-pocket spending on health care consumed 41 percent of the average Social Security check, according to Kaiser, which also estimated that the figure would rise.More people are also entering their later years carrying debt. For many of them, at least some of the debt is a mortgage \u2014 roughly 41 percent in 2016, compared with 21 percent in 1989, according to an Urban Institute analysis.And those who are carrying debt into retirement are carrying more than members of earlier generations, an analysis by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found.Perhaps not surprisingly, the lowest-income households led by individuals 55 or older carry the highest debt loads relative to their income. More than 13 percent of such households face debt payments that equal more than 40 percent of their income, nearly double the percentage of such families in 1991, the employee benefit institute found.Share of homeowners with a mortgage, by ageYounger than 5555 to 6061 to 6480%+31\u2013160+12percentagepoint change40200\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u20191665 to 6970 to 7475 or older80%+2160+20+2340200\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916Share of families with credit card debtby age of head of householdAll55 to 6465 to 7475 or older80%60+4+10+740+6200\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916Share of homeowners with a mortgage, by ageYounger than 5555 to 6061 to 6465 to 6970 to 7475 or older80%+31\u20131+2160+20+12percentagepoint change+2340200\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916\u201989\u201916Share of families with credit card debt by age of head of householdAll55 to 6465 to 7475 or older80%60+4+10+740+6200\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916\u201992\u201916Sources: Urban Institute; Employee Benefit Research InstituteOlder Americans\u2019 finances are also being strained by the needs of those around them.Some parents, Mr. Stern said, had co-signed loans for $10,000 or $20,000 for adult children and suddenly could no longer afford them. \u201cWhen you are living on $2,000 a month and that includes Social Security \u2014 and you have rent and savings are minuscule \u2014 it is extremely difficult to recover from something like that,\u201d he said.Others had co-signed their children\u2019s student loans. \u201cI never saw parents with student loans 20 or 30 years ago,\u201d Mr. Stern said.\u201cIt is not uncommon to see student loans of $100,000,\u201d he added. \u201cThen, you see parents who have guaranteed some of these loans. They are no longer working, and they have these student loans that are difficult if not impossible to pay or discharge in bankruptcy, and these are the kids\u2019 loans.\u201dKeith Morris, chief executive of Elder Law of Michigan, which runs a legal hotline for older adults, said the prospect of bankruptcy was a regular topic for his callers.\u201cThey worked all of their lives, and did what they were supposed to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand through circumstances like a late-life divorce or a death of a spouse or having to raise grandkids, have put them in a situation where they are not able to make the bills.\u201dFor Lawrence Sedita, a 74-year-old former carpenter now living in Las Vegas, the problems began when he lost his health insurance about two years ago. He said he had been on disability since 1991, when a double pack of 12-foot drywall fell on his head at work.After his union, the New York City District Council of Carpenters, changed the eligibility requirements for his medical, dental and prescription drug insurance, he lost his coverage.Mr. Sedita, who has Parkinson\u2019s disease, said his medical expenses had risen exponentially. (A spokesman for the union declined to comment.)A medication that helps reduce his shaking, a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s, rose to $1,100 every three months from $70, Mr. Sedita said. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken my medicine in three months since I can\u2019t afford it,\u201d he added.He said he and his wife, who has cancer, filed for bankruptcy in June after living off their credit cards for a time. Their financial difficulty, he said, \u201chas drained everything out of me.\u201dDoris Burke and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research. Graphics by Karl Russell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tax Cut Unlocks Millions for a Republican Election Blitz", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBillionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars in tax cuts are pumping some of that windfall into the Congressional Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d closely aligned with Speaker Paul D. Ryan that is flooding the airwaves and front porches of swing congressional districts with increasingly sharp attacks on the Democratic candidates vying to wrest control of the House.But party leaders say the passage of the law appeased wealthy donors, who had been frustrated by Republicans\u2019 failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act and had threatened to sit out the 2018 campaign. Now, flush with big checks from a handful of deep-pocketed donors, the Congressional Leadership Fund is serving as the party\u2019s best hope of a defense against an electoral defeat in November.The fund\u2019s executive director, Corry Bliss, who runs both that group and the American Action Network, said that some of his donors did not favor all the provisions of the tax law, but that all of them hailed its passage as the rich fruits of total Republican control of Washington.Had the tax bill failed, Mr. Bliss said, \u201cI think they would have been very disappointed and very deflated.\u201d But Mr. Bliss said that donors were more concerned with seeing results from unified Republican control \u2014 especially after the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 than specifically with the passage of the tax bill.A super PAC like the Congressional Leadership Fund is allowed to raise unlimited donations, including from corporations and unions, but it is not allowed to coordinate its efforts with candidates.Democrats have their own super PAC dedicated to House campaigns, the House Majority PAC, which on Friday started a harshly negative digital attack ad on the Republican House leadership, and those who aspire to be in it. The group has raised more than $32 million this year.After the speaker laid out his case for help defending the Republican House majority, he stepped out of the room while Mr. Coleman made the explicit request and secured the $30 million.\u201cThe American people know that the Republicans who control Washington sold them out with a disastrous tax giveaway to the rich and big business that the rest of the country is being forced to pay for,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the liberal campaign group American Bridge. \u201cThe fact that those same corporations and wealthy individuals have turned around to bankroll Republican campaign efforts is further proof of what this travesty was all about.\u201dMr. Bliss\u2019s group has already rescued flailing conservative candidates in special elections in what previously had been considered safe Republican districts, from Ohio to Arizona. Its strategy departs from the traditional carpet-bombing of tight races with television advertisements in the closing days. Instead, the group is building an ambitious field operation to knock on doors and make other voter contacts in 40 targeted congressional districts this fall.\u201cWe reject the old model, which is I raise as much money as possible, I save it and 98 percent gets spent on\u201d lousy TV ads in October, Mr. Bliss said in an interview. He added, \u201cHistory and common sense says we are supposed to lose the House. Our mission is to defy history. It\u2019s very clear that in this environment, the old playbook was not going to work.\u201dSome of the group\u2019s advertising so far has focused on tax cuts, in a way that contrasts with Republican candidates\u2019 strategies. The tax-themed ads do not focus on corporate tax cuts \u2014 the centerpiece of the law, both in dollar amount and in the boost to economic growth that Republicans have promised it will deliver \u2014 but instead highlight income tax cuts for middle-class individuals.But most of the ads, in a long list of districts in New York, California, Kentucky, Kansas, Nebraska and Ohio, paint Democratic candidates as left-wing radicals, far out of the mainstream, and puppets of the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi.The Joint Committee on Taxation, the arm of Congress that models effects of tax cuts, estimates that one-quarter of the benefits of the business tax cuts in the new law will go to Americans earning $1 million and up next year. Factoring in individual income tax cuts, those high earners will reap about 14 percent of the law\u2019s benefits. But those individual cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, while the corporate cuts are permanent.The heavy donors to the fund who stand to reap large benefits from the law\u2019s business and personal tax breaks include the oil giants Chevron and ConocoPhillips, the investing mogul Charles Schwab, and Robert C. McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans of the National Football League.A person close to the largest donor, Mr. Adelson, said that the billionaire did not discuss his savings on the tax bill in the context of his donations to the Congressional Leadership Fund. His contributions, the person said, were more a product of his broader political philosophy.In some of its early ads, the super PAC has used voters in congressional districts to say how the tax cut has helped them. Mr. Bliss said he had \u201call but begged every campaign to run on the middle-class tax cut\u201d \u2014 an appeal that so far has not often been heeded.\u201cIt\u2019s a central thematic,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this environment, if you don\u2019t make clear the contrasts between the two teams, then you are not going to get the benefit of the doubt.\u201d Two who have, he said \u2014 Carlos Curbelo in Florida and Will Hurd in Texas \u2014 are doing better than many other incumbents who serve in districts won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.Otherwise, the headwinds are strong. \u201cAbsolutely Democrats have more energy than we do,\u201d he said.The super PAC has field offices in 40 congressional districts around the country. Mr. Bliss said they had identified 50,000 to 70,000 voters in each of them, and began trying to persuade them more than a year ago with a regular campaign of door knocking, using a positive message in contrast to what voters see on television.In Nebraska\u2019s Second Congressional District, for instance, the super PAC has a target group of voters that it repeatedly reminds of the attention that Representative Don Bacon has paid to the preservation of Offutt Air Force Base, a major economic engine in the district, he said.The group is also defying convention by airing television ads in more than a dozen districts in August, a time when many voters may not be paying attention to politics.\u201cThis is a really tough environment,\u201d Mr. Bliss said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win in August, you are not going to win in October.\u201dThe Congressional Leadership Fund spent more than $3 million to help the campaign of Troy Balderson, the Republican candidate in a House special election in Ohio this month. Mr. Balderson is leading, but the race has not been officially decided.But when there are more than three or four dozen close races, that kind of focus will not be \u201csustainable\u201d in the fall, Mr. Bliss conceded.So his attention will most likely be focused on races where his operatives have been knocking on doors for almost 18 months to \u201cbreak through the news and break through the incredible cynicism and skepticism in the electorate.\u201d\u201cThe outside group is the hammer,\u201d he said, \u201cand must first and foremost always be the hammer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those documents could include general ledgers, bank statements, invoices and contracts.James Gazzale, a spokesman for the Tax Department, confirmed the subpoena had been issued \u201cfor relevant information in light of the public disclosures made yesterday\u201d but declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation.Representatives of the Trump Organization, an umbrella company for Mr. Trump\u2019s holdings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the subpoena on Wednesday.On its own, the Tax Department\u2019s inquiry may provide political ammunition for Mr. Cuomo more than it presents a legal peril to Mr. Trump. Even if the department found evidence of criminal behavior, it would need to refer the matter to a law enforcement agency, such as the attorney general\u2019s office or a district attorney, for prosecution.Administration officials would not say when the Tax Department\u2019s investigation began, but it became public a month after the attorney general\u2019s lawsuit.Beyond the civil charges, the attorney general\u2019s office has not announced a criminal investigation into the foundation, saying only that it would seek a criminal referral from a state agency at the appropriate time. But because the office\u2019s review of the Trump Foundation is still active, the office is coordinating with the Tax Department\u2019s inquiry, according to an official familiar with the investigation, who also requested anonymity because the investigation is active.The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is also looking into possible impropriety by the Trump Foundation, according to someone familiar with the matter.In October 2016, the New York attorney general\u2019s office ordered the foundation to cease soliciting donations in the state, after Mr. Trump admitted he had used the foundation\u2019s money to contribute to political causes. After the election, Mr. Trump announced he would dissolve the foundation to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest, but the attorney general did not approve the proposal, saying the office needed to finish its investigation.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Imran Khan Takes Oath in Pakistan, a Nation Divided and in Debt", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImran Khan, the former cricket star turned firebrand politician, was sworn in as Pakistan\u2019s prime minister on Saturday, taking control of a country facing a looming economic crisis as observers questioned whether he had the political acumen to govern a deeply divided nation.Mr. Khan\u2019s first decision was to scrub the nine-course meal traditionally served after the oath-taking ceremony, held at the president\u2019s house. It was a sign of the \u201causterity drive\u201d he had promised while on the campaign trail, his party said. Instead, refreshments were served in the grand hall of the residence.Since winning the July 25 election, Mr. Khan has stressed that he would lead a lean life, shunning the ostentatious displays of power and wealth of his predecessors. He has said that he will not live in the prime minister\u2019s house, a lavish, white marble building on a hilltop overlooking Islamabad.Instead, he vowed to take a smaller house belonging to the military secretary. Mr. Khan, however, maintains a sprawling, private Mediterranean-style villa nearby.\u201cThe main challenge is economic,\u201d said Ayaz Amir, a former lawmaker and noted Pakistani columnist. \u201cThere\u2019s not much money in the kitty, and there are a lot of debts coming due both in the immediate and long term.\u201dMr. Amir added: \u201cHe will be judged by what kind of people he appoints to key ministries \u2014 this will be crucial. And he has many other advantages: People look upon him as a clean leader with no legacy of corruption attached to his name, and he\u2019s popular enough to withstand populist demands.\u201dIf Mr. Khan completes his five-year term, he would be the first prime minister in Pakistan\u2019s history to do so.The new prime minister has said he would break the dynastic nature of Pakistani politics and promised to bring young, dynamic leadership to his government. Instead, he has so far elevated into key roles some of the same politicians he had denounced in the past over their political opportunism and checkered records on corruption.Asad Umar, a private-sector businessman whom economists view as a populist with a thin grasp of the challenges ahead, was named as finance minister.One of the first tests facing Mr. Khan is whether to ask the International Monetary Fund for a bailout or to extend another open palm to China, deepening Pakistan\u2019s economic reliance on its larger neighbor. Pakistan already relies on China to develop critical infrastructure projects worth some $62 billion, with onerous loan terms and profit-sharing agreements benefiting Beijing.Pakistan will start negotiations with the I.M.F. in the coming weeks and will ask for loans worth up to $12 billion, officials say, part of a four-year program that will require the country to undertake privatization measures and tighten its fiscal policy. Pakistan has taken 14 bailouts from the fund since the 1980s.If Mr. Khan\u2019s government pursues an I.M.F. bailout, he will have to explain to voters why the populist measures he promised will no longer be possible under the fund\u2019s lending terms.Saturday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony was the second democratic transfer of power in Pakistan since it was founded in 1947. The military has ruled for about half the country\u2019s history through a series of coups.Whether Mr. Khan can assert control over Pakistan\u2019s foreign and defense policies will be another crucial test of how successful his government will be. The military has typically controlled those domains, and Mr. Khan\u2019s objectives \u2014 such as brokering peace in Afghanistan and pursuing talks with India, a longtime rival, will need the military\u2019s approval.Mr. Khan \u201cneeds to sit down with the military and figure out what are the national security objectives,\u201d said Ikram Sehgal, an independent analyst and retired Pakistani military officer. \u201cEveryone should be on the same page.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe need to fix the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. We cannot afford to be in either the U.S. or the China camp. We need to be neutral and friendly with everyone.\u201dAlthough Pakistan\u2019s main political parties all agree that the economy is the top priority, whether Mr. Khan can cobble together the needed support will be a challenge. He was voted in as prime minister by Parliament on Friday, with 51 percent of the vote. As he took the floor to make his acceptance speech, opposition lawmakers began chanting slogans against him.It was not the image that many had expected Mr. Khan to project: a new, composed prime minister. The tirade was a break from the conciliatory note he had taken in a national address just after his party won the elections.\u201cHe simply doesn\u2019t have it; he doesn\u2019t have the temperament to deal with dissent,\u201d said Khurram Dastgir-Khan, a sitting opposition parliamentarian who served as the defense minister in the previous government.\u201cThat is why he abandoned whatever high-minded speech he planned and went back to his fiery accusations. He was elected with a razor-thin majority. This is our new leader, a man who will struggle to negotiate with parliament to get support for his policies,\u201d he added.During Saturday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, Mr. Khan stumbled as he repeated the oath, and was immediately denounced by opponents for not being prepared. But his followers praised his humility.There were other stumbles. When Parliament was inaugurated on Monday, Mr. Khan forgot the national identification needed to enter the session. The speaker of the House had to grant him special permission to enter and to take his oath alongside fellow parliamentarians.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the most auspicious of beginning for this Parliament,\u201d said Mr. Amir, the analyst, adding, \u201cHe has to make the transition from opposition leader to the leader of Pakistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Louis C.K. and Men Who Think Justice Takes as Long as They Want It To", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA comedian who admitted to sexual misconduct seems to think it\u2019s time for his comeback.Contributing Opinion WriterTheir victims, however, have been disbelieved. They have had to withstand accusations that they are seeking attention. Justice has been grandly elusive. The public discourse has been more about whether the #MeToo movement has gone too far than it has been about reckoning with the alarming prevalence of sexual predation in every circumstance imaginable. \u201cShould a man pay for his misdeeds for the rest of his life?\u201d This is always the question raised when we talk about justice in the case of harassment and rape allegations against public figures. How long should a man who has faced no legal and few financial consequences for such actions pay the price? I appreciate the idea of restorative justice \u2014 that it might be possible to achieve justice through discussing the assault I experienced with the perpetrators and that I might be involved in determining an appropriate punishment for their crime. Restorative justice might afford me the agency they took from me. But I also appreciate the idea of those men spending some time in a prison cell, as problematic as the carceral system is, to think long and hard about the ways in which they violated me. I would like them to face material consequences for their actions because I have been doing so for 30 years. There is a part of me that wants them to endure what I endured. There is a part of me that is not interested in restoration. That part of me is interested in vengeance. And this is what is so difficult about justice and sexual violence \u2014 the repercussions of the crime can last a lifetime. Satisfying justice may not be possible, but we can certainly do better given that all too often, victims of sexual harassment and violence receive no justice at all. We spend so little energy thinking about justice for victims and so much energy thinking about the men who perpetrate sexual harassment and violence. We worry about what will become of them in the wake of their mistakes. We don\u2019t worry as much about those who have suffered at their hands. It is easier, for far too many people, to empathize with predators than it is to empathize with prey. I have to believe there is a path to redemption for people who have done wrong, but nine months of self-imposed exile in financial comfort is not a point along that path. It is far too soon for any of the men who have faced the marginal consequences born of the #MeToo movement to think about redemption. People love a comeback narrative, and all too often they yearn for this narrative at the expense of victims who are only beginning to reconcile with their suffering. Take Louis C.K. Not only did he expose himself to and masturbate in front of female comics; the actions of people in his employ reportedly worked to impede his victims\u2019 careers. Still, he has remained in control of the narrative. He gets to break the rules, and then he gets to establish rules of his own when he must answer for his misdeeds.How long should a man like Louis C.K. pay for what he did? At least as long as he worked to silence the women he assaulted and at least as long as he allowed them to doubt themselves and suffer in the wake of his predation and at least as long as the comedy world protected him even though there were very loud whispers about his behavior for decades. He should pay until he demonstrates some measure of understanding of what he has done wrong and the extent of the harm he has caused. He should attempt to financially compensate his victims for all the work they did not get to do because of his efforts to silence them. He should facilitate their getting the professional opportunities they should have been able to take advantage of all these years. He should finance their mental health care as long as they may need it. He should donate to nonprofit organizations that work with sexual harassment and assault victims. He should publicly admit what he did and why it was wrong without excuses and legalese and deflection. Every perpetrator of sexual harassment and violence should follow suit. We need to figure out what justice looks like in the court of public opinion, not for the sake of the offenders, but for the sake of victims. It is painful to know Louis C.K. simply strolled into a comedy club and did a set as if he hadn\u2019t admitted to masturbating in front of women, as if for sport. Advertisement"}

He sounded defiant in two speeches to supporters on Friday, railing against foreign powers that he accused of orchestrating Turkey\u2019s economic crisis, and vowing not to bow to Western pressure.\u201cThose who believe they can make us kneel by economic manipulation, have never understood this nation at all,\u201d he told a crowd in Gumushane, a province on Turkey\u2019s northern Black Sea coast. \u201cThey can\u2019t use threatening language, blackmailing language against this nation. Especially bullying will not cut it with our nation.\u201dAfter watching Mr. Erdogan on live television, Asli Aydintasbas, senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said, \u201cThey have no deal, their positions have hardened.\u201dThe breakdown was surprising, she said, because Mr. Trump had appeared to reach the outlines of an agreement for the pastor\u2019s release with Mr. Erdogan on the sidelines of the NATO summit last month.In exchange, the United States agreed to arrange for the Turkish banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who is serving a 32-month prison term in the United States, to be returned to serve the remainder of his sentence in Turkey.After his meeting with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Trump even threw in an extra favor, asking Israel to release a Turkish detainee, Ebru Ozkan, who was quickly freed.Washington wanted Mr. Brunson released immediately, but the formalities of the Turkish banker\u2019s transfer were expected to take two or three weeks, according to Ms. Aydintasbas.The deal has not happened, she said, as Turkey has held out for further guarantees, including the lowering of a fine by the United States Treasury against the state-owned Turkish bank Halkbank for conspiring to violate United States sanctions against Iran, and a promise to cease any further prosecutions.According to one American official, Turkey had been given a deadline to release Mr. Brunson, who is now under house arrest at his home in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, by 6 p.m. Wednesday.Turkey had seemed to be trying to stave off the crisis by scrambling a delegation to travel to Washington for more talks that day.The talks did not go well, said a second American official.\u201cThe conversations continue,\u201d said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, after the discussions.By Friday Mr. Erdogan seemed determined to tough it out. He called on Turks to sell their gold and dollars and buy lira to bolster the Turkish currency.\u201cThose who have dollars, euros, gold under their pillows, should go and change them in our banks for the Turkish Lira,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national struggle.\u201d\u201cErdogan has made a decision,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said. \u201cHis speech was clearly very defiant.\u201dYet Turkey\u2019s economic situation looked increasingly fragile.The lira\u2019s plunge has sent shudders through financial markets because it has raised doubts about investing in Turkish securities. The yield on Turkish 10-year bonds has risen sharply, to more than 20 percent, which means traders are demanding much higher returns for what they see as an increasingly risky investment.The anxiety extended to doubts about Asian and European banks that have heavily invested in Turkey, and it contributed to declines in stock markets around the world. As with the financial crisis set off by Greece in 2010, Friday\u2019s events were the latest example of how troubles in a nation with a midsize economy but world-class problems could threaten financial stability further afield.\u201cIn financial markets everything is interlinked,\u201d said Bart Hordijk, a market analyst in Amsterdam at Monex Europe, a foreign exchange firm. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if one bank has huge exposure to the Turkish lira.\u201dAs a result, Mr. Hordijk said, \u201cPeople scramble to safer assets.\u201dIn power for 15 years already, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has depended greatly on his ability to bring Turks continued economic growth. It has created a middle class beholden to him, even as he has trimmed civil liberties, jailed opponents, and constrained traditional and social media alike.The economic trouble has only worsened in the weeks since Mr. Erdogan acquired sweeping executive powers after his re-election to a newly enhanced presidential system in June.The currency\u2019s sharp decline has reflected concerns about the fundamentals of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s economic model, which has depended on a voracious construction industry that his opponents say has enriched his inner circle while heaping debt on the country.The even steeper fall in the lira since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election is now fueled by worries that he is ever more insulated and is taking no one\u2019s economic advice but his own.In an example of his increased role, he has resisted calls for a rise in interest rates to curb inflation and to ease pressure on the lira.Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, who has been appointed to the combined post of Treasury and Finance Minister, attempted to calm markets with a briefing to the news media.He insisted that Turkey would respect the independence of the Central Bank even as Mr. Erdogan\u2019s interference in monetary policy has been one of the causes of the fall of the lira, and that its economy would even show positive growth this year.\u201cTurkey will go further with its friends and with those who say \u2018We are for winning with Turkey,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTurkey has a very strong banking sector, it is well prepared to these kind of scenarios with its capital structure.\u201dTurkey also announced that Mr. Erdogan had held a telephone call with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Friday to discuss economic ties amid the market turmoil, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Erdogan, who has often touted his relationship with Russia as a signal that he has an alternative to relations with the West, said they discussed Russian tourism to Turkey.The minister of trade, Ruhsar Pekcan, reacted the news of the new sanctions in measures tones, pleading for a return to negotiations.\u201cTurkey is deeply disappointed by the U.S. Administration\u2019s decision to double steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe tariffs were groundless when they were announced in June, and remain so now.\u201d\u201cThe effects of this ill-advised action by the U.S. Administration will not only impact Turkey, but will prove detrimental to American companies and workers as well.\u201d\u201cWe implore President Trump to return to the negotiating table \u2014 this can and should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.\u201dCarlotta Gall reported from Istanbul, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt, Germany.

Sorry, I couldn\u2019t help myself.Indeed, Regan couldn\u2019t have picked a worse example \u2014 or, from the point of view of U.S. progressives, a better one.For Denmark has indeed taken a very different path from the United States over the past few decades, veering (modestly) to the left where we\u2019ve veered right.

We just have to get beyond the structural and cultural roadblocks that prevent us from talking about it.Most of us approach it this way: We\u2019re getting older and it\u2019s time to be a responsible adult, which means getting our financial lives in order. I think it\u2019s more effective to actually ask yourself specifically why you want to be better with money.Spending is often a really emotional experience, and the most important way you build better habits around money is to understand the emotions that come with it.Everyone\u2019s habits with money are going to be different. If you want to improve yours, it\u2019s crucial to understand your relationship with money and how you approach it so you can pinpoint bad habits. If you don\u2019t deal with the emotional side of money management, the practical stuff might not work. But I feel much better about money these days because I\u2019ve learned to let go of the shame I associated with it. We sometimes feel so ashamed about our money habits because there\u2019s so much judgment around money! If you\u2019re dwelling on a past mistake you\u2019ve made with money, or you just feel like you\u2019ll never be good at it, you tend to avoid it altogether.It\u2019s important to let go of those past mistakes and try to drown out the finger-pointing around money. If you can find a financial resource \u2014 a book, a podcast, a blog \u2014 that makes you feel positive about your relationship with money, stick to that resource and keep learning a little bit about money at a time. Even the \u201cexperts\u201d slip up every now and then, because to be bad with money is to be human. So don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.Illustration by Benedikt RugarAfter years of attempting and failing to use Mint as a budgeting tool, I realized the frustration I felt came from the sheer number of categories Mint imposes on users for nonrecurring expenses.My monthly budget could easily reach 15 to 20 categories, some which of which \u2014 like \u201crestaurants\u201d \u2014 are almost impossible to predict because they change each month depending on my social calendar. Setting spending goals for nonrecurring expenses like that can be near-impossible, since you never know if this is going to be \u201c$50 on entertainment\u201d month or a \u201c$250 on entertainment\u201d month.So to simplify my budget, I split my expenses into only two categories:So, for example, say I have $1,000 in \u201cpersonal spending\u201d for the month. If I\u2019m feeling culinarily adventurous, I can spend $600 eating at restaurants and, as long as I don\u2019t go over my total spending limit, I\u2019m still sticking to my budget.From there I can track these expenses using tags, like snacks, Broadway shows and eyebrows, allowing me to watch my spending in a much more granular way.Advertisement"}

Medical Students", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New York University School of Medicine announced on Thursday that it would cover the tuition of all its students, regardless of merit or need, citing concerns about the \u201coverwhelming financial debt\u201d facing graduates.N.Y.U.\u2019s initiative comes at a time when affordability has become an increasingly urgent issue in higher education, with some graduates struggling with thousands of dollars in debt.But N.Y.U.\u2019s plan, which was announced Thursday morning in an unexpected ending to the annual \u201cWhite Coat Ceremony\u201d for new students and their families, goes beyond that, and may spur other top medical schools to follow suit. In a statement, N.Y.U. said that it would be the only top-ranked medical school in the nation to offer full-tuition scholarships to all students.The plan, effective immediately, covers all current and future students. Annual tuition is roughly $55,000. There are 93 first-year students, and another 350 students who have up to three years left before obtaining their degrees. (A small group of new and current students who are enrolled in joint M.D./Ph.D. programs already have their tuitions paid for, thanks to the National Institutes of Health.)The plan does not cover room and board or fees, which together are an additional $27,000, on average.About 62 percent of N.Y.U.\u2019s School of Medicine graduates leave with some debt; the average debt incurred by members of the class of 2017 was $184,000.\u201cThis decision recognizes a moral imperative that must be addressed, as institutions place an increasing debt burden on young people who aspire to become physicians,\u201d said Robert I. Grossman, dean of the medical school and chief executive officer of N.Y.U. Langone Health.N.Y.U. said that it had raised more than $450 million of the $600 million that it anticipates will be necessary to finance the tuition plan. About $100 million of that has been contributed by Kenneth G. Langone, the founder of Home Depot, and his wife, Elaine, for whom the medical school is named.Most of the roughly 20,000 students per year enrolled in American medical schools take out sizable federal loans to support their studies. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, in 2017, the median debt for graduating medical students was $192,000. The median cost of medical school attendance, including living expenses, was $60,945 a year for public medical school and $82,278 for private medical school.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "John McCain to Discontinue Treatment for Brain Cancer, Family Says", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been battling brain cancer for more than a year, will no longer be treated for his condition, his family announced on Friday, a sign that the Republican war hero is most likely entering his final days.\u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWith his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\u201dMr. McCain, 81, had been undergoing treatment since July 2017, and has been absent from Washington since December. Mr. McCain\u2019s family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent.From his ranch in Arizona, Mr. McCain had managed to maintain a voice in key foreign policy and military policy debates, sharply criticizing President Trump after his summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, an old adversary of Mr. McCain. At home, he has welcomed close friends to renew ties. But after decades as a fixture in Washington and a larger-than-life character, he had largely retreated from the public eye.Senators from both parties quickly wrote to comfort Mr. McCain\u2019s family and lauded his service. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader and an occasional McCain sparring partner, wrote on Twitter that Mr. McCain has been a \u201cdear friend\u201d with whom he was lucky to serve in the Senate.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said, \u201cMay the prayers and affection of his country, and of friends around the world, surround John and his beloved family in these peaceful final hours.\u201dThe son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr. McCain rose to become one of the towering figures in American politics, twice seeking the presidency and winning the 2008 Republican nomination for president. In the Senate, he has been both revered as an iconoclast and criticized by many, including Mr. Trump, for his willingness to buck his party on issues like campaign finance reform and, last summer, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, Mr. McCain has watched his party steer sharply away from many of the values he long championed. A fierce advocate for an expansive and interventionist American foreign policy, Mr. McCain has fretted as Mr. Trump moved the party toward \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, criticizing longtime American allies and institutions like NATO, while praising adversaries like Russia.For decades, Mr. McCain advocated on behalf of refugees and was a leading \u2014 if intermittent \u2014 Republican voice in a few efforts to overhaul the American immigration system. Mr. Trump has tried to strictly limit both.Though he was unable to vote on the Republican tax cut bill late last year, a top Trump priority, Mr. McCain\u2019s endorsement helped secure its passage.Still, neither Mr. McCain nor Mr. Trump has held back from airing their differences, often with bruising consequences.As a candidate, Mr. Trump openly said he did not consider Mr. McCain a war hero, saying he preferred \u201cpeople who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Since Mr. McCain helped kill the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump has made mimicking the Arizona Republican\u2019s thumbs-down vote a staple of his stump speeches.\u201cThat was not a good thing when he put the thumb down,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one rally in June.Mr. McCain has not held his tongue either.In his final book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d published in May, Mr. McCain sharply criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s moral character, warning against his apparent admiration for autocratic leaders and his sharp crackdown on immigration. After Mr. Trump seemingly accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election interference, Mr. McCain penned a blistering statement, calling the summit meeting \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201dMr. McCain has made clear he intends to remain a senator until his death. It will fall to Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, to appoint his successor to serve through 2020.The choice is not necessarily a simple one. The state already has an open contest to replace Senator Jeff Flake, who is retiring, in November and a competitive Republican primary scheduled for next Tuesday.Mr. Ducey could name Representative Martha McSally, a relatively moderate former Air Force fighter pilot who is running in the Republican primary to replace Mr. Flake.In doing so, he would ensure that Ms. McSally, a favorite of Republicans in Washington, would have a seat in the Senate.But such a move would also clear the way for Joe Arpaio or Kelli Ward, two conservative hard-liners competing with Ms. McSally, to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Flake\u2019s seat and increase the chances of losing it to the Democrats.Mr. Ducey could also choose Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, for the seat. But Ms. McCain is a relative moderate and could make it more difficult for Republican leaders in Washington to hold together their narrow majority on key votes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russ Feingold: John McCain Was a Committed Leader. He Was Also Really Fun.", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Feingold, a Democrat, served in the Senate from 1993 to 2011.When we traveled from Little Rock to Annapolis to San Francisco and beyond to hold \u201ctownhall meetings\u201d in the home districts of recalcitrant senators and congressmen, John delighted in introducing me to the crowds saying: \u201cPeople in Wisconsin think Senator Feingold\u2019s first name is McCain,\u201d reflecting the popular name of our campaign finance reform bill and also how long it was taking to pass it. In a place like New Orleans, after a long day of meetings and rallies and long after I had gone to bed, John was still playing the tables at Harrah\u2019s though he was 16 years my senior.When I would see John on the Senate floor way over on the \u201cother\u201d \u2014 Republican \u2014 side, he would invariably come running over to me and say something like, \u201cC\u2019mon boy, we have to get one more Democrat co-sponsor.\u201d Or, \u201cWe\u2019re going to New York next week for a news conference at Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s birthplace.\u201d The conversations were brief, to the point and about getting the job done: He was a determined man, always in motion. All of us, including his terrific staff led by Mark Salter, were always trying to keep up with him, to which John would typically say, \u201cMarch or die. March or die.\u201dOf course we did not always see eye-to-eye, even on our own bill. There was one period when John and I knew we had to scale back our more ambitious campaign-finance legislation to attract support. We had a tense and difficult conversation about what should be cut, and it didn\u2019t end well. I spent the evening afterward wondering whether we might go separate ways, even though, despite our ideological differences, we had reached the same conclusion: that the system by which members of Congress were being elected was corrupt.By this time, John and I were no longer just a political odd couple. We had become dear friends. When I approached John on the Senate floor the next morning to agree to much of his version of a scaled-back McCain-Feingold bill, I was struck and humbled by the relief on his face. We laughed when he hugged me and patted me on the back repeatedly. John also agreed to some of my requests in that conversation, conveying a keen understanding of why I was fighting hard for certain provisions.One time, during a long, lonely debate before we had nearly enough votes, we sat together on the Senate floor and commented about how our colleagues in each of our parties weren\u2019t speaking to us much anymore. I said, \u201cYeah, and now you\u2019re going to become president and leave me here alone.\u201d John replied, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019ll be in the cabinet.\u201d He paused and then, with a grin, said, \u201cBut just not as secretary of defense.\u201dAnd, indeed, while we often agreed on domestic reform issues, we had almost diametrically opposed views on defense, especially on certain military interventions, Iraq in particular. But this did not stop John from inviting me as one of two Democrats on a nine-person congressional delegation trip to Iraq in 2006, when things were not going at all well there. On the plane trip over, he had us all convene for a briefing. John spoke at length about the approach of Col. H.R. McMaster, who would later become a three-star general and President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, to insurgencies. At the appropriate time, I interjected my views about the likely futility of such an approach, to which a Republican governor on the trip said: \u201cWhy did you bring this guy along?\u201d Not missing a beat, John responded: \u201cI bring Russ along because he is consistent \u2014 consistently wrong.\u201d The fact is, as passionate as John was about his positions, he truly valued hearing all sides and was a good listener.Yet, it was John\u2019s interaction in Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone in 2006 with David Petraeus, then a lieutenant general, that most displayed his integrity and commitment to getting things right. John\u2019s questions to the decorated general were pointed and tough and made clear his first duty was to the American men and women serving there, not to his own ego or belief in the mission. He sharply challenged the general\u2019s claims about the success that had been achieved in training Iraqi troops. He did this in front of strong opponents of the war knowing it could be used as fodder against the intervention in which he believed. He wanted to know the facts wherever they led.That encounter and so many others made me feel that John would have been a very good president. His fundamental respect for diverging viewpoints, his willingness to befriend people from different parties and philosophies, his intense desire not for political dominance but to get things done, and yes, his sense of humor, would have served our divided nation and fraught world well.John McCain, to paraphrase Teddy Roosevelt, had the heart to demand joy in life. And demand it he did, with his wife, Cindy, whose own work, particularly in Africa, remains a powerful example of caring and commitment. Like so many others, I will greatly miss my friend. We will all be poorer without his leadership. He was a modern-day rough rider, and those of us who knew him well will longingly remember those days when we could join the charge by his side.Advertisement"}

Candidates Than Ever", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA record number of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender candidates are running for office in November, as the Trump administration and state-level politicians have moved to roll back some legal protections.KANSAS CITY, Kan. \u2014 Sharice Davids, a leading Democrat in a key congressional primary election on Tuesday, finished a White House fellowship in the early months of the Trump administration. As a lesbian and a Native American, she became convinced that hard-won progress on issues like gay rights and the environment would erode under Mr. Trump, and thought Kansans in her district might support her as a counterforce to the president.Ms. Davids is among more than 400 gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender candidates running for office this year \u2014 a record number, according to groups that track such data. Most are Democrats, and several are mounting anti-Trump congressional bids with a message broader than gay rights. Ms. Davids says she talks mostly about issues like health care and only had one exchange with a voter who questioned whether a gay person could win.Ms. Davids and other candidates are also pursuing a new kind of political strategy that treats sexuality, race and gender as campaign assets that intersect with their criticism of Mr. Trump, their warnings about lost progress on civil rights, and their policy ideas. Many of the candidates are running in states far from liberal areas on the East and West Coasts. They include Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, who is seeking re-election; Representative Jared Polis, who is the Democratic nominee for governor of Colorado; and Representative Kyrsten Sinema, who is running in the Aug. 28 Senate primary in Arizona. There are also many first-time candidates like Ms. Davids in Kansas; Christine Hallquist, a transgender woman running in the Aug. 14 Democratic primary to be governor of Vermont; and Rick Neal, a former humanitarian aid worker in Afghanistan and Liberia and current stay-at-home dad in Columbus, Ohio.Mr. Neal won the Democratic primary in the 15th District of Ohio and will compete in November against Representative Steve Stivers, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Mr. Neal said some voters were \u201cnaturally curious\u201d about how he would appeal to people who \u201cmay not be comfortable\u201d with his sexuality. \u201cI just talk about what I want to work on and what I want to do for people,\u201d he said, citing issues like campaign finance reform and improving access to health care. \u201cI guess at the end of the day a gay guy with an interracial family running for Congress is a little bit like waving a red flag in front of a bull for some folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like they were trying to intimidate us and that\u2019s just not going to work.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d said Jessica Gonzalez, who is running unopposed for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives to represent the 104th District, in Dallas County. She said L.G.B.T. lawmakers could \u201cdefinitely make a big difference.\u201dMs. Davids, of Kansas, agreed. \u201cHaving L.G.B.T. people sitting in the room while decisions are being made, and sitting there as peers, will shift the conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the lived experiences and the point of view of L.G.B.T. folks be included in conversations that affect all of us.\u201dDespite the growing number of candidates, Andrew Reynolds, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who tracks those numbers, said he was \u201cnot convinced there will be a dramatic increase in the number of statehouse members.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like a massive rainbow wave that will dominate news stories,\u201d he said. There are 13 states \u2014 largely in the Midwest and the South \u2014 where no gay or transgender people are serving in the legislature. The experience of candidates there point to the challenges that remain. Michael Aycox, 30, who ran in a Democratic primary this spring in a Mississippi district that President Trump won by 24 points, was the first openly gay congressional candidate in the state\u2019s history. He lost by almost 40 points.\u201cI had 17 death threats,\u201d Mr. Aycox said. \u201cMy community respects me, but they\u2019re going to stand with their religious beliefs every day. Religious beliefs are the governing framework for this state.\u201dMr. Boykin acknowledged that the Republican Party has \u201csome issues\u201d with respect to gay rights, but he said working with \u201cthese so-called homophobic senators\u201d is more effective than taking a combative stance. That is why some, like Ms. Davids, said they were running for office in the first place: to get different kinds of people engaged with the political process. \u201cWe are going to elect more women this year, we\u2019re going to elect more people who are L.G.B.T., we\u2019re going to elect more people who are people of color,\u201d said Ms. Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, a Native American tribe in Wisconsin. \u201cThis midterm election cycle is our opportunity to demonstrate who we are as a country.\u201d Liam Stack reported from Kansas City, Kan., and Catie Edmondson from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Know About Trump\u2019s $130,000 Payment to Stormy Daniels", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the landslide of news last week about guilty pleas, immunity deals and criminal convictions, you no doubt heard something astonishing: President Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer said in open court that Mr. Trump directed him to pay a pornographic film star quite a bit of money not to tell the world that they had sex.Other than that, you might be somewhat hazy on the details.Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements about the arrangement with Ms. Clifford \u2014 a $130,000 payment given to her by the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2014 have, shall we say, evolved over time.Here\u2019s everything that we now know \u2014 and don\u2019t \u2014 about Mr. Trump\u2019s deal with Ms. Clifford.Ms. Clifford, now 39, first met Mr. Trump in July 2006 \u2014 four months after his son Barron was born \u2014 at American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nev.At that point, she was a porn star with more than 60 credits to her name in movies like \u201cSlave to Love\u201d and \u201cThe Witches of Breastwick.\u201d She had gone to the event to promote her adult-film company, Wicked Pictures.They dined in his room and eventually had sex, she said. (\u201cTextbook generic,\u201d as she put it.)Ms. Clifford claims the two met again, including at Mr. Trump\u2019s private bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles.Mr. Trump has denied the affair.Ms. Clifford gave the In Touch interview in 2011, but given its sensitive subject, the magazine decided not to publish it at the time.Cut to five years later, when Mr. Trump, now running for president, was besieged by questions about his relationships with women.It was then, prosecutors say, that Ms. Clifford\u2019s agent, Gina Rodriguez, decided it was time for her client to try again to publicize the tale of what she said was her affair with Mr. Trump.According to court papers, one day after the video was released, Ms. Rodriguez reached out to someone she thought could help her: a top editor at American Media Inc., a conglomerate whose flagship publication was the National Enquirer.Her message to the editor was clear: Ms. Clifford, as the government later put it, was \u201cwilling to make public statements and confirm on the record\u201d her assignations with Mr. Trump.Even though the National Enquirer was a supermarket tabloid, known for publishing gossip, it turned out to be the worst place possible to take a story about Mr. Trump\u2019s infidelities.David J. Pecker, the publication\u2019s owner, was not only a longtime friend of Mr. Trump. More to the point, as the presidential race was heating up, Mr. Pecker had turned the Enquirer into something like an early-warning system for Trump-related scandals, prosecutors said.Whenever the tabloid heard \u201cnegative stories\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s relationships with women, the government said, Mr. Pecker and his staff would work to have them \u201cpurchased and their publication avoided\u201d \u2014 a tactic that was known as catch-and-kill.In approaching the Enquirer, Ms. Rodriguez and Ms. Clifford triggered this early-warning system.Instead of rushing into print their scoop about a major party\u2019s candidate for president, Mr. Pecker, having caught the story, sent it to be killed by somebody he trusted: Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer and fixer, Mr. Cohen.It was not the first time Mr. Cohen had done this.A few months earlier, prosecutors said, Mr. Cohen had worked with Mr. Pecker to catch and kill the story of the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who had also claimed an affair with Mr. Trump.Although that deal \u2014 for $150,000 \u2014 was never sealed, Ms. McDougal was represented in the negotiations by a lawyer from Los Angeles, Keith Davidson.As it happened, Mr. Davidson also represented Ms. Clifford. And with the presidential election only a month away, he and Mr. Cohen went to work again, quickly striking a deal to keep Ms. Clifford quiet.Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Cohen agreed to pay Ms. Clifford $130,000 through Essential Consultants LLC, a shell company he created. (He got the money, prosecutors said, through a fraudulently obtained home-equity loan.)Ms. Clifford, in turn, agreed to sign a nondisclosure contract with Mr. Trump. In it, she was identified as Peggy Peterson and he as David Dennison.There was just one problem: Mr. Trump never signed the papers. That omission could cause him future legal problems because Ms. Clifford\u2019s current lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has sued him.Mr. Avenatti is claiming that the nondisclosure contract that Ms. Clifford signed is void because Mr. Trump never bothered putting his signature on it.Two things happened at this point.First, Mr. Trump was elected president. Second, shortly after his inauguration, In Touch finally published Ms. Clifford\u2019s account of the affair.Mr. Cohen wanted Ms. Clifford \u201cto lie to the American public about her relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d according to the lawsuit.But after a series of frantic texts to Mr. Davidson \u2014 \u201cCan you call me please?\u201d \u201cPlease call me\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen abruptly changed his mind about putting Ms. Clifford on TV.Why?The lawsuit quotes him as sending a cryptic text to Mr. Davidson.\u201cThe wise men all believe the story is dying,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote, \u201cand don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart for her to do any interviews.\u201dBut the president\u2019s position on the matter, like that of those close to him, has gradually shifted over time.Contrary to established law, he went on to insist that, even though he had paid the $130,000 back to Mr. Cohen, none of it amounted to a crime.The payments did not \u201ccome out of the campaign,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey came from me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gallagher, a large insurance broker. Some companies are self-insured, he said, but many find earthquake insurance too expensive.California, with its multiple geological faults, has benefited from a period of seismic quiet over the past two decades \u2014 the last major earthquake struck Los Angeles in 1994 \u2014 but a small earthquake that shook parts of Los Angeles County earlier this week was a reminder of the state\u2019s seismic vulnerability. A big earthquake is a certainty for the state, scientists say.\u201cWhat are we going to do when no one has insurance and everyone has damage?\u201d said Mary Comerio, an earthquake expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dOther states prone to natural disasters have much higher insurance rates. In Florida, where banks typically require homeowners to purchase hurricane windstorm coverage, about 70 percent of households have it, according to ImageCat, a company specializing in disaster risks.In California, earthquake insurance is not included in standard homeowner policies, and few banks require homeowners to buy it. Alex Kaplan, a disaster specialist at Swiss Re, the insurance company, calls earthquakes the \u201clargest uninsured exposure from a natural disaster in the U.S.\u201dWith the median price of a home in California now above $500,000, estimates of the potential uncovered losses in an earthquake run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Economists say a large earthquake could have serious repercussions for local California banks. And with one-fifth of America\u2019s $10 trillion in mortgage debt held in California, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that guarantee much of America\u2019s mortgage debt, are also exposed to the risk, economists say.Those who have lived through major earthquakes recount how damaging they can be, even to ordinary wood-structure homes, which are considered among the safest.Art Polan and his wife were still sleeping when the Northridge earthquake struck their two-story home in 1994. Bookshelves crashed to the floor, and the china in the kitchen spilled out of closets. \u201cThe house was totaled,\u201d Mr. Polan said. The insurance payout he received was not enough to rebuild the house, so with the help of a federal loan, he moved and built elsewhere.Cindy Watter remembers the Napa earthquake of 2014 sounding like \u201ca runaway train full of howling beasts was outside my back door.\u201d Her two-story Victorian home, built in 1895, had relatively light damage, but her neighbors were not as lucky. One house burned to the ground because of a gas fire.\u201cLots of people around here took a real financial hit and couldn\u2019t afford to fix up their houses, so they sold them and moved away,\u201d Ms. Watter said. \u201cI still have earthquake insurance because, well, you never know.\u201dInsurance is not a panacea, experts say. Even if every building in California were insured, a large earthquake could nonetheless have a devastating impact on the economy.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as easy as some people make it out to be,\u201d said Laurie A. Johnson, an expert on the economics of earthquakes who has served as a consultant to cities and insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not a simplistic answer just to say people need to have insurance.\u201dA magnitude 7 earthquake on the Hayward fault, which runs through major cities like Oakland and Berkeley, would displace more than 400,000 people from their homes \u2014 the equivalent of about half the population of San Francisco \u2014 according to a recent simulation by the U.S. Geological Survey. With California already suffering a severe housing shortage, many people who would lose their homes could be forced to leave the area after an earthquake, whether they have insurance or not, Ms. Johnson said.The scale of economic losses from an earthquake would of course depend in large part on whether it struck near a large metropolitan area. Estimates of total damages for an earthquake in the Los Angeles area dwarf the costs of any previous natural disasters in the United States.CoreLogic, a real estate research company, estimated that a 7.3 magnitude earthquake along the Puente Hills Fault in Los Angeles would cause economic losses of as much as $450 billion, more than twice as much as the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the costliest United States natural disaster to date.The main source of earthquake insurance in California is a nonprofit, publicly managed organization known as the California Earthquake Authority, founded two decades ago in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. Shocked by the nearly $17 billion in payouts they made in that earthquake, insurance companies balked at offering further earthquake policies, forcing the state to step in and establish the earthquake authority.The seismic lull in California since Northridge has helped the authority accumulate $15 billion in available funds for an eventual payout. But its earthquake policies are expensive, and awareness remains low among California residents, experts say.Mr. Jones, the insurance commissioner, describes the low uptake of insurance as \u201ca chronic problem of denial and underestimation of the risk.\u201dIn the case of a large earthquake would the state or federal government come to the rescue?Mr. Jones says no.Many Californians, he said, \u201cmistakenly believe that FEMA or the state will rebuild their homes in the event of an earthquake.\u201dFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has a ceiling on individual assistance in disasters of $33,000, but actual payouts are typically much lower.\u201cIf you have a $1.45 million home in San Francisco, that $33,000 is not going to get you very far,\u201d said Mr. Kaplan of Swiss Re.Evan Reis, an engineer who is the executive director of the U.S. Resiliency Council, a nonprofit organization founded to promote the construction of buildings more resistant to earthquakes, finds it odd that flood insurance is required by banks in flood zones, but that earthquake insurance is not required in coastal California.\u201cIn the Bay Area, 90 percent of the properties are not insured,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many hundreds of billions of dollars is that in potential uninsured losses? it\u2019s astounding when you think of it.\u201dLast year, the share of California households with earthquake insurance rose to 13 percent, from 11 percent the previous year.Glenn Pomeroy, chief executive of the California Earthquake Authority, attributes the uptick partly to the public seeing reports about disasters like the Northern California wildfires last October, as well as Hurricane Harvey and earthquakes in Mexico.Several years ago, the earthquake authority ran ads showing happy Californians enjoying the beach or walking through a Sierra forest, with an upbeat narrator suggesting that viewers consider earthquake insurance because \u201cCalifornia rocks.\u201d\u201cWe overdid it in terms of not scaring people,\u201d Mr. Pomeroy said.The authority plans to spend $12 million on advertising in 2019, more than double its spending at the beginning of the decade. Its latest campaign, \u201cIt could happen today,\u201d uses suspenseful music and darkened scenes of California waking to uncertainty.\u201cWill today be like any other?\u201d intones a worried voice. \u201cOr a day that turns our world upside down?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The younger Mr. Goodlatte\u2019s Twitter feed is largely composed of musings on cryptocurrency, social media and technology, and the occasional anti-Trump retweet. In criticizing online trolling of Barron Trump, the president\u2019s youngest son, last January, he tweeted, \u201cChildren don\u2019t choose their parents\u2019 politics.\u201dNeither Mr. Goodlatte responded to inquiries seeking comment.The younger Mr. Goodlatte, in the past decade, has donated to just one candidate, according to federal campaign finance records: Max Rose, a Democrat and an Army veteran running for Congress in New York\u2019s 11th District, which includes Staten Island and southern Brooklyn.

It\u2019s Time to Play \u2018Find the Collusion\u2019!", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Have you heard the one about the collusion? Nobody can seem to find it!It was about halfway through President Trump\u2019s speech to thousands of supporters last week in West Virginia \u2014 right after referring to \u201cfake news and the Russian witch hunt,\u201d as if it were an ironically named rock band \u2014 that he breezily posed the question.Spreading his arms in mock confusion, as if half expecting to find it hidden, like a particularly elusive Easter egg, somewhere near the lectern bearing the presidential seal, Mr. Trump issued the challenge again.\u201cFind some collusion,\u201d the president bellowed, making the notion of uncovering a conspiracy with a foreign power to sway a presidential election sound more like a scavenger hunt \u2014 a kind of \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d for undermining American democracy.\u201cWe want to find the collusion!\u201dHad his audience in that civic center in Charleston seen it? (A smattering of boos and thumbs jamming downward in response indicated that they had not.) Had anybody? What about Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections, and whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team sought to help?The answer Mr. Trump was going for, of course, was no. With legal troubles mounting for some of his closest former associates and Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation still looming as an existential threat to his presidency, he has distilled the scandals surrounding him into a comic book-like drama, with a reality showman\u2019s instinct for cliffhanger and competition.The mantra of \u201cno collusion\u201d has emerged for Mr. Trump and his team as a shield and a talisman. It is the answer to every question, the nonresponsive parry to every thrust of a question about the president\u2019s credibility and actions, the ultimate rejoinder to any hint of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump.In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, it refers to the specific allegation that members of his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 election in his favor. But he has adopted it as a shorthand to encompass any allegation against him, making it into the sought-after object in his own kind of morality tale.In it, there are villains: Mr. Mueller and his \u201c17 angry Democrats,\u201d as Mr. Trump is fond of calling the special counsel\u2019s team, as well as Jeff Sessions, whom he casts as the weak-kneed attorney general who has allowed biased prosecutors to run amok with their \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer who pleaded guilty last week to campaign finance crimes and implicated Mr. Trump in the scheme, has also recently joined this team, as the president made clear in several tweets after his plea.There are heroes, such as himself and the \u201cbrave\u201d Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, who was convicted of multiple counts of fraud on the same day as Mr. Cohen\u2019s bombshell. Mr. Trump lavishly praised Mr. Manafort for refusing to \u201cbreak\u201d and cooperate with federal investigators.And then there\u2019s the Ultimate Prize \u2014 the collusion \u2014 that nobody seems to be able to lay their hands on, like so many children at a Passover Seder hunting for the afikomen, the hidden piece of matzo at the end of the meal that fetches its finder a reward of a dollar or so. Who can find the collusion, kids?Nobody yet, even as the buzzer of the midterm congressional elections draws closer.On Tuesday in West Virginia, collusion hide-and-seek appeared to be little more than a way for the president to shrug off a series of damaging developments; Mr. Trump quickly moved on to other subjects. But his rhetorical questioning also revealed how Mr. Trump, a president facing the most serious of threats, has sought to minimize and trivialize what is happening in and around his White House, and in the process, to desensitize his supporters to grave charges.\u201cThere is an entertainment aspect to this, and this tease of \u2018Who\u2019s going to win? Who\u2019s going to be the bad guy?\u2019 and Trump has a demonstrable instinct for this,\u201d said Mary E. Stuckey, a professor of communications at Penn State University who has written extensively on presidential communication. \u201cIt keeps people watching, and it puts the attention where he wants it, which is, \u2018Where is the shiny object?\u2019\u201dThere is a strategy behind Mr. Trump\u2019s framing, intentional or not. It\u2019s a way of mocking what is in fact a serious allegation, of muddying the waters of what is a clear-cut question that Mr. Mueller is working to answer. Legal experts have said a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians to break election laws could, indeed, be a crime.If the issues looming over his presidency are a kind of game, then perhaps voters will consider themselves nothing more than popcorn-munching spectators in a drama, rather than people deeply invested in the outcome. That could be vital to Republicans\u2019 chances of keeping Congress in the midterm congressional elections in November, when a Democratic takeover of the House would lead to a rash of Democratic-led investigations of Mr. Trump, and potentially impeachment proceedings against him.\u201cIf it\u2019s entertaining, then it can\u2019t be serious, because those things don\u2019t exist in the same box,\u201d Ms. Stuckey said.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have adopted his approach, albeit with less apparent enthusiasm.\u201cThe president has done nothing wrong, there are no charges against him, there is no collusion,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, intoned dutifully three separate times in a news briefing on Wednesday.During a contentious interview on CNN on Thursday night, Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, got into the game as well, when asked whether the president had lied.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Ms. Conway demanded of the host, Chris Cuomo. (The collusion, she meant.)\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about collusion and promising it to your viewers,\u201d she added.For Mr. Trump and his team, the idea of an endless find-the-collusion game may be having its desired effect. Public polls have shown a slight decline in support for the continuation of Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry since last year. Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said that was in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent harping on the idea that the prosecutors have not found their Holy Grail.\u201cThere is a point where the public starts getting tired,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that they distrust Mueller, but it\u2019s: \u2018O.K., this thing has been going on for a long time. Show your cards now or go onto something else.\u2019\u201dUntil then, as Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, sounding as if he was announcing the next episode of a game show, \u201cWe continue the witch hunt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Says He Arranged Payments to Women at Trump\u2019s Direction", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, a litany of crimes that revealed both his shadowy involvement in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle and his own corrupt business dealings.He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d implicating the president in a federal crime.\u201cI participated in this conduct, which on my part took place in Manhattan, for the principal purpose of influencing the election\u201d for president in 2016, Mr. Cohen said.The plea represented a pivotal moment in the investigation into the president, and the scene in the Manhattan courtroom was striking. Mr. Cohen, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump \u2014 and loyal confidant \u2014 described in plain-spoken language how Mr. Trump worked with him to cover up a potential sex scandal that Mr. Trump feared would endanger his rising candidacy.Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to multiple counts of tax evasion and a single count of bank fraud, capping a monthslong investigation by Manhattan federal prosecutors who examined his personal business dealings and his role in helping to arrange the financial deals with women connected to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have, for months, said privately that they considered Mr. Cohen\u2019s case to be potentially more problematic for the president than the investigation by the special counsel.But Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said in a statement after Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea, \u201cThere is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government\u2019s charges against Mr. Cohen.\u201dIn federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Cohen made the admission about Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the payments to the women \u2014 an adult film actress and a former Playboy playmate \u2014 as he pleaded guilty to two campaign finance crimes.One of those charges stemmed from a $130,000 payment he made to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.Prosecutors said that Trump Organization executives were involved in reimbursing Mr. Cohen for that payment, accepting his phony invoices that listed it as a legal expense. The other charge concerned a complicated arrangement in which a tabloid bought the rights to the story about the former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, then killed it.Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea was announced by Robert Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney, along with senior officials from the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service. Addressing reporters outside the courthouse, Mr. Khuzami said that Mr. Cohen had \u201cdecided that he was above the law, and for that, he is going to pay a very, very serious price.\u201dThe plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty.If Mr. Cohen were to substantially assist the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Mr. Mueller could recommend a reduction in his sentence.Mr. Cohen had been the president\u2019s longtime fixer, handling some of his most sensitive personal matters over a decade at the Trump Organization. He once said he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump.As Mr. Cohen addressed the judge, admitting to the crimes he had committed, the packed courtroom remained silent. Even when Mr. Cohen made obvious references to Mr. Trump, referring to him as \u201cthe candidate\u201d and \u201ca candidate for federal office,\u201d spectators seemed to listen raptly, with no gasps or audible reactions.Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion for concealing more than $4 million in personal income from 2012 to 2016 and to one count of bank fraud, for failing to disclose $14 million in debts in an application for a $500,000 home equity line of credit \u2014 the source of his payment to Ms. Clifford.He also pleaded guilty to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution during the 2016 election cycle.He will be sentenced on Dec. 12 before Judge William H. Pauley III. Though Mr. Cohen faces a maximum of 65 years in prison, the plea agreement provides for a far more lenient sentence: The government calculated the sentencing guidelines at from 51 to 63 months and the defense put them at 46 to 57 months. A final guidelines determination will be made by the Probation Department, but the ultimate sentence will be determined by Judge Pauley.Mr. Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny J. Davis, said Mr. Cohen had put his family and country ahead of his loyalty to Mr. Trump.\u201cHe stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cIf those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn\u2019t they be a crime for Donald Trump?\u201dLooming over the negotiations between prosecutors and Mr. Cohen has been the possibility of a presidential pardon. Mr. Trump reached out to Mr. Cohen by phone a few days after the F.B.I. raids, and they had dinner together a month earlier in March, at Mr. Trump\u2019s private club in Florida, Mar-a-Lago.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer had loosely raised the issue of a pardon with an attorney for Mr. Trump several months ago, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.By striking a deal with Mr. Cohen that includes prison time, federal authorities were aware of the risk that the president might pardon him, said another person briefed on the matter. But it is also possible that Mr. Cohen could eventually cooperate.Prosecutors charged that Mr. Cohen\u2019s $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford was effectively a donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, because by securing her silence it improved his electoral fortunes, and thus violated 2016 campaign finance law prohibitions against donations of more than $2,700 in a general election.Mr. Cohen also pleaded guilty to \u201ccausing\u201d an illegal corporate donation to Mr. Trump through his involvement in a $150,000 payment American Media Inc. made to Ms. McDougal in late summer 2016 to buy the rights to her story, effectively securing her silence for the remainder of the campaign.Corporations are prohibited from coordinating political spending with candidates or their representatives. Mr. Cohen signed papers a month later to purchase the rights to her agreement from A.M.I., but the publisher backed out of the deal at the last minute.The prosecutors filled in several blanks in a story that has been unfolding for months about the lengths to which Mr. Cohen went during the campaign to help his boss stave off embarrassing news about alleged affairs ahead of Election Day.And the charges confirmed that what might have seemed on the surface to have been only tawdry allegations involving an adult entertainment star and a former Playboy model may actually carry legal and political implications for a sitting president.MichaelD.

Inc., owner of The National Enquirer, became a de facto campaign proxy for Mr. Cohen in his efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump.According to court papers, the publisher agreed in August 2015, months before the first primaries, to look out for damaging stories about Mr. Trump and his alleged affairs with women during talks with Mr. Cohen and \u201cone or more\u201d members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.The tabloid company agreed to identify those stories \u201cso they could be purchased and their publication avoided,\u201d the prosecutors said on Tuesday \u2014 an inverted role for a tabloid scandal sheet such as The Enquirer, which went on to savage Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents while promoting and protecting him.That deal led to the arrangement with Ms. McDougal, which was struck in August 2016. It only came together, prosecutors said, after Mr. Cohen promised A.M.I. it would be reimbursed for the McDougal payment.But prosecutors also reported for the first time that A.M.I. was intimately involved in the arrangement with Ms. Clifford. The tabloid connected Mr. Cohen with the lawyer who had negotiated the McDougal contract, Keith Davidson. Mr. Davidson also had Ms. Clifford as a client and later hashed out the agreement for Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence.Prosecutors said in court papers that when Mr. Cohen initially failed to finalize the deal, an editor at A.M.I. \u2014 a likely reference to Dylan Howard, the company\u2019s chief content officer \u2014 alerted Mr. Cohen that there was a risk that Ms. Clifford would sell her story to another media company, one that would publish it.Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission that he broke the law by paying off Ms. Clifford was a remarkable turnaround from the legal and publicity battle that he and his lawyers had waged against her. Ms. Clifford and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, have hounded Mr. Cohen since May, taunting him on social media and predicting his indictment.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers frequently fired back, accusing Mr. Avenatti of \u201cfanning a media storm\u201d and of \u201csmearing\u201d Mr. Cohen in a relentless series of televised appearances.\u201cI predicted this a long time ago before the warrants were even executed,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said on Tuesday. \u201cWe feel extremely vindicated.\u201dLawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump spent the next four months working with a court-appointed special master to review the documents and data files to determine whether any of the materials were subject to attorney-client privilege and should not be made available to the government.The special master, Barbara S. Jones, who completed her review last week, issued a series of reports in recent months, finding that only a fraction of the materials were privileged and the rest could be provided to prosecutors for their investigation.On Monday, the judge overseeing the review, Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan, issued an order adopting Ms. Jones\u2019s findings and ending the review process.It was unclear on Tuesday what role the materials that Ms. Jones reviewed, which were made available to prosecutors on a rolling basis, may have had in the charges against Mr. Cohen.One collateral effect of Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement is that it may allow Mr. Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, to proceed with a deposition of Mr. Trump in a lawsuit that Ms. Clifford filed accusing the president of breaking a nondisclosure agreement concerning their affair.The lawsuit had been stayed by a judge pending the resolution of Mr. Cohen\u2019s criminal case. Mr. Avenatti wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that he would now seek to force Mr. Trump to testify \u201cunder oath about what he knew, when he knew it and what he did about it.\u201dBenjamin Weiser and Alan Feuer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A candidate needed 50 percent to win outright and avoid a runoff.Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s victory did not come as a surprise to Malians. The president was flush with cash, exercised a near monopoly over access to state television and used the security forces and the resources of his office to campaign throughout the country. His clear advantages were noted by the European Union\u2019s election observation mission.Ambroise Dakouo, an analyst from the Alliance to Rebuild African Governance, said that the low turnout during elections reflected disillusionment with the political establishment, consisting of a rotation of \u201cthe same elites\u201d who are unaccountable to their constituents, the majority of whom are poor and illiterate.\u201cCorruption is a very strong force,\u201d Mr. Dakouo said. \u201cPeople will be mobilized and elect someone, and right away they are disappointed.\u201d\u201cIf you ask why people do not vote, they will say, \u2018They are all the same,\u2019\u201d he added.During his campaign, Mr. Ke\u00efta, 73, trumpeted what he said were the successes of his first term, including creating jobs and expanding access to drinking water, electricity and education. His supporters maintained that he needed a second five-year term to finish what he had started.\u201cMali is still not stable. People are poor, there is unemployment, people finish their studies and they are jobless,\u201d said Moussa Tour\u00e9, a 26-year-old law student, after he voted on Sunday. \u201cThere are still things which are not settled, and maybe we need 10 years to have change in Mali and give time to a leader or we cannot move forward.\u201dCritics of Mr. Ke\u00efta have criticized him for what they say has been lavish spending on presidential jets and travel, rampant corruption, the appointment of family members to key government positions, widespread military abuses and a failure to maintain security in the face of Islamist extremism and ethnic conflict.Mr. Ke\u00efta has been in office since his election in 2013, just after a period during which Mali faced an Islamist insurgency, a rebellion by the Tuareg ethnic group, and a military coup. During his tenure, violence and insecurity have spread closer to the capital, Bamako, with conflict between ethnic groups and local militias emerging in the central region.The 14,000-member United Nations peacekeeping force is regularly attacked. The United Nations Security Council has given Mali a deadline of six months to begin to carry out a peace agreement signed in 2015, which involves reconciling warring parties and disarmament, and reforms for the political and security sectors. The peacekeepers could be pulled from Mali if it fails to make progress, according to Mahamat Saleh Annadif, the leader of Mali\u2019s United Nations Mission.Kola Ciss\u00e9, who is not related to the candidate, is a local activist who is working to resolve a violent conflict between Fulani herdsmen and Dogon hunters and farmers in the central region. He said Mr. Ke\u00efta\u2019s government must act immediately to stop the rising conflict.\u201cThe government is completely absent in the center of the country,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the campaign director of a candidate in Mali\u2019s presidential election.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Pollution Rules Still Won\u2019t Save the Coal Industry", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYet the reality on the ground for the nation\u2019s coal industry remains bleak. Even the Trump administration\u2019s own numbers suggest that its latest proposal won\u2019t reverse the sharp decline of coal power, which has been crushed by competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy over the past decade.\u201cThis is like throwing a few snowballs into a blizzard,\u201d said Tom Sanzillo, director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \u201cYou might see a plant here or a plant there that benefits from the new rules. But we\u2019re talking about very minor changes compared with the significant gap between the cost of coal and the cost of natural gas.\u201dIn its place, the agency will propose a looser rule that merely encourages coal plants to make modest efficiency upgrades and allows states to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants lightly, if at all.On paper, that\u2019s a drastic revision. But the truth is that utilities had already been shifting away from coal anyway, finding cleaner gas, wind and solar to be more attractive investments. The Clean Power Plan, which was fiercely opposed by industry groups when it was proposed in 2014 and never took effect, was quickly being outpaced by market forces.Over the past decade, coal has been pushed off the power grid by competition from cheap natural gas, state efforts to boost renewable energy and stricter pollution rules.If the Clean Power Plan had taken effect, coal generation would have dropped somewhat more: 29 percent below today\u2019s levels.And if the Trump administration\u2019s proposal is finalized? Coal-fired electricity will still decline by roughly 20 percent by 2030, the E.P.A. predicted. The total amount of coal mined for electricity would drop by one-third, compared with levels that are already the lowest in decades.\u201cI think this new rule will have a relatively small impact on what we see as our business strategy going forward,\u201d said John McManus, senior vice president of environmental services at A.E.P. He noted that the company aimed to cut emissions another 16 percent by 2030 and was planning for the possibility that Congress might eventually enact stronger climate policies, such as a carbon tax.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect the climate issue to go away, so we do want to plan for a range of possible futures beyond this particular plan,\u201d he added, referring to the E.P.A.\u2019s latest proposal.The Trump administration\u2019s new proposal could, however, offer a reprieve for some individual coal plants around the country. The majority of the nation\u2019s coal-fired power plants are at least 40 years old, and many utilities are currently faced with the choice of paying for upgrades to keep them running or shutting them down. Under an existing E.P.A. program known as New Source Review, plant owners typically have to install state-of-the-art pollution controls if they significantly upgrade those plants. That acts as a deterrent for keeping those plants open, especially if, say, building a new gas plant might be cheaper.The Trump administration proposal, for its part, would exempt coal plants from New Source Review if they invest in efficiency improvements under the rule. That could shift the calculus and convince some plant owners to keep their coal plants open longer, especially in states like Kentucky or Wyoming, where there is somewhat less competition from natural gas.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect a large number of plants to do this,\u201d said Travis Kavulla, the vice chairman of the Montana Public Service Commission. \u201cBut you could see this dynamic in regulated electricity markets, where utilities can recover their costs from ratepayers and regulators might be reluctant to close down plants early.\u201dStill, it is unclear how many plants will pursue this course. Mr. McManus said that A.E.P., which operates in 11 states, may consider upgrading some of its coal plants, but much will depend on whether the rule survives legal review \u2014\u00a0environmentalists are certain to challenge the revisions to New Source Review in court \u2014\u00a0and what types of plans states decide to craft.Even as coal industry groups cheered the Trump administration\u2019s latest move, they also argued that coal plants would likely need further policy support to avert a serious decline.\u201cThese changes to environmental rules are necessary but insufficient,\u201d said Michelle Bloodworth, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, who estimated that roughly 10 percent of the nation\u2019s coal fleet is still on track to retire in the next three years.That rumored move has already drawn criticism from other energy companies, which have called the proposal \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and argue that it would force consumers to pay billions more for electricity. Yet Mr. Trump has urged Energy Secretary Rick Perry to do everything he can to stop plant closings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Manafort\u2019s Accountant Testifies She Helped Alter Financial Documents", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 The tax accountant for Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, testified in his fraud trial on Friday that she had agreed to alter tax and bank documents to help Mr. Manafort out of his financial troubles in late 2015 and 2016, even though she believed that key financial records were false.Cynthia Laporta, a Virginia accountant who testified under a limited grant of immunity, said she had agreed in September 2015 to lower Mr. Manafort\u2019s reported income on a tax return, which saved him about a half-million dollars in taxes. She did so, she said, after Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort\u2019s longtime aide and Mr. Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman, told her that Mr. Manafort was unable to pay what he owed.And then the next year, as he tried to convince banks to lend him millions against his homes, she said, she did the opposite, inflating his income so that he would qualify. Banks were reluctant to lend Mr. Manafort money because his business showed no income, she and others testified.So Ms. Laporta said she agreed to record a $1.5 million loan to Mr. Manafort\u2019s company as forgiven. She also sent letters stating that Mr. Manafort would receive $2.4 million in payments owed to him by November \u2014 even though she doubted the truth of both those assertions.Asked by prosecutors why she did so, Ms. Laporta said she was trying to protect her firm, KWC. \u201cI could call Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates liars,\u201d she said, but \u201cMr. Manafort was a longtime client.\u201d If she challenged him, she said, it was also possible her company could be sued.Her testimony brought to life in dramatic fashion the financial machinations that prosecutors have been sketching out since Mr. Manafort\u2019s trial on 18 charges of bank and tax fraud opened on Tuesday. And it underscored questions about how Mr. Manafort landed such a prime spot on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, where he served as a delegate manager and then as campaign chairman for five months in 2016, when his political consultancy business was essentially bankrupt.Prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, spent much of the week on Mr. Manafort\u2019s flush years, when a highly lucrative contract to promote pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine from 2010 to 2014 financed a life of opulence for the veteran political consultant. They showed how millions of dollars \u2014 wired from overseas bank accounts that were hidden from his accountants \u2014 paid for Mr. Manafort\u2019s luxury clothing, rugs, home entertainment systems, home renovations, landscaping and three new homes.But it was Mr. Manafort\u2019s behavior once he fell on hard times after 2014 that produced the most compelling testimony. Prosecutors say that Mr. Manafort earned about $60 million working for pro-Russia oligarchs behind Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was elected Ukraine\u2019s president in 2010. But after Mr. Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia in 2014, prosecutors say that Mr. Manafort\u2019s income plummeted to zero. He then switched from hiding his income in foreign bank accounts to inflating it so American banks would extend millions in real estate loans to him.Ms. Laporta testified that in August 2016, just a week before Mr. Manafort left Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign amid controversy over his activities in Ukraine, she assured a potential lender that a $1.5 million loan to Mr. Manafort\u2019s firm had been forgiven. In truth, she said, she was worried that the loan did not exist and was instead a ploy to lower Mr. Manafort\u2019s tax bill. When she asked for documentation of the transaction, she testified, Mr. Gates gave her an unsigned letter, just over a page long, with almost no details. In an email, he wrote that he still needed to \u201cchase down signatures.\u201dShe also sent letters to banks noting that Mr. Manafort anticipated a $2.4 million payment by November 2016 for work in Ukraine. In fact, his Ukraine work for Mr. Yanukovych \u2014 whom prosecutors called Mr. Manafort\u2019s \u201cgolden goose\u201d \u2014 had ended at least a year earlier. Other financial records showed that Mr. Manafort\u2019s company, DMP International, finished 2016 nearly $1.2 million in debt.In other efforts to help Mr. Manafort, Ms. Laporta testified that she backed up his assertion that he was using his Manhattan condominium as a second home so that he could qualify for a lower mortgage interest rate from banks, even though records showed he had been renting the property on Airbnb to generate more cash.Like some of the other roughly dozen witnesses who have testified for the prosecution, Ms. Laporta seemed to treat Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates as one person. At one point on Friday, she referred to both of them as \u201cthe client.\u201d But other witnesses, including Heather Washkuhn, Mr. Manafort\u2019s bookkeeper, testified this week that while he relied on Mr. Gates, Mr. Manafort kept track of \u201cevery penny\u201d of his finances.Besides Ms. Laporta, four other witnesses have been given limited grants of immunity to testify against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers are expected to delve into exactly what led Ms. Laporta, a veteran accountant who said she earned about $400,000 a year, to cooperate with prosecutors. But they have already signaled that Mr. Gates will be their main point of attack.Ms. Laporta\u2019s testimony was especially helpful to prosecutors because she was able to crystallize financial transactions that were otherwise befuddling, even to courtroom spectators steeped in the case. Short and soft-spoken, Ms. Laporta did not hide her suspicions that Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial records had been doctored.She clearly explained, for instance, why Mr. Gates asked \u2014 and she agreed \u2014 that she characterize $900,000 that had been previously reported as income as a loan to DMP International, which Mr. Manafort and his wife owned. Otherwise, Mr. Gates told her in a phone call, the tax bill was \u201ctoo high\u201d and Mr. Manafort \u201cdid not have that money.\u201dBut since loans are not taxable, she said the change \u201cresulted in a tax amount due that could be paid by Mr. Manafort.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Manafort Trial: Gates Admits Having Affair as Defense Attacks Him", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Rick Gates, the former right-hand man to Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, is being cross-examined by defense lawyers in Mr. Manafort\u2019s trial on bank and tax fraud charges in Alexandria, Va.\u2022 As defense lawyers attacked his credibility, Mr. Gates admitted to having an affair about a decade ago, but he denied using company money for his trysts.\u2022 Prosecutors led him through a clinical examination of his and Mr. Manafort\u2019s business dealings, including how he hid income to avoid taxes.\u2022 It is unclear whether Mr. Manafort will take the stand in his own defense. His lawyers would not say. The prosecutors said they expect to wind up their case this week.Kevin Downing, the lead defense lawyer, began cross-examination Tuesday by hammering at Mr. Gates\u2019s credibility, demanding an exact accounting of when he lied to the government and pleaded guilty to the charge of doing so. Mr. Gates seemed to struggle to articulate that timeline, prompting Judge T. S. Ellis III to intervene.Mr. Downing also pressed Mr. Gates on the number of interactions he had with the special counsel\u2019s office \u2014 Mr. Gates estimated around 20 meetings \u2014 and who from the office confronted him about giving a false statement.Mr. Gates admitted that he submitted false expense reports to pay for personal expenses while he worked for Mr. Manafort.As part of that line of inquiry, he also admitted to having an affair about a decade ago, flying first class to London to an apartment he used for trysts. Mr. Downing wanted to know whether Mr. Gates used company money to help pay for his secret relationship, but Mr. Gates only said that he used his family\u2019s money and other funds to help finance the affair.Mr. Downing confronted Mr. Gates over the validity of his testimony: \u201cAfter all the lies you\u2019ve told and fraud you\u2019ve committed, you expect this jury to believe you?\u201d the lawyer asked.Mr. Gates responded, \u201cYes, I made a decision. I\u2019m here to tell the truth.\u201d He added that \u201cMr. Manafort had the same path,\u201d suggesting that the defendant could have agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of a light sentence. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dMr. Gates said that he was taking responsibility and trying to change after his mistake in committing fraud.Mr. Manafort\u2019s case is separate from the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and any ties to the Trump campaign, though this is the first trial stemming from the investigation of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.The prosecution is relying heavily on Mr. Gates to show that Mr. Manafort directed a multiyear financial fraud scheme, even if Mr. Gates helped him execute it. Mr. Gates, 46, President Trump\u2019s former deputy campaign chairman, has figured more prominently than Mr. Manafort in the documents that prosecutors have presented as evidence.But the prosecution\u2019s witnesses have also testified that they generally believed that Mr. Gates was carrying out Mr. Manafort\u2019s wishes when he gave false information to Mr. Manafort\u2019s accountants. Prosecutors claim that information helped Mr. Manafort evade taxes on tens of millions of dollars in income and fraudulently obtain millions of dollars in bank loans.Mr. Gates described how he helped Mr. Manafort conceal the amount of taxes he owed. According to Mr. Gates, Mr. Manafort preferred to report income as loans. This, Mr. Gates said, \u201cenabled Mr. Manafort to reduce his overall tax liability.\u201dIn one instance, Mr. Gates disclosed that they had received money from an oligarch and politician from Ukraine, Serhiy Lyovochkin. Mr. Manafort instructed his bookkeeper to classify it as a loan for tax purposes, though Mr. Gates admitted in court that it was not one and Mr. Manafort had never received a loan from Mr. Lyovochkin.Mr. Gates admitted that at Mr. Manafort\u2019s behest, they later created a loan agreement for Mr. Lyovochkin\u2019s payment, though no loan existed.Mr. Manafort disliked paying a lot of taxes, Mr. Gates said.With his income drying up in 2015, Mr. Manafort was upset when he learned how much he apparently owed in federal taxes; one estimate showed that Mr. Manafort would owe $215,000 in taxes for income he reported in 2014. He wrote to Mr. Gates: \u201cHow could I be blindsided like this. You told me you were on top of this. We need to discuss options. This is a disaster.\u201dDocuments introduced showed the two men routinely discussed a range of financial issues, including how to conceal an existing mortgage on one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s homes and whether Mr. Manafort\u2019s season tickets to his favorite sports teams had arrived. A March 2013 memo documenting one of their discussions noted: \u201cYankees tickets never received. Tickets going to Trump next week.\u201dWhen one of the defense lawyers tried to suggest to Mr. Manafort\u2019s tax accountant Monday that Mr. Gates had kept Mr. Manafort in the dark about his own finances, the accountant, Cynthia Laporta, pushed back.\u201cIn most instances, it was clear that Mr. Manafort was aware what was going on,\u201d she testified.\u201cI assisted Mr. Manafort in filing false tax returns,\u201d Mr. Gates testified. \u201cWe didn\u2019t report the income or the fact that the accounts existed.\u201dHe said that some of Mr. Manafort\u2019s income was disguised as loans from 15 shell companies that Mr. Manafort controlled, most of them in Cyprus.In late 2015 and 2016, Mr. Manafort\u2019s political consulting firm had no clients. Mr. Gates said that in March 2016, when he and Mr. Manafort joined a \u201cpresidential campaign\u201d in the United States \u2014 he did not name Mr. Trump\u2019s bid for office \u2014 the firm had no clients. He said vendors and accountants were dunning Mr. Manafort about his unpaid bills.The accusations against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates mostly stem from their work helping to elect Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, and other pro-Russia forces in Ukraine, and to secure business ventures with the oligarchs backing those politicians.But on Tuesday, Mr. Gates testified that Mr. Manafort also was paid $4 million a year to help Mr. Yanukovych govern after he was elected president in 2010.It is unclear how long the arrangement extended.But the revelation could be notable, because, while Mr. Yanukovych ran on a platform of integrating with the European Union, while also maintaining good relations with Russia, he eventually pivoted toward Moscow, which helped prompt mass street protests that drove him from power in early 2014.Mr. Manafort asked Mr. Gates to help arrange inauguration tickets and administration posts \u2014 including secretary of the Army \u2014 for a banker from whom Mr. Manafort is accused of fraudulently seeking loans, Mr. Gates testified.In one email sent during the presidential transition, when Mr. Gates was serving on the inaugural committee, Mr. Manafort said \u201cwe need to discuss Steve Calk for Secretary of Army.\u201dIt is unclear whether Mr. Gates responded or tried to push Mr. Calk\u2019s prospective nomination, which did not advance.In another email, Mr. Gates said he was involved in discussions about nominating Mr. Calk to an economic advisory council. And in a third email just before Christmas 2016, Mr. Manafort included the names of Mr. Calk and his son on a list of people he would like to invite to the inauguration.The case pits two of Mr. Trump\u2019s former senior campaign aides, men who worked together for decades, against each other in a high-stakes battle that could land either or both of them in prison for years.Mr. Gates, 46, admitted Monday that he was guilty of a long list of crimes, including stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Manafort\u2019s accounts by inflating his business expenses. He said that while he was helping Mr. Manafort hide income to evade taxes, and later to inflate his income to obtain bank loans, he was doing essentially the same on his own behalf.He said he concealed some of his own income in overseas accounts, evading taxes, and lied on applications for a mortgage and for a credit card. In exchange for his cooperation, the government in February agreed to dismiss 22 criminal charges stemming from his involvement in the scheme for which Mr. Manafort is now on trial.Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities and conspiracy to commit fraud but has yet to be sentenced. Although sentencing guidelines recommend a prison term of up to six years, he testified that prosecutors have agreed not to object if his defense attorney argues that he should receive probation.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Adam Goldman, Sharon LaFraniere, Kenneth P.

{"Headline": "What the Manafort Verdict Means", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s Robert Mueller\u2019s biggest victory yet, in one of the most successful special counsel investigations in history. Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Barry Berke is a co-chairman of the litigation department at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel. Norman Eisen is the chairman of CREW.With Tuesday\u2019s convictions in the criminal trial of President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has struck another blow in his investigation: five guilty pleas, 32 indicted individuals, 187 charges revealing startling evidence of Russia\u2019s 2016 attack on our democracy, and now the conviction of one of the top operators in the Trump campaign orbit. Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction on eight separate counts means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction cannot be diminished by arguing, as Mr. Trump and his coterie are fond of doing, that the misconduct was unrelated to the Trump campaign or Russian \u201ccollusion.\u201d On the contrary, the trial evidence included Mr. Manafort\u2019s close ties to pro-Russia forces and his desperate financial straits as he \u201cvolunteered\u201d his time for the next president. The trial revealed how willing Mr. Manafort was to corruptly leverage his position of influence over Mr. Trump during the campaign for his own personal benefit. He offered briefings to a pro-Russia Ukrainian oligarch and dangled a position in the Trump administration in front of a banker who provided him a loan for which he would not otherwise have qualified.Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction should also send chills down the spines of other potential defendants, possibly including the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and his informal adviser Roger Stone. As far as we know, they have been excluded from the hundreds of witnesses the special counsel has interviewed. That fact, and the public evidence about their conduct, signals that they may be facing Mr. Mueller\u2019s scrutiny.Notably, Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement does not provide him with any protection from additional charges that could be brought by the special counsel. Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction (together with mounting pressure on him from the Department of Justice investigation of his own alleged misdeeds) will only increase the pressure on Mr. Cohen to cooperate with Mr. Mueller's investigation to reduce his sentence. The conviction is also bad news for the president because it increases the pressure on Mr. Manafort to cooperate with investigators. He has a second trial coming shortly in Washington, D.C., which could add even more time to what will likely be a substantial sentence \u2014 and Mr. Mueller reportedly has much more evidence to present to jurors in that trial than he did in the trial that just concluded.A pardon for Mr. Manafort could also end up inflicting more harm on the Trump presidency than any of the other allegedly obstructive acts Mr. Trump has so far undertaken. The Constitution and the laws of our country do not allow Mr. Trump to dangle the possibility of, or explicitly offer, pardons with corrupt intent.

With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

Kaiser, who was bent on building a park.Seven years later, the Olmsted-style transformation of 66 acres in the central city is now Gathering Place, a much-anticipated $465 million park that opens Sept. 8 as one of the largest and most ambitious public parks ever created with private funds \u2014 and the latest example of deep-pocketed citizens rebuilding cities through projects they perceive to be in the public good.If it succeeds, as its founders and community leaders hope, it can bring families together and help mend a city with a legacy of segregation, where many neighborhoods grapple with poverty, health disparities and the isolating effects of urban renewal. \u201cTulsa has a long history of social inequality,\u201d Mr. Van Valkenburgh observed. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly a better way to bring people together than in a democratic space like a park.\u201dAt Gathering Place, play and landscape get equal billing. The wide range of park programs, which arose from a close engagement with the public, are the heart and soul of the project.Even as the finishing touches are readied, it is a richly imagined landscape inspired in part by local limestone cliffs, in which a child can encounter a 22-foot-tall Great Blue Heron with a slide between her wings \u2014 one of more than 160 inventive play structures secreted among its groves, glades, vales and prairie-flowered hillocks.The son of Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany, Mr. Kaiser has a net worth estimated at $7.9 billion from oil, banking and other investments. The Kaiser foundation has gifted the entire property to River Parks Authority, a city and county agency that develops and maintains public riverfront parks. A foundation subsidiary is responsible for operating the park and picking up the tab for the next 99 years.On a recent sultry morning, Mr. Kaiser, 76, was walking the park in a hard hat and a shirt with a plastic pocket protector for leaky pens, spouting statistics on dew points, quoting Monty Python and angsting about whether spending millions on a park best furthered equal opportunity for young children (\u201cI feel guilt about everything I do,\u201d he allowed). \u201cWe got more and more divided over time by geography, race and class,\u201d he said of this city of 400,000. \u201cSo getting people together is step number one.\u201dA high-decibel preview of what Gathering Place might become was on display recently as about 150 children from the Tulsa Dream Center, a community nonprofit in the city\u2019s underserved North Tulsa district, made a mad dash for four gigantic castle towers worthy of Rapunzel, connected by bouncy rigging.Amaiah Jenkins, 10, emerged sweaty and panting after barreling down a slide positioned between two elephant tusks. \u201cMy favorite part is everything!\u201d she enthused before making a beeline to a zip line in the trees.The name \u201cGathering Place\u201d intentionally addresses the city\u2019s need for inclusion. Dubbed \u201cThe Oil Capital of the World\u201d by 1920, Tulsa became the scene of a devastating race massacre, known as the 1921 Race Riot, in which white mobs burned the thriving, traditionally black Greenwood district \u2014 \u201cthe Black Wall Street\u201d \u2014 to the ground. An estimated 300 black residents were killed.Greenwood is part of North Tulsa, which, like the heavily Latino east side of town, continues to struggle with economic and social mobility. \u201cThe park has the opportunity to bridge the physical divides and heal some of the wounds of history that have festered for so long,\u201d said Hannibal B. Johnson, an attorney and the author of \u201cBlack Wall Street: From Riot to Renaissance in Tulsa\u2019s Historic Greenwood District.\u201dLike many cities, Tulsa reserves its budget for fire, public safety and other nuts and bolts concerns, not elaborate parks. The Gathering Place evolved from a more modest proposal to build small sites along the river between the city and the Tulsa county suburbs with public funds matched by private donations, a prospect that was defeated by county voters in 2007. \u201cThat caused us to rethink,\u201d said Ken Levit, the George Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s executive director. \u201cThe result was a better thought-out plan in the core of the city with community input at the outset.\u201dThe site consisted of four disparate parcels, including a 35-acre estate with a replica of Jefferson Davis\u2019s house, since demolished. The foundation launched an international competition, winnowing 99 candidates to four. In 2011, Mr. Van Valkenburgh and his team touched down on an unplowed runway with over a foot of snow (still, it beats a tornado). The firm had just been awarded the commission for St. Louis\u2019s Gateway Arch Park, which included a grass-covered land bridge over the interstate.To root Gathering Place in the region, he and his longtime principal Matthew Urbanski and others toured rock formations at Chandler Park, a county park outside the city where narrow paths squeeze through towering limestone walls that appear as if they might tumble down.\u201cWe were stunned to find geological expressions as powerful as Chandler,\u201d Mr. Van Valkenburgh said. The team scoured quarries in eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas to bring richly-veined sandstone in myriad hues to the park. Dramatic stone outcroppings are everywhere, forming grottoes, misty waterfalls and, at one entrance, a canyon-like series of stacked stone walls that look like stowaways from a John Ford western.Three buildings by the architects Mack Scogin and Merrill Elam include a lodge that will serve as a living room for park visitors. The Great Hall includes a massive circular stone fireplace and a vaulted ceiling composed of thousands of variegated cedar and maple planks. A boathouse pavilion on a Van Valkenburgh-made pond will house cafes and a \u201cCabinet of Wonder\u201d by the artist Mark Dion.The oppressive Oklahoma heat defined water as a park priority and pushed Mr. Van Valkenburgh toward his thorniest task: connecting Gathering Place to the Arkansas River by extending the park in two places over a busy roadway. This technical derring-do also involved an ecological mitzvah: 450,000 cubic yards of river silt formed the park\u2019s \u201chills\u201d as well as an expanse of lawn planted with cedar and ginkgo trees that may become the Tulsa equivalent of Central Park\u2019s Great Lawn.But it is the landscape of fantasy and play \u2014 where fanciful castles rise to the tree canopy, and hidden kaleidoscopes and fun-house mirrors lurk in the boxwood \u2014 that seems most likely to bring the community together. Part Lewis Carroll, part Brothers Grimm, its eight and a half acres of playgrounds are geared to specific ages and abilities. In this somewhat madcap environment, it\u2019s possible to climb inside a bear, slide through a tulip, hang out inside a giant paddlefish, and dream up a play on a stage with a velvet curtain. There is a major BMX and skate park for teenagers.The significant difference between designing a park for an enlightened billionaire, rather than a public agency, Mr. Van Valkenburgh said, was the Foundation\u2019s willingness to embrace play structures with moving parts that involve a manageable risk. A water zone invites children to operate dams and pumps, and think like a pint-size Army Corps of Engineers. Children can direct some of the water into a huge sandbox, creating sand castles and tunnels. \u201cIt\u2019s really about being able to make a complete mess,\u201d Mr. Urbanski, the firm\u2019s playground czar, said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make control freak mothers crazy.\u201d\u201cThey are stepping into the holes because of government underfunding,\u201d he said.Park construction has typically been financed through municipal bonds.Mr. Kaiser may be committed to ensuring that Gathering Place is publicly owned in perpetuity, but there is no guarantee the next billionaire in the next city will be. \u201cYou\u2019re relying on someone\u2019s good will,\u201d said Galen Cranz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cThe Politics of Park Design.\u201dAaron Johnson, the Dream Center\u2019s executive director, noted that many children in the city \u201cwon\u2019t get to Oklahoma City, let alone Disney World.\u201d The park, he feels certain, will let young people know what\u2019s possible and \u201cfire up creative neurons.\u201dEven as he spoke, 9-year-old Josiah Shaw was practically vibrating with exhilaration, pretending he was being chased by jungle animals across the castle rigging. \u201cIt\u2019s superfun!!\u201d he exulted. \u201cI kind of imagine I\u2019m in a life and death situation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Be the Governor\u2019s No. 2? Debate Offers Opposing Views of Job", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs undercards go, it would be hard to go further under than this one.The event was so far under the radar that few could immediately watch it: It is not scheduled to air until Thursday \u2014 and even then, only on a Manhattan local access cable channel and online. The only audience for the half-hour debate was a handful of reporters watching on a monitor in an adjoining room.That pretty much sums up the race for lieutenant governor: Two people whom few people know about, speaking without an audience about a job that attracts little attention.Mr. Williams, a rabble-rousing New York City councilman who prefers to call himself an \u201cactivist/elected official\u201d rather than a politician, said he thinks that should change.\u201cThe lieutenant governor\u2019s office has been one that simply does what the governor says to do,\u201d Mr. Williams said as the debate began. He was eager, he said, to work with the governor when they agree. But when they did not, \u201cSomeone has to step up, stand out and have the courage to say, \u2018The emperor has no clothes.\u2019\u201dMs. Hochul, the incumbent lieutenant governor who was previously a county clerk in Erie County and served briefly in Congress, punched back.\u201cAs a strong woman I do not do what men tell me to do,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cFour years ago the people of the State of New York elected me to be a partner with Governor Cuomo because, basically, they want us to get things done.\u201dMr. Williams persisted: The job under Ms. Hochul and her predecessors, he said, has been largely ceremonial, a \u201cribbon-cutting role.\u201dMs. Hochul said that Mr. Williams was denigrating her role. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen a ribbon is cut, that means something good and new is happening.\u201dUnder questioning from the debate moderator, Ben Max, the executive editor of Gotham Gazette, Ms. Hochul was unable to point to any occasion when she opposed a policy or proposal supported by the governor and changed his mind. Their conversations, she said, were private.Mr. Max pressed her: \u201cSo no issue that you\u2019d say that you changed his mind on at this time?\u201d Ms. Hochul shook her head.Mr. Cuomo is also running for re-election and is strongly favored in the polls ahead of the Sept. 13 primary. But the ballot is filled with Democrats challenging his authority from his left: Ms. Nixon, his direct challenger; Mr. Williams; and Zephyr Teachout, whose campaign for attorney general is based partly on her assertion that she would be more independent than Mr. Cuomo\u2019s favored candidate, the New York City public advocate, Letitia James.A Siena College poll conducted in late July, showed that 30 percent of likely Democratic Party primary voters said they would vote for Ms. Hochul while 21 percent favored Mr. Williams. Half of those polled said that they were undecided. Mr. Williams held an advantage in New York City and among black and Hispanic voters, while Ms. Hochul, who is white, did much better among upstate and suburban voters and among white voters.Yet both candidates remain largely unknown. More than two-thirds of the voters polled said that they had not formed an opinion about either candidate.Ms. Hochul\u2019s political career should give her the benefit of name recognition; in 2011, she won a special election in a solidly Republican congressional district. She was unseated the following year by Mr. Collins, despite taking conservative stances on issues such as gun laws and immigration. She went to work as a bank vice president in Buffalo, until being tapped by Mr. Cuomo in 2014 to run for lieutenant governor.Mr. Williams, who is from Brooklyn, has been one of the City Council\u2019s most outspoken proponents of police reform, and he co-sponsored bills that created an inspector general for the police and placed greater restrictions on profiling.Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant, said that several factors favor Ms. Hochul, including sharing in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strong support from labor groups.\u201cThere has never been an upset winner in a statewide Democratic primary that labor has not had an instrumental role in precipitating,\u201d Mr. Gyory said.Ms. Hochul also has an overwhelming financial advantage. The most recent campaign finance report, in mid-August, showed that she had $1.5 million in her campaign account; Mr. Williams had just $38,575.About half the voters in a typical Democratic primary are upstate and in the suburbs, Mr. Gyory said, and half are in New York City. That has Ms. Hochul spending lots of time downstate and Mr. Williams traveling widely upstate.\u201cI had my first fried Oreo,\u201d Mr. Williams said before the debate began, as he and Ms. Hochul could be heard chatting amiably about visiting local fairs or the state fair.Ms. Hochul responded: \u201cFried cookie dough is quite out there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of the mayor of Rochester.

{"Headline": "Trump Boosts Ohio Republicans, Minus His Usual Swagger", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 President Trump, closing out a brutal week that plunged him deeper into legal and political peril, warned Ohio Republicans on Friday that Democrats would destroy their state and impose policies that would spill \u201cinnocent blood\u201d if they were successful in November.While presenting himself as the savior of the party\u2019s fortunes in a highly competitive state, Mr. Trump displayed little of his trademark swagger. Appearing subdued and distracted, he played up the strong economy and his trade policies, and charged without evidence that Democrats were putting the interests of undocumented immigrants before those of American citizens.\u201cTheir whole campaign is \u2018resist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said inside a cavernous banquet hall here where the Ohio Republican Party was holding its annual banquet, adding, \u201cthey still haven\u2019t figured out they lost the election, but they\u2019re going to figure it out soon.\u201d\u201cDemocrat immigration policies are destroying innocent lives and spilling very innocent blood,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe that any party that puts criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office.\u201dBut even as he argued that the strength of the economy under his leadership should be enough to buoy Republicans in the coming contests, Mr. Trump was less bullish about his party\u2019s chances than he has been in the past.\u201cThey keep saying that whoever is president, they don\u2019t win the midterms \u2014 I just don\u2019t get it \u2014 but no president has ever had this economy,\u201d Mr. Trump said, expressing confidence about preserving the Republican majority in the Senate. \u201cThe House is probably tougher. We have so many people running.\u201d (It was not entirely clear what Mr. Trump meant; unlike the Senate, which has six-year terms, House seats turn over every two years, meaning that all 435 are contested.)\u201cYou would have made me look bad if you hadn\u2019t pulled that out,\u201d Mr. Trump quipped during his speech.Governor John Kasich, the state\u2019s Republican governor and an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, skipped the dinner, highlighting divisions in the party over the president\u2019s leadership.Matt Borges, an ally of Mr. Kasich\u2019s whom Mr. Trump helped to force out as chairman of the state\u2019s party, said that the president\u2019s divisive messaging on issues like immigration was driving up the enthusiasm of Democrats in a way that could spell peril for Republican candidates in November.\u201cHis constant desire to polarize the electorate \u2014 whether it be polarized Democrats or polarized Republicans who just aren\u2019t comfortable with the president \u2014 could be a dangerous strategy,\u201d Mr. Borges said. \u201cHe\u2019s goading the other side \u2014 he does it all the time \u2014 so what we have now is an electorate where the people who don\u2019t like him are maxed out, and the question is whether that sort of rhetoric really helps energize Republicans to vote.\u201d\u201cSo far, it has succeeded,\u201d Mr. Borges added of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach. \u201cBut I just think it could be playing with fire.\u201dDuring the dinner, Mr. Trump stoked the themes of cultural division that he has made his trademarks. He lashed out at the N.F.L., as well as the television networks ESPN and CBS, for their handling of the controversy over football players kneeling in protest during the national anthem.And he claimed that Americans had refrained from saying \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d before his election, but were doing so now, and \u201cproud of it.\u201dMr. Trump praised Representative James B. Renacci, a Republican, who is running to unseat the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown, calling Mr. Brown \u201ca very liberal Democrat.\u201d But he saved his most savage words for Richard Cordray, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who is the Democratic candidate for governor, calling him a \u201cbad guy\u201d who was \u201cdestroying a lot of people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll destroy your state \u2014 Cordray will destroy your state,\u201d Mr. Trump said, offering to share disparaging information about Mr. Cordray with Republicans seeking to defeat him. \u201cCall my office. I have so much information.\u201dAt times, though, Mr. Trump appeared to wander off his campaign-themed script and toward venting his frustrations about the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 elections, and whether his campaign played a role.\u201cIt\u2019s always negative, nasty \u2014 the way they come after me,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \u201cNobody looks at them. Is that \u2018deep state,\u2019 or what?\u201dHe began to reel off the names of his perceived enemies.\u201cMcCabe, you have the beautiful Lisa Page and her wonderful F.B.I. agent \u2014 how about him?\u201d Mr. Trump said as diners, seated at round tables in a hall lit with red, white and blue lighting, looked on silently.He was referring to Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy director of the F.B.I.; Ms. Page, a former lawyer for the bureau; and indirectly to Peter Strzok, an F.B.I. agent who exchanged texts with Ms. Page that were highly critical of the president.All have since left the bureau.\u201cComey lies and leaks \u2014 he\u2019s a liar and he\u2019s a leaker,\u201d Mr. Trump added, referring to the F.B.I. director he fired, James B. Comey. \u201cIs this guy being looked at? It\u2019s the most incredible thing people have ever seen.\u201dEven as he bragged about his record and made a final plea to residents to turn out to carry Republicans to victory in the fall, Mr. Trump appeared preoccupied with the cascade of crises in which he has found himself.\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it all back,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening, folks. It\u2019s happening faster than people understand.\u201dThen, he added: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of craziness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: Eating in a Heat Wave", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood Wednesday morning.It will be mercilessly hot again today.The mercury may reach a mere 90, but with the humidity, it could feel as stifling as 98. (Thunderstorms may roll in, mainly after 2 p.m., but they won\u2019t cool us off.)Can hot weather affect your appetite?Yes. Extreme weather of any kind can change appetite, said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cWhile it\u2019s difficult to generalize, many people, myself included, don\u2019t feel as hungry in hot weather,\u201d she said. The reason? Overeating generates a lot of heat. \u201cIf you eat a large amount of concentrated calories, you\u2019re going to generate heat from metabolizing them,\u201d Ms. Nestle said. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s hot outside, you don\u2019t want to be generating extra heat in the body.\u201dDoes hot weather change the types of foods we eat?Probably not. What are the best foods to eat in hot weather?Fruits and vegetables. \u201cHydration is key during hot weather,\u201d said Ms. Akabas. \u201cFruits and vegetables provide lots of water and are loaded with potassium.\u201dIs spicy food helpful?It depends on where you eat it. It\u2019s true that spicy foods make some people sweat, which can help cool you down, Ms. Nestle said. But outside in really hot and humid weather, like today\u2019s, she said, \u201cIt just makes things worse because you\u2019re sweating, but the sweat is not evaporating.\u201d So, if you\u2019re in an air-conditioned restaurant then go for the extra-hot guac, but if you\u2019re having lunch outside or in the sun, that extra-spicy pad thai may make you more uncomfortable.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Our city is getting a new park.Later today, Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce that the city has secured financing for an extension of the Hudson Park and Boulevard at Hudson Yards in Midtown West.The three-acre park will run over the Amtrak rail cut from 36th Street to 39th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues.While the current park serves as a popular lunch spot for the area\u2019s commercial workers, the extension will create a space that\u2019s greener and more lush, according to a spokesman for City Hall.Groundbreaking is set to begin in late 2020, and the park isn\u2019t scheduled to be open until the winter of 2023.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Courts of New York City", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "In the city that hosts the U.S. Open, playing tennis on a regular basis can feel like an administrative and logistical boondoggle for New Yorkers.Supported byMy tennis-playing friends in Los Angeles talk about leisurely games on conveniently located, freshly resurfaced public courts. Of playing year-round alongside members of the creative class, prolifically tanned tennis bums and the occasional famous person.And when I visit relatives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., I can always reserve a beautiful green clay court in the same park where Chris Evert got her start. Or I can book a cheap lesson in a nearby retirement community, where I had the recent pleasure of being throttled by the country\u2019s top-ranked 45-and-older woman player.Things are not so simple in New York, where competition for time slots is fierce, the courts are neglected and there are far too many people trying to game the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation\u2019s idiosyncratic public court system.There are more than 500 public tennis courts in the city, including some really nice ones. Each of them has its own story to tell. What follows are some of mine.Competition for time slots is fierce, and certain locals always seem to be on the same schedule and one step ahead of you (I\u2019m looking at you, Rita). The park ranger in charge of the list told me he recently had the sign-up sheet crumpled up and thrown in his face by a frustrated player. The park ranger told me he is \u201ca black belt in verbal karate\u201d but isn\u2019t allowed to direct his skills toward the local tennis-playing community per the guidelines set forth during the five days of conflict resolution training he is required to take as a parks department employee.Somehow it\u2019s apt that the park is named for a mayor perhaps best remembered for presiding over a public transit strike. The courts are nestled under the Williamsburg Bridge, and playing there generally requires tuning out traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the bridge, the E and M trains on the bridge, helicopters, seaplanes and, during a recent game, a jackhammer. The cacophony and lousy courts notwithstanding, nowhere else do I feel more like I am winning my battle with the concrete jungle.On a recent morning I played a friend who wanted to prepare for the tournament. As we played, a man napped in a hammock strung from the fence at the back of our court to a nearby tree. A little boy began cheering me on, shouting \u201cGo, white!\u201d (I was wearing a white shirt) before realizing my partner was the better player and switched to, \u201cGo, blue!\u201d As our hour wound down, a player from the neighboring court walked past and said to her friend, \u201cEven if you stink, it\u2019s still fun,\u201d which perfectly summed up my state of mind.I can\u2019t play here without thinking of my first match on the courts a few years ago, when I played a friend for $100 after he wagered that he could beat me using any old wooden racket he purchased on the internet. I won the match, 7-6, but not before slipping a disk in my back and getting passed at the net by a between-the-legs shot off said wooden racket, to the delight of the crowd that had gathered to watch. I\u2019d have gladly traded the win for that tweener to have sailed long.Players are not required to adhere to standard operating procedure on clay and sweep the courts and brush the lines clean after their games, which I feel fosters a mercenary attitude among the tennis community. The courts also seem to be the turf of the elderly, who play doubles games that appear quite serene. Nobody is frustrated, nobody is cursing at themselves or their partners (during a recent game someone on an adjacent court shouted \u201cson of a biscuit!\u201d during my service motion). Their patty-cake rallies go on forever. When I\u2019m in my 80s, I hope my games resemble theirs.Cary Leeds is a private facility \u2014 its list of patrons reads like a who\u2019s-who of the worlds of tennis, politics and high finance \u2014 but since it is within a city park, you can use your tennis permit to book a court there. There is a spacious clubhouse and 22 hard courts, and its tennis director is the six-time doubles Grand Slam winner Liezel Huber, whom I watched put a preteen boy through his paces after my match. \u201cI\u2019m the last kid who beat you!\u201d she shouted as she fed him balls, which he dutifully crushed. Despite my late arrival, my partner and I played for 90 minutes on one of two stadium courts, though as our tight set dragged on, I was secretly hoping we\u2019d get bounced from the court.The courts have been named for the novelist Oscar Hijuelos, an Upper West Side resident who died of a heart attack while playing tennis there in 2013. A court-conditions hotline is sponsored by a local Indian restaurant, which is comforting in a way I can\u2019t easily define. The words, \u201cI Love Tennis\u201d have been detailed in old, red clay-stained tennis balls stuffed into the chain link fence.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the tennis court at Washington Market Park. The court is next to the Tribeca Bridge, not under it. The article also misstated where Oscar Hijuelos, a novelist who played at the Riverside Clay Tennis Association, died. He had a heart attack while playing on the association\u2019s courts, not while playing elsewhere.David Shaftel is the editor and co-founder of Racquet Magazine.Advertisement"}

One tidbit: He bumped up the price tag, which he\u2019d calculated at $419 a share, to $420 because it was more auspicious.

Her group recently called for a moratorium on political microtargeting. \u201cThere is a danger that every single person can get their own concerns played back to them,\u201d she said.Facebook executives say they\u2019re taking steps to curb abuse, including tougher verification standards for political ads. Critics worry that isn\u2019t enough \u2014 and the midterms are coming.Drug makers\u2019 stocks didn\u2019t move much, perhaps because no one\u2019s yet certain the lawsuit will happen.That hands a small number of coders, tweaking the algorithms that determine who sees whom across the virtual bar, tremendous power to engineer mating outcomes.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Says Tesla May Go Private, and Its Stock Soars", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has become one of the world\u2019s most prominent chief executives, and a billionaire several times over, by boldly making big bets on ideas that few others thought possible.Through it all, he has shown a maverick \u2014 some would say arrogant \u2014 management style. On Tuesday, he may have outdone himself.In a terse and cryptic Twitter post, he declared that he was ready to take Tesla private. The stock market that made his company worth over $60 billion wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFunding secured.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock was already up sharply on a report that Saudi Arabia was taking a sizable stake in the company. But investors were left to puzzle out the implications of Mr. Musk\u2019s proposition, its relationship to the Saudi report, and even the authenticity of the tweet. And so, starting at 12:48 p.m., the market that Mr. Musk threatened to forsake went into a frenzy.At 2:08 p.m., with shares up more than 7 percent for the day, trading was halted pending news \u2014 news that finally came shortly before 3:30.\u201cI fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Musk said that no final decision had yet been made about taking the company private, and that any such proposal would have to be approved by shareholders.He outlined a plan under which shareholders could be bought out for $420 a share \u2014 a 20 percent premium over the stock price after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call last week \u2014 or they could remain as private shareholders.\u201cThis has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI own about 20 percent of the company now and don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is complete.\u201dTesla trading resumed 15 minutes before the end of the trading session, and the shares added to their gains, closing at $379.57, up 11 percent.Mr. Musk did not elaborate on any sources of financing to take Tesla private. The announcement followed a report that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had acquired a stake in the company.A person briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the Saudi fund had taken a stake of less than 5 percent.The Financial Times reported that the shares had been acquired for the fund in the secondary market with the help of JPMorgan Chase. The bank declined to comment.If the transaction got done at $420 per share, Tesla would be valued at just over $70 billion, making it the biggest deal in which a company is taken private.Although Tesla has become the most valuable American car company, it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. And its chief executive, a 47-year-old native of South Africa, has come under increasing pressure as he has scrambled to increase production of the Model 3, a midsize sedan that he is counting on to drive up revenue and enable the company to become profitable.Still, this is not the way multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts are typically announced. Companies would normally line up banks, private equity firms or other deep-pocketed investors to agree in advance to provide money to finance the purchase of shares.Officials representing a number of large banks and investment funds said on Tuesday that they had not talked with Tesla about financing a buyout, although it is possible the company had secured funding from other sources.Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Tuesday \u2014 mentioning the specific price of a possible buyout and declaring that Tesla had already arranged funding \u2014 were virtually guaranteed to send the shares flying. Still, while it was unusual for a chief executive to make a market-moving announcement on Twitter, there is nothing improper about it on its face.But the S.E.C. has also advised that intentional releases of market-moving information on social media platforms or websites must be accompanied by a simultaneous release to the broader public. The delay between Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet and Tesla\u2019s corporate announcement could be of interest to the S.E.C., said Michael Liftik, a former deputy chief of staff at the commission who is now a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\u201cSimultaneously really means simultaneously,\u201d he said. And he said a tweet would be held to the same standard of factuality as a news release.Others pointed out that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet could have opened his company up to legal exposure from investors with financial incentives to sue.\u201cWhat they have to show is there was a material misstatement, in these loose statements, by Mr. Musk,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance. Mr. Coffee said the statement \u201cfunding secured\u201d could be a legal gray area where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys see an opportunity to make a case.\u201cThat\u2019s a very broad statement about what is still an extraordinarily amorphous transaction,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.The S.E.C. had no comment, and Tesla would not comment beyond what was in Mr. Musk\u2019s statement to employees.Being a public company and reporting earnings every three months \u201cputs enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\u201d he said. Having its stock traded publicly also means that Tesla can attract short-sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla \u2014 whom he described as \u201cpeople who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dTesla has attracted more so-called short-sellers than any other publicly traded company, in part because many investors doubt the company can achieve the lofty targets that Mr. Musk has set.Tesla\u2019s short-sellers on Tuesday racked up about $1.5 billion in losses, according to S3 Analytics, a technology and research firm. That brings their losses so far this year to $3 billion.Going private \u201cwould definitely benefit Elon Musk and the way he\u2019d like to run the company,\u201d said Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t like the intrusion he gets as a public company.\u201dHe has also objected to analysts\u2019 conclusions that the company may have to raise additional capital from investors later this year as it continues to post losses and use up hundreds of millions of dollars in cash each quarter.Mr. Levy, the analyst, said that even if Tesla went private, it would probably still need to borrow to pursue its plans for new models and new factories. \u201cThe question is whether they will have the same investor support,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a private company with a lot of debt, the risk goes up.\u201dHe characterized Mr. Musk\u2019s management style as \u201cunique.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of unexpected surprises,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the ambitions of SpaceX, a company run by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. It plans to send astronauts into space next year; it has not yet done so.Michael J. de la Merced, Peter Eavis and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Green Party, Eyeing the 2020 Presidential Race, Prepares for the Midterms", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Democratic Party loomed large over the annual Green Party conference last month, but all eyes were on November, when Green leaders say they\u2019ll field at least 224 candidates.\u201cThree times is a lot. It\u2019s a lot for any one person and it\u2019s a lot for a party,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be kind of shocked if it came to that.\u201dTheir growth is due not just to the failure of Mr. Sanders campaign, but to what many Greens see as the success of Ms. Stein\u2019s, which raised three times as much money, $3.4 million, and got over three times as many votes as she did in 2012. She appeared on the ballot in 45 states, the most ever for a Green nominee, and won over 1.4 million votes, or roughly one percent.Last month, 175 Green Party activists from more than 40 states gathered at the University of Utah for their annual conference, where they dined on pizza alongside students in the cafeteria, placed bids on secondhand sci-fi books and homemade wine at a silent auction, and discussed their dream of implementing eco-socialism and ranked choice voting.But the most pressing matter was the midterm elections, which for them are an important first step in the 2020 presidential campaign. Under the state-by-state patchwork of ballot access laws, Green candidates need to win enough votes in November, generally between one and five percent, to secure a spot on the presidential ballot in most states.Party leaders said they expected to field at least 224 candidates for a variety of offices in 32 states this year. There are already 155 elected officials nationwide who are Greens, most of them serving in local offices like city councils or on school boards.But because the party does not accept money from corporations, unions or political action committees it has never won the kind of race that takes deep pockets, like governor or anything at the federal level. There is no indication that is about to change.But that has not deterred candidates like Mr. Mejia, Mr. Cortes Barragan and Ms. Moxley, who are running for Congress armed with little more than shoestring budgets and the strength of their convictions.As far as New Jersey is concerned, Ms. Moxley said she thought \u201cthere really is no difference now\u201d between the Democrats and the Republicans. That sentiment is not shared by Democrats and Republicans, but at the Green Party convention Ms. Moxley was not alone in that belief. Even in the age of President Trump \u2014 whom they concede may be uniquely hostile to their principles \u2014 there are many Greens who squint to see the difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.\u201cThey are not different enough to save your job, to save the climate, to save the economy and to save the peace,\u201d said Ms. Stein. \u201cThe reality is we are going further and further over the edge here, whether it is a Democrat or a Republican, and it\u2019s not as if Hillary would have stopped this slide into catastrophe.\u201dThe Democratic Party loomed large over the Green conference, where attendees ruminated over the many ways they claimed the Democrats had slighted or sabotaged them over the years.And last November, the Senate Intelligence Committee requested documents from the Stein campaign as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the election.Ms. Stein also blames \u201cDemocratic operatives\u201d for years of unfavorable coverage in the news media. And, of course, there is the word that irks the Greens more than any other: \u201cspoiler.\u201dGreens bristle at the \u201cspoiler\u201d accusation, which they say ignores poll data that suggested many of Ms. Stein\u2019s 2016 supporters either would not have voted if she had not been on the ballot or would have voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cCandidates have to earn votes, they don\u2019t own votes,\u201d Ms. Stein said. \u201cThat in a nutshell is the problem with the Democrats, it\u2019s the arrogance of thinking they own the system.\u201dWhile the Green Party and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party share a great deal of common ground, the Greens express a mix of grand idealism and grim cynicism: they believe American society is capable of revolutionary change, but the Democratic Party is not.Gloria Mattera, one of the party\u2019s co-chairpersons, said she doubted that the enthusiasm currently propelling the Democratic Party\u2019s left flank would lead to a lasting change in its priorities.\u201cI don\u2019t think one or two wins around the country in a Democratic primary should be dismissed, but they\u2019re not a revolution inside the party, either,\u201d said Ms. Mattera. \u201cThe Democrats will eat their own young, if you ask me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey Cheers as Erdogan Takes On U.S. Over Sanctions", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 In their recent encounter at the NATO summit meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Trump gave each other a fist-bump, as Mr. Trump declared, \u201cI like him, I like him.\u201dCombative politics is written in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s DNA, one Turkish columnist explained, and for that matter, it seems, in Mr. Trump\u2019s. Indeed, according to diplomats, the several phone calls that have taken place between the two men this year have been stormy.In the nationalistic mood of the moment, many Turks have even applauded Mr. Erdogan\u2019s riposte.Across the spectrum, Turkish politicians, despite their deep divisions, took a united front against the United States for freezing the assets of the Turkish interior and justice ministers last week.Most of the opposition parties in the Parliament condemned the United States sanctions in a joint statement, and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other business organizations denounced the sanctions by the United States.The Ceyhan municipal council, in Turkey\u2019s southern province of Adana, announced that it had revoked its sister-city status with Frisco, Tex., because of the dispute.\u201cI have my own company and dollar affects almost our entire business,\u201d said a Twitter post by Erkan Babur, an engineer from Tokat, a province in the Black Sea region, and a local executive member of the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party. \u201cBut we are not born as bosses from our mothers. And it is not the dollar that made us the boss.\u201d\u201cWe will close down our company if necessary and paint shoes, sell bagels, thanks to God, but never make Turkey bait for you,\u201d he added.Newspapers, most of them now under control of businessmen close to the president, took fiercely anti-American stances as well.\u201cKnow your limits, U.S.,\u201d said one headline in the daily Milliyet. Even the newspaper S\u00f6zc\u00fc, an aggressive nationalist opponent of Mr. Erdogan, called on the government not to bow its head. \u201cStand tall, that\u2019s enough for us,\u201d one headline read.Even before Mr. Erdogan ordered matching sanctions on Saturday against two American officials, some analysts had predicted that he would escalate the dispute.Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, predicted an \u201cirrational response from Ankara.\u201d\u201cHalf of Turkey, including many in Erdogan\u2019s circles, has drunk the Kool-Aid and believes that Erdogan is under attack (by his domestic and foreign adversaries) because he\u2019s out to make Turkey great again,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay wrote in a text message.Kemal Can, writing in the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, said much of the dispute was driven by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s personal style.\u201cSometimes a cunning tradesman, sometimes a stubborn toughness, sometimes glowering, sometimes bowing, but always with confidence that he would make it happen in the end,\u201d Mr. Can wrote. \u201cA mental state manages this style that Erdogan himself strongly believes in as he molds his close circle around the same religious belief.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s propensity to surround himself with yes-men may have led him to misjudge domestic politics in the United States and miscalculate how far he could push Washington, he and others said.\u201cIt is the thinking that \u2018we are so valuable that America is not going anywhere,\u2019\u201d said Ahmet Kasim Han, associate professor in international relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul.Not only is it wrong, but dangerous, Mr. Han said. \u201cThis leads to an escalation that becomes very hard to control and it can really lead to a point where it can all break up.\u201d\u201cIt is possible that, in seven or eight months, Brunson will be sitting in his home in North Carolina, Atilla will be back in Turkey, and Trump will be raving about Erdogan on Twitter once again,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas wrote, describing a proposed deal to exchange the pastor for Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a Turkish banker convicted by an American court.\u201cBut it is also possible that Turkey will become the next Venezuela, clashing with the West and dealing with a dire economic downturn,\u201d she added. \u201cNo one can be sure.\u201dYet Mr. Erdogan, some analysts pointed out, can also be a pragmatist, capable of conducting an about-face on policy when it suits him.Officials close to him have continued to offer assurances that an agreement would be found. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has repeated that negotiations were continuing, and reports surfaced Tuesday that a Turkish delegation would travel to Washington within days.Berat Albayrak, the finance and treasury minister and also the son-in-law of Mr. Erdogan, expressed confidence in a television interview on Friday. \u201cTies would never break,\u201d Mr. Albayrak said, likening the dispute to an argument within a family.\u201cEven two siblings in the same household cannot agree on the same issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWife and husband, partners of 40 years long cannot agree on everything. They sometimes argue and then they make peace.\u201dHis comments were intended to calm the financial markets which have suffered losses in the last week since the United States announced the sanctions.Sedat Ergin, a former Washington correspondent for the newspaper Hurriyet who has followed American-Turkish relations for more than 40 years, suggested that damage control for the economy would be Mr. Erdogan\u2019s priority.He described the current crisis as the worst he had seen since the weapons embargo over Cyprus by the United States against Turkey 40 years ago.Both sides were to blame, he said. Turkey did not grasp the grievances that Mr. Brunson\u2019s case caused to the United States. And Washington, he said, had made no progress on the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, who is accused of instigating the 2016 failed coup, and it had disregarded Turkey\u2019s security concerns in Syria for far too long.The relationship would not be easily mended, he said. \u201cThere is no magic wand to solve this deadlock with a single touch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps, it will be best for both sides to put this relationship on ice for a while.\u201dYet he also saw signs that Mr. Erdogan may yet want a deal.The president\u2019s language, Mr. Ergin wrote, was carefully measured, he expressed the wish that an agreement on the Syrian town of Manbij remain in place, and he made an unusual appeal that was clearly a message to Mr. Trump, the businessman.Mr. Erdogan complained that some around Mr. Trump were causing the problems by imposing sanctions and \u201cbeating the grape grower,\u201d while he was for cooperating so both parties could enjoy \u201ceating the grapes.\u201d\u201cAlways, everywhere, we are on the side of \u2018win-win\u2019 politics,\u201d Mr. Erdogan declared. \u201cWe are for every kind of cooperation to eat the grapes. But we will never give the opportunity to those whose aim is to beat the grape grower.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Moshe Mizrahi, 86, Who Won an Oscar for \u2018Madame Rosa,\u2019 Is Dead", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoshe Mizrahi, an Israeli director whose \u201cMadame Rosa,\u201d one of several movies he made in France, won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 1978, died on Aug. 3 at a hospital in Tel Aviv. He was 86.His son, Daniel, said the cause was pneumonia.He would continue to make films in Israel, France and elsewhere. He directed \u201cEvery Time We Say Goodbye\u201d (1986), with Tom Hanks, on location in Jerusalem, and \u201cWar and Love\u201d (1985), a Holocaust story set in Poland that featured Kyra Sedgwick, was filmed in Hungary.Moshe Mizrahi was born on Sept. 5, 1931, in Alexandria, Egypt, to Haim Victor and Dora (Behar) Mizrahi. His father, a store clerk, died of an abscess when Moshe was 9, forcing his mother to do housework to support her four children.Entranced by movies early on, Moshe saw as many as seven films a week in Alexandria, mostly from the United States.\u201cAt some point,\u201d he told Haaretz, \u201cI discovered there was such a thing as directors, and that they were the magicians who made the movies.\u201dDaniel Mizrahi said in an email that his father \u201ccredited growing up in cosmopolitan Alexandria as being decisive in establishing his humanistic and pluralistic worldview, and he was a firm believer and supporter of the possibility of good will and understanding between Arabs and Jews.\u201dThe family left for Palestine in 1946. During the Israeli war for independence two years later, Mr. Mizrahi\u2019s brother, Shabtay, was killed in an Egyptian bombing raid. Mr. Mizrahi did not stay there for long. In 1950, courtesy of a Jewish group that paid his way, he moved to Paris, where he satiated himself on films noir and westerns and hoped one day to work in America.Returning to Israel, he worked as a newspaper reporter and wrote Hebrew movie subtitles before heading back to Paris in 1958. There he found work in television and was eventually hired by Telfrance Films, where he rose to production manager and producer.When he turned to film directing, he used some of his family\u2019s lore in telling cinematic stories. For \u201cI Love You Rosa,\u201d he drew on his maternal great-grandmother\u2019s experience for a story set in the late 19th century about a young widow (Michal Bat-Adam) obliged by Old Testament law to marry her brother-in-law, who is only 11 years old.In his review for The New York Times, A. H. Weiler wrote that Mr. Mizrahi \u201csticks to his theme and avoids religious or distaff proselytizing,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is a refreshingly professional craftsman who allows a viewer his own judgments.\u201dA year later Mr. Mizrahi directed \u201cThe House on Chelouche Street,\u201d whose story echoed his own: A widow moves her family from Alexandria to Israel before its independence.Those films helped establish his reputation for creating strong matriarchal characters. \u201cI was raised in a Mediterranean type of culture where women were predominant,\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1982. \u201cThe households were filled with powerful mother figures \u2014 grandmothers, aunts and all the rest. It was the kind of background that helped me feel my material thematically.\u201dHe married Ms. Bat-Adam, a screenwriter, actress and director, in 1980, after she had appeared in five of his pictures. They continued to collaborate for many years, she as an actor in his films and he as an actor and producer in some of hers. In \u201cRachel\u2019s Man\u201d (1975), Ms. Bat-Adam played the title role, while Mr. Mizrahi directed and wrote the script with his former wife, Rachel Fabian.In addition to his son and wife, Mr. Mizrahi is survived by his daughter, Orit Mizrahi; two sisters, Silka Erez and Lea Pinto; and two grandchildren.But Mr. Mizrahi suggested that he had fallen out of step both with Israeli and with French culture \u2014 and it did not seem to bother him.Advertisement"}

But word quickly got around, and other investors flooded his inbox with $200 million of investment offers, half of which he turned down.Gusto, a payroll and benefits software company, raised $140 million in July, but could have done five times that, according to Joshua Reeves, its chief executive and founder.Convene, a real estate services start-up, recently obtained $152 million and turned away more than $100 million of additional investment. Soon after, another wave of hopeful investors called, asking if the company would be looking for more financing, according to Ryan Simonetti, Convene\u2019s chief executive.Start-ups raising $100 million or more from investors \u2014 known as a mega-round in Silicon Valley \u2014 used to be a rarity. But now, they are practically routine, producing a frenzy around tech companies with enough scale and momentum to absorb a large check.The jump in oversize investments is led by relatively new investors, including the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, Chinese companies and sovereign wealth funds. They see a chance to capitalize on tech\u2019s incursion into just about every industry, and want to put their money down before the young companies go public.By entering the tech market, they have all but eliminated talk in Silicon Valley about an investment bubble \u2014 a leading concern a couple of years ago \u2014 because the money now seems almost limitless.For the start-ups, the pots of money are changing the normal way of building a tech company. They must move even faster, expand their ambitions and collect more investment money than ever \u2014 even if they might not be ready. They risk becoming too reliant on funding and never finding a path to profit.\u201cIf your competitor is going to raise $150 million and you want to be conservative and only raise $20 million, you\u2019re going to get run over,\u201d said Bill Gurley, a managing partner at Benchmark Capital.Investors participated in a record 273 mega-rounds last year, according to the data provider Crunchbase. This year is on pace to easily eclipse that, with 268 completed in the first seven months of the year. In July, start-ups reached more than 50 financing deals worth a combined $15 billion, a new monthly high.In the last 10 days, Letgo, an online classifieds ads company, raised $500 million. Actifio, a data storage company, took in $100 million. MyDreamPlus, a co-working space start-up, secured $120 million. And Klook, a travel activity booking site, got $200 million.These mega-rounds have become so common that CB Insights, which tracks start-up investments, has even debated lifting its definition of a mega-round to $200 million or more, according to Anand Sanwal, the firm\u2019s chief executive.Many of the new investors, including SoftBank\u2019s $93 billion Vision Fund, manage funds so large they dwarf the entire traditional venture capital market in the United States. These giant funds are looking for start-ups that can take large sums of money with one shot. Writing lots of small checks is too time-consuming, and the returns from small bets will not make a difference for a such a big fund. So investors are competing to back any start-up that shows promise and the ability to put $100 million or more to use.\u201cAs soon as they feel like they have a winner, they will really put a lot of resources behind it,\u201d said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.SoftBank\u2019s deal-making has affected every part of the venture capital market. The arrival of its Vision Fund, which has a minimum investment size of $100 million, has prompted a number of traditional venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, to build larger pools of money to compete. Funds from seven different firms are raising capital, according to the data provider Pitchbook.But the Vision Fund is not even the most active mega-round investor. In the first seven months of 2018, Tencent Holdings participated in 31 rounds of funding of $100 million or more, compared with 18 for SoftBank, according to CB Insights. GIC and Temasek Holdings, investment funds associated with the government of Singapore, as well as Alibaba and Sequoia Capital China, have also been among the most active mega-round investors this year.As a result, early investors must make sure their portfolio companies are friendly with the large funds, laying groundwork for a potential investment in the future.\u201cIt feels like there is a bit of a beauty pageant that early-stage investors put on for the mega-funds,\u201d said Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures.The hot funding market is pushing high-growth start-ups to change their plans. Flywire was not going to pursue more investment money until next year. It still had $15 million in the bank from a previous funding round. But the company saw \u201cinvestment heat\u201d in the payments industry and Mr. Massaro thought more money would help Flywire grow even faster.Funding rounds can take as long as six months to put together, but Flywire\u2019s round wrapped up in just over two. As a result of the capital, the company will complete some of its hiring plans in half the time it previously planned and expand into a new geographic market two years early.Moving aggressively is not a choice. Well-funded start-ups, called \u201csuper-haves\u201d by some investors, can afford to pay their employees more and lower their prices, losing money in the short term to win more customers.Convene, the real estate start-up, competes tangentially with WeWork, an office rental company that has raised more than $8 billion in funding from SoftBank and other investors. Convene was not planning to chase more capital until later this year, but the company\u2019s investors encouraged it to move sooner. Business deals move faster today than they did five years ago, said Mr. Simonetti, the company\u2019s chief executive, and having extra capital on hand helps with speed.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a little bit of this, \u2018Let\u2019s overcapitalize the company a little bit so we can move quicker and faster,\u2019 \u201d he said.The large investors also demand big ideas from the start-ups. Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund team pushed Tina Sharkey, chief executive of e-commerce start-up Brandless, to share the most grandiose, ambitious version of her business road map.\u201cThey were like, \u2018Come on, show us your real plan,\u2019 \u201d she said. Brandless had barely been operating for a year before Ms. Sharkey outlined an expansive vision to use machine learning, data, curation, and community-building to create efficiencies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the gumption to say that to anyone else,\u201d she said. In July, SoftBank invested $224 million into her company.\u201cIn today\u2019s hyper-connected world, companies need to hire, scale and enter new markets faster than ever before or risk being surpassed by others,\u201d said Jeff Housenbold, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers.Few venture investors foresee a slowdown in the pace of mega-rounds. Those who once cautioned of a tech bubble and subsequent crash have given up on their warnings. In 2015, Mr. Gurley of Benchmark predicted \u201cdead unicorns,\u201d referring to start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. But since 2015, the number of start-ups worth $1 billion or more has ballooned to 258 from 80, according to CB Insights. Excess funding is tied to inflated valuations, which may create problems when overvalued companies eventually try to go public.Mr. Gurley said he was done trying to sound the alarm. \u201cYou have to adjust to the reality and play the game on the field,\u201d he said.Annie Lamont, a managing partner at the venture fund Oak HC/FT, expected a drop-off in start-up valuations and funding three years ago, but it never happened. Now, she expects more of the same, partly because most the companies can easily get more money and few are worried about a downturn.\u201cThe fear of a correction is not occurring,\u201d she said. If any start-ups do \u201cvaporize,\u201d she said, \u201cI think people are going to ignore them and roll right on to the next one.\u201dMitchell Green, a managing partner at Lead Edge Capital, does not imagine a slowdown unless interest rates increase significantly, a change that could prompt investors to move money into tax-free bonds. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much money.\u201dMr. Reeves, of software start-up Gusto, acknowledged that founders who obtain outsize sums of capital can get caught up in a \u201cgrowth at any cost\u201d mentality. That is why he chose not to maximize his funding round despite the intense interest. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the founder to realize that\u2019s a distraction,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess is not having more money or a bigger team, but having more customers or revenue.\u201dMr. Reeves is staying cautious, even when few others seem worried about a bubble. \u201cThe most likely time to have some type of correction, or change, or realization of the cycle turning, is when you\u2019re not talking about it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Representative Duncan Hunter Is Indicted, Accused of Misusing Campaign Funds", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Duncan Hunter was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego on Tuesday after a monthslong criminal investigation into allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds on family trips to Hawaii and Italy, private school tuition for his children and even a $600 airline ticket for a pet rabbit.In a 48-page indictment released by the Justice Department, Mr. Hunter, Republican of California, and his wife, Margaret, are charged with converting more than $250,000 in campaign funds to pay for personal expenses and filing false campaign finance records with the Federal Election Commission.Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be \u201cfully vindicated and exonerated.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Hunter, Michael Harrison, said Tuesday that the congressman \u201cbelieves this action is purely politically motivated,\u201d and referred a reporter to a letter that Mr. Hunter\u2019s lawyer, Gregory A. Vega, sent this month to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Vega, anticipating an indictment, asserted in the letter that two prosecutors involved in the investigation had attended a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, and complained that bringing charges so close to the election would effectively deliver a \u201csolidly Republican\u201d House seat into Democratic hands.The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House.And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats. Mr. Hunter cannot take his name off the ballot, according to a spokesman for the California secretary of state, and California does not allow write-in candidates.The United States of America v. Duncan D. Hunter and Margaret E. Hunter\u201cThe division, chaos and corruption in Washington has gone too far,\u201d Mr. Campa-Najjar said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment confirms just how deep this corruption can reach when someone like Duncan Hunter Jr. is in it for himself instead of representing the people.\u201dThe indictment details scores of instances, beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016, in which the Justice Department said the Hunters spent campaign money on themselves. The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite \u201cnumerous warnings\u201d and \u201crepeated inquiries\u201d from Mr. Hunter\u2019s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases.\u201cThe indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,\u201d Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission.\u201cElected representatives should jealously guard the public\u2019s trust, not abuse their positions for personal gain,\u201d Mr. Braverman added. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment is a reminder that no one is above the law.\u201dBeyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as \u201ctens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,\u201d according to a statement released by the Justice Department.To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as \u201ccampaign travel,\u201d \u201cdinner with volunteers/contributors,\u201d \u201ctoy drives,\u201d \u201cteacher/parent and supporter events,\u201d \u201cgift cards\u201d for charitable donations and \u201cgift basket items,\u201d the statement said.Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to \u201cSmiles for Life.\u201d Theater tickets were mischaracterized as \u201choliday gift certificates.\u201d Tickets for the family to see the Irish dance show Riverdance at the San Diego Civic Theater became \u201cSan Diego Civic Center for Republican Women Federated/Fund-raising.\u201dThe Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego.Adam Nagourney contributed reporting from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A One-Two Punch Puts Trump Back on His Heels", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In two courtrooms 200 miles apart on Tuesday, President Trump\u2019s almost daily attempts to dismiss the criminal investigations that have engulfed his White House all but collapsed.Mr. Trump has long mocked the investigations as \u201crigged witch hunts,\u201d pursued by Democrats and abetted by a dishonest news media. But even the president\u2019s staunchest defenders acknowledged privately that the legal setbacks he suffered within minutes of each other could open fissures among Republicans on Capitol Hill and expose Mr. Trump to the possibility of impeachment.A president who has labored under the cloud of investigations from almost the moment he took office, Mr. Trump now faces an increasingly grim legal and political landscape. Mr. Mueller is methodically investigating whether Mr. Trump and members of his campaign conspired with a foreign power to win the election \u2014 and whether the president tried to obstruct the investigation from the White House. And the president is months away from congressional elections that could hobble the second half of his presidency.Inside the West Wing, aides to Mr. Trump \u2014 numbed and desensitized by breathless news cycles blaring headlines about the president\u2019s behavior \u2014 said privately on Tuesday afternoon that they were having trouble assessing how devastating the day\u2019s legal events might be.Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers spent hours working on a statement that was attributed to his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, but privately, several said that they could not come up with something to explain away Mr. Cohen\u2019s admissions beyond calling him a liar.\u201cIt had nothing to do with Russian collusion,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cWe continue the witch hunt.\u201dLater, the president largely ignored the dramatic courtroom events during a raucous rally in which his fervent supporters cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s usual rants about trade, illegal immigration, Democratic obstruction and the news media.\u201cWhere is the collusion? Find some collusion,\u201d he said before shifting topics to declare that illegal immigration is \u201cthe beating heart\u201d of the coming elections.The effect of Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction and Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea on the investigation itself was unpredictable, according to legal experts. But Democrats said it put the lie to Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that Mr. Mueller was engaged in a political investigation.\u201cIt shows that Mueller and prosecutors in New York are conducting a professional investigation, following the facts where they lead, and obtaining serious felony convictions,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThey also dramatically increase the likelihood that both men cooperate with the government.\u201dMr. Schiff said Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission that he violated campaign finance laws in paying hush money to two women \u201cadds to the president\u2019s legal jeopardy,\u201d though Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers played down the likelihood that a sitting president would be indicted for such violations.\u201cThere is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president in the government\u2019s charges against Mr. Cohen,\u201d said Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen\u2019s actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.\u201dStill, Mr. Cohen was blunt about the president\u2019s culpability as he stood in court and admitted his guilt: \u201cIn coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office,\u201d Mr. Cohen said he conspired with a media company to keep secret Mr. Trump\u2019s affair with Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels.\u201cMr. Cohen, when you took all of these acts that you\u2019ve described, did you know that what you were doing was wrong and illegal?\u201d the judge asked. Mr. Cohen answered, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201dFrom complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.The startling charge directed at Mr. Trump carried echoes of President Richard M. Nixon, who was named an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d in the special prosecutor\u2019s investigation of Watergate.And it raised the prospect that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency could be at risk by impeachment in Congress even if the sprawling Russia investigation never definitively concludes that there was collusion or obstruction of justice.Mr. Cohen worked for decades as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer. He was privy to the innermost details of the president\u2019s business dealings and personal life \u2014 once saying that he would take a bullet for Mr. Trump.While Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation grinds on \u2014 reaching into the murky depths of Russian money laundering or Russia\u2019s shadowy efforts to hack the 2016 election \u2014 Mr. Cohen\u2019s case throws a white-hot spotlight on the behavior of Mr. Trump and his closest confidants.It also makes it harder for Mr. Trump or his aides to distance themselves from Mr. Cohen\u2019s wrongdoing. Though he also pleaded guilty to tax and bank fraud, related to his ownership of New York City taxi medallions, the heart of the case against Mr. Cohen is the payments to women he made on behalf \u2014 and at the behest of \u2014 his most celebrated client.With Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea, five associates of the president have either pleaded guilty to or been convicted of crimes since Mr. Trump took office. In addition to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Manafort, they include Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign chairman, and George Papadopoulos, who advised the campaign on foreign policy issues.Mr. Trump\u2019s mood tracked a tumultuous day. In the morning, he was chipper, monitoring Fox News and commenting to aides on the headlines he saw, according to people who spoke with him. But Mr. Trump was already snappish with aides in the West Wing before the Manafort verdict was announced and before Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty, according to people familiar with his conversations.By then, it had become clear that Mr. Cohen was likely to plead guilty to several crimes. The president\u2019s churlish mood had not lightened by the time he boarded Air Force One for the rally in West Virginia, and learned the details of his plea.The president\u2019s team quickly tried to paint Mr. Cohen as a liar, and noted that prosecutors had not targeted Mr. Trump.People close to Mr. Trump privately acknowledged that the declarations from Mr. Cohen, made under oath in open court, could have significant political ramifications.While impeachment discussions have always been treated as having a potential positive effect to turn out Republican voters, the statements that Mr. Cohen made were stark and took it out of the realm of the theoretical.\u201cI think impeachment is now squarely going to define the midterms,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a Republican strategist who has been critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s inescapable now that Democrats can legitimately raise that issue.\u201dHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Republican members of Congress sitting in tough districts that are going to have to really think hard about how they\u2019re going to finesse this in the days ahead.\u201dWhat makes it harder for Republicans, he said, is that this did not emerge from the Mueller inquiry. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something from the deep state,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a classic B-team type of bumbling screw-up of covering up mistresses.\u201dAnd, he added, \u201cIt\u2019ll be very hard to distance the president. You would assume that there\u2019s legitimate evidence that the president was aware that those invoices were not for services rendered. You already have the one tape.\u201dBrian Walsh, a former spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that it was too early to say whether this would damage the president, but he noted he is already suffering with suburban voters.\u201cI think the president\u2019s most ardent supporters will continue to defend him with blinders on, but to any neutral observer watching this, it\u2019s impossible to believe that Cohen would engage in this conduct without his client signing off on it or at least being aware of it,\u201d he said.\u201cI think many will take a wait-and-see attitude,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat it does is serve as another tremendous distraction for Republicans running for re-election and already facing tough political headwinds. Every day that Republicans are being asked about legal questions surrounding the president is a day they\u2019re not delivering the message they want to be delivering on the campaign trail.\u201dMark Landler and Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Developments With Manafort and Cohen Explained", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOur investigative reporter who spent 16 days covering the Paul Manafort trial, Sharon LaFraniere, answers our readers\u2019 questions on Manafort\u2019s conviction and Cohen\u2019s guilty plea.How should we make sense of this? Sharon LaFraniere, a New York Times investigative reporter who covered the Manafort trial for 16 days, discussed the two criminal cases on Facebook Live with our audience. Here are nine questions sent in by viewers, along with her answers. Questions and answers have been lightly edited for clarity.In Michael Cohen\u2019s case, his plea agreement did not include an agreement to cooperate with ongoing investigations and that\u2019s sort of an outstanding question: Why didn\u2019t it?In Mr. Manafort\u2019s case, he faces a second trial coming up in September on seven additional counts, so it\u2019s not over for Mr. Manafort by any means.In the Manafort case, no, that case was purely financial fraud charges. It had nothing to do with whether Russia interfered or tried to influence the Trump campaign in the 2016 presidential race.In the Cohen case, that\u2019s an open question. In court, Michael Cohen implicated the president in payments to two women who had alleged that they had affairs with him, so in those counts he pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws. I don\u2019t think that the prosecutors will because they didn\u2019t get everything they wanted but they got a lot of what they wanted and they have another case coming up in Washington, D.C. where they are likely to have a more favorable jury pool.On the 10 counts that the jury deadlocked on in the Manafort trial, the prosecutors do have the option of seeking to retry those charges, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely that they will do that. There were bench conferences that we were extremely curious about. One bench conference convened after the defense attorneys asked Mr. Gates, \u201cDid the prosecutors try to question you about the Trump campaign?\u201d and the bench conference on that question was sealed by the judge after the prosecutors said it could jeopardize an ongoing investigation. The judge said he is not going to unseal that for the foreseeable future. The other bench conferences are less interesting and will be unsealed.It would have political ramifications for sure because Mr. Manafort was convicted of, among other things, evading taxes on more than $15 million in income over a period of five years and the two bank fraud charges on which he was convicted carry a maximum sentence of up to 30 years. So these are not crimes that could be dismissed as politically charged, they were straight out fraud charges.He\u2019s been charged with federal crimes \u2014 both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen were charged with federal crimes \u2014 so I don\u2019t think so. I think the answer to that is no.The bank fraud charges were complicated, probably four of them didn\u2019t result in a conviction because it seemed like the bank itself in that case was a co-conspirator. Manafort might have submitted inaccurate information, but the bank definitely seemed to want to give the loan. In fact it seemed almost like quid pro quo between Manafort and the bank chairman, who was hoping for a job. Maybe Secretary of the Army or even Secretary of the Treasury in the Trump administration. So the argument was that if the bank is willing to give the loan, where\u2019s the fraud?The others were conspiracy charges that involved basically requiring the jury to believe Mr. Gates\u2019 testimony. Gates testified that he stole from Mr. Manafort hundreds of thousands of dollars. He also testified he might\u2019ve stolen from President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee when he was executive director of it and that he has committed crimes that could land him in prison for 100 years. And yet more than two dozen charges were dismissed against him as part of his plea agreement, so it\u2019s possible that the jury just wasn\u2019t going to convict on anything that they thought depended upon Rick Gates\u2019 testimony.For Paul Manafort, the judge said basically that he wanted to hear back from the prosecution about whether they intended to retry him on the 10 counts on which the jury could not reach a consensus.For Michael Cohen, no sentencing date has been set as far as I know. It\u2019s worth noting that both men face significant prison time. I think Mr. Manafort probably is looking at anywhere from six to 12 years in prison and Mr. Cohen is looking at possibly a minimum of four years in prison, so very stiff consequences for both of them.Not that I know of, honestly. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really confronted that question in the same way as we are now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We Abandoned Them\u2019: Pope Francis Condemns Sex Abuse and Cover-Up", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Pope Francis, whose pace of action on clerical sexual abuse has threatened lasting damage to his papacy, on Monday did what no pope had done before, issuing a letter to all Catholics condemning the \u201catrocities.\u201d But he offered no specific remedies.It was published as Francis prepared to visit Ireland, a predominantly Catholic nation where abuse scandals and other gross mistreatments of rank-and-file Catholics have contributed to a revolt over issues like abortion that would have been unthinkable just years ago.The church\u2019s mishandling of the abuse crisis, which has affected dozens of countries, has contributed greatly to the gradual erosion of the church\u2019s authority in the West. Over the past two decades, the church has often resisted acknowledging the scale of the crisis, or even specific sexual abuse scandals as they came to light in parishes and dioceses in many countries.Francis\u2019s predecessor, Benedict XVI, ultimately came around to removing many offending priests, but expectations were high that Francis would tackle the culture of secrecy and self-protection in the Vatican that has perpetuated the problem.But even as the pope said on Monday that the church would spare no effort to ensure such abuses never happen again, the letter invited a fresh round of criticism from disappointed survivors, frustrated by the gap between the pope\u2019s words and actions when it comes to what is by now a well-documented, decades-old history of pedophilia by priests and cover-ups by their superiors.Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, called the pope\u2019s letter \u201crecycled rhetoric\u201d and \u201ca disappointment.\u201d\u201cMere words at this point deepen the insult and the pain,\u201d she wrote in a statement to the news media.When Francis assumed the papacy from Benedict in 2013 he was a charismatic leader whose very utterances were seen as action. But the frequency of abuse cases and the church\u2019s inability to offer a comprehensive reckoning have tried the patience of even his supporters and have begun to overwhelm the pope\u2019s popularity and moral authority.The scale of the problem, especially after the new round of revelations, also seems to dwarf the pope\u2019s recent strengthening of his policy of addressing sex abuse in specific countries.Some advocates for abuse victims have called for a worldwide zero tolerance policy, which would take away bishops\u2019 leeway in how to deal with convicted and plausibly accused priests. Activists also want a standardized system for punishing bishops and other religious superiors who allowed child sex abuse to continue under their watch. They want the church to open its archives willingly, without the threat of subpoena.Prosecutors in various countries are taking matters into their own hands and putting clerics on trial, Ms. Doyle said. \u201cIf the pope doesn\u2019t get his house in order, the civil authorities will do it for him,\u201d she said.But Monday\u2019s letter was different, the Vatican said. \u201cThis is about Ireland, this is about the United States, and this is about Chile. But not only,\u201d Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See Press Office said in an audio statement. \u201cPope Francis has written to the people of God and that means everyone.\u201dWhile the shift in Francis\u2019s tone has been notable since he was assailed in the Chilean scandal, critics say the pope has consistently raised expectations of remedies and then failed to deliver.Early on, in 2013, Francis directed the Vatican to act decisively on sexual abuse cases. He instituted a Vatican commission that included victims among its members to propose \u201cbest practice initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults\u201d from delinquent clerics, and proposed a tribunal to prosecute remiss bishops.The initiatives, however, disappointed. The commission, whose term expired in December 2017, gradually lost several members, who quit citing frustration at the resistance they had met from some church officials as well as reluctance in the Vatican to implement recommended changes. The Vatican tribunal to try bishops was never set up.Then came the pope\u2019s serious mishandling of the Chilean situation.Outrage followed and the pope took note.In February, Francis sent the Vatican\u2019s top investigator to Chile, and that led to the pope\u2019s convening of the country\u2019s bishops at the Vatican for a collective scolding. All of the country\u2019s bishops eventually tendered their resignations.Responding to the Pennsylvania grand jury report, the Vatican issued a statement that called the abuses criminal and morally reprehensible and that sought to emphasize that the pope had the victims at heart.\u201cThose who have suffered are his priority, and the church wants to listen to them to root out this tragic horror that destroys the lives of the innocent,\u201d the Vatican wrote.In his letter issued Monday, which Francis addressed to \u201cthe People of God,\u201d the pope went further, acknowledging that saying sorry was not enough. \u201cEfforts to beg pardon\u201d would never be sufficient, the pope wrote.The deep wounds of the victims \u201cnever go away,\u201d he said, specifically citing the grand jury report. While most of those cases, \u201cbelong to the past,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death.\u201dHe also admitted that the church had delayed in applying \u201cactions and sanctions that are so necessary\u201d to protect \u201c the integrity of children and of vulnerable adults, as well as implementing zero tolerance and ways of making all those who perpetrate or cover up these crimes accountable.\u201dThe Rev. Tom Reese, a senior analyst at Religion News Service, said he heard a \u201cdifferent, better, tone coming out of this letter,\u201d which was, he thinks, necessary. \u201cPeople were asking for a personal response from the pope,\u201d he said.\u201cThe letter isn\u2019t defensive, it acknowledges that the church has been slow in responding, and identifies with the suffering of the victims, they are on the cross,\u201d said Father Reese. Bishops once saw themselves as those being crucified on the cross of public opinion because of the sexual abuse crisis, \u201cwhich is nonsense,\u201d he said.The letter, which was issued in seven languages, also makes clear that the pope believes that at least in part, the church got itself into its current trouble because of what is termed \u201cclericalism.\u201d\u201cClericalism is a great sin of clergy, putting themselves first, putting themselves on a pedestal, rather than acknowledging that they are the servants of the faithful,\u201d Father Reese said. \u201cCircling the wagon to protect our own is what got us into this trouble, it\u2019s at the root of the church\u2019s poor response to the abuse crisis.\u201dThat mind-set, the pope wrote, \u201chelps to perpetuate many of the evils that we are condemning today. To say \u2018no\u2019 to abuse is to say an emphatic \u2018no\u2019 to all forms of clericalism.\u201dMr. Burke said that the pope was asking the faithful \u201cdo their part with very traditional means of combating evil: prayer and penance.\u201dBut there were no other specific measures. And for some, the pope\u2019s overture was not enough.\u201cStatements from Vatican or Pope should stop telling us how terrible abuse is and how all must be held accountable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTell us instead what you are doing to hold them accountable. That is what we want to hear. \u2018Working on it\u2019 is not an acceptable explanation for decades of \u2018delay.\u2019\u201dOthers were encouraged.Silica McMeans, a Catholic mother of four children under age 8 in Pittsburgh, said she had read the pope\u2019s entire letter this morning.\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to me like he was mincing words or engaging in a hedging language,\u201d Ms. McMeans said. \u201cI appreciated that it was forthright and honest.\u201dMs. McMeans said she would watch what Francis does and says in his upcoming trip to Ireland.\u201cAs long as things continue in the same way it is a good start,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the action really has to bear it out.\u201dElizabeth Dias contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

Cohen sat silently in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday as a judge ran through a list of questions typically asked of defendants before they plead guilty.Had he been under a doctor\u2019s care? Had he ever been hospitalized for mental illness or addiction?No, Mr. Cohen replied each time.But when the judge asked whether he had had any medication or alcohol in the last 24 hours \u2014 \u201cWhat have you taken or consumed, sir?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen responded affirmatively.\u201cLast night at dinner, I had a glass of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, drawing laughs from the spectator gallery. It was not his usual custom to do that, he added.Mr. Cohen\u2019s sunken eyes loomed as dark as his charcoal suit. After he took his seat, he moved his head side-to-side and he clasped his hands, which seemed to be trembling. He sighed deeply. He reviewed documents given to him by his lawyers, and at one point lifted a hand over his mouth.After the hearing began, Mr. Cohen responded calmly to questions from the judge, William H. Pauley III, often with a lawyer\u2019s precision and self-assurance. Asked his age, he answered, \u201cIn four days, I\u2019ll be 52.\u201dThe plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty.\u201cThey were omitted, your honor, as opposed to being false,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.When the judge pressed him \u2014 \u201cWell, you knew it was false; that it falsely depicted your financial condition, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen acquiesced, saying, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201dThroughout the hearing, Mr. Cohen maintained a look of grim resignation, pursing his lips and nodding slightly when the judge advised him of his rights.After one question, he paused and his voice almost seemed to disappear.\u201cDo you understand,\u201d Judge Pauley asked, \u201cthat you can change your mind right now and refuse to enter a plea of guilty?\u201d\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Cohen responded, in a voice far reduced from its normal bold tenor.When Judge Pauley also asked Mr. Cohen if he understood that he could face as many as 65 years in prison, Mr. Cohen\u2019s voice began to crack, and he appeared to fight back tears.\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Cohen said softly.Judge Pauley, appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by President Bill Clinton, was randomly assigned to Mr. Cohen\u2019s case. He scheduled Mr. Cohen\u2019s sentencing for Dec. 12.As the hearing ended and the courtroom began to empty, Mr. Cohen stood quietly with his lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester; Ms. Lester patted him gently on his left shoulder. They left without offering any comment, and soon Mr. Cohen was walking to a waiting black Buick on Worth Street.This scene played out before scores of reporters and camera crews enclosed behind police barricades.

{"Headline": "Letitia James Has Embraced Andrew Cuomo. Is It Worth It?", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Letitia James, politics has made quick and convenient bedfellows.Within weeks, Mr. Cuomo endorsed Ms. James; the Democratic Party\u2019s formal nomination quickly followed. The governor then held a fund-raiser for her with a minimum ticket price of $1,000. He invited her to appear with him at rallies for reproductive rights. And, in July, he brought Ms. James and several of his political allies on his fifth trip to Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria.As the other three Democratic candidates for attorney general have tried to distance themselves from Mr. Cuomo, Ms. James has fully embraced him. But at a time when prosecuting Wall Street, pursuing political corruption in Albany, and being willing to challenge President Trump and his administration are considered highly prized qualifications for the job, Ms. James\u2019s strategy has been one of high rewards, but also some risk.\u201cPerhaps no criterion is more important right now than the capacity of the next attorney general to be independent,\u201d said the former attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, under whose tenure Ms. James ran the office\u2019s Brooklyn operations. \u201cThe occupant of that office must have the wherewithal to pursue cases against the most powerful forces without regard to political consequences.\u201dThe issue of demonstrating independence has jump-started a relatively quiet race where 42 percent of voters said in a recent poll that they are undecided about whom they will vote for in the Sept. 13 primary.With little separating the four Democratic hopefuls on most campaign issues, the candidates \u2014 Sean Patrick Maloney, New York\u2019s first openly gay congressman; Leecia Eve, a former top aide to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Cuomo; Zephyr Teachout, a law professor who ran a surprisingly effective race against Mr. Cuomo in the 2014 primary; and Ms. James \u2014 have taken to arguing about who is the least anchored to Mr. Cuomo.\u201cUnbossed and unbought,\u201d Ms. James said when asked about her independence from Mr. Cuomo after a fund-raiser at a union hall in Manhattan last week. She scrunched her face and called the speculation that she was too close to Mr. Cuomo \u201cdisrespectful,\u201d hinting that it may be coming her way because she would become the first black woman to hold statewide office were she to win.\u201cI think the governor supports me because he knows that I get things done, that I\u2019ve got a long record in public service and that I understand how Albany works,\u201d Ms. James said in an interview. \u201cThat does not mean I\u2019m beholden to the governor.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say that was offensive?\u201d Ms. James asked. \u201cEveryone in the room enjoyed his comments and, in fact, he got a standing ovation.\u201dMs. James has also benefited from Mr. Cuomo\u2019s skill as a fund-raiser. Of the 155 donors who gave Ms. James $1,000 or more for the July reporting period, just under a third of those donors, 28 percent, also gave money to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s 2018 election account. Ms. James received more than $430,000 from those donors, according to campaign finance records.One shared donor between Mr. Cuomo and Ms. James is the Medmen Opportunity Fund II L.P., a private equity firm that invests in companies that sell legal marijuana. In July, the company gave Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign $65,000 and gave Ms. James\u2019s campaign $21,000. They were the only two politicians in the state to receive donations from the fund, officials there confirmed.\u201cThey are on the right side of the issue,\u201d a Medmen spokesman, Daniel Yi, said in an interview.As much as her association with Mr. Cuomo has helped elevate Ms. James\u2019s profile, it has also alienated some of her supporters.The New York Progressive Action Network interviewed Ms. James and Ms. Teachout in May, intending to make an endorsement soon after. But the decision was delayed because of concerns that Ms. James might be too close to the governor, according to leaders of the group.By the time the board of directors reconvened in July, they had seen enough. They overwhelmingly endorsed Ms. Teachout.\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that she\u2019s no longer a progressive,\u201d said Traci Strickland, co-chairwoman of the group. \u201cWe\u2019re just saying there\u2019s a closeness to the incumbent governor for whom there are many questions.\u201dGeorge Albros, a leader of the network and one of the founding members of the Working Families Party, which helped Ms. James win her first election to the City Council in 2003, was more blunt: \u201cIf you owe your election to the guy you are supposedly overseeing, that creates a problem.\u201dThe Muslim Democratic Club of New York should have been another easy endorsement for Ms. James. Her first deputy in the public advocate\u2019s office, Ibrahim Khan, is a member of the club, which is in Brooklyn, the heart of Ms. James\u2019s political base. The group says it has endorsed Ms. James in previous races. But in July, the group backed Ms. Teachout.\u201cFor many of members of the club,\u201d said one board member, Mohammad Khan, \u201cany association with Cuomo is pretty toxic.\u201d\u201cDoing what the governor wanted her to do in rejecting the line was the canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change. \u201cFor me, it was a sign that she\u2019s not willing to challenge establishment politics.\u201dMr. Westin\u2019s group had also endorsed Ms. Nixon in April, and has since backed Ms. Teachout, who is running on a ticket with Ms. Nixon \u2014 a relationship that should also draw scrutiny, according to Mr. Maloney, the congressman seeking the attorney general post.\u201cThe attorney general can\u2019t be a lieutenant governor-style position,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cThe attorney general has to stand on her own two feet.\u201dMr. Maloney has his own history of supporting Mr. Cuomo, praising him in March for supporting same-sex marriage and calling him a \u201cnational progressive leader.\u201d Democrats \u201cshould all support Governor Cuomo,\u201d Mr. Maloney wrote in a statement.\u201cHe\u2019s been a very good governor and I agree with much of what he\u2019s done,\u201d Mr. Maloney said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t get to pick the attorney general of New York.\u201dMs. Teachout said her career has been focused on fighting corruption, and that she decided to run against Mr. Cuomo in 2014 because he abruptly shuttered the Moreland Commission. \u201cI have never been scared to stand up to power,\u201d Ms. Teachout said.Ms. Eve noted that she was not the \u201ccandidate of either the Democratic or the Working Families Party.\u201d She did participate in the Democratic Party\u2019s convention. \u201cI\u2019m not aligning myself with any particular candidate,\u201d Ms. Eve said.She points to lawsuits against the administrations of Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio during her time as a member of the City Council and as the public advocate as proof of her autonomy.Asked about Ms. James\u2019s remarks, Mr. Spitzer, who has donated money to Mr. Maloney\u2019s campaign, said paying close attention to \u201cintegrity on Wall Street\u201d is more important than ever for state prosecutors.\u201cThere is uniform agreement that prosecutors must step into the void created by the Trump administration\u2019s abdication of its enforcement role in critical areas,\u201d Mr. Spitzer said. \u201cFor Tish James to question that role is, at a minimum, very, very surprising.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "There Is More to Stacey Abrams Than Meets Partisan Eyes", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when Ms. Abrams was beginning her long run as the minority leader in the State House of Representatives, Republicans who were getting to know her style told a different story: They saw a Democrat with a \u201cbalanced view on issues,\u201d as the speaker of the House, David Ralston, put it at the time, and an \u201cability to reach across the aisle.\u201dThe governor\u2019s race in Georgia this year is one of the most closely watched in the country, in large part because of who Ms. Abrams is and what she represents. If she wins, she will be the first black female governor in the nation\u2019s history, and she will have gotten there by running unapologetically as a liberal, with an embrace of gun control, gay rights and access to abortion.In the six years when Ms. Abrams led the Democrats in the State House, though, she proved to be a much more complex political character than the portraits now painted by either her most outspoken adversaries or her most fervent fans.Rising from obscurity in 2011 to helm a diminished and beleaguered caucus, Ms. Abrams, a Yale Law School graduate, showed a penchant both for standing on liberal principle and for negotiating with her opponents.She charmed Republicans and earned their trust. She inspired fellow Democrats and helped them claw back some seats in the legislature. She also prompted grumbling from some Democrats that she could put pragmatism over principle.Campaigning recently at a recreation center in Murray County \u2014 a rural, mainly white bastion of Republicanism on the Tennessee border \u2014 she stood before TV news cameras, reminding people of her work helping to pass a bipartisan billion-dollar transportation bill, and her support of legislation that supports grandparents and other family members raising children.\u201cI know how to work across the aisle when we need to,\u201d she said.Supporters like Gerald Griggs, a vice president of the state N.A.A.C.P. chapter, reject such descriptions as inaccurate \u2014 and also hear in them a coded effort to scare off white voters.\u201cDefinitely, it\u2019s a dog whistle embedded,\u201d he said.Ms. Abrams was elected to the General Assembly in 2006, two years after Republicans had taken control of the Georgia House for the first time in more than a century. She was young, but not green. She had served as student president at Spelman College, Atlanta\u2019s storied African-American women\u2019s college, and kept her life ambitions, eventually including the goal of becoming president, listed in a spreadsheet. \u201cThe sheer boldness of my ambitions gnawed at me,\u201d she recalled in her 2018 autobiography, \u201cMinority Leader: How to Lead from the Outside and Make Real Change.\u201dStyle-wise, she was more of a listener than a glad-hander, more policy wonk than enforcer. She was a careful, prepared speaker with a bookish quality, a wry sense of humor and a tendency toward efficiency.\u201cShe engendered a sense of loyalty in a lot of people that way,\u201d said Brian Thomas, who was a member of the House Democratic leadership at the time. \u201cA lot of people just respected the fact that she was just a lot smarter than some of us, and able to use that intellect in ways that were really effective.\u201dMs. Abrams, through a campaign spokesman, declined to be interviewed for this article.Her debut on the political scene had effectively come in 1992, when she emerged as a leading voice among black students. Atlanta, like other American cities, was racked by protests and riots after police officers in Los Angeles were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King. Eventually she found herself at a televised town-hall meeting with Maynard Jackson, the city\u2019s first black mayor. As the cameras rolled, Ms. Abrams recalled in her book, she \u201cexcoriated his record and scoffed at his leadership.\u201dMr. Jackson later co-opted his eloquent critic, giving her a job in the city\u2019s office of youth services. She went on to earn a law degree and a master\u2019s in public policy, and at the age of 29, to serve as deputy city attorney.The caucus, which had become majority black and held fewer than 70 of the 180 seats in the House, turned to a young backbencher. \u201cI took the lead of a broken party,\u201d Ms. Abrams wrote, \u201cknowing that we would wander in the political wilderness for at least a decade.\u201dShe had already established herself as one of the smartest members of the Legislature. Her background in tax law helped her analyze the deep structure of complex bills, landing her on the powerful Ways and Means Committee as a freshman. Even Republicans saw her talent: In 2011, State Representative Allen Peake called her \u201cbrilliant.\u201d\u201cPeople who underestimate her risk complete embarrassment,\u201d he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution at the time.Her first big test as minority leader came in the crisis over the state\u2019s Hope Scholarship program, arguably the Georgia Democrats\u2019 proudest achievement of the last quarter-century. Begun in 1993 under Gov. Zell Miller and financed with state lottery revenue, the generous program signaled that Georgia saw investment in higher education as a catalyst for progress.But from the beginning, the program has also raised complicated questions about how to allocate government aid to students \u2014 by need or by merit. Initially, the Hope Scholarship paid full in-state college tuition and fees for any student in the state who had at least a B average and family income of less than $66,000 a year; the income cap was removed in 1995.By 2011, Hope had helped send more than a million Georgians to college, and roughly the same number to preschool under a separate arm of the program.But it was also going broke, and fixing it became a priority for Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, after his election in November 2010.The Republican solution was to retain the original scholarship with a reduced award amount, and then to create a second scholarship that would offer a smaller group of students a full ride: those with a high school G.P.A. of 3.7 or better and at least a 1200 score on the SAT test.Vincent Fort, a liberal from Atlanta who was then in the State Senate, and several other Democratic lawmakers passionately opposed the plan, and pushed to return to the original idea of a means test based on family income.\u201cI\u2019m a college teacher,\u201d Mr. Fort said. \u201cI\u2019d been in classrooms, and I knew that SATs were not a predictor of academic success. And I knew that it would not only exclude students of color, but rural white kids as well.\u201dSome Democrats wanted Ms. Abrams to work with Republicans to solve the problem, she wrote in her book, while others wanted \u201cto force the G.O.P. to take responsibility\u201d for cuts to the scholarship.She chose to negotiate.In the book, she said that she \u201csecured\u201d the system that preserved a partial scholarship for B students, pushed for a new low-interest college loan program, and was able to preserve the full pre-K program.\u201cI angered a number of Democrats,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understood, but I disagreed.\u201dThere were moments in her tenure when she could sway public policy by dint of sheer intellect. During her first year, she analyzed a Republican-backed flat-tax plan and showed that it would amount to a tax increase \u2014 not a break \u2014 for the middle class. Even some Republicans bailed.Representative David Dreyer, a Democrat who entered the Legislature in 2017, said that Ms. Abrams was a master of the art of the possible \u2014 even when her party\u2019s limited power often left her with few possibilities.\u201cYou get small bites accomplished legislatively, while you\u2019re also having a conversation with the larger issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou offer a vision.\u201dThe moments in which she disappointed some Democrats have been chronicled in recent months by The Intercept.Though Ms. Abrams has championed greater voter access, and founded a nonprofit group that, according to her campaign, has submitted voter registrations for 200,000 people, she also supported a bill in 2015 that was later criticized for setting district boundaries disadvantageous to minority voters. Her campaign said in a statement that Republicans \u201cmisled her\u201d about the matter.\u201cI wrongly presumed that the party of freedom would jump at the opportunity to make a stand in that historic moment,\u201d Ms. Jones wrote. \u201cAbrams quickly and definitively said no.\u201dMs. Abrams\u2019s campaign declined to comment about Ms. Jones\u2019s assertion.Two days after the critical blog post, Ms. Abrams, in one of the most attention-grabbing announcements of her nascent bid for governor, called for the carving at Stone Mountain to be removed.Since Ms. Abrams won her bruising primary fight in May, Democratic lawmakers have been rallying to her side, their complaints melting away in the face of a chance to make history, and in widespread faith in her ability to lead them.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t just a musician, she was a conductor, and she was able to conduct an orchestra with many different instruments,\u201d said Joe Heckstall, a Democrat who had his disagreements with Ms. Abrams when he served in the House. \u201cSome of those play by themselves, and out of tune, but she was able to harmonize. There were some things where we didn\u2019t agree with her. But she was able to keep us focused.\u201dAlan Blinder contributed reporting from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Swamp Things", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid anybody mention clearing the air?Opinion ColumnistI cannot think of a better time to talk about draining the swamp.After all, we\u2019ve got swampy weather. Plus a president whose administration is setting records for boggy behavior. \u2019Tis the season.People, what do you think originally inspired Donald Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d if he was elected? Do you think he repressed the whole matter of his tax returns? The hush money payments to Stormy and Company? He did say during his campaign that the swamp was the \u201centire corrupt Washington establishment,\u201d so maybe he presumed that slimy things occurring in New York or Florida didn\u2019t count.Ah, well, let\u2019s look ahead. Autumn is coming, temperatures will be falling and the Democrats will be running on a neo-Drainage platform.\u201cThe swamp has never been more foul or more fetid than under this president,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, when he and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi held a press conference on the steps of the Capitol to unveil a good-government agenda called \u201cA Better Deal for Our Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s part of the overall Democratic election theme \u201cA Better Deal.\u201dO.K., the last one was an old quiz show. On the reform front, Better Deal has a lot of pieces, like making it easier for people to register to vote, increasing the political power of small donors and stronger ethics guidelines. Who could possibly be against any of that? Well, somebody must, since they\u2019ve never become law. Actually, while Republicans have in recent years been the big brake on reform, anything that affects elections makes elected officials nervous. So it\u2019s important to show a lot of enthusiasm when these ideas come up. Even if the words \u201ccampaign finance reform\u201d cause your eyes to glaze over, look excited. This is our moment.Anyhow, Warren\u2019s basic idea is to unravel some of the ties between the federal government and the corporate world that government is supposed to regulate. So you couldn\u2019t just leave your seat in Congress and go to work for a big financial or lobbying firm.There\u2019s a lot of subsurface hostility to this in Congress. The members, who get around $174,000 a year (plus benefits), frequently convince themselves they\u2019re making a great financial sacrifice that will pay off later when they return to the private sector. Some can\u2019t even wait that long, like Representative Duncan Hunter of California. \u2026The Trump era makes our normal problems with political ethics explode like spectacular, sleazy fireworks. It\u2019s not unusual for public servants to recycle themselves into lucrative jobs in lobbying or business. But this administration has been distinguished by the number of people who can\u2019t even wait until they leave the government to start getting payback. Hunter\u2019s district is, as you can probably tell, very conservative. It\u2019s also very safe \u2014 he inherited the seat from his father. Pre-scandal, there weren\u2019t a lot of Democrats standing in line to get a chance to run against him, and his opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, is a relative political newcomer. Cross your fingers and see if voters in a red district will be willing to take a stand against corruption and elect a Palestinian Mexican-American millennial to represent them in Washington.Hey, stranger things have happened. For instance, Hunter\u2019s apparently paid back the $600 he used for the rabbit\u2019s plane flight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Live and Die in Paris ", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Druckerman is a contributing opinion writer. PARIS \u2014 In June, I got an email from a Frenchwoman I know. I\u2019ll call her H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cI am now embarked on a fascinating trip as I will no longer be around at the end of the summer. I am serene and ready. I would be happy to share some thoughts on death if you could come and see me. Pick a nice day, we\u2019ll chat in the garden.\u201dH\u00e9l\u00e8ne is a teacher in her 70s whom I\u2019d met a few years earlier when she invited me to speak to her class. She became a friendly informant on French culture, with a distinctly Parisian way of sounding familiar, then suddenly saying something altogether foreign. She once complained that when she invites Americans to dinner, they phone ahead with their food preferences. She couldn\u2019t understand why she wasn\u2019t supposed to intervene to help her overweight American students slim down.H\u00e9l\u00e8ne has now surprised me again with the way she plans to, as the French say, \u201cdisappear.\u201d (I knew that she had cancer, but I hadn\u2019t realized that it was terminal or that she had imminent plans to die.) On the M\u00e9tro to her house, I remind myself that we\u2019re not close. She has summoned me as a journalist. I won\u2019t get too involved. Over lunch (I\u2019ve made no food requests), H\u00e9l\u00e8ne describes the complicated logistics of dying in Paris. They\u2019re a lot like living in Paris. She was terrified of dying in August, when Parisians are on vacation, so \u201cat my burial there would be one dog and three people.\u201d She was relieved when a funeral planner promised that he\u2019d refrigerate her until September. She has drawn up a guest list for her memorial service \u2014 called a c\u00e9r\u00e9monie d\u2019adieu \u2014 and selected an \u201celegant\u201d crepe de Chine dress to wear for it. She had hoped to be cremated afterward and then sprinkled into the Seine, but \u201cwith this stupid and authoritarian state, you don\u2019t have the right to do what you want with your ashes.\u201d\u201cIt must be frightening to think of not being there,\u201d I say. \u201cYes, it\u2019s unbearable! Otherwise they\u2019re going to have to get a boat and take me out to sea.\u201dI realize H\u00e9l\u00e8ne thought I meant the burial plot. I gently clarify that she must be afraid of not being alive. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d she replies. \u201cI\u2019m impatient to go. I\u2019m ready. It\u2019s enough. It does not interest me to watch my body fall apart.\u201d I\u2019m struck by the paradox: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is eager to die, but she\u2019s intensely alive and curious about her experience. And even now, she has a very French way of keeping track of precisely what she does and doesn\u2019t like. Instead of a bucket list, she delights in small daily moments, like being carried by a handsome fireman after she recently injured herself at home. (\u201cI said to him, \u2018Come back and have a glass of wine here!\u2019\u201d) She also takes pleasure in editing her life, including clearing her drawers of all but \u201cimportant\u201d possessions. At first, some colleagues came to visit out of \u201cmorbid curiosity.\u201d Now she sees only beloved friends and former students, and several boyfriends from her youth. \u201cWe know it\u2019s the last time, so we tell each other things, there\u2019s no reason to hide anything.\u201d When discussing death with them, \u201cI put people at ease, there\u2019s no taboo.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is enjoying her palliative care. With her doctors and nurses, too, \u201cwe really have profound conversations. Because they\u2019re in life and death all the time.\u201d (One issue she doesn\u2019t need to ponder is money: France\u2019s national insurance covers all her medical expenses, including the physical therapist and hospice nurse who visit her at home several times a week. She accepted an at-home hospital bed but refused the state-financed housekeeper and facials.) H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s insights are modest: Don\u2019t confuse your own joys and preferences with anyone else\u2019s. Observe your own mind and experiences carefully and arrange your life \u2014 and your death \u2014 accordingly. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s to try to find a truth that is really yours, nothing but yours. And not to act out of conformism.\u201d By doing this, she has reached the pinnacle of female Frenchness: She\u2019s une femme libre \u2014 a free woman.Over dessert, my journalistic reserve cracks. I realize that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne isn\u2019t just a friendly informant; she\u2019s a friend. And there is no one else like her. I don\u2019t want her to disappear. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re still alive in September?\u201d I ask, hopefully. \u201cPlease don\u2019t wish that for me,\u201d she replies. She detests being dependent, and she can\u2019t be cured. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll come to my funeral,\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne says, walking over to embrace me before I leave. I tell her the truth: I wouldn\u2019t miss it.Pamela Druckerman, the author of \u201cBringing Up B\u00e9b\u00e9\u201d and \u201cThere Are No Grown-Ups: A Midlife Coming-of-Age Story,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deal Gives Kushners Cash Infusion on 666 Fifth Avenue", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, paid a record-setting $1.8 billion for the building in 2007, and it has been a drag on his family\u2019s real estate company ever since.The deal, in which Brookfield paid the rent for the entire 99-year term upfront, helps remove the family\u2019s biggest financial headache: a $1.4 billion mortgage on the office portion of the tower that was due in February next year. The Kushners have spent more than two years on an international search for new partners or fresh financing that stretched from the Middle East to China.The deal would enable the Kushners to pay off at least a large portion of what they owe lenders and retain ownership of the land beneath the tower. But they may not make any money from it.While the deal relieves some of the Kushners\u2019 troubles, difficulties persist across their real estate empire, at least in part because of their connection to the White House. \u201cIf you do business with the Kushners, there\u2019s a headline reality,\u201d said Kenneth Pasternak, executive chairman of the real-estate firm KABR Group and an investing partner of the Kushner family in multiple developments. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a headline risk,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a headline reality.\u201dIn the 666 Fifth Avenue deal, Brookfield paid about $1.1 billion in upfront rent, according to an executive who requested anonymity because he had been briefed on the deal but was not authorized to discuss it. Charles Kushner, Jared\u2019s father, who now runs the company, in turn, negotiated with his lenders to pay less than the company owed to satisfy the debts, the executive said.Analysts have long said that 666 Fifth was worth less than its debts. The building was 30 percent vacant and only generated about half the annual mortgage payments. In recent months, the building\u2019s largest remaining tenant, Millennium Management, signaled that it too planned to leave.A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies declined to comment on the Brookfield deal.The purchase of the aluminum-clad tower was intended to vault the Kushners into the top ranks of New York real estate from their perch in New Jersey, where they were known for a huge portfolio of garden apartment complexes. They moved their company headquarters to 666 Fifth, from where they presided over a new and rapidly expanding empire that included former industrial buildings in Brooklyn, apartments in Maryland and development sites in Jersey City, N.J.But they ran into trouble almost immediately. They were unable to get the office rents they expected in 2007, making it difficult to pay the initial $1.75 billion debt on the building. Then the recession hit.Jared and Charles Kushner sold 666 Fifth\u2019s most valuable asset \u2014 the Fifth Avenue retail space \u2014 for $525 million and used the proceeds to pay down some of their debt. But office rents continued to fall and two of the tower\u2019s biggest tenants left.That forced the Kushners to restructure their loans, and Vornado Realty Trust bought a 49.5 percent stake in the office space and gave the Kushners an $80 million high-interest loan. Vornado later bought the retail space from separate owners.In 2016, Charles and Jared Kushner pitched a new deal to investors in the United States and abroad: They would demolish the building and erect a $7.5 billion luxury supertower in its place. They got close to a deal with a billionaire from Qatar, Hamad Jassim Al-Thani, the country\u2019s former prime minister, and with Anbang, a giant Chinese insurance company.But the deal with the Chinese collapsed amid criticism from legislators over the connection between Jared Kushner\u2019s political role and the family business.In negotiations with his lenders, the executive familiar with the deal said, Mr. Kushner argued that 666 Fifth was not worth the $1.4 billion that was owed. He eventually worked out an agreement to pay off the debts for substantially less, according to the executive.But they still could not secure financing, and on Friday, Brookfield, which owns and operates more than 275 office buildings worldwide, said that it had taken the 99-year lease instead. The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Also on Friday, Vornado announced that it had sold its stake in the office portion of the building to the Kushners for $120 million.While the deal solves a major problem for the Kushners, the company still faces challenges. Lenders continue to hesitate or retreat from doing business with the company, cowed by the scrutiny that other financial partners have received.In a statement, Natixis said that while it had done deals with Kushner Companies between 2013 and 2016, it \u201cno longer has any exposure or active business relationship with Kushner Companies.\u201d Officials there declined to comment on the Jersey City transaction.Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, has said that Kushner Companies is a longtime client of the bank, that the meeting Mr. Corbat had with Mr. Kushner had no connection to the loan made shortly afterward and that every deal is analyzed on a case-by-case basis.Chris Taylor, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said, \u201cIt is very well known in the marketplace that Natixis is a very unreliable lender. Kushner has a strong relationship with Citi for decades and continues to have a very close relationship.\u201dAt 666 Fifth Avenue, Brookfield is betting on a turnaround based on the building\u2019s premier location on Fifth Avenue, near Rockefeller Center and Central Park, and its access to public transportation. The company plans to spend about $700 million renovating the lobby, installing new elevators, refurbishing the vacant office space and attracting new tenants.\u201c666 Fifth Avenue has the potential to be one of New York City\u2019s most iconic and successful office properties,\u201d Ric Clark, chairman of Brookfield Property Group, said in a statement Friday. \u201cGiven Brookfield\u2019s experience in successfully redeveloping and repositioning major office assets in New York and other cities around the world, we are well placed to capitalize on that opportunity.\u201dBrookfield is one of the world\u2019s biggest real estate companies, and among its investors is the Qatar Investment Authority, one of the world\u2019s largest sovereign funds, which bought a $1.8 billion stake in one of the company\u2019s subsidiaries, Brookfield Property Partners in 2014, and is the second-largest investor in the company, ranking only behind Brookfield Asset Management. That has raised questions given Jared Kushner\u2019s portfolio in the White House, which includes the Middle East.Brookfield has said that the Qataris had no knowledge of the deal before its public announcement.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}

(That\u2019s more than 17 hours a day.)And that doesn\u2019t count those of us who take work home.With that in mind, we spoke to Anat Lechner, a business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, about mental health in the workplace and how to avoid hitting a breaking point.What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point?The signs are usually emotional. \u201cYou can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don\u2019t work as hard,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it\u2019s important to understand what messy work means, she added. \u201cPeople who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.\u201dWhat are the best ways to personally prevent a breaking point?Avoidance and engagement. \u201cAvoid being on the grid 24-7,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. \u201cCarve out for yourself the three or four hours that you need every day to get off the grid and relax and teach the rest of the world, as well as yourself, that not all hours are email hours.\u201d And engage more effectively. \u201cLearn to collaborate better. When you learn the skill of collaboration, or working together, the work naturally gets distributed more effectively,\u201d she said.How can I help a struggling colleague?Talk, listen and lend a hand.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Keep your umbrella at the ready.Showers are very likely this morning, with bouts of heavy rain, and we may see thunderstorms.The day will gradually get drier and we may see a fair bit of sun before it hits the horizon.And the gig economy, as it\u2019s known, can come with its own pressures: a lack of financial security, access to health care or a comfortable place to work that doesn\u2019t make you buy a $4 coffee.But soon, New York freelancers will get a boost.At 10 a.m. today, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment will announce the creation of a \u201cFreelancers Hub\u201d at the Made in NY Media Center in Dumbo, Brooklyn.Think of the hub as a free WeWork with areas for networking, legal clinics for workers and workshops in marketing, accounting and filing your taxes.It\u2019s the first effort by an American city to create a hub for freelancers who work in the gig economy, according to the Office of Media and Entertainment.The new center, operated by the Freelancers Union, is geared toward freelancers in media and entertainment.It\u2019s slated to open in early October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Details \u2018Excruciating\u2019 Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was at home in Los Angeles, struggling to maintain his composure. \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dIn an hourlong interview with The New York Times, he choked up multiple times, noting that he nearly missed his brother\u2019s wedding this summer and spent his birthday holed up in Tesla\u2019s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.Asked if the exhaustion was taking a toll on his physical health, Mr. Musk answered: \u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually. I\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dFor two decades, Mr. Musk has been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most brash and ambitious entrepreneurs, helping to found several influential technology companies. He has often carried himself with bravado, dismissing critics and relishing the spotlight that has come with his success and fortune. But in the interview, he demonstrated an extraordinary level of self-reflection and vulnerability, acknowledging that his myriad executive responsibilities are taking a steep personal toll.In the interview, Mr. Musk provided a detailed timeline of the events leading up to the Twitter postings on Aug. 7 in which he said he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. He asserted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for such a deal \u2014 a transaction likely to be worth well over $10 billion.That morning, Mr. Musk woke up at home with his girlfriend, the musician known as Grimes, and had an early workout. Then he got in a Tesla Model S and drove himself to the airport. En route, Mr. Musk typed his fateful message.Mr. Musk has said he saw the tweet as an attempt at transparency. He acknowledged Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it.Tesla\u2019s shares soared. Investors, analysts and journalists puzzled over the tweet \u2014 published in the middle of the day\u2019s official market trading, an unusual time to release major news \u2014 including the price Mr. Musk cited. He said in the interview that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 \u2014 a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dMr. Musk reached the airport and flew on a private plane to Nevada, where he spent the day visiting a Tesla battery plant known as the Gigafactory, including time meeting with managers and working on an assembly line. That evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he held Tesla meetings late into the night.What Mr. Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured\u201d has become an important question. Those two words helped propel Tesla\u2019s shares higher.But that funding, it turned out, was far from secure.Mr. Musk has said he was referring to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government investment fund. Mr. Musk had extensive talks with representatives of the $250 billion fund about possibly financing a transaction to take Tesla private \u2014 maybe even in a manner that would have resulted in the Saudis\u2019 owning most of the company. One of those sessions took place on July 31 at the Tesla factory in the Bay Area, according to a person familiar with the meeting. But the Saudi fund had not committed to provide any cash, two people briefed on the discussions said.Another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX, Mr. Musk\u2019s rocket company, would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet kicked off a chain reaction.An hour and 20 minutes after the tweet, with Tesla\u2019s shares up 7 percent, the Nasdaq stock exchange halted trading, and Tesla published a letter to employees from Mr. Musk explaining the rationale for possibly taking the company private. When the shares resumed trading, they continued their climb, ending the day with an 11 percent gain.The next day, investigators in the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Tesla for explanations. Ordinarily, such material information about a public company\u2019s plans is laid out in detail after extensive internal preparation and issued through official channels. Board members, blindsided by the chief executive\u2019s market-moving statement, were angry that they had not been briefed, two people familiar with the matter said. They scrambled to cobble together a public statement trying to defuse a mounting uproar over the seemingly haphazard communication.Mr. Musk said in the interview that board members had not complained to him about his tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t recall getting any communications from the board at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely did not get calls from irate directors.\u201dBut shortly after the Times published its interview with Mr. Musk, he added through a Tesla spokeswoman that Antonio Gracias, Tesla\u2019s lead independent director, had indeed contacted him to discuss the Aug. 7 Twitter post, and that he had agreed not to tweet again about the possible privatization deal unless he had discussed it with the board.In the interview, Mr. Musk added that he did not regret his Twitter post \u2014 \u201cWhy would I?\u201d \u2014 and said he had no plans to stop using the social media platform. Some board members, however, have recently told Mr. Musk that he should lay off Twitter and focus on making cars and launching rockets, according to people familiar with the matter.The S.E.C. investigation appears to be intensifying rapidly. Just days after the agency\u2019s request for information, Tesla\u2019s board and Mr. Musk received S.E.C. subpoenas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Board members and Mr. Musk are preparing to meet with S.E.C. officials as soon as next week, the person said.In the interview on Thursday, Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears.He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently \u2014 echoing the reason he cited in a recent public apology to an analyst whom he had berated. In the interview, Mr. Musk said he had not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMr. Musk stopped talking, seemingly overcome by emotion.He turned 47 on June 28, and he said he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday at work. \u201cAll night \u2014 no friends, nothing,\u201d he said, struggling to get the words out.Two days later, he was scheduled to be the best man at the wedding of his brother, Kimbal, in Catalonia. Mr. Musk said he flew directly there from the factory, arriving just two hours before the ceremony. Immediately afterward, he got back on the plane and returned straight to Tesla headquarters, where work on the mass-market Model 3 has been all consuming.Mr. Musk paused again.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dHe blamed short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet that Tesla\u2019s shares will lose value \u2014 for much of his stress. He said he was bracing for \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dReferring to the short-sellers, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb guys, but they\u2019re not supersmart. They\u2019re O.K. They\u2019re smartish.\u201dTo help sleep when he is not working, Mr. Musk said he sometimes takes Ambien. \u201cIt is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,\u201d he said.But this has worried some board members, who have noted that sometimes the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar with the board\u2019s thinking. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has on occasion used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Tesla executives have been trying for years to recruit a chief operating officer or other No. 2 executive to assume some of Mr. Musk\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities, according to people familiar with the matter. A couple of years ago, Mr. Musk said, the company approached Sheryl Sandberg, who is Facebook\u2019s second-highest executive, about the job.Mr. Musk said that \u201cto the best of my knowledge,\u201d there is \u201cno active search right now.\u201d But people familiar with the matter said a search is underway, and one person said it had intensified in the wake of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets.In response to questions for this article, Tesla provided a statement that it attributed to its board, excluding Elon Musk. \u201cThere have been many false and irresponsible rumors in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe would like to make clear that Elon\u2019s commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. Over the past 15 years, Elon\u2019s leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process.\u201dMr. Musk said he had no plans to relinquish his dual roles as chairman and chief executive.But, he added, \u201cif you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peloton\u2019s New Infusion Made It a $4 Billion Company in 6 Years", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Peloton\u2019s first two years in business, venture capital investors didn\u2019t get it. The company\u2019s founders struggled to convince them that blending stationary bikes and streaming live video classes would work. It had to cobble together money from a network of more than 200 angel investors to get off the ground.But six years and a quarter of a million bikes later, the company is the toast of Silicon Valley. On Friday, Peloton announced it had raised $550 million in financing from prominent investors led by TCV, a firm known for investing in Facebook, Netflix and LinkedIn. Peloton has now raised $1 billion and is valued at $4 billion.The combination of hardware and software that initially turned off investors is now viewed as an advantage. After Peloton sells customers a bike for $1,995, the company charges a $39 monthly subscription for the live video classes. Jay Hoag, general partner of TCV, compared the business model to Apple\u2019s iPhone and App Store. And he said Peloton\u2019s repeat revenue from subscriptions reminded him of Netflix, where he\u2019s a board director, and of Spotify, a TCV portfolio company.\u201cThey have a similar-sized opportunity to reshape fitness,\u201d he said.Peloton is on track to bring in $700 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in February, said Jessica Kleiman, vice president of global communications for Peloton. It plans to go public in 2019.Peloton\u2019s slug of capital comes during an influx of so-called mega-rounds of funding of $100 million or more. In July, 55 companies raised mega-rounds, the highest amount in the last decade, according to data site Crunchbase.Peloton\u2019s new influx of money will partly be used to fend off new competitors. Investors, seeing Peloton\u2019s fast rise, are fearful of missing out again on an exercise start-up.Flywheel, NordicTrack and a brand called Echelon all offer stationary bikes with video classes. A start-up called FightCamp is pitching itself as \u201cthe Peloton of boxing.\u201d And Mirror, a company making home fitness devices that stream yoga and Pilates fitness routines, has raised $13 million even though its product has not yet gone on sale.The money going to Peloton will also be used to expand Peloton\u2019s offerings. Fitness is a faddish industry, as anyone who owns a dusty set of Tae Bo tapes can attest, and indoor cycling is not immune. In May SoulCycle, a boutique indoor cycling company, withdrew its plans to go public, citing \u201cmarket conditions.\u201dThe company has plans to expand outside the United States as well, including in Canada and Britain, starting in the fall.The company has not yet shipped bikes overseas because it hasn\u2019t had music licenses in other countries. That hasn\u2019t stopped some enthusiasts from getting their hands on them. Last year, according to Mr. Lynch, a duchess in Sweden sent the company a photo of a bike being delivered to a countryside chateau.\u201cWe had this tsunami of demand from Europe and Canada from consumers asking if they could get the bike,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Customers Died. Will That Be a Wake-Up Call for China\u2019s Tech Scene?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHuang Jieli, who ran a Chinese ride-sharing business called Hitch, was invited to a wedding in March. One of her drivers was getting married to a woman who had once been his passenger. Thanks, the invitation said, for getting them hitched.Didi Chuxing, Hitch\u2019s corporate parent and one of the world\u2019s most successful and valuable start-ups, once cheered these stories of young love. Like so many other Chinese internet companies, Didi explored all kinds of ways to bring in new users, including social networking.So through suggestive ads hinting at hookups through driving, Didi pushed Hitch\u2019s romantic possibilities. In a 2015 interview with the Chinese online portal NetEase, Ms. Huang compared Hitch cars to cafes and bars.\u201cIt\u2019s a very futuristic and very sexy scenario,\u201d she told NetEase.It\u2019s a rare moment of self-reflection in China\u2019s internet industry, which has grown to rival Silicon Valley in both size and influence. Two Chinese companies, Tencent and Alibaba, rank among the top 10 publicly listed companies in the world in valuation. Four of the 10 most valuable start-ups are from China, according to CBInsights. One of them is Didi, which ranks second only to Uber.But the potential for abuse in China is severe. Corporations are subject to little scrutiny from state-controlled media until problems spin out of control. Spotty enforcement and slow lawmaking leave the public less protected from exploitation. Chinese people are fixated on their phones, spending four more hours on average a week online than Americans. The industry\u2019s extreme growth \u2014 the number of internet users has doubled, to 800 million, in eight short years \u2014 has created a culture in which companies prize money over users\u2019 well-being.Didi itself admitted this week that it had lost its way. In a statement on Tuesday, it said it would stop using scale and growth to measure its success.\u201cIn the past few years we forged ahead wildly, riding on aggressive business strategies and the power of capital,\u201d the company said in the statement from Cheng Wei, its chief executive, and Jean Liu, its president. In the face of lost lives, the statement said, \u201cthe whole company started to question whether we have the right value system.\u201d\u201cTruly disgusting, despicable marketing for Didi Hitch that\u2019s all sexual innuendo and all about \u2018picking up\u2019 girls,\u201d said Rui Ma, a technology investor who works in both Silicon Valley and China, on Twitter. She added, \u201cDidi are you running a service for sexual predators or a ride hailing app?!\u201dWhile it wasn\u2019t obvious to female passengers that their drivers might want to hook up, the drivers knew. Until Didi deactivated Hitch, the car-pooling service allowed drivers to share comments with other drivers on the looks of their passengers, leading some male drivers to seek out the ones others had declared attractive.The problem goes well beyond Didi. China has grown so fast that many facets of life \u2014 shopping, online banking, transportation \u2014 lack the sort of established incumbents common in the West. Tech companies can swoop in and become dominant in those areas. That makes Chinese companies appealing to investors. It also makes them potentially dangerous.My conversations with Chinese tech companies and their investors, including some from the United States, revolve around user growth and the amount of time they can keep users glued to apps. On occasion I asked why they lent their technology to the government for surveillance, or what they thought the social impact might be from the videos, games and endless feeds of mind-numbing information they send to the public. They either gave me blank stares or said their technologies were merely neutral tools.\u201cNo matter how we complain or criticize, bad companies, be it Didi or Baidu, simply won\u2019t change,\u201d Ye Ying, editor of The Art Newspaper China, wrote on her WeChat timeline. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped using Baidu long time ago. Should I delete the Didi app as well?\u201dEven with women in top jobs, the industry can\u2019t seem to shake the attitude. Ms. Liu is probably China\u2019s most prominent female technology executive.Hitch\u2019s suggestive strategy was overseen by Ms. Huang. In one corporate video the company compared her to Hua Mulan, the female warrior of ancient China, and promoted her as a skilled executor of the company\u2019s vision. The video\u2019s English title is \u201cLean In, Jelly,\u201d using her English name.The question now is whether Didi, and executives in the rest of the industry, can root out those attitudes to protect users.\u201cWithout the interference of a value system, the vast majority of them will choose their job performances over users\u2019 safety,\u201d wrote Feng Dahui, a former Alibaba executive and industry critic, in a WeChat post. \u201cThis is the ethical dilemma of most internet elites.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Sick of Losing,\u2019 Democrats Race to the End of a Wild Florida Primary for Governor", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 She made her way past a man in a coconut-shell bikini top and a burly guy in a parrot-head hat, and then the candidate trying to become Florida\u2019s first female governor began swaying to an escapist island tune being played onstage in her honor. Just days before a stubbornly close primary election, the show stood a chance of helping win over an undecided Democratic voter or two.The crowd cheered for Gwen Graham, the former Tallahassee congresswoman and senator\u2019s daughter seen by national party leaders as a formidable contender to break the Republican Party\u2019s 20-year hold on the Florida governor\u2019s mansion. A mainstream Democrat, Ms. Graham is a former P.T.A. mom with a golden pedigree who could appeal to the moderate women who have been abandoning the Republican Party since the election of President Trump.\u201cHelp is on the way,\u201d she promised the audience.But this is Florida, where political races, much like Floridians, run a little wild.The state\u2019s primary election on Tuesday will set up one of the most consequential governor\u2019s races in the country in the nation\u2019s largest presidential battleground state, which voted twice for President Barack Obama before swinging narrowly to Mr. Trump in 2016. Even though the state has gone blue in some presidential elections, it has not elected a Democratic governor for two decades. Picking one this year would give the party a prominent voice to counter the White House going into the 2020 presidential campaign, and veto power in the next round of redistricting of congressional seats.Florida takes a measure of civic pride in being a political microcosm of the country, and Democrats here see the governor\u2019s race as a testing ground for how to campaign successfully in the Trump era. Should the party try to lure away centrist white voters uneasy with the president, or should it mobilize young and non-white voters who already lean Democratic but often do not vote in midterm elections?The leading candidates reflect the contours of the national party, and its struggles to decide on its ideological direction. Ms. Graham is the moderate who enjoys the support of national women\u2019s groups and argues that it\u2019s past time to elect a female governor; Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee is the outspoken, Bernie Sanders-endorsed progressive who is eager to tug the party toward the undiluted left; and three businessmen \u2014 former Mayor Philip Levine of Miami Beach, Jeff Greene, a Palm Beach real-estate investor, and Chris King, an Orlando entrepreneur \u2014 are the rich white men, part of an increasingly common breed of wealthy entrepreneurs dipping into their own fortunes to enter the political world.These familiar battle lines are what have made the unusually tight and unpredictable contest more than a little awkward for the party, and also hard to forecast.The campaigns of Mr. Levine and Mr. Greene have dominated the television airwaves. Mr. Gillum, Ms. Graham\u2019s friend turned rival, could make history as Florida\u2019s first black governor.Polls suggest Ms. Graham and Mr. Levine are in the lead, with Mr. Gillum gaining ground. Mr. Greene, a billionaire who made a late entry into the race, briefly appeared as a top contender before seeing his popularity wane. Apparently concluding he could not win, he preserved the rest of his fortune by taking his TV ads off the air last week.Ms. Graham has nicknamed the race \u201cGwen and the men.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d said Sally Dieguez, 69, a Graham supporter who attended Mr. Buffett\u2019s free concert. \u201cLevine and Greene got their ads out very early, and they saturated the TV market.\u201dA few days earlier at the nearby public library, where early voting was underway, Bud Knoop, 62, a retired city gardener, said he \u201cvoted for Ms. Gwen\u201d in part as a rejection of Mr. Levine and Mr. Greene, who in attack ads have each likened the other to Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m tired of the two gentlemen fighting each other, picking on Trump and not saying what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Mr. Knoop said.Ms. Graham\u2019s safe-for-suburbia profile, and a voting record from her single term in Congress that reflects her more conservative Panhandle district, have not exactly been helpful in a primary that has been a race to the left. Democratic leaders in Washington have been frustrated at her inability to lock in a win, irritated at Mr. Levine\u2019s self-financed command of the airwaves \u2014 especially in expensive South Florida, home to at least a fifth of Democratic primary voters \u2014 and Mr. Greene\u2019s deluge of attacks. (After spending more than $30 million of his own money, Mr. Greene went mostly off the air.)\u201cIt\u2019s hard to run against a multimillionaire and a billionaire,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, who runs the Democratic women\u2019s group Emily\u2019s List, which will spend more than $2 million for Ms. Graham by the end of the primary. (Ms. Graham is also a multimillionaire.)Mr. Greene\u2019s foray into the race blunted Mr. Levine\u2019s momentum and helped Ms. Graham, at least until Mr. Greene started highlighting her family\u2019s involvement in a proposed megamall development near the Florida Everglades. Ms. Graham\u2019s father, Bob Graham, is a former governor and senator beloved among older Democrats but unknown to many new arrivals.\u201cWe have a president who\u2019s in this situation,\u201d Mr. Levine said after a recent debate in Palm Beach Gardens. \u201cWe are not going to test you on the top job.\u201dEven more delicate in progressive circles is Mr. Gillum\u2019s candidacy. Some Democrats were uneasy about rallying to Ms. Graham\u2019s side when there was such a promising young African-American in the race. Quashing the aspirations of a viable black candidate for governor would be difficult enough given how reliant the party is on African-American voters in a state where blacks make up 28 percent of registered Democratic voters. But it is an even more sensitive matter with a racially divisive president in the White House. Few in the party were willing to discuss the matter publicly other than to diplomatically emphasize the importance of fielding the candidate most likely to win a state Mr. Trump carried in 2016.\u201cThis race exemplifies how important it is to balance our long-term goals with our short-term, acute need to win in key states,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, who runs Naral-Pro-Choice America, which endorsed Ms. Graham.Quentin James, who runs a group dedicated to electing more African-Americans, echoed Mr. Gillum, saying the \u201ccentral question\u201d Democrats face is, \u201cAre we going to go after moderate Republicans or seek to revolutionize the election?\u201dMr. James\u2019s own group, Collective PAC, has helped underwrite Mr. Gillum\u2019s campaign, but some Graham supporters believe the organization has taken undisclosed money from Republican-leaning business interests whose intention is to torpedo her candidacy. Mr. James denied Republican involvement, but the group is not required to identify its donors in such cases, and he said two of the entities that had given to Collective did not want to be identified.Mr. Gillum also got help from the progressive billionaires George Soros and Tom Steyer but struggled to raise money on his own as an F.B.I. corruption investigation loomed over Tallahassee City Hall. He has said he is not the investigation\u2019s target, and says his lack of personal wealth is an asset when it comes to relating to regular people.\u201cHe can be a governor for the masses,\u201d said Felicia Robinson, a councilwoman in the predominantly black city of Miami Gardens, where schoolteachers at a rally for public education last week greeted Mr. Gillum with excited shrieks, frenzied selfies and the sound of the late Aretha Franklin belting out \u201cRespect\u201d over the loudspeakers.\u201cI\u2019m sick of losing,\u201d Mr. Gillum declared. \u201cI\u2019m sick of losing not because of the names that are on the ballot \u2014 I\u2019m sick of losing because of who we lose when we lose these elections: our kids, who are being told they attend failure factories. Our teachers, who are being called failures and evil.\u201dA lightning alarm blared. Mr. Gillum stepped offstage and spotted a woman dressed in her Sunday best, sitting in a folding chair under the shade of a tree. She was Ms. Robinson\u2019s mother, Carletha Robinson, 80. Mr. Gillum gave her a high-five.\u201cLet\u2019s make history right here, together,\u201d he said.Behind him, though, was the candidate who had won the endorsement of the statewide teachers\u2019 union. She took the microphone. It was Ms. Graham.Patricia Mazzei reported from Hollywood, Fla., and Jonathan Martin reported from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s War on the Justice System Threatens to Erode Trust in the Law", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 It is a once-unimaginable scenario: Sometime soon in an American courtroom, a criminal defense lawyer may argue that the prosecution of an MS-13 gang member is a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d built around a witness who has \u201cflipped\u201d and taken what the lawyer calls a plea deal of dubious legality.He will be quoting the president of the United States.That is potentially the gravest danger of President Trump\u2019s sustained verbal assault on the country\u2019s justice system, legal experts say. In his attempt at self-defense amid the swirl of legal cases and investigations involving himself, his aides and his associates, Mr. Trump is directly undermining the people and processes that are the foundation of the nation\u2019s administration of justice.The result is a president at war with the law.\u201cAt some point I may have to get involved!\u201d he warned.The most remarkable moment came when Mr. Trump attacked the very notion that prosecutors should try to \u201cflip\u201d witnesses by reaching plea agreements. In an interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the president questioned that tool, which has long been considered lawful and essential for prosecutions.\u201cI have had many friends involved in this stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal.\u201dFormer prosecutors and defense lawyers said the president\u2019s embrace of that notion \u2014 spread broadly by his bully pulpit and given a measure of validity by the office he holds \u2014 is likely to undermine trust in the justice system and weaken the government\u2019s ability to win in court.\u201cHow long will it take before a federal criminal defendant claims in court in front of a jury that the president of the United States rejects the legitimacy of cooperating witnesses and so too should jurors?\u201d said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and prosecutor. \u201cIf only one juror agrees, a dangerous criminal could walk free.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s often cynical view of the American legal system has been shaped by decades of courtroom clashes over his business decisions, his personal behavior and his aggressive pursuit of the presidency.The legal system was also the venue for infuriating and embarrassing battles with his former wives. But it has also offered tools with which to bludgeon his business adversaries or \u2014 as he is accused of doing during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 to bury unflattering stories.As president, Mr. Trump is sworn to uphold the law, but he has viewed the legal system itself as an adversary, suggesting that it be circumvented to, for instance, send migrants back home.But Mr. Conway also offered a more hopeful observation, one that was echoed this past week by several constitutional and legal scholars: Many of the country\u2019s law enforcement institutions seem to be standing up to Mr. Trump\u2019s continued abuse \u2014 at least for now. As they always have, they are pursuing hundreds of cases across the country, even as the president is fixated on only one of them.The strength of the system was underscored on Tuesday, moments after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty. Outside a courtroom in New York, Robert S. Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney, delivered a message that might have been directed squarely at the person in the Oval Office.\u201cThat message is that the rule of law applies,\u201d Mr. Khuzami said, standing in front of a phalanx of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors.Paula Duncan, a firm supporter of Mr. Trump who served on the jury that convicted Mr. Manafort, made the same point in an interview on Saturday. Although she believes that Mr. Manafort was targeted because Mr. Mueller\u2019s team hopes he is a steppingstone to Mr. Trump, she said, he was convicted because of \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence.She said it would be \u201ca great mistake\u201d if Mr. Trump pardoned Mr Manafort. If he does, \u201ceven his supporters will have questions, because it would send the message that it is O.K. to break the law,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is above the law, not even President Trump.\u201dStill, it is not clear how the president\u2019s attack on the basic structures of the American legal system will reverberate among judges, lawyers, police officers, jurors and the public in the weeks and months ahead, said Leah Litman, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Irvine.It is possible, she said, that jurors will increasingly view prosecutors through the highly charged partisan lens that Mr. Trump repeatedly employs. If that happens, she said, trust in the system will erode.\u201cIf people start to believe that all government prosecutions are politically tainted, or that you can just straight up lie or deny the facts, I don\u2019t think that is a very stable arrangement for the system of laws to exist in,\u201d Ms. Litman said.The result, she said, would be \u201ca general lack of concern for any compliance with the law, or adherence to basic norms of democratic legitimacy.\u201dAnd while the president has so far stopped short of firing Mr. Sessions or halting the inquiries that seem to be drawing nearer to him, his threats to \u201cget involved\u201d have only grown.\u201cNo matter when this all ends, Trump will have caused long-lasting damage to the ability of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to execute on its mission,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cHe is sacrificing our public safety and national security on the altar of his own ego.\u201dSharon LaFraniere contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Voters Sick of Money in Politics, a New Pitch: No PAC Money Accepted", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEXCELSIOR, Minn. \u2014 Like many political candidates, Dean Phillips spends hours each day fund-raising and thanking his donors. But because he refuses to accept PAC money from corporations, unions or other politicians, he has adopted a unique approach.\u201cNorbert?\u201d he asked on the doorstep of a man who\u2019d donated $25 to his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m here with goodies!\u201d\u201cWe desperately need to get the money out of the political system,\u201d he said in an interview afterward. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think we have a Congress that\u2019s representing the people any more.\u201dCampaign finance was once famously dismissed by Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, as being of no greater concern to American voters than \u201cstatic cling.\u201d But since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for unrestricted political spending, polls have shown that voters are growing increasingly bitter about the role of money in politics.The issue is now emerging in midterm races around the country, with dozens of Democrats rejecting donations from political action committees, or PACs, that are sponsored by corporations or industry groups. A handful of candidates, including Mr. Phillips, are going a step further and refusing to take any PAC money at all, even if it comes from labor unions or fellow Democrats.Rather than dooming the campaigns, these pledges to reject PAC money have become central selling points for voters. And for some of the candidates, the small-donor donations are adding up.In Minnesota, Mr. Phillips, a Democrat, has raised more than $2.3 million, 99 percent of it from individuals, and has used his no-PAC-money pledge to mount a formidable challenge in a district that Republicans have held since 1961. His opponent, Representative Erik Paulsen, who sits on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, has raised $3.6 million, more than half of it from PACs.In Texas, Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat running to unseat Senator Ted Cruz, has raised more than $23 million in this election cycle \u2014 considerably more than Mr. Cruz \u2014 without accepting any PAC money.\u201cIt\u2019s a major theme of the campaign,\u201d said Chris Evans, Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s communications director. \u201cPeople want to know that you are going to respond to them and their interests, and not the most recent check you received.\u201d\u201cPoll after poll is showing that money in politics has more traction today than it has had in my life time,\u201d said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a nonpartisan advocacy group concerned with ethics and accountability, who has been working on the campaign finance issue for decades.Under current federal rules, a candidate\u2019s campaign cannot accept more than $2,700 from any individual donor or $5,000 from any single PAC. Groups known as Super PACs, however, can legally receive and spend unlimited amounts to influence a race, as long as they do not coordinate their activity directly with a candidate\u2019s campaign.Frustration with corporate influence in politics was already evident during the 2016 presidential cycle. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who sought the Democratic nomination, rejected corporate PAC money, excelled at attracting small-dollar donations, and criticized the political establishment in Washington for being too beholden to the wealthy.Donald Trump also made corruption in Washington a central theme of his campaign and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of politicians who only do the bidding of their wealthy donors.Ken Buck, a Republican Congressman from Colorado, wrote a book last year called \u201cDrain the Swamp: How Washington Corruption is Worse Than You Think,\u201d detailing the way powerful posts are doled out to those who raise the most campaign money, not necessarily those with the best ideas. The cycle perpetuates itself, he wrote, as members of Congress who serve on powerful committees attract more donations for their re-election campaigns.But Republican leaders have so far not taken up the issue. And Mr. Trump routinely endorses candidates who accept large amounts of money from corporate PACs. In the recent special election in Ohio, Mr. Trump attended a rally for Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s Republican opponent, Troy Balderson, a state senator who heads an energy committee and has received more than one-third of his campaign funds from PACs, including some with ties to oil and gas companies.Democrats in Congress also routinely give leadership posts to top fund-raisers. But an increasing number of rising stars in the party have sworn off corporate PAC money including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.Candidates can do this in part because of a sharp rise in giving by small donors.In the last midterm election year, 2014, some 1.5 million small donors contributed a total of $335 million to Democratic campaigns across the country through ActBlue, an online platform that raises money for Democrats. This time around, about 3.8 million small donors have already contributed more than $1 billion, and are on a pace to exceed $1.5 billion before Election Day in November, according to Erin Hill, ActBlue\u2019s Executive director. The average donation is $33.85.That\u2019s good news for Mr. Phillips in Minnesota, who has staked his candidacy on the proposition that voters care about whom he takes money from.On the campaign trail, he ties nearly every issue back to campaign finance. When people complain to him about the high cost of drugs or health care, he tells them that corporate influence is to blame.\u201cCan anybody guess how much the big pharma industry spent on lobbying last year?\u201d he asked a group of small business owners at a round-table discussion. \u201cTake a guess.\u201dMr. Paulsen was under fire even before Mr. Phillips entered the race, because of his record of voting in lock step with President Trump. His district, the Third, has sent Republicans to Congress for six decades, but its voters chose Hillary Clinton for president.Mr. Phillips is an unlikely messenger for warnings about the corrupting influence of wealth on politics. He is the heir to a liquor fortune, as the stepson of Edward Phillips, owner of Phillips Distilling Company, which popularized luxury vodka in the United States.Mr. Paulsen\u2019s campaign has tried to make an issue of Mr. Phillips\u2019 wealth.\u201cDean Phillips is a hypocrite spending his vast inherited wealth on his campaign, which he\u2019s padded with investments in the very things he campaigns against,\u201d said John-Paul Yates, Mr. Paulsen\u2019s campaign manager.According to Federal Election Commission filings, Mr. Phillips has contributed less than $6,000 of his own money to the campaign, and given less than $30,000 worth of in-kind donations, including the use of a pontoon boat for campaigning on Lake Minnetonka.Mr. Phillips says his family fortune is what opened his eyes to the way money influences politics, after he began hearing from candidates who were eager to enlist him as a major donor.\u201cI watched the Hillary Clinton campaign, and recognized that it was so predicated on spending time with wealthy donors and not spending time in middle-class neighborhoods and rural areas,\u201d he said.Don Kuster, who said he has ticked the box for Mr. Paulsen in every previous election, now volunteers for Mr. Phillips\u2019s campaign. He drives the pontoon boat and has held a meet-the-candidate party at his home, which was attended by about sixty Republicans.\u201cI asked him \u2018What\u2019s your thing?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Campaign finance reform,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kuster recalled from his first conversation with Mr. Phillips. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not taking any PAC money. I\u2019m not taking it from the Sierra Club. I\u2019m not taking money from Planned Parenthood. I want to be able to make my own decisions.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Ok, that\u2019s something I can support.\u2019\u201dLaurie Wolfe, a college professor from Maple Grove, Minn., said Mr. Phillips\u2019s no-PAC pledge has bipartisan appeal.Ms. Wolfe is a co-chairwoman of the local chapter of Indivisible, a grass-roots network that opposes Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, but her two brothers support Mr. Trump. At family gatherings, there is often only one issue they agree on.\u201cWe need to get rid of these politicians who only care about their corporate donors and getting re-elected,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people like us find it refreshing to have a candidate that\u2019s going to the people rather than the big donors.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But what if going to bed in the wee hours is actually an advantage?It starts off with a montage of perky professionals, rising before dawn in homes and executive-class hotel rooms around the world, stretching their gym-toned bodies and firing up coffeepots at an hour usually reserved for mating fruit bats.\u201cHere\u2019s to all 180 million of you early risers, go-getters and should-be sleepers,\u201d the voice-over says, as Disney\u2019s \u201cHeigh-Ho\u201d swells in the background. \u201cBecause the ones who truly change the world are the ones who can\u2019t wait to get out in it.\u201d It\u2019s basically the idea that Ben Franklin touted more than 250 years ago \u2014 \u201cearly to bed, early to rise\u201d \u2014 with everyone else cast as lazy or self-indulgent.But what if they are wrong? What if night owls are actually the unsung geniuses? What if we are the ultimate disrupters and rule changers, the ones who are better suited to a modern, postindustrial society ruled by late-night coders, digital nomads, freelance moguls and co-working entrepreneurs?Perhaps it is finally time for the night owls of the world to rise! (Just not too early, of course.)I knew I was different by the time I was 7 or 8. My parents\u2019 efforts to get me to sleep by 7:30 p.m. were pointless. I have painful memories of those nights, lying wide-awake with the lights out, my mind whirring as I watching the minutes on my old digital clock grind by \u2014 30 minutes, 60, 90. Only my hamster Stuart shared my nocturnal proclivities, rattling along on his squeaky wheel in the darkness. Things got worse in my teens. My father, who was an extreme lark, would wake up by 6:30 a.m. and storm into my room, huffing, \u201cSociety starts at dawn,\u201d as he yanked off my bedcover. He was not wrong. Schools, office jobs and sports leagues were all designed around a lark\u2019s schedule. And there was nothing I could do about it. The notion that I could simply reset my internal wiring with a little self-discipline seemed patently false, likely damaging. Keep in mind that my sleep hygiene, to invoke a term that had not yet come into vogue, was excellent. I didn\u2019t touch alcohol or caffeine, and found it easy to avoid screen time before bedtime, since the only screen in my house was a cathode-tube television serving up dreck like \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi.\u201dAnd I have it fairly bad. My body naturally wants to go to bed around 2 a.m. and rise around 10 a.m. Whenever I try to adjust to an early schedule, my brain is like mush. Conversely, I light up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree around 9 p.m., and for the next few hours I am my most me: alert, clever, inspired to create.Not that society has ever shown much flexibility toward my sleep cycle. I have had an office job for most of my adult life, and I am now married with two children under 10, so I regularly rise by 7:30 a.m., doing my best to fake some Fred Rogers good cheer as I pack lunches and get our sons off to school. As a result, I suffer chronic sleep deficit. That is, I have a so-called sleep problem, although technically, that is not accurate. I sleep fine. It is everyone else who has a problem with it. The book details how every human runs on a 24-hour circadian rhythm, an internal clock, which coordinates a drop in body temperature, for example, as it prepares for slumber, and cranks back up when it is time to wake. What larks like my father never understood is that not everyone\u2019s clock is the same. When night owls are forced to rise early, their prefrontal cortex, which controls sophisticated thought processes and logical reasoning, \u201cremains in a disabled, or \u2018offline,\u2019 state,\u201d Dr. Walker writes. \u201cLike a cold engine in an early-morning start, it takes a long time before it warms up to operating temperature.\u201d That might even serve an evolutionary purpose. When early humans lived in small tribes, as in the early scenes of \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d staggered sleep schedules bestowed a survival advantage: Someone was always awake to watch for prowling leopards and club-wielding rivals, according to the book. But it has been downhill for us night owls ever since. The rise of agriculture brought fields to till at daybreak. The industrial revolution brought factories with 8 a.m. time clocks. Night owls were forced to adapt, and that appears to have taken a toll.I certainly know what it is like to burn the candle at both ends. When I graduated from college, I found the morning rhythms of office life to be an eye-opener \u2014 though not literally, of course. At my first job, as a newspaper reporter in Orange County, Calif., I was required to be at my desk at 8 a.m. I held that job for 14 months, taking only one week of vacation, but my body never acclimated. Night after night I would lie awake until 1 a.m. or later, freaking out about my inevitable exhaustion the next day, as the Santa Ana winds violently rustled the Italian Cypress trees outside my bedroom window. It\u2019s the old \u201cdress like your boss\u201d formula for success, but with chronotypes, not clothes. But what if the modern-day workplace no longer operates under that formula? What if being a night owl is no longer a handicap, but an asset?Tech entrepreneurs are even advertising their night owl tendencies as a status symbol. The traditional 9-to-5 workplace is starting to fall out of favor, especially in Silicon Valley and creative sectors where the workday is no longer tied to daylight hours. And, with robots and artificial intelligence further eroding the old system by taking over the routine tasks, the new workplace culture is less about punctuality and more about creativity and breaking the rules. This may not be a coincidence. The very essence of our chronotype makes us oddballs, prone to looking at life through a different lens. We are the weirdos who feel most alive skulking through the darkness, secure in the illusion that we own the world for at least a few precious hours every night while everyone else slumbers. In those wee hours, we feel the freedom to think any thought, dream any dream, safe from the scrutiny and judgment of the strait-laced world. Does that mean we are, in fact, narcissists? Perhaps. We are at least different. Maybe special. Granted, those traits may add up to embezzler as much as disrupter, but after a lifetime of hearing negatives about our chronotype, I\u2019ll take what I can get.It would certainly make my life easier if scientists somehow proved that night owls were a teensy bit smarter and a weensy bit bolder. But I don\u2019t think you have to go there to feel good about our chances. For night owls, this is huge. No longer must armies of professionals arbitrarily be rousted at daybreak, like groggy recruits heeding a bugle blowing reveille. \u201cCompanies can use the knowledge about circadian rhythms as a competitive advantage,\u201d Ms. Kring said.It is about time. Let\u2019s say the whole world finally wakes up to the idea that we night owls are more than laggards and sleepyheads.Fast-forward to 2025, say, and I settle into my seat on a Delta flight, perhaps a supersonic one, to be greeted by a new commercial. It starts off with a montage of perky professionals in executive-class hotel rooms around the world, firing up the kettle for chamomile tea and furiously tapping away at laptops as they race to meet deadlines at an hour usually reserved for James Corden\u2019s \u201cCarpool Karaoke.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s to all 180 million of you late risers, night crawlers and can\u2019t-get-to-sleepers,\u201d the voice-over says, as Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d swells in the background. \u201cBecause the ones who truly change the world are the ones who are still at it when everyone else is fast asleep.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking Back at the Economic Crash of 2008", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If journalism is the first rough draft of history, Tooze\u2019s book is the second draft. A distinguished scholar with a deep grasp of financial markets, Tooze knows that it is a challenge to gain perspective on events when they have not yet played out. He points out that a 10-year-old history of the crash of 1929 would have been written in 1939, when most of its consequences were ongoing and unresolved. But still he has persisted and produced an intelligent explanation of the mechanisms that produced the crisis and the response to it. We continue to live with the consequences of both today.Tooze calls it a problem in \u201cWestern capitalism\u201d intentionally. It was not just an American problem. When it began, many saw it as such and dumped the blame on Washington. In September 2008, as Wall Street burned, the German finance minister Peer Steinbruck explained that the collapse was centered in the United States because of America\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d laissez-faire approach. Italy\u2019s finance minister assured the world that its banking system was stable because \u201cit did not speak English.\u201dIn fact this was nonsense. One of the great strengths of Tooze\u2019s book is to demonstrate the deeply intertwined nature of the European and American financial systems. In 2006, European banks generated a third of America\u2019s riskiest privately issued mortgage-backed securities. By 2007, two-thirds of commercial paper issued was sponsored by a European financial entity. The enormous expansion of the global financial system had largely been a trans-Atlantic project, with European banks jumping in as eagerly and greedily to find new sources of profit as American banks. European regulators were as blind to the mounting problems as their American counterparts, which led to problems on a similar scale. \u201cBetween 2001 and 2006,\u201d Tooze writes, \u201cGreece, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, the U.K., France, Ireland and Spain all experienced real estate booms more severe than those that energized the United States.\u201dBut while the crisis may have been caused in both America and Europe, it was solved largely by Washington. Partly, this reflected the post-Cold War financial system, in which the dollar had become the hyperdominant global currency and, as a result, the Federal Reserve had truly become the world\u2019s central bank. But Tooze also convincingly shows that the European Central Bank mismanaged things from the start. The Fed acted aggressively and also in highly ingenious ways, becoming a guarantor of last resort to the battered balance sheets of American but also European banks. About half the liquidity support the Fed provided during the crisis went to European banks, Tooze observes.Before the rescue and even in its early stages, the global economy was falling into a bottomless abyss. In the first months after the panic on Wall Street, world trade and industrial production fell at least as fast as they did during the first months of the Great Depression. Global capital flows declined by a staggering 90 percent. The Federal Reserve, with some assistance from other central banks, arrested this decline. The Obama fiscal stimulus also helped to break the fall. Tooze points out that almost all serious analyses of the stimulus conclude that it played a significant positive role. In fact, most experts believe it ended much too soon. He also points out that large parts of the so-called Obama stimulus were the result of automatic government spending, like unemployment insurance, that would have happened no matter who was president. And finally, he notes that China, with its own gigantic stimulus, created an oasis of growth in an otherwise stagnant global economy.The rescue worked better than almost anyone imagined. It is worth recalling that none of the dangers confidently prophesied by legions of critics took place. There was no run on the dollar or American treasuries, no hyperinflation, no double-dip recession, no China crash. American banks stabilized and in fact prospered, households began saving again, growth returned slowly but surely. The governing elite did not anticipate the crisis \u2014 as few elites have over hundreds of years of capitalism. But once it happened, many of them \u2014 particularly in America \u2014 acted quickly and intelligently, and as a result another Great Depression was averted. The system worked, as Daniel Drezner notes in his own book of that title.Bannon is right. The crash brought together many forces that were around anyway \u2014 stagnant wages, widening inequality, anger about immigration and, above all, a deep distrust of elites and government \u2014 and supercharged them. The result has been a wave of nationalism, protectionism and populism in the West today. A confirmation of this can be found in the one major Western country that did not have a financial crisis and has little populism in its wake \u2014 Canada.The facts remain: No government handled the crisis better than that of the United States, which acted in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion in late 2008 and almost seamlessly coordinated policy between the outgoing Bush and incoming Obama administrations. And yet, the backlash to the bailouts has produced the most consequential result in the United States.Tooze notes in his concluding chapter that experts are considering the new vulnerabilities of a global economy with many new participants, especially the behemoth in Beijing. But instead of a challenge from an emerging China that began its rise outside the economic and political system, we are confronting a quite different problem \u2014 an erratic, unpredictable United States led by a president who seems inclined to redo or even scrap the basic architecture of the system that America has painstakingly built since 1945. How will the world handle this unexpected development? What will be its outcome? This is the current crisis that we will live through and that historians will soon analyze.Fareed Zakaria is a CNN anchor, a Washington Post columnist and the author of \u201cThe Post American World.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He offered an alternative.Opinion ColumnistJohn McCain was no moderate. He won Barry Goldwater\u2019s Arizona seat in 1986 and was, for the most part, a fitting heir to Goldwater. McCain supported a smaller federal government, a hawkish foreign policy and the typical Republican positions on abortion, guns and other issues. But McCain pursued his conservative ends through means that are depressingly rare in today\u2019s Republican Party. McCain believed in the American ideals of pluralistic democracy.He despised autocracy. He was willing to accept defeat when his side lost a political battle. He pushed for an election system not dominated by the wealthy. He came to reject racism as a political strategy. And in his dying months, McCain was one of the only Republicans to oppose President Trump not just with his words, but also with his vote.I expect the Trump presidency to end poorly for Republicans, in some combination of disgrace, unpopularity and defeat. If it does, at least some Republicans will be looking for ways to reinvent their party. They will want an antidote to Trumpism, a set of ideas that manage to be conservative and anti-Trump. What would a Republican Party more in the mold of John McCain look like? Second, a more McCain-like Republican Party would understand that racism is both immoral and, in the long term, politically ruinous. McCain had a multiracial family \u2014 the kind that is increasingly America\u2019s future. Rather than scapegoat immigrants, he took risks to pass immigration reform. After Charlottesville, he declared, \u201cWhite supremacists aren\u2019t patriots, they\u2019re traitors.\u201d Third, McCain believed in democracy and its vital, fragile institutions. He accepted his two haunting presidential defeats honorably. He has reportedly chosen the victors in those campaigns \u2014 Obama and George W. Bush \u2014 to deliver eulogies at his funeral. Most significantly, McCain fought for campaign-finance laws to reduce the influence of plutocrats.Imagine how different our politics could be if even some Republicans \u2014 \u00e0 la T.R. \u2014 occasionally took the side of the little guy against corporate behemoths. And even if you disagreed with McCain on as many issues as I did, imagine if the Republican Party ultimately came to resemble him more than Trump.Above all, McCain believed in American greatness \u2014 as a reality, not a slogan. He knew that the United States could play a unique role in the world, as a defender of freedom and human dignity. He also knew that the role was anything but assured. It required hard work, good choices, compromise and sacrifice. McCain\u2019s final message for his country was a warning: Our greatness is in peril.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bitter Regrets of a Useless Chinese Daughter", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Qian is a fiction writer from Shanghai.It wasn\u2019t until a whole week later that I found out my mother had had a stroke. She\u2019d been a typical Chinese mother about it, not telling any relatives about her illness. She didn\u2019t want to trouble anyone: She didn\u2019t tell my two cousins because she thought they were busy caring for their young child. She didn\u2019t tell me, her only child, because she didn\u2019t want me to change my plans \u2014 applying to a Ph.D. program and continuing to write fiction in English. I found out only after her health took a turn for the worse \u2014 after she went to the hospital a bit too late and didn\u2019t receive very good treatment, and I was told that she, not yet 60, would probably have trouble walking for the rest of her life.And so I set about trying to help from afar, where I soon discovered that there was still very little I could do. I tried to secure her a specialist appointment at Huashan Hospital, one of the best public hospitals in Shanghai, only to discover that they were full till the end of August. You could still make an appointment, but only if you knew somebody on the inside \u2014 only if you had enough \u201cguanxi,\u201d the network of connections and relationships that make China function. I should have had some guanxi. I\u2019m a graduate of Fudan University, the most renowned university in Shanghai; a lot of my fellow alumni are probably in the process of rising to important positions in that very hospital right now. If I had followed the advice of older family members and socialized more in college, I would have a long list of \u201cuseful friends\u201d whom I could call. I don\u2019t. I made very few friends in college, real friends, whom I bonded with based on our shared values and interests. The only friend I could think of was my dorm mate, Y.C., but like my mother, I felt reluctant to inconvenience her. She is pregnant. And I didn\u2019t want her to face the same moment of truth that I was facing \u2014 have I made \u201cuseful\u201d friends that I can ask for a favor?I had a second chance at building guanxi, one that I also let pass me by. After graduation, I taught literature at a prestigious local high school for more than five years. It was an open secret that only those who were born into privileged families could get in there. Some colleagues of mine went so far as to keep an Excel spreadsheet of all the parents\u2019 job titles and contact information, just in case. The previous principal liked to boast about the guanxi he had via those parents. \u201cWhen my father needed heart surgery,\u201d he said once in a faculty meeting, \u201cI asked my secretary to locate a parent who worked at the president\u2019s office in Huashan Hospital. And I soon found one.\u201d But over the course of my teaching career in Shanghai, I wanted to use my spare time for my fiction writing, so I refused to take on jobs that would have required frequent contact with parents outside of the classroom. Besides, I found the idea of \u201cmaking use of\u201d my students slightly distasteful. Now I regret it.A man who is courting me has tried to help, too. He asked about my mother\u2019s situation and put me in contact with his middle-school classmate, who is now an eminent vascular surgeon. \u201cLet me ask an M.B.A. classmate too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe developed an app for making online appointments with doctors.\u201d Two days later, however, his surgeon classmate hadn\u2019t responded, and my friend fell silent, ashamed of his uselessness.Without guanxi, it all boils down to money, of course. One of the best things to do would be to get my mother a good rehab nurse, since I\u2019m not around and since my father does little housework. It\u2019s not difficult to find a good nurse in Shanghai, but it will cost a great deal, and my mother would refuse such a suggestion without hesitation. As a graduate student, I am not making real money. Even worse, as a writer, I will probably never make real money. And my father, who has earned minimum wage as a janitor ever since the central government shut down state-owned enterprises in the 1990s and caused millions of layoffs nationwide, can\u2019t be of much help.Before my mother\u2019s illness, I spurned what I saw as an excess of pragmatism among Chinese people, who want to ensure that all of their efforts go toward something useful. College degrees, jobs, friendships, marriages \u2014 all these should be chosen practically. \u201cBe wise, pick an able man. Love doesn\u2019t feed you,\u201d my people like to say. Looking back on my high school years, all my relatives tried to talk me, a top-ranking student, into majoring in science or finance in college. But I was stubborn enough to stay with my favorite subject, literature. Now I understand them. They knew very well that in life, things can easily fall apart, and that those degrees are a promise of a steady, good-paying job, and perhaps a ticket to freedom, too.I know I shouldn\u2019t take everything so personally. It\u2019s China\u2019s institutions, after all, that are to blame. Why do we have so few options for good medical treatment, such limited education resources, such narrow career paths? Why do we need to be rich or have guanxi merely to enjoy access to very basic public services? Instead of desperately chasing connections or money, we should work together to address these social and political issues. My mother, too, blames herself \u2014 \u201cWhy am I getting sick at such a moment, one that might change my daughter\u2019s life?\u201d I recently spoke with her over a video call where I told her that I wanted to get her a wheelchair. \u201cI don\u2019t need one,\u201d she said. \u201cI can walk. Slowly and unsteadily.\u201d I insisted my father take a cab to run errands for my mother, but he again rode his electric bike across the city on a stifling summer day.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d my mother said, smiling through the cellphone camera lens. \u201cPursue your dream in America.\u201d I know my tears are useless. My promise is useless. Even my decision-making is useless.

The central bank set the benchmark rate for Monday\u2019s trading in Shanghai at 6.8629 renminbi to the dollar, the weakest in nearly 15 months.The renminbi has now slid more than 9 percent since mid-April, on a combination of worries about trade frictions with the United States and concerns within China itself about weakness in the economy through the spring and early summer. The Beijing government tried to rein in lending and infrastructure spending last spring in a bid to limit the country\u2019s ever-rising domestic debt, but it has largely reversed those moves since the end of July in an attempt to shore up economic growth.In early futures trading on Monday morning in Asia, the Turkish lira dropped more than 20 percent to 7.2 to the dollar, before strengthening slightly to 6.8. The plunge came after a more than 13 percent decline in the currency on Friday.In recent months, investors have become increasingly concerned about Turkey\u2019s high levels of foreign debt and the reluctance of the central bank to raise interest rates, the traditional approach when a currency comes under attack.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said repeatedly that higher interest rates will not bring down inflation. And on Sunday, he continued his criticism of those selling liras, lashing out at credit rating agencies and urging Turkish industrialists to refrain from swapping liras for other currencies.Over the weekend, Turkey\u2019s new finance minister, Berat Albayrak, said the government would put an action plan forward on Monday, but investors, after days of inaction, remained skeptical that the lira\u2019s slide would be halted.The country\u2019s main banking regulator said on Sunday that foreign exchange operations by Turkish banks could not exceed 50 percent of their equity. Turkish banks have been very aggressive in borrowing in dollars from foreign banks to lend to local companies and real estate developers.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s the timeline:In court, Mr. Cohen said he made those payments at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction. Referring to the payment to Ms. Clifford, Mr. Cohen continued: \u201cIn coordination with, and at the direction of the same candidate, I arranged to make a payment to the second individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign to keep the individual from disclosing the information.\u201dwhat was saidthe facts\u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in the recording, most likely referring to David J.

One-fifty?\u201d Mr. Trump responded. That is believed to refer to the $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal. what was saidMr. Trump: \u201cAnd by the way, he pled to two counts that aren\u2019t a crime, which nobody understands.

{"Headline": "Trump Knows Digital Ads Work. Why Don\u2019t Democrats? ", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party\u2019s campaigns are ignoring obvious opportunities to engage with voters. Mr. Collins is a board member at Tech for Campaigns.President Trump may not be up for re-election until 2020, but since May 31, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee \u2014 his re-election campaign \u2014\u00a0has spent $629,500 on advertising on Google platforms alone, making it the top spender on political ads on Google platforms. That\u2019s nearly $200,000 more than the No. 2 spender, One Nation, a right-wing organization focused on influencing Senate elections.So why are Democratic campaigns ignoring such obvious opportunities to engage with voters? I\u2019m honestly not sure; perhaps old habits are hard to break. But outdated models aren\u2019t going to win in this digital world. Unlike the Democrats, Republican candidates and right-wing organizations are prioritizing the right channels.In the average 2016 Senate general election, Republicans outspent Democrats by a three-to-one ratio on YouTube, AdWords and other Google channels. From January to June, during the primaries, this gap was even wider at 20 to one.It\u2019s even worse for down-ballot, state-level campaigns, which are under-resourced in both manpower and financial support. A typical state legislative campaign might run with an average budget of $150,000 (just 10 percent of the budget of a successful federal House race). With a smaller budget, you need to be intentional and efficient. Why spend money on TV ads, which are often aired beyond your voting district or skipped entirely with DVRs, when you could be utilizing Google AdWords and Facebook ads that can zero in on specific ZIP codes and target voters by segment or even language?Other Democrats should take a cue and double down on digital: It empowers them to reach more people with less money, engage in back-and-forth conversations with voters and test what messaging is resonating in real time. It should also prove critical in turning out a younger voting population, which often sits out midterm elections.In Silicon Valley, support for Democrats is overwhelming, so how can we be getting beaten so badly at the digital game that we largely created?Since then, the organization has grown to over 7,500 skilled volunteers, completed over 75 projects with campaigns and played a major role in the Virginia 2017 midterms \u2014 contributing to nine wins, eight of them flipping seats from red to blue. They have built an impressive infrastructure that can rapidly scale to help hundreds of campaigns this coming November and long into the future.These volunteers are defining and executing digital strategies on campaigns: running email campaigns and paid digital ad programs, creating websites, building software and tools for caucuses and campaigns that save time and serve to amplify great candidates and ideas. It might be the largest force of digital talent that Democrats have assembled anywhere, and it came together in less than one year because so many talented professionals were craving a way to make a difference.Our tech community is full of smart people who have the passion and the optimism to make a change in our electoral process. It\u2019s time for us to step up and make our own contribution to the thousands of progressive candidates who are running for change. Let\u2019s start winning the digital game that we built before it\u2019s too late.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Republican Hypocrisy Lifts Social Democrats ", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Suderman is the managing editor at Reason.com.To be a Republican is to oppose socialism. That opposition is practically encoded in the party\u2019s DNA. Yet under Republican Party rule, socialism, or at least the conversation about it, is thriving. Although true-blooded socialists \u2014 Democratic Socialists, to be precise \u2014\u00a0remain a relatively small niche within the Democratic Party, they are having a visible impact on the party\u2019s agenda, with nearly every likely 2020 presidential contender embracing Medicare for all. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign galvanized progressive support for the idea of Democratic Socialism, and this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has embraced not only the label but also a blue-sky vision of American socialism \u2014 free public college, a jobs guarantee, guaranteed family leave and more \u2014 unbound by moderate liberal worries about government overreach or overspending.But it has also been emboldened by more conventional aspects of the Republican agenda, in particular the party\u2019s astoundingly hypocritical approach to debt and deficits. You may remember a time when Republicans pretended to care about the debt and deficits. That time was not so long ago, when Barack Obama was president. Republican governance has shown how much the party actually cares about the deficit: not one bit. One can perhaps imagine a Republican Party that could defend conventional notions of fiscal responsibility with some semblance of integrity, a conservative movement that governed according to its professed principles; even some deficit doves might find such a party useful as a pragmatic counterweight to progressive ambitions. But although Republicans will surely attack the new class of Democratic Socialists and their policies as debt-increasing budget busters \u2014 that is, after all, what Republicans do \u2014 their own actions will ensure that those criticisms have no real authority. Their opposition to the socialist agenda will be hollow, because they helped make that agenda possible.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Congressional Republicans have been operating under a see-no-evil policy with President Trump: ignoring his lying, his subversions of democratic norms and his attacks on government institutions or, when that\u2019s not possible, dismissing such outrages as empty bluster \u2014 as Trump being Trump.Let\u2019s set aside, for the moment, the duty of lawmakers to the Republic and the Constitution and instead consider simple political self-interest. Even by this standard, Republicans\u2019 behavior is beginning to look like masochism if not simple madness. When members of Mr. Trump\u2019s party pooh-pooh his thuggish rantings and otherwise signal that they will overlook even his most dangerous behavior, they are inviting him to act out even more. Like a willful toddler, Mr. Trump lives to test limits. While breaking campaign finance laws may not sound as serious as, say, obstructing a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to help him get elected, it, too, violates the integrity of the American electoral system. If Mr. Trump arranged secret payments to hush up his affairs, then he conspired to deny voters information he feared would harm his electoral chances. His efforts to hide the money trail suggest he knew his behavior wasn\u2019t kosher. And while the initial payments to the women were made before Mr. Trump won the election, he didn\u2019t begin compensating Mr. Cohen until February of 2017 \u2014 thus any conspiracy was carried straight into the Oval Office. The good news is that, for the most part, the justice system seems to be dealing with the problem pretty effectively.

{"Headline": "Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtEver since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies to stay out of the world\u2019s largest internet market, especially when many of Google\u2019s American rivals happily operate under that government\u2019s intrusive rules. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.But wasn\u2019t standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Google\u2019s Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in \u2014 a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of life\u2019s information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.Activists for online freedoms worry that Google\u2019s return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown \u2014 the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.\u201cIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey should just say so \u2014 that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think it\u2019s fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.\u201dIn a statement, a Google spokesman said that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201d But the company\u2019s leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last week\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.Mr. Pichai underlined this argument \u2014 that providing some access to the outside world is better than none \u2014 by citing his experience growing up in India.\u201cMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,\u201d he told Google\u2019s staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it weren\u2019t for that.\u201dThere are other factors behind Google\u2019s potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the company\u2019s executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, na\u00efve and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.\u201cI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said. \u201cAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where the internet is going\u2019 and \u2018If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u2019 \u2014 well, that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201dIf Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Google\u2019s shift.\u201cIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,\u201d said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldn\u2019t be telling Chinese people, \u2018Here\u2019s what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201dSure, it\u2019s early, and Google\u2019s plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy China\u2019s censors without losing its soul.But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The jeweler\u2019s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said that his client was innocent and that the fraud allegations stemmed from a misunderstanding over a $40 million loan.Born in Antwerp, Belgium, to a diamond trading family, Mr. Modi branched out and launched his own line of jewelry. He rose to international prominence in 2010 when he designed a necklace with a 12.29-carat diamond set that Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong auctioned for $3.56 million, about $1 million more than its asking price.The bidding war landed Mr. Modi on the cover of the Christie\u2019s catalog; it was the first time an Indian had been featured on the front. Later that year, he formed his Nirav Modi brand and announced plans to open 100 stores around the world by 2025.The brand reached New York City in 2015 when Mr. Modi opened his flagship store on Madison Avenue, a few blocks from the luxury giants Dior and Saks. The star-studded opening saw some of his high-powered clients, including the actress Naomi Watts, as well as Donald Trump Jr. and the model Coco Rocha, on the red carpet. The next year, Mr. Modi designed 100 carats\u2019 worth of diamond jewelry that the actress Kate Winslet wore to the Oscars.But Mr. Modi\u2019s quick rise puzzled jewelers everywhere. They were surprised by how rapidly his jewelry line expanded and achieved name recognition, which they said typically takes time and major financial resources.

{"Headline": "Cuomo vs. Nixon? He\u2019d Rather Campaign Against Trump", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was a time when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo used to shy away from criticizing President Trump. No more.Now, as the governor seeks a third term, he rarely goes even a day without slinging a one-liner at Mr. Trump or threatening to sue him.He has said Mr. Trump should be \u201cashamed\u201d of the impact of separating families at the border, called on him to apologize to Puerto Rico (\u201cThey deserve more from you than paper towels\u201d) and said his joint appearance with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin would have had the founding fathers rolling over \u201cin their graves.\u201dHis rhetorical shift has far more to do with putting down an aggressive primary challenge from the activist and actress Cynthia Nixon in 2018 than any rumored presidential ambitions in 2020; one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s most recent television ads begins with the line, \u201cHe\u2019s taking on Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201dBut taking on Mr. Trump also thrusts Mr. Cuomo, whose extemporaneous speaking style can lead to verbal misfires, into the national spotlight, for better or worse.On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo, while attempting to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, said that America \u201cwas never that great.\u201dThe remark drew furious reaction from the right \u2014 it was bannered on the Drudge Report and the talk of Fox News \u2014 further cementing Mr. Cuomo\u2019s status as a left-wing villain from New York, as his staff sought to backtrack and push back simultaneously.\u201cA total meltdown!\u201d declared Mr. Trump.\u201cWe will not go back to discrimination, segregation, sexism, isolationism, racism or the KKK,\u201d Mr. Cuomo replied.For a governor known for his fixation with polls (he has spent nearly $300,000 on them since the start of 2017), the anti-Trump strategy is informed by months of focus groups and survey research, according to people involved with the campaign. Mr. Cuomo has rotated the issues he has challenged Mr. Trump on \u2014 immigration, abortion and guns most loudly of late \u2014 but the broader frame of him leading the charge against the White House has been the same.\u201cThank God for New Yorkers that we have his tenacity, his toughness, his competence and his experience because he knows how to push back,\u201d said Maggie Moran, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign manager.Ms. Nixon and other progressive activists argue the notion of Mr. Cuomo as an anti-Trump standard-bearer is risible. She pointed out this week that the day after the 2016 election, Mr. Cuomo had said the fact that Mr. Trump hailed from New York was a potential \u201cbonus.\u201d And she noted that Mr. Trump, formerly a Democrat, was once a donor to Mr. Cuomo, calling on the governor to return his money. (Mr. Cuomo has declined.)\u201cThe reality is that Cuomo is desperately trying to run against Donald Trump because he doesn\u2019t have the progressive credentials to run against me,\u201d she said on Thursday.But the governor has mostly ignored her in recent months, doing so at the urging of numerous advisers who intervened in late spring to say his aggression was damaging his own standing while elevating hers. He recently agreed to one televised debate.While Mr. Cuomo had begun to speak out directly against Mr. Trump months before Ms. Nixon emerged on the scene \u2014 especially about the tax cut legislation that targeted high-tax states like New York and the slow response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico \u2014 he has clearly turbocharged his rhetoric and focus in recent months.By early May, Mr. Cuomo was incorporating the line that \u201cNew York is the alternative state to Trump\u2019s America\u201d not just into his stump speech but his administration\u2019s daily posture.There have been cable news hits, news conferences and, in a particular Cuomo favorite, sternly worded open letters (eight since the start of July) to Mr. Trump and his administration.His tactical shift was particularly evident at an event at a Manhattan hospital last month, when he railed against \u201cTrump and his cronies\u201d for undermining the health care system. A year earlier, the governor appeared on the very same stage, with the same banner \u2014 \u201cFighting for N.Y.\u2019s Healthcare\u201d \u2014 that was used last month. Then, Mr. Cuomo had conspicuously avoided saying Mr. Trump\u2019s name.The new anti-Trump message is also being amplified by millions of dollars in television ads, with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign spending more than $5 million in the last month, according to his campaign filings.As Mr. Trump arrived in upstate New York on Monday for his first visit as president, Mr. Cuomo sniped, \u201cYou have clearly forgotten what made this country great in the first place.\u201dMr. Cuomo has mocked the president\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan before, but he has been more careful in his phrasing than his assertion on Wednesday that America \u201cwas never that great.\u201dIt was another example of the governor, who often does not read from prepared remarks, wading into uncomfortable territory. (His office\u2019s clarification that he did indeed see America as great, but that the nation had yet to achieve \u201cmaximum greatness,\u201d did not stem the outrage.)Of the governor\u2019s recent remarks about America, Ms. Nixon said, \u201cI think this is just another example of Andrew Cuomo trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile.\u201dFor her part, she has tried to outdo Mr. Cuomo on opposing Mr. Trump, calling to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and promising drivers licenses for people who are here illegally.And yet, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s pitch that he is the man to take on the president has a side benefit: It casts the tough-guy tactics that Ms. Nixon has hammered him for \u2014 she calls him \u201cAndrew the Bully\u201d \u2014 in a positive light benefiting New York.\u201cThere is a real fear amongst Democratic voters that Trump\u2019s America is not their America and that they want somebody to fight back and fight back hard and in that regard there is nobody better than Andrew Cuomo to do just that,\u201d said Ms. Moran, the governor\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cYou know he\u2019s fearless. He doesn\u2019t cower. He\u2019ll look a bully in the eye.\u201dMs. Moran called Ms. Nixon \u201cwell-intentioned.\u201d\u201cWhen we file, how we announce \u2014 that matters a lot to us,\u201d said one state attorney general, not from New York, who was involved in the case and spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive legal and political matter, adding that Mr. Cuomo unnecessarily gave the Trump administration advance notice, even if by an hour.Mostly, it was viewed as Mr. Cuomo trying to take credit for a broader legal action against the Trump administration. \u201cAmongst A.G.s, it\u2019s a collective eye-roll,\u201d the attorney general said.Advertisement"}

With Western observers still reserving judgment, it was not yet clear whether this election would pass the test and give President Mnangagwa of the governing ZANU-PF party legitimacy as a democratically chosen leader.For most Zimbabweans, who had not known any other leader than Mr. Mugabe, his ouster last year had raised expectations of a new era. But the victory by Mr. Mnangagwa, who was Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man and was behind some of his most repressive policies, underscored that power was passing from one ZANU-PF die-hard to another. Neither in Zimbabwe nor in the rest of southern Africa has a liberation party ever lost power.As the results were announced, soldiers fanned out throughout Harare to pre-empt protests.Mr. Mnangagwa, 75, won 50.8 percent of the vote compared with 44.3 percent for Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance, election officials announced. A number of other candidates split the rest of the vote.Competing against a party with a history of rigging elections, Mr. Chamisa, 40, had cast doubt on the integrity of the electoral process even before Monday\u2019s vote.When opposition supporters began protesting on Wednesday, Zimbabwe\u2019s security forces responded with the brutality they have shown over the decades under Mr. Mugabe, apparently firing live ammunition to disperse protesters. Zimbabwe\u2019s national police spokeswoman, Charity Charamba, announced the arrests of 18 people in connection with the protests.\u201cWe categorically denounce the excessive use of force against unarmed civilians and wish to urge all parties to exercise restraint,\u201d John Dramani Mahama, a former president of Ghana who led observers from Commonwealth nations, said in a statement on Thursday.Mr. Mahama pointed to both the opposition and the government for the deadly violence this week. He expressed \u201cprofound sadness at the outbreak of violence by supporters of the opposition and the excessive use of force by the security services.\u201dSupporters of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance began holding angry protests on Wednesday after their leader, Mr. Chamisa, proclaimed victory and accused election officials of manipulating the results, without offering any evidence. In addition, a top aide, Tendai Biti, accused the governing party in a news conference of plotting to assassinate him and Mr. Chamisa \u2014 again without any evidence.\u201cBoth Mnangagwa and Chamisa are power-hungry,\u201d said Kundai Chauke, a private-school teacher in Westlea, a middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Harare. \u201cThey want power at any cost. You see Mnangagwa sent the army to kill protesters because he does not want them to disturb his power. Chamisa has had protesters on the streets because he wants their noise to help him take power.\u201dThough the governing party continued to use government resources like the state news media and the army to benefit its candidates \u2014 creating what the European Union described as an \u201cunlevel playing field\u201d \u2014 Zimbabweans grew excited and optimistic about the vote. In one of the largest turnouts in the nation\u2019s history, election officials said more than 75 percent of registered voters cast ballots.\u201cWhen I voted, I was so very excited thinking the elections will bring a difference,\u201d said Jessie Mhambo, a street vendor selling cellphone cards in Westlea. \u201cBut now the same stress people had during Mugabe is back. There is no hope. We are stuck with our problems.\u201dIn a strange political realignment, Mr. Chamisa also spoke favorably on a few occasions of Mr. Mugabe, who had violently suppressed his party in the past. In 2008, Mr. Tsvangirai led in the first round of the presidential election but was forced to withdraw from a runoff after Mr. Mugabe unleashed security forces on opposition supporters.On Sunday, on the eve of the vote, Mr. Mugabe said he would vote against Mr. Mnangagwa, and indicated his preference for Mr. Chamisa. Criticized by some of his supporters for his seemingly amicable ties with Mr. Mugabe, Mr. Chamisa held a news conference to distance himself from Mr. Mugabe and to deny accusations in the state media that his campaign had been financed by the former president.Mr. Mugabe, who is now 94, was ousted in November by army leaders backing Mr. Mnangagwa. Though Mr. Mnangagwa had acted for decades as Mr. Mugabe\u2019s right-hand man, including orchestrating vote-rigging in previous elections, he has become known as a pragmatist. He has courted Western governments and investors, declaring that Zimbabwe is open for business.But foreign investors and governments have reserved judgment, waiting for the outcome of the election.Zimbabwe\u2019s economy collapsed after Mr. Mugabe encouraged the violent takeover of farms owned by white citizens in the early 2000s. Zimbabwe became a pariah in the West and was cut off from loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Western officials have said that they would consider the resumption of loans only after a credible election.Jeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley \u2014 and Won", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "FeatureMining personal data has become a trillion-dollar business \u2014 which is why activists are pushing laws to curb the practice, and why Facebook and other companies are desperate to stop them.Supported byThe way Alastair Mactaggart usually tells the story of his awakening \u2014 the way he told it even before he became the most improbable, and perhaps the most important, privacy activist in America \u2014 begins with wine and pizza in the hills above Oakland, Calif. It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "John McCain, a Last Lion of the Senate", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 John McCain was an essential element of the nation\u2019s political conversation for half a century, an ever-present figure eager to challenge friend and foe through his singular temperament \u2014 sometimes angry, often funny, always ardent.Now he is gone, leaving behind a storied life and a tear in America\u2019s political fabric at a time when national unity \u2014 always a McCain theme and ultimate goal \u2014 seems especially elusive.\u201cWe are losing someone who really, no matter who was the president, believed in the Senate\u2019s role in checks and balances,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who was a frequent traveling companion of Mr. McCain on official overseas trips. \u201cHe truly was a giant in the Senate, a towering figure and someone who really made a difference not just on policy, but in asserting the Senate\u2019s constitutional role.\u201dMr. McCain had real power, not just the kind that comes from seniority and being a committee chairman, but the kind that comes from rich \u2014 and sometimes shattering \u2014 life experiences that provide credibility and heft to positions. No one else could talk about the need to ban torture with the authority of Mr. McCain, who had been tortured during his more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And his crusade for better campaign finance laws arose from his own bitter experience as a member of the Keating Five, the group of senators exposed for interceding with bank regulators on behalf of a generous donor.He was also an institutionalist, helping lead the bipartisan Gang of 14 that in 2005 struck a deal to preserve the filibuster against judicial nominees. It was a temporary reprieve, as it would turn out, but it showcased Mr. McCain as a creature of the Senate willing to put what he saw as the fate of the chamber above more partisan interests. Mr. McCain was of the era when senators saw themselves \u2014 and their branch of the government \u2014 as independent equals of the executive, not merely an extension of it.John McCain was tremendously resilient. He endured grueling rehabilitation from his P.O.W. experience to return to the military and become naval liaison to the Senate, whetting an interest in politics that eventually took him to the House and then the Senate.As a first-term senator in 1987, he met with federal regulators on behalf of a donor and savings-and-loan chairman. The ensuing Keating Five scandal, which stretched from 1989 to 1991, was a public humiliation for Mr. McCain, a real blow to someone who lived by a stringent honor code.The only Republican implicated, he also received the most lenient finding by the ethics committee, which found him guilty of poor judgment. The televised hearings essentially ended the political careers of several of the other senators involved. But that searing experience drove Mr. McCain to become a more independent lawmaker as well as a champion of campaign finance changes intended to reduce the influence of big money in politics, and he eventually became his party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008, after a failed bid in 2000.The loss to Barack Obama that followed rocked Mr. McCain, and he returned to the Senate unhappy and somewhat at a loss. But he eventually recovered his footing and remained an outspoken force on immigration and the military \u2014 and an outspoken opponent of the Obama administration on a variety of domestic and foreign affairs issues.Few in the Senate escaped Mr. McCain\u2019s outbursts of temper, and he could be extremely cutting and dismissive to those he saw as standing in his way or offering what he considered unfounded views. During his presidential run in 2008, some of his colleagues whispered concerns that his temper was potentially disqualifying. But the episodes often quickly passed, and Mr. McCain would offer apologies.For a man who built his public reputation through close ties to journalists, he could also be up and down with the news media. But even when angry, he had a hard time keeping himself away and thoroughly enjoyed jousting with the reporters who frequented the Capitol hallways.When he first returned to Washington in July 2017 after his devastating diagnosis, reporters were encouraged to stay far away from him to avoid passing on any illness, given his weakened immune system. That lasted about a day, and soon Mr. McCain was striding through the Senate hallways as usual, trading barbs and bits of information with journalists and colleagues who were aware that their moments with him were drawing to a close.The final elections of his career marked a turn to the right for Mr. McCain as he sought to fight off the Tea Party movement, a groundswell he helped accelerate with his selection of Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential nominee in 2008. But in one of his last acts, he defied the far right \u2014 and President Trump, the man who had ridiculed his capture in Vietnam \u2014 by helping to derail the Republican drive to overturn the Affordable Care Act.Much of Mr. McCain\u2019s signature campaign finance overhaul has been undone by the courts. The nation\u2019s immigration problems remain unresolved and seem to defy legislative solutions despite his best efforts. And the famous deal to preserve the judicial filibuster has long since dissolved.But his impact on the Senate, his influence on his colleagues, and the force of his will won\u2019t be forgotten.\u201cThe lions are gone,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cThe lions of the Senate are gone. It is very sad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Garbage Pours Into Chesapeake Bay, and States Quarrel Over Whose Mess It Is", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter rain pummeled Mid-Atlantic States in recent weeks, Maryland officials publicly lamented the masses of trash flowing into Chesapeake Bay \u2014 and blamed two states to the north.One Maryland official called the pileup of woody debris, plastic bottles and broken Styrofoam an \u201caesthetic assault.\u201d Another called it an \u201cinsult\u201d to the bay and an environmental crisis that could reverse years of progress toward reducing pollution in the country\u2019s largest estuary.As destructive storms hit in late July, officials opened more than 20 floodgates in the Conowingo Dam in northern Maryland, pushing floating garbage and debris down the Susquehanna River from upstream states.But whose trash is it? And who is responsible for cleaning it up?\u201cThe upstream states, Pennsylvania and New York, need to step up and take responsibility for their sediment and their debris that is pouring into our bay,\u201d Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said at a public works meeting on Aug. 1.Maryland officials from both parties have urged upstream states and the dam\u2019s operator, Exelon Corporation, to take partial responsibility for the widespread mess. Officials said the waste that accompanied the highest water flow through the dam in seven years was not just unsightly \u2014 it was also a danger to boats that populate the bay, which is known for its commercial fishing of blue crabs and oysters.Ben Grumbles, secretary of Maryland\u2019s Department of the Environment, said that at least two million tons of sediment that had been trapped behind the dam entered the bay within days; that\u2019s more than a year\u2019s worth of sediment from the Susquehanna River under normal conditions.\u201cFrom our perspective, the polluters should pay,\u201d he said in an interview.But officials from Pennsylvania and New York have not taken kindly to Maryland\u2019s moral appeals.Last week, Patrick McDonnell, secretary of Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection, called comments by Maryland officials \u201ccareless and insensitive\u201d in light of the disastrous impact the flooding has had on his state.\u201cFinger-pointing is not something that\u2019s going to accomplish our goals,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said in an interview. \u201cWe all need to be working cooperatively together.\u201dAs for New York, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, Basil Seggos, rejected the suggestion that the state was responsible for a significant portion of the debris that flowed through the Susquehanna River and into the bay. The river, which contributes about half of the bay\u2019s fresh water, starts in Cooperstown, a village in central New York.\u201cIf the water quality of Chesapeake Bay were as high quality as the Susquehanna River\u2019s when it flows out of New York, Chesapeake Bay would not be impaired,\u201d Mr. Seggos said in a statement.There are no clear federal regulations that deal with the transfer of this kind of pollution from one state to another, causing officials to resort to an interstate war of words, said Robert Percival, a professor of environmental law at the University of Maryland.In this case, the legal foundation for compelling Pennsylvania and New York to clean up debris that flowed into Maryland\u2019s waterways is murky, he said.Federal backing for restoring the bay has been more precarious under the Trump administration.On top of concerns about future funding, Maryland officials fear that the recent deluge of debris through the Conowingo Dam has set back the cleanup process by years.Mr. Grumbles, Maryland\u2019s environmental secretary, said the long-term effort to increase the bay\u2019s water quality required contribution from all six of the states in the watershed. But he and other Maryland officials are not afraid of calling out states they believe are lagging.\u201cWhile Maryland is making progress toward meeting all of the targets, Pennsylvania is just limping along behind,\u201d Peter Franchot, Maryland\u2019s comptroller, said in an interview.Most of Pennsylvania\u2019s nitrogen load comes from agricultural runoff, which has made the decontamination effort a politically \u201cexplosive\u201d issue in the state because it involves the interests of farmers, said Mr. Percival, the environmental law professor.Mr. McDonnell said in an interview that he was aware his state was behind in reducing pollution levels, and officials there are working to address the problem.Ann Swanson, who has led the bay restoration effort for nearly 30 years, said this unusual bout of discord between the states was an unnecessary distraction from the long-term effort to rid the bay of pollutants.The concentration of debris in the bay after the record-setting rainfall was significant but not unprecedented, said Ms. Swanson, who is executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, a multistate agency that advises legislatures on bay-related policy.\u201cWe\u2019ve had big storms like this, and we\u2019ll have more big storms like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best thing we can do is continue to make progress in helping our farmers control pollutant loads and helping our cities control stormwater.\u201dMaryland isn\u2019t seeking to shift responsibility for the health of the bay only onto the upstream states.State officials say they believe that Exelon, the operator of the 90-year-old dam, should also shoulder some of the burden. In a letter sent last week to Exelon\u2019s chief executive, Christopher M. Crane, Maryland officials called on the company to provide resources to help remove the detritus from the bay.Exelon obliged, pledging to donate $25,000 to a local nonprofit working to preserve the bay, as well as offering up its contractors and employees to aid in the cleanup, according to a letter from the company to Maryland officials. Earlier this year, Exelon sued Maryland after the state required the company to reduce pollution flowing from the dam in order to renew its lease to operate the massive power generator.After seeing the masses of garbage floating in the bay, Ms. Swanson also pointed out another source of blame apart from states and corporations. \u201cEveryone who is using a plastic bottle should feel responsible,\u201d she said.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Financial Crisis Surprised Many. Except This Analyst.", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past seven years, Tim Lee has been warning that a financial crisis in Turkey would set off a wider calamity in global markets.Just about nobody listened \u2014 until now.There are signs of the rout spreading beyond Turkey. The stock prices of European banks, which have been big lenders to their Turkish counterparts, dropped sharply on Friday, with investors worried that a wave of corporate bankruptcies in Turkey would lead to a banking bust in the country. The currencies of China, Brazil and Mexico also weakened. And in the United States, major stock-market indexes fell more than 1 percent before recovering slightly.Suddenly, Mr. Lee\u2019s largely ignored prophecy \u2014 that a decade of Turkish companies and real estate developers gorging on cheap foreign debt would end badly, not just for Turkey but for the world \u2014 does not seem so outlandish.\u201cTurkey is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Mr. Lee said on Friday. \u201cWe are going have another crash that will be worse than 2008 in certain ways.\u201dThis is not a widely held view. Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, United States stock markets remain near their highs. Anxiety about trade wars with China and Europe has been largely cast aside. Even financial markets in developing countries, which tend to swoon in unison when one of their peers implodes, recently have been doing well.Mr. Lee, 58, made his initial call \u2014 that Turkey was in deep financial trouble \u2014 in 2011.He writes the newsletter, called piEconomics, from a Greenwich, Conn., office where he now works alone. The publication is simple: 10 pages of dense text supplemented with the occasional chart. His subscribers are a small cluster of European investment funds.Toward the end of 2011, Mr. Lee published an installment of the newsletter in which he predicted that Turkey would need a $100 billion bailout.At the time, central banks all over the world were pumping money into their economies, which were struggling to recuperate from the financial crisis.Mr. Lee noticed that Turkish banks were borrowing in dollars to make other loans to fast-growing Turkish companies. He also saw that, over all, Turkey\u2019s economy was growing more reliant on financing from foreign investors. It struck him as similar to what had happened to Thailand in the years before the Asian financial crisis in 1997.In his monthly notes to investors, he kept returning to the topic of Turkey and the risks there.At the time, the Turkish economy was humming. The odds of a blowup looked remote. The idea of the lira ever trading at 7.2 seemed ludicrous. It was easy for people to ignore Mr. Lee\u2019s fantastical-sounding warning.But Mr. Lee was on to something, even if his prediction was a half-decade premature. Over the next five years, the economic situation in Turkey deteriorated, as he had anticipated.One side effect of having trillions of dollars of new money sloshing around courtesy of central banks was that it became much easier for governments and companies in hot economies like Turkey\u2019s to borrow money in dollars \u2014 as opposed to their own currencies \u2014 to finance their investments or other growth plans.Today, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking trade group, corporate debt in foreign currencies is $5.5 trillion, the most ever.The threat is that as the lira loses value, it becomes more expensive for Turkish companies to repay their dollar-denominated loans. Indeed, a growing number of companies in Turkey already have said they cannot repay these loans.\u201cCompanies there just ignored all the risks and kept borrowing in dollars,\u201d Mr. Lee said.And that has the potential to spread far and wide. American investors, for example, own nearly 25 percent of outstanding Turkish bonds and more than half of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the I.I.F.Mr. Lee these days is far from the only one warning about the Turkish economy and financial system. The thing that really worries him and other bearish investors is that Turkey could be a signal for what lies ahead for assets and economies that were inflated by cheap debt.If Mr. Lee\u2019s 2011 call now looks prescient, it hasn\u2019t won him much new business.Lately, just as Turkey began its crackup, a number of his clients have left him.Yes, he might have been right on Turkey. But his persistent gloom was wearing thin, especially as the markets continued to soar.\u201cIt has been some hard sledding,\u201d Mr. Lee admitted. \u201cI have lost a lot of clients because I have been too bearish.\u201dYet he is doubling down on his doomsday message: The river of global cash will dry up, the dollar will spike and there will be a series of financial seizures. Investors, he thinks, will flee developing economies, then Europe and eventually the American stock and bond markets.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a banking crisis this time around \u2014 it will be a financial market crisis,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cAnd I am very confident that it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s High Crimes and Misdemeanors", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe principled case for impeachment is clear. What\u2019s missing is the courage.Opinion ColumnistMy reasons: First, being a terrible president and a wretched person are not impeachable offenses. Second, Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has so far produced evidence that can be interpreted as obstruction of justice, but not as clear proof. Third, impeachment in the House would be unlikely to translate into conviction in the Senate, even if Democrats win both chambers in the fall. Fourth, impeachment without conviction could strengthen Trump politically, much as it did for Bill Clinton after his own 1998 impeachment.And, like it or not, Trump remains popular with tens of millions of Americans. To overturn the results of an election for anything less than unambiguous evidence of criminal behavior is a danger to democracy itself. At least that was my view until this week. Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea changes this. The Constitution\u2019s standard for impeachment is \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d The standard is now met.Trump\u2019s longtime fixer acknowledged in court on Tuesday that he violated campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women \u201cin coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.\u201d That means Trump. That means that, as a candidate, Trump is credibly alleged to have purposefully conspired with Cohen to commit criminal acts. That means the duo did so \u201cfor purposes of influencing [an] election for Federal office,\u201d which is the legal definition of a campaign contribution.The Trumpian rebuttal to these charges is that Cohen is a sleazy lawyer and proven liar. And that the most prominent attempt to prosecute a political figure for violating campaign-finance laws \u2014 involving former Democratic senator and 2004 vice-presidential candidate John Edwards \u2014 failed in court. And that campaign-finance violations don\u2019t rise to the level of impeachable offenses, anyway.But if Cohen\u2019s lies as Trump\u2019s lawyer are one thing, lying under oath to a federal judge is quite another. Cohen\u2019s sentencing isn\u2019t until December, when he\u2019s expected to be sent to prison for up to five years. If he\u2019s being untruthful, that leaves plenty of time for any deceits to come to light. Ask yourself: Does he look like a guy eager to have his sentence doubled?As for the Edwards standard, the case failed because prosecutors could not prove that the former North Carolina senator received campaign donations from benefactors to influence an election, rather than simply cover up an embarrassing affair. In Trump\u2019s case, there is little doubt about the purpose of the payment to Stormy Daniels: To prevent disclosure of their alleged liaison, less than a month before the election and barely two weeks after the Access Hollywood tape came to light.To suggest that this doesn\u2019t amount to a felonious act also doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. The president is now, in effect, an unindicted co-conspirator on charges already prosecuted by the government as a criminal matter against Cohen. Why should a lighter standard apply to Trump, since he\u2019s the one at whose direction Cohen claims to have carried out the payments? That question should especially engage those conservatives who demanded Clinton\u2019s impeachment (as I did). Take South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, one of the House managers overseeing the case against the 42nd president.The emphases here are mine. To conservatives reading this column, ask yourselves the following questions: If breaking the law (by lying under oath) to conceal an affair was impeachable, why is breaking the law (by violating campaign-finance laws) to conceal an affair not impeachable? If \u201ccheating the electoral system\u201d (by means of a burglary) was impeachable, why is cheating the electoral system (by means of illicit hush money) not impeachable? If cheating \u201cour institutions\u201d (by means of an \u201cassault\u201d in \u201cevery way\u201d on the legal system) is impeachable, why is cheating those institutions (by means of nonstop presidential mendacity and relentless attacks on the Justice Department and the F.B.I.) not impeachable?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Safe Drinking Water for All", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia lawmakers are considering a plan to help poor communities afflicted by contaminated water. It could be a model for the nation.Ms. Firestone and Ms. De Anda run a nonprofit in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley focused on solving drinking water problems.Now, for the first time, a solution is within reach in California. State lawmakers are expected to vote this month to establish reliable funding sources to help ensure, for the first time, that all state residents have access to safe and affordable drinking water. It could be a model for other states.In 2015, the same year that the water crisis in Flint, Mich., made headlines, more than 21 million people nationwide relied on drinking water systems that violated basic legal health standards, according to the study. Throughout the country, low-income communities disproportionately bear the brunt of this crisis. In California, drinking water contamination is most likely to afflict small, low-income communities of color, particularly Latino farmworker communities that have not benefited from the tremendous economic growth in the San Francisco Bay Area and other urban centers. However, nearly every county in the state has a system without safe drinking water. In 2012, after a hard-fought grass-roots campaign, California became the first and only state to pass a right-to-water act. That bill enshrined \u201csafe, clean, affordable and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes\u201d as a basic human right. Yet more than five years later, legislators have yet to take the bold actions necessary to make that guarantee a reality.This is not just a problem in California. As the recent study in the National Academy of Sciences journal found, \u201cregulatory compliance\u201d with drinking water regulations \u201ccan be a challenge for rural systems due to limited financial resources and technical expertise.\u201d The study also noted that small systems \u201cface restricted access to loans and outside financing.\u201dNow a solution may be at hand in California. After more than a decade of intense community activism, negotiations and studies, a plan to help communities tackle drinking water problems has won the support not only of environmental justice and public health advocates but also of leaders from business, agriculture, labor and many local governments and water suppliers, though not all.The agricultural fee revenues would be targeted to address nitrate contamination from fertilizers, a common problem in farming areas. Money raised by the voluntary contributions, which would be collected from water customers unless they opt out, would be directed to disadvantaged communities suffering from water contamination caused by a range of pollutants, such as arsenic and uranium. Together, these sources are expected to raise $100 million or more a year. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Turkey\u2019s Lira Crisis Matters Outside Turkey", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are fretting about emerging markets again.Turkey is the front-burner concern at the moment, but what really is getting people\u2019s attention is the prospect that the financial problems there could spread to other fast-growing but risky countries.If history is any indication, that has the potential to quickly turn a local crisis into a global one. Or maybe not.At first glance, this seems like a problem peculiar to Turkey, as the country\u2019s economy has weakened.At the same time, Turkey\u2019s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been seizing greater control over the country\u2019s economic policy. He appointed his son-in-law as finance minister. He has made a series of pronouncements that undercut the independence of the country\u2019s central bank, railing against the prospect of high interest rates.Turkey\u2019s economy isn\u2019t all that large, so even if it were to collapse, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily have a huge impact on the global economy.In recent years, investors in wealthier parts of the world, like the United States, Europe and Japan, have lent many billions of dollars to governments and companies in developing economies like Turkey, South Africa and Argentina.That has been an attractive proposition because interest rates in the United States and other developed markets have been incredibly low, as central banks tried to nurse their economies back to health after the last recession. The higher rates on offer in countries like Turkey have acted as magnets for foreign capital.Now, with the economy of the United States strong again, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates. As a result, keeping money invested in American markets looks like a better deal, and the dollar has strengthened.The stronger dollar is bad news for foreign countries and companies that borrowed dollars. That\u2019s because currency moves are always relative. If the dollar is up, that means other currencies are down, and vice versa. A stronger dollar therefore makes it more difficult for foreigners to pay back their dollar-based loans.Turkey is far from the only country whose economy has grown reliant on foreign lending. Argentina and South Africa are in the same boat. That\u2019s why some think that the problems underway in Turkey could be the start of something bigger.Indeed, Argentina\u2019s central bank on Monday surprised markets by raising its interest rates by five percentage points. It was an attempt to prop up its currency by encouraging foreign investors to stick around.That is certainly how it\u2019s worked at times in the past. One highly indebted, fast-growing economy starts to unravel, and others tend to follow, as fearful investors rush for the exits. In most cases, those countries\u2019 economies aren\u2019t all that large, but the chain reactions they trigger in the financial markets can have global repercussions.In 1994, the Mexican government devalued the peso, setting off a period of financial instability that came to be known as the Tequila Crisis. In 1997, the collapse of the Thai baht set off a financial crisis throughout East Asia.And in 1998, the devaluation of the Russian ruble threatened to spread instability to the heart of the developed world, when it contributed to the collapse of large American hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, sending financial markets in the United States into a panic.In past crises, one way that trouble spread was through the banking system. Foreign banks lent money to companies, investors and governments in the crisis-stricken countries. As borrowers defaulted, those loans led to deep losses that threatened to undermine the health of financial systems thousands of miles away.There are echoes of that situation in today\u2019s Turkey crisis. A number of large European banks \u2014 including Italy\u2019s UniCredit, Spain\u2019s BBVA and France\u2019s BNP Paribas \u2014 own stakes in Turkish lenders. Other western banks are exposed to Turkey via loans to Turkish companies.Those banking losses might not look likely to presage a broader crisis. But if other emerging-market countries follow Turkey into trouble, the losses could worsen.\u201cThis has the potential to be a real crisis,\u201d said Gary N. Kleiman, an emerging-market investment consultant who argues that too many developing economies have taken on too much debt. \u201cBanks are overstretched, and soon you are going to see an increase in nonperforming loans. It is going to spread.\u201dOn the other hand, events that look like they could shake the foundations of the global financial system sometimes fizzle out.But the sell-offs were relatively short lived. Markets recovered, and more important, the global financial system avoided a serious crisis.Landon Thomas Jr. contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Can You Stop Interrupting?\u2019 \u2018Can You Stop Lying?\u2019 Cuomo and Nixon Clash in Debate.", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHEMPSTEAD, N.Y. \u2014 After months of shadowboxing from afar, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon clashed up close in a heated debate on Wednesday that featured sharp attacks, flashes of frustration and two competing visions for the Democratic Party and New York.They fought over standing up to President Trump, the subways, releasing their tax returns, health care policy and corruption convictions in the Cuomo administration. For much of the hour, they jabbed and counterpunched, talking over each other repeatedly and accusing each other of distortions, as Mr. Cuomo said Ms. Nixon lives in \u201cthe world of fiction.\u201d\u201cCan you stop interrupting?\u201d Mr. Cuomo said to her at one point.\u201cCan you stop lying?\u201d Ms. Nixon snapped back.Mr. Cuomo paused. \u201cAs soon as you do,\u201d he answered.The attacks and contours of the debate echoed some of the same tensions that are gripping the Democratic Party nationally in the age of Trump: namely, whether the path back to power and success must be led by seasoned political veterans or to-the-barricades outside agitators.For Ms. Nixon, the actress and activist undertaking a long-shot challenge against a two-term incumbent, the debate offered her biggest stage yet in the race, and she used the spotlight to rip Mr. Cuomo as a \u201ccorrupt corporate Democrat\u201d while promising an array of progressive policies she said he had bottled up in the last seven years.\u201cI\u2019m not an Albany insider like Governor Cuomo, but experience doesn\u2019t mean that much if you\u2019re not actually good at governing,\u201d she accused.Mr. Cuomo sought to raise doubts about Ms. Nixon\u2019s qualifications \u2014 she has never held elected office \u2014 to serve and succeed as governor, while simultaneously burnishing his own credentials.\u201cThat\u2019s the art of government. I can get it done,\u201d he said at one point. At another, he told Ms. Nixon that \u201cyou don\u2019t snap your fingers\u201d and simply make things happen.\u201cThe only caveat is if God strikes me dead,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said of not serving a full third term as governor.Nonetheless, the governor portrayed himself as a bulwark against the president, repeatedly highlighting steps he has taken to push back against White House initiatives.\u201cKnow me by my enemies,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, pointing to the president\u2019s Twitter posts about him. The president has mocked Mr. Cuomo\u2019s remark that America \u201cwas never that great,\u201d which Mr. Cuomo later revised.\u201cNo one has stood up to Donald Trump the way I have,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said.Ms. Nixon dismissed that idea entirely, quipping, \u201cYou stood up to him about as well as he stood up to Putin.\u201dNeither candidate fell into the traps the other side tried to lay in advance: She seemed versant on the issues; he didn\u2019t lose his cool or condescend uncomfortably.But the candidates disagreed on whether public workers should have the right to strike (she is in favor, he is not); single-payer health care (she is in favor, he said it should be left to the federal government); and campaign finance reform (both said they were in favor, although Ms. Nixon said Mr. Cuomo had not made any reforms as governor, and would not in a third term).Both candidates said they were in favor of postponing a subway fare increase, though they sparred repeatedly over the state of the system, as Mr. Cuomo tried to blame New York City and its mayor, Bill de Blasio, while Ms. Nixon noted the governor, not the mayor, controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. She called his argument otherwise \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\u201cHe used the M.T.A. like his A.T.M.,\u201d she said.Behind in the polls, Ms. Nixon had widely been expected to serve as the aggressor, and she was for much of the night at Hofstra University on Long Island. It was Ms. Nixon\u2019s first-ever political debate and she delivered cutting lines with comfort and ease.In the early minutes, she hit all the key elements of her campaign: the \u201cincredible corruption\u201d in the Cuomo administration; the deteriorating state of the subways; the need for more equitable education funding; and what she said was Mr. Cuomo\u2019s past support to enable Republican control of the State Senate.\u201cYou are a corporation,\u201d Mr. Cuomo accused. \u201cI am a person,\u201d she replied.The tax tactic seemed designed to blunt her broadsides on his corporate donors \u2014 he has $24.4 million in campaign cash as of the most recent report \u2014 as Ms. Nixon described her tax strategy as standard practice for small businesses.\u201cWorking men and women don\u2019t have corporations,\u201d Mr. Cuomo countered.There are just two weeks remaining in the race before an unusual Thursday election, on Sept. 13, that has both camps racing to determine who will turn out. New York is the only state in the nation this year to hold two primaries \u2014 one for federal races, and one for state and local contests \u2014 adding to the turnout X-factor.On Wednesday, Ms. Nixon said Mr. Cuomo had to be dragged to progressive positions, particularly by labor unions, specifically on the $15 minimum wage, which she said he had initially opposed.\u201cI have no idea what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d Mr. Cuomo retorted. \u201cHow am I with labor?\u201d he added, gesturing to the crowd, where some of his supporters cheered.The debate, sponsored by WCBS-TV, was the first and only time that both candidates will appear together. WCBS-TV journalists, Maurice DuBois and Marcia Kramer, served as moderators.Throughout her campaign, Ms. Nixon has made legalizing marijuana a focus, saying minority users are unfairly targeted for arrest. Mr. Cuomo has slowly moved toward her position in recent months, and revealed on Wednesday that he had \u201cexperimented with marijuana in college.\u201dThere was one rare area of agreement: Neither candidate would say they wanted the endorsement of Mr. de Blasio, who has long feuded with Mr. Cuomo.\u201cThis is a race I am running on my own,\u201d said Ms. Nixon, a friend of the mayor\u2019s.\u201cI love Mayor de Blasio,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said with a grin, adding he \u201cwouldn\u2019t tell him what to do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Crisis Exposes the Perils of Strongman Rule", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterInflationary crises, like the one looming over Turkey, are bad news for any government, but they are especially dangerous for a certain subset of authoritarians: populist strongmen.Potentially catastrophic on their own, these are symptoms of a set of weaknesses and liabilities that go beyond monetary policy to the core of populist strongman rule.Before Turkey, there Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who oversaw their country\u2019s fall from prosperity to ruin, partly by plowing into an inflationary crisis.[Listen to an episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201d about how Turkey\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism helped trigger an economic crisis.]Populist strongmen \u2014 because of their relationships to their citizens, their fellow elites and to their own policymaking apparatus \u2014 tend to be different. Mr. Maduro printed more money, worsening the crisis dramatically. A decade earlier, Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe did much the same thing, to much the same effect.Whether Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ultimately follows the same path, he already is repeating the familiar patterns of a ruler constrained and guided by his system in ways not always in the country\u2019s long-term interests.Turkey\u2019s meltdown, more than just a product of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s power grabs, is a microcosm of the pathologies inherent in his style of governing, and that of other populist strongmen. And it is a reminder that, although their system seems to be rising in the world, it comes with special risks that make it, on average, more likely to collapse.Any dictator knows that inflation \u2014 which erodes legitimacy with the public and angers powerful elites who expect payouts \u2014 can pose existential risks. Elected leaders will merely lose office (most of the time), but an authoritarian state can more easily collapse outright.In 1989, workers angered by inflation in China joined idealistic students in protests that the government answered with one of the modern era\u2019s bloodiest crackdowns.Inflation can be so dangerous for authoritarians that it can also prompt otherwise unthinkable reforms.Vietnamese leaders, worried that a run of inflation in the 1980s could bring down the communist system, shifted to a more market-based economy.Iran\u2019s inflation surge, in 2013, fed into public dissatisfaction deep enough that the hard-line supreme leader stood by as voters ushered a relative moderate into the presidency.All forms of authoritarianism are susceptible: one-party states (think China or Cuba), monarchies (Saudi Arabia) or military dictatorships (Thailand today, others in the recent past).But a strongman \u2014 a charismatic leader, consolidating power for himself and smashing institutions that might challenge him \u2014 can make such crises easier to start and harder to contain.Much of that has to do with how strongmen typically come to power: by rising within a flawed democracy or, in some cases, a military or one-party regime. This leads them to dismantle the old system, which they see as a threat. That is often where the trouble starts.\u201cInsecurity over their futures can incentivize them to make choices that are bad in the long term,\u201d said Erica Frantz, a scholar of authoritarianism who teaches at Michigan State University.As they slash away at institutions and rivals, undermining their own legitimacy, they are more desperate for growth and more panicky about seeing it slide.China has seen its share of boondoggle infrastructure projects and overinvestment. But dictatorships run by an entrenched royal, military or party bureaucracy have something that strongmen often feel compelled to destroy: institutions.Even if authoritarian institutions are hardly fair or just, they are at least predictable and can be, within limits, independent. That makes them better able to manage or forestall problems. Particularly the central bank.Strongmen like Mr. Ch\u00e1vez or Mr. Erdogan, who installed his son-in-law as finance minister, tend to meddle with their central banks, both to juice short-term growth and out of a tendency to see independent institutions as threats rather than partners. Inflation rises, a precursor of worse to come.Even if rule of law is only weakened in a few sectors, this eventually catches up with central bankers, who come to act less as independent stewards than as loyal, or fearful, cronies.Bureaucratic dictatorships like China\u2019s often try to bolster their legal systems as a way to cement their rule, even if those legal systems remain deeply flawed. But a leader like Mr. Erdogan, who purged swathes of his country\u2019s judges, tends to see the judiciary as a threat.In a more bureaucratic system, at least in theory, competence trumps loyalty. Officials are held to long-term goals and the leadership feels secure enough to learn from unwelcome economic data. It\u2019s not that such leaders are more enlightened, merely that their incentives align with long-term stability over day-to-day image management.Under a strongman-style rule, even the leaders themselves grow demonstrably less competent.In her research on how dictators behave in war, Dr. Frantz found that \u201cpersonalist dictatorships don\u2019t always have access to accurate information or insightful advice,\u201d she said, using the academic term for strongmen. By isolating themselves in a bubble of sycophantic loyalists, they set themselves up for disastrous errors.This policy of partial blindness appears to limit economic decision-making as well, she said, citing data showing that \u201cinflation rates fluctuate significantly more from one year to the next in personalist dictatorships than in other forms of dictatorship.\u201dThe result is often that strongmen do not just overspend or overborrow \u2014 they do so unwisely, erratically and with little sanity imposed from central banks or other institutions. They can careen into crises that other countries would at least try to steer around.The strongman\u2019s relationship to powerful elites may make things worse. Mr. Maduro, for instance, grew more fearful of a coup as the economy declined, so he siphoned off resources to military leaders and the handful of other powerful insiders he could count on.Strongmen, dedicated as they are to crushing rivals, tend to enjoy the support of only some members of their country\u2019s elite, so need to keep them happy. That can distort the economy, as those members often belong to sectors that were lucrative when they came up but may have grown outdated. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s zeal for construction, where much of the overborrowing took place, may be instructive.Instead, the steel barons were brought to heel \u2014 something more easily done by a vast authoritarian bureaucracy than a lone strongman who needs to worry about his inner circle. Even Saudi Arabia, a monarchy with its own collectives and institutions, though deeply troubled, has forced through changes that disfavor a certain old elite.But, as the lira plummets in value, the greatest risks are borne by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s citizens, and not only in economic terms.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rare Break for Renters: 325 Units at Waterside Plaza Could Become Affordable", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResidents used to pay well below market rates at Waterside Plaza, raising families and growing old in a middle-class Manhattan community of four residential towers on the East River. But rents soared and scores of tenants moved out after the development aged out of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program two decades ago. The surrounding Manhattan neighborhood changed, and today only about 28 percent of the apartments are still occupied by longtime residents.Most of them are older than 70, retired and paying a burdensome percentage of their incomes in rent.But they may soon get a respite.Many of those residents would get a rent freeze, some even a rent reduction, as part of a deal struck this week between New York City and the property\u2019s owner, Richard Ravitch, a real estate developer who also served as lieutenant governor and chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The agreement \u2014 a rare happy outcome for renters in today\u2019s real estate market \u2014 would preserve the affordability of 325 apartment units over the next 75 years and would effectively allow current residents to age in place in a section of Manhattan seeing increased development and an influx of young people.\u201cThis is a really unique opportunity from a preservation perspective because it is an unregulated property in downtown Manhattan,\u201d said Kim Darga, an associate commissioner of preservation at the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.The deal would end a longstanding dispute between Mr. Ravitch and some of his oldest tenants over the affordability of their apartments. The agreement is also atypical: It was reached as part of a broader deal to extend the ground lease for the property for 99 years \u2014 a plan that still needs to go through the city\u2019s public review process, and win the approval of the City Council.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for everybody,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said in an interview. \u201cThe city is pleased. The tenants are pleased.\u201dMr. Ravitch said he approached the city about two years ago to negotiate an extension of the property\u2019s ground lease in order to refinance the mortgage. In return for keeping some rents affordable, Mr. Ravitch would get a reduction in payments made to the city.\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d Mr. Ravitch said. \u201cWe\u2019re in talks with people about getting financing.\u201dResidents of Waterside Plaza \u2014 jutting into the East River from East 26th to 29th Street in Kips Bay \u2014 voted 199 to 0 in favor of the arrangement on Monday night.Waterside Plaza, the only residential complex in Manhattan east of Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, is a community unto itself that also includes 20 townhouses, a two-acre plaza, stores and the British International School of New York. The waterfront complex was built as a middle-class enclave in the 1970s under the Mitchell-Lama program, a New York State plan that spurred the construction of middle-income housing by giving developers low-interest mortgages and tax abatements. In return, rents were capped and increased only under certain conditions.\u201cMany, many people were driven out because of the rent increases,\u201d said Janet Handal, the tenant association president, who has lived at the complex since it opened in 1974. \u201cMany people would say Waterside is not affordable now.\u201dThe pending deal would address the affordability concerns of the remaining longtime tenants who managed to hold on to their apartments.Under the deal, households would get a rent freeze if their gross income is lower than 165 percent of the area\u2019s median income of $83,500 for a family of two. Households above that threshold could see modest rent increases of 2.25 percent a year, or the rate established by the Rent Guidelines Board for rent-stabilized apartments, whichever is higher. And residents who are considered rent-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income in rent, would have their rents reduced to 30 percent of their income.Norma Davis, 76, who has lived at Waterside Plaza since it opened, called the arrangement \u201cmiraculous.\u201dThe affordability of Waterside Plaza allowed Ms. Davis and her husband to raise their two children on the Manhattan waterfront, she said. But she has struggled to pay rent since the increases began, she said, and was forced to downsize when she divorced and her two children moved out. Her $2,000 rent is equal to the monthly Social Security payments she receives, so she recently returned to work part time as a medical lab technologist. She pays about half of her income in rent, she said, and under the deal she expects her rent to decrease by a few hundred dollars.\u201cThis is more of a home than any other place has ever been, and I know people here,\u201d Ms. Davis said.Mr. Powers said he hoped the city could use the deal as a model to preserve affordable housing in other Manhattan buildings, but acknowledged the agreement was largely a result of Waterside Plaza\u2019s unique history.\u201cIt\u2019s not every day that you\u2019re going to have a landlord who was a lieutenant governor,\u201d Mr. Powers said, \u201cand he cared.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He Keeps Them Close.", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "The Republican nominee for Senate in Virginia likes to engage the racial fringes of his party, creating a dilemma for mainstream G.O.P. leaders wary of his views.Supported byWOODBRIDGE, Va. \u2014 Corey Stewart stands at the end of a long driveway that leads back in time, to his 18th century plantation manor hidden in woods behind a modern housing development. Mr. Stewart, the Republican Senate nominee from Virginia, treats the brick home like a living museum, complete with buttons from Redcoats, a Civil War soldier\u2019s belt buckle and a room dedicated to George and Martha Washington, who were once visitors.This has made him a popular figure with white nationalists, much to the horror of many Virginia Republicans. While Mr. Stewart has disavowed some on the extreme right, interviews with dozens of his friends, colleagues, supporters and fellow Republicans yielded a portrait of a political opportunist eager to engage the coarsest racial fringes of his party to advance his Trumpian appeal.\u201cI don\u2019t think he said anything bad there,\u201d Mr. Stewart, 50, said during a 90-minute interview last month. \u201cIn fact I was one of the few people in the country that actually said pretty much the same thing.\u201dHe does not accept that slavery was at the heart of the Civil War.\u201cWe can debate about the causes of the Civil War,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBut the causes of it were much more complex\u201d than only slavery.\u201cThe question of what actually caused the Civil War is secondary to the result of the Civil War, which is that after the war was over, slavery was ended and the North and the South reconciled. And I think we need to respect that.\u201dHe contended that the term \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was a concoction of the left.\u201cThis term they literally resurrected, \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which hadn\u2019t been used in 100 years, or whatever it was,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s clearly a coordinated effort to \u2014 because they know the term \u2018racist\u2019 has been overused \u2014 they\u2019ve come up with another one which is \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 an equally ridiculous term.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body,\u201d Mr. Stewart said during a recent appearance. \u201cNot one. I challenge anybody to find a single racist statement that I\u2019ve ever made.\u201dIn an extraordinary sign of discomfort with Mr. Stewart, some Republicans have been eager behind the scenes to provide opposition research aimed at discrediting him, with disaffected party members circulating racially inflammatory tweets and Facebook postings authored by one of Mr. Stewart\u2019s advisers.But many Republican leaders haven\u2019t publicly disavowed Mr. Stewart, mindful that Mr. Trump is supporting him, and that the president has strong influence with the party base \u2014 many of whom supported Mr. Stewart in the primary.Virginia has not elected a Republican statewide since 2009 and voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump in 2016. With its strong economy and elite public university system, Virginia has become a symbol of Southern moderation and tolerance, but the far right sees an ally in Mr. Stewart who will push back against the leftward drift and demographic changes underway in the state.For his part, Mr. Stewart said he sees virtue in being provocative.\u201cI think you need to be edgy,\u201d he said.Even as a teenager growing up in Duluth, Mr. Stewart was known for his ambition.\u201cI had many kinds of debaters,\u201d his high school debate coach, Jack Armstrong said. \u201cCorey was a street smart debater,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cby the time he was a senior he was ranking with some of the best in the state.\u201dHe came from a family of Democrats. His father was a longshoreman who couldn\u2019t vote because of a felony conviction, Mr. Stewart said, adding it was \u201cprobably manslaughter\u201d stemming from a fatal car accident. The younger Mr. Stewart was the first in his family to graduate from college, initially attending St. Olaf College in Minnesota, then transferring to Georgetown.\u201cI wanted more,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing wrong with it, but I just wanted to see more.\u201dHe eventually became an international trade lawyer and moved to Virginia, working at Foley & Lardner, a prominent firm. In 2006 he was elected chairman of the Prince William County Board, a county outside Washington, D.C., that has become majority minority in recent years.In his politics, Mr. Stewart embraced expediency over ideology. He was initially anti-development, riding concerns about the pace of growth, then later allied with developers. Amid the county\u2019s shifting demographics \u2014 its Hispanic population tripled rapidly \u2014 he picked up on immigration as a hot button. \u201cI changed my focus to address what people were telling me their concerns were,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get elected.\u201dMany found the ease with which Mr. Stewart adopted hard-line views unsettling, starting with colleagues at work.\u201cSome of the partners at the firm didn\u2019t like that very much,\u201d Mr. Stewart said of his immigration stance, adding, \u201cit became uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got this guy who is a transplant coming into Virginia trying to out-Southern folks who\u2019ve been here for 400 years,\u201d said Brian Schoeneman, a Fairfax Republican and former legislative candidate.\u201cThe monuments weren\u2019t contentious until the left started taking them down,\u201d Mr. Stewart said, adding that \u201cthankfully those efforts seem to have subsided.\u201dHe claimed that \u201cthe ones who were most vehement in terms of taking down the monuments were not African-Americans. They were white liberals.\u201dBut Kevin Chandler, president of the state\u2019s N.A.A.C.P., called Mr. Stewart \u201ctreasonous\u201d for his embrace of the Confederate flag.\u201cIt symbolizes hate. It symbolizes white supremacy,\u201d the Rev. Chandler said. \u201cAnd something such as that should not be displayed openly in the public.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t a coincidence that this happened in my neighborhood,\u201d said Maggie Hansford, a local teacher who has decided to run for a board seat. \u201cOur chairman can\u2019t stop talking about the Confederate flag.\u201dMr. Stewart later issued a statement condemning the Klan.A \u201cCorey Stewart for Senate\u201d sign flanks the gravel driveway leading to George and Donna Randall\u2019s southern Virginia home.An avowed secessionist, Mr. Randall is eager to explain himself, welcoming a visitor onto his porch.\u201cI\u2019m a secessionist because the federal government is anti-Christian and we\u2019re different culturally,\u201d explained Mr. Randall, a retired heavy equipment operator whose forebears include Confederate veterans. \u201cThe government never surrendered, only the Army. We\u2019re still under Reconstruction.\u201dInterviews with Mr. Randall and his twin brother Gregory helped explain Mr. Stewart\u2019s appeal to his die-hard supporters.\u201cI liked Corey because he\u2019s a Trump supporter,\u201d said Gregory Randall, who plays Stonewall Jackson in Civil War re-enactments, in an interview at his home in Fredericksburg. \u201cHe\u2019s for low taxes, he\u2019s a big second amendment rights guy, he\u2019s against MS-13 and all these illegal people coming here that are committing crimes.\u201dGeorge Randall and his wife Donna have helped organize \u201cmeet and greets\u201d for Mr. Stewart. The 60-year-old brothers have been seen frequently with him and are known to provide volunteer security for Mr. Stewart at public events, a task they both confirmed, though Mr. Stewart denied it, saying \u201cthat was one of those crazy rumors.\u201dGregory was asked about anti-Semitic chanting that took place at the rally.\u201cThe only thing that I think I heard somebody say was that \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Randall. \u201cWow, is that killing somebody?\u201d\u201cCome on, it\u2019s a chant,\u201d he added. \u201cThe left chants stupid stuff all the time.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a guy that everybody supported before we all found out that he was a lunatic,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cAnd many people said very kind things about him, even President Trump and Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin and Laura Ingraham.\u201dMr. Stewart\u2019s associations with Mr. Kessler, the Charlottesville rally organizer, and Mr. Kessler\u2019s ties to a Stewart aide, Brian Landrum, have raised the most serious questions.Mr. Landrum, who also worked in Mr. Stewart\u2019s campaigns, commented only once on the chat, on May 17, with smiley emojis and profanity.In a July deposition in a dispute with the city over a proposed rally this month in Charlottesville, Mr. Kessler described Mr. Landrum as a friend. \u201cHave you had discussions with him in the last couple months?\u201d Mr. Kessler was asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.Mr. Stewart declined to comment, referring questions to Mr. Landrum, who did not return messages seeking comment. An attempt to reach him at his Woodbridge, Va., apartment resulted in a police complaint that a reporter for The New York Times entered his dwelling unlawfully, an allegation The Times has denied.Mr. Stewart brushed off questions about the company he keeps, and returned repeatedly in the interview to his love of his adopted state\u2019s heritage, and his admiration for the president.\u201cAll these attacks, on all this Kessler stuff and everything else like that, most people are just, they don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are so used to the left calling Trump and other conservatives as racists and bigots.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to back down from my controversial positions,\u201d he added. \u201cIf I were to do that my base would be gone.

{"Headline": "Did Elon Musk Violate Securities Laws With Tweet About Taking Tesla Private?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseElon Musk had better be right.At two sentences and just 53 characters \u2014 \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d \u2014 it was probably the shortest offer ever. (General Motors\u2019 prospectus in 2010 was over 230 pages.)The announcement came via Twitter at about 12:48 p.m. from Mr. Musk personally, not, as is customary, in a news release or regulatory filing from the company.Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Mr. Musk offered no basis for the $420 offering price, which would ordinarily be arrived at after reams of analysis by investment bankers and negotiations with a committee of independent Tesla directors.Given the offbeat sense of humor that Mr. Musk has sometimes displayed in his Twitter posts, there was immediate speculation that the $420 figure was a reference to a widely used numerical code \u2014 420 \u2014 that refers to marijuana. (April 20, 4/20, is celebrated by some people as a kind of national marijuana holiday.)But it was Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d statement on Twitter that may put the iconoclastic founder most at risk. He provided no details about how much funding had been secured, from whom or under what conditions. His email to employees did not mention anything about the funding.\u201cThat\u2019s a clear factual statement,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in corporate law and securities fraud. \u201cIf it\u2019s not fully secure, that\u2019s potentially a very material misrepresentation, and a very straightforward violation of Rule 10b-5\u201d of the securities law \u2014 in short, securities fraud.It is illegal for a director or officer of a public company \u201cto knowingly or recklessly make material misstatements about that company,\u201d said John Coates, a professor at Harvard Law School who teaches mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201ctweets seem cryptic at best, and it is hard to see how he has complied with his duty to not be misleadingly incomplete.\u201dA Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.The Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla on Wednesday to inquire about the accuracy of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets and why the announcement was not made in a regulatory filing, according to a person briefed on the inquiry, who was not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the S.E.C. Such questions typically precede the launch of any formal investigation.Even at a time when Twitter is the preferred medium for presidential communiqu\u00e9s, this is no way to commence a takeover bid. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cIf I assigned this scenario to my students, the list of legal issues would fill many pages.\u201dFor one thing, it is doubtful that a private Twitter account provides adequate notice for a public announcement of a $72 billion deal that is likely to move a stock\u2019s price. (By the end of the day, Tesla shares had shot up over 10 percent.)In 2013, the S.E.C. ruled, in a case involving the Netflix founder Reed Hastings, that companies can announce important news via social media as long as they have previously told investors they might do so, and simultaneously announce that news to the broader public.Mr. Hastings was not sanctioned for the relatively innocuous remark at issue in the matter: that Netflix subscribers had surpassed a viewing milestone of one billion hours. That\u2019s a far cry from Mr. Musk\u2019s announcing what would be the largest private buyout offer ever, one that could very well run afoul of the commission\u2019s guidance. (Tesla did say in a 2013 S.E.C. filing that it might use social media to make material information public.)\u201cThis approach doesn\u2019t even come close to adhering to S.E.C. rules,\u201d Professor Coffee said.Then there is the question of the price, for which Mr. Musk offered no rationale.\u201cA chief executive can\u2019t just say he\u2019s taking the company private at a price he determined, without any explanation and without any attempt to negotiate a deal,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cHe has to go to the board, which needs to appoint a special committee of independent directors, which would hire investment bankers and lawyers to help negotiate a deal. There must be some attempt at an arms-length transaction.\u201dProfessor Coates predicted a \u201cwelter\u201d of lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders and short sellers who lost money on the big jump in Tesla\u2019s stock price on Tuesday. And if the shares plunge on subsequent disclosures, disappointed buyers will sue, especially if no buyout materializes.Professor Coffee agreed. Short sellers, he noted, lost over a billion dollars on Tuesday and may be eager to sue, especially given Mr. Musk\u2019s frequently hostile comments about them. Punishing short sellers would be no justification for false or misleading statements.\u201cAnd you can be sure there will be people who sold their Tesla stock before the price ran up, who will say they didn\u2019t follow Musk on Twitter and didn\u2019t know about his tweet,\u201d Professor Coffee added. \u201cThere are plenty of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who would be happy to take that case.\u201dMr. Musk has also put the company itself in an awkward situation. \u201cIf I were their lawyer, I\u2019d tell them to have an 8-K filing at the S.E.C. the first thing in the morning,\u201d Professor Coates said, referring to a regulatory filing used to disseminate information that may be important to shareholders. \u201cIt needs to explain if this was a joke or a mistake, and if not, what he really meant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To solve them, it helps to look back at three historic diseases that science has conquered or quelled, to see how unbridled curiosity, tireless investigation and innovation have enabled some of our brightest minds to achieve scientific breakthroughs. SmallpoxThe world\u2019s first vaccine and only eradicated diseaseCan a bovine virus suppress a devastating human disease?SmallpoxThe world\u2019s first vaccine and only eradicated diseaseSmallpoxCan a bovine virus suppress a devastating human disease?Early methods to fight smallpox were born out of hearsay and desperation. One remedy called for administering beer and \u201cdrawing the bedclothes no higher than the patient\u2019s waist.\u201dBut there were also scientific approaches. As early as the 17th century, doctors had developed an inoculation method called variolation. They would transfer live smallpox matter from the skin of a smallpox patient to a healthy person, inducing a more mild and less lethal reaction than if the recipient had acquired the virus naturally. It was, however, an imperfect solution; variolated patients, while now protected against actual smallpox, could still transmit the virus.Then, in 1768, the English surgeon John Fewster made a curious epidemiological observation, says Dr. Arthur Boylston, the author of \u201cDefying Providence: Smallpox and the forgotten 18th century Medical Revolution.\u201dMany of the farmers Fewster variolated experienced no reaction to the virus. Fewster found that these patients previously had cowpox, a less fatal virus.Could a previous cowpox infection somehow prevent smallpox?Nearly three decades later, another doctor, Edward Jenner, tested Fewster\u2019s observation by vaccinating a young boy with matter from a cowpox pustule. After developing mild symptoms and recovering, the boy was inoculated with smallpox \u2014 but did not develop the disease. \u201cThis was the first time someone was able to artificially induce immunity with something that wasn\u2019t the disease itself,\u201d says Dr. Boylston. \u201cYou could argue that modern immunization derives from Jenner\u2019s use of cowpox to produce smallpox immunity.\u201dSmallpox vaccination programs spread globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox globally eradicated \u2014 the first and only eradicated disease to date.Late BlightThe plant disease that helped spur germ theoryHow did a 19th-century famine revolutionize science?Late BlightHow did a 19th-century famine revolutionize science?Many farmers attributed the devastation to bad weather or poor luck. What they did not know was that a fungal-like pathogen had infected their crops. In potato-dependent Ireland, this plant disease, called late blight, destroyed entire crops for nearly five seasons, resulting in a decade-long famine that killed more than a million people.This catastrophe led scientists to take a closer look at plant diseases and crop protection, giving rise to the field of plant pathology. In 1861, German botanist Heinrich Anton de Bary set up an experiment: He applied spores from one blighted potato to a number of healthy potatoes. Others he kept spore-free. Only the plants exposed to the fungus decayed. Though people had observed pathogens since the 17th century, de Bary was one of the first scientists to show that they were not the result of diseases but, rather, the cause of them, says William Fry, Ph.D., a professor of plant pathology and plant-microbe biology at Cornell University.\u201cDe Bary spurred a real movement to think of plant disease being caused by pathogens,\u201d says Dr. Fry. \u201cHis discovery stimulated scientists to accept the germ theory of disease, which Louis Pasteur demonstrated in the following years.\u201dLate blight has not been fully eradicated, largely because the pathogen can quickly mutate and overcome plant resistances. But de Bary\u2019s discovery nonetheless triggered major advances in the study of diseases in plants, as well as in humans and animals.Late BlightThe plant disease that helped spur germ theoryPolioBetter sanitation breeds a killerCan one vaccine prevent three types of a virus?PolioBetter sanitation breeds a killerPolioCan one vaccine prevent three types of a virus?While polio could be fatal, major outbreaks were not generally recognized until the late 19th century, when modern sanitation systems were built and public health improved in many cities. Previously, infants were commonly exposed to the virus while they were still protected by maternal antibodies, says Dr. Walter Orenstein, the associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center and a former director of the U.S. Immunization Program. But as hygiene improved, people were exposed to polio later in life, when the antibodies they received from their mothers had disappeared.  As polio epidemics killed and paralyzed tens of thousands each year, governments were desperate to find a way to prevent them. In 1953, Dr. Jonas Salk developed the first polio vaccine \u2014 an injectable, dead version of the virus. One of Dr. Salk\u2019s major contributions, says Dr. Orenstein, was discovering that there were three disease-causing versions of the poliovirus, and an effective vaccine had to protect against all of them.\u201cWe saw this again with influenza \u2014 that you have to induce immunity against multiple different strains,\u201d Dr. Orenstein says. After successful clinical trials, mass vaccination programs with Dr. Salk\u2019s vaccine began in 1955, slashing U.S. polio cases nearly 90 percent.Scientists\u2019 work wasn\u2019t done, however. In the early 1960s, Dr. Albert Sabin, concerned that an inactivated vaccine would not be as effective as an active one, developed a live oral vaccine that prevented all three types of polio. Together, Dr. Salk\u2019s and Dr. Sabin\u2019s vaccines swiftly controlled the disease in industrialized countries. But polio remained a menace in the developing world: In 1988, there were an estimated 350,000 polio cases in more than 125 countries. That year, the global eradication effort began, and thousands of health care workers helped establish mass immunization programs in high-risk areas. As a result, polio cases have decreased 99 percent globally. In 2017, there were only 22 reported cases.

Casebia Therapeutics, a joint venture between Bayer and CRISPR Therapeutics, combines Bayer\u2019s protein-engineering capabilities with CRISPR Therapeutics\u2019 breakthrough gene editing tool to research cures for inherited diseases, such as hemophilia and macular degeneration. In a separate collaboration with Versant Ventures, Bayer has formed BlueRock Therapeutics to develop stem cells that can repair heart muscles in heart attack patients and brain cells in Parkinson\u2019s patients. And in agriculture, Bayer has joined forces with Ginkgo Bioworks to form Joyn Bio, which is researching how designer microbes can help plants fertilize themselves, reducing dependence on greenhouse-gas-heavy nitrogen fertilizers.\u201cWe can address these 10 challenges by building companies around great technologies and giving them enough runway and intellectual property access to immediately get started,\u201d Dr. Bouchon says. \u201cWe want to drive a paradigm shift from treatment to cure in health care, and from industrial to sustainable in agriculture.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "An Eclectic Lineup at a Festival Dogged by Scandal", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTheater ReviewESSEN, Germany \u2014 The Ruhrtriennale, an international arts festival that reanimates the disused factories of Germany\u2019s rust belt every summer, has acquired a reputation for being ambitious, eclectic and unpredictable.This year, maybe a little too unpredictable.After other invited artists expressed outrage at the treatment of Young Fathers and threatened to cancel their appearances, Ms. Carp sheepishly asked the Scottish band back. Unsurprisingly, it rejected her renewed overtures.Since then, it has been open season on Ms. Carp and the festival she has put together. (It will run through Sept. 23.)Ms. Carp is the first woman to lead the Ruhrtriennale, which was founded in 2002 by Gerard Mortier, a former director of the Salzburg Festival. Each three-year cycle of events is curated by a single artistic director. The common denominator is the setting in the region\u2019s defunct cathedrals of industry, which lends itself to large-format experiments.Spread out over six weeks and a dozen locations, the Ruhrtriennale specializes in hard-to-categorize productions. Among Europe\u2019s summertime festivals, it is uniquely decentralized, covering an area 50 miles long and 30 miles wide.One of the most storied is the PACT Zollverein in Essen, a former coal mine and coking plant that is a Unesco world cultural heritage site. It was here that \u201cThe Factory,\u201d a play by Mohammad Al Attar, had its world premiere during the first festival week in a production by Omar Abusaada. The show is a coproduction with the Volksb\u00fchne theater in Berlin, which last season presented Mr. Abusaada and Mr. Al Attar\u2019s \u201cIphigenie,\u201d starring nonprofessional actresses who fled Syria and now live in Germany.In a festival that gives pride of place to interdisciplinary works, \u201cThe Factory\u201d was one of the few conventional plays. With torn-from-the-headlines urgency, Mr. Al Attar dramatizes the true story of the French cement manufacturer Lafarge, which operated a factory in war-torn Syria until 2014 and was recently found guilty by a Paris court of complicity in crimes against humanity and financing terrorism.In a series of Arabic-language monologues, a Syrian tycoon, an unscrupulous Syrian-Canadian businessman and a lowly factory worker present accounts of Lafarge\u2019s activities in the country to a journalist modeled after Doroth\u00e9e Myriam Kellou, whose investigation for the French newspaper Le Monde blew the lid off the scandal.Given the subject matter, one of the most compelling aspects of \u201cThe Factory\u201d was encountering it in a former industrial building. In fact, that location, enlivened by some striking directorial touches \u2014 including rubber masks that looked like cement moldings of the actors\u2019 faces and a floor littered with glowing hard hats \u2014 remained the most interesting thing about the play, which, despite some fine acting, is verbose, static and didactic. A bright spot, however, was the periodic sound of the oud, an Arabic lute strummed by Saleh Katbeh.Music played a much greater role the following evening in Christoph Marthaler\u2019s \u201cUniverse, Incomplete,\u201d a quirky exploration of the American composer Charles Ives and his incomplete \u201cUniverse Symphony.\u201d\u201cIn case I don\u2019t get to finishing this, somebody might like to try to work out the idea,\u201d Ives wrote of what was to be his magnum opus, a symphonic odyssey through past, present and future, from creation into infinity. At the time of his death, Ives left behind a jumble of sketches, which have led to several performing versions of the work.Mr. Marthaler, an acclaimed Swiss theater director, brings a markedly musical, if not outright operatic, sensibility, to the project. \u201cUniverse, Incomplete,\u201d a collaboration with the set and costume designer Anna Viebrock and the conductor Titus Engel, tries and largely succeeds at being both epic and intimate. Spread around the Jahrhunderthalle in the city of Bochum, a small group of actors, singers and dancers perform a freewheeling exploration of both Ives\u2019s own late 19th- and early 20th-century milieu and the cosmic, utopian ambitions of his \u201cUniverse Symphony.\u201d (A Tyrannosaurus rex makes a memorable cameo.)Imposing musical forces, led by a full symphony orchestra, play a potpourri of Ives songs, symphonies, marches and chamber music, often from various positions in the hall, which is how the composer wished his haunting \u201cThe Unanswered Question,\u201d one of the featured pieces, to be performed. The musicians\u2019 sheer number, revealed only late in the evening, is a startling contrast to the small acting troupe.The costumes and props sometimes bring to mind an Off Broadway production of \u201cOur Town,\u201d while the performers\u2019 movements hold the audience in a strangely hypnotic thrall. That, at least, was my take as an Ives enthusiast. Those less familiar with the composer might find the production, at two and a half hours, baffling and tedious.The day after the \u201cUniverse, Incomplete\u201d premiere, Ms. Carp appeared at a heated panel discussion on artistic freedom that was scheduled as a replacement for the Young Fathers\u2019 concert. The packed event also attracted 250 demonstrators, according to German media reports. Many of these protesters, waving Israeli flags and wearing skullcaps, tried to squeeze into the sold-out venue. Some who made it inside heckled her loudly: The atmosphere was barely civil.Ms. Carp still looked shaken that evening as she walked around a cavernous former factory in the city of Gladbeck before the premiere of \u201cKirina,\u201d a dance-theater piece created by Serge Aim\u00e9 Coulibaly, a choreographer from Burkina Faso; the Malian composer and songwriter Rokia Traor\u00e9; and the Senegalese scholar Felwine Sarr, who wrote the dialogue.A collaboration between the Ruhrtriennale and Faso Danse Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Mr. Coulibaly\u2019s company, \u201cKirina\u201d \u2014 the name refers to the site of a 13th-century battle in what is today Guinea \u2014 was a stunning spectacle that combined sweaty, ritualistic and ecstatic dance; propulsive music; and incantatory French-language narration. For 90 minutes, it was possible to forget the controversies that have dogged this festival for months, as fresh and electrifying art came to life in the onetime engine house.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Shrinking. That\u2019s a Problem for Everyone.", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe American stock market has been shrinking. It\u2019s been happening in slow motion \u2014 so slow you may not even have noticed. But by now the change is unmistakable: The market is half the size of its mid-1990s peak, and 25 percent smaller than it was in 1976.When I say \u201cshrinking,\u201d I\u2019m using a specific definition: the reduction in the number of publicly traded companies on exchanges in the United States. In the mid-1990s, there were more than 8,000 of them. By 2016, there were only 3,627, according to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Because the population of the United States has grown nearly 50 percent since 1976, the drop is even starker on a per-capita basis: There were 23 publicly listed companies for every million people in 1975, but only 11 in 2016, according to Professor Stulz.This puts the United States \u201cin bad company in terms of the percentage decrease in listings \u2014 just ahead of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the size of the United States, its economic development, financial development and its respect for shareholder rights,\u201d he added, one might expect that tally to be climbing, not falling.In his new paper, \u201cThe Shrinking Universe of Public Firms: Facts, Causes, and Consequences,\u201d Professor Stulz surveyed the body of academic research on the topic. In an interview, he said that the casual observer may not entirely grasp the implications of the changes that have taken place.\u201cThe headline is that the number of public firms is shrinking, but it\u2019s not just that,\u201d he said. Profits in the overall market are now divided among fewer winners. And as capital-intensive companies have been supplanted by those whose value is largely found in their intellectual property, the marketplace is less transparent \u2014 with troubling consequences.Consider these big shifts:\u25a0 The companies on the market today are, on average, much larger than the public corporations of decades ago. Fast-rising upstarts are harder to find.In 1975, 61.5 percent of publicly traded firms had assets worth less than $100 million, using inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars. But by 2015, that proportion had dropped to only 22.6 percent.Because of this, Professor Stulz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for the general public to invest in a diversified portfolio of really small, publicly traded companies in the way they could a few decades ago.\u201dIn theory, as a shareholder, you are entitled to a piece of a company\u2019s future earnings. That\u2019s one of the main arguments for buying stock in the first place. But the reality is that you often are buying a piece of a money-losing proposition. Aside from the top 200 companies, the rest of the market, as a whole, is burning, not earning, money.\u25a0 A quirk of accounting is at the root of some of that profit deficit, especially for smaller and younger companies. Increasingly, value resides in intellectual property \u2014 \u201cintangibles\u201d like software and data and biological design \u2014 rather than in the production of physical objects like cars.But under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which American companies must follow, research and development must be deducted from corporate income \u2014 and those charges can reduce or eliminate profits. (Capital expenditures \u2014 in physical things like factories \u2014 appear on corporate balance sheets, not income statements, and don\u2019t reduce profits.)Without deep knowledge of a company\u2019s critical research \u2014 which businesses may be reluctant to share, for competitive reasons \u2014 it\u2019s difficult for outsiders to evaluate a start-up\u2019s worth. That makes it harder to obtain funding, and it may be partly responsible for certain trends: why there are fewer initial public offerings these days, why smaller companies are being swallowed by the giants, and why so many companies remain private for longer.That creates opportunities for private equity firms, which have insider access to innovative start-ups that may never go directly to the public markets. Meanwhile, Main Street investors are consigned to a less diverse universe than they may realize.There\u2019s a broader problem. Our visibility into the inner workings of public companies isn\u2019t great, but we know far more about them than we do private companies, which aren\u2019t required to disclose nearly as much information.And these changing dynamics mean we know far less about many of the creators of American profits and jobs than would otherwise be the case.In a democracy in which corporations already have enormous clout, that is worth worrying about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Mt. Etna, Europe Makes a Last Stand for Solar", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCATANIA, Italy \u2014 The enormous glass building on the outskirts of this Sicilian city had been intended for making silicon wafers for flash memory chips. That plan got crushed by the global financial crisis.Built in the early 2000s, it was overhauled in 2011 to churn out conventional panels used to build solar farms in Greece, Italy and South Africa. Once again, the factory struggled, this time losing ground to Chinese rivals that trumped it on price, as well as on technology.Now, the facility\u2019s owner, the Italian utility Enel, is changing tack again, betting on an advanced, commercially untested system for solar panels. This time, Enel hopes it finally has what it takes to challenge the industry behemoth \u2014 China.A short distance beyond the toe of Italy\u2019s boot, Europe is making what may be its last-gasp bid to remain a player in the global solar sector.The region was an early backer of technology harnessing the sun\u2019s energy. But manufacturing of solar panels here has fallen off in the years since, as Chinese companies have cut prices and ramped up production.Enel believes that by focusing on an esoteric technology, it can afford to make panels here and avoid a price war. It hopes that its products, which can capture more energy from the sun\u2019s rays than those of rivals, will offer greater value than cheaper models.\u201cMaking solar power is not rocket science,\u201d said Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm. \u201cIt is something you can do more cheaply when you have a big manufacturing base.\u201dAt the foot of Mount Etna, Catania is known for its trove of ornate buildings fashioned from black and gray lava rock and decorated with winged cherubs. The city has also long served as an industrial and agricultural hub for Sicily, thanks in part to a busy port, which is also an entry point for thousands of migrants from North Africa, across the Mediterranean.More recently, it has fallen on harder times. And, like the city itself, the building housing the Enel factory has struggled to adapt to economic shifts. Every time it charted a path, Chinese rivals were quick to crowd it out.In the latest such instance, as prices for solar power dropped sharply in recent years, the Italian utility came to a difficult conclusion: Its panels were already a third less efficient than those developed by Chinese manufacturers, and that gap is likely to widen over time.\u201cWe said to ourselves: \u2018We have bought the company. What do we do?\u2019\u201d said Antonello Irace, the head of the Catania unit, known as EGP 3Sun.Mr. Irace eventually admitted defeat, shutting down the old production line last fall to retool the plant.Enel is spending 87.5 million euros, or about $101 million, on new equipment and other changes, of which the Italian government is chipping in \u20ac14 million. The European Union is adding an extra \u20ac9 million to help cover operating expenses.The Catania plant is likely to begin producing state-of-the-art solar panels next year, after trial runs in the coming months. It is embracing heterojunction technology, a system that has not been commercially proven. It involves adding a new, microscopic layer of silicon to solar cells, increasing their ability to gather sunlight and convert it into electricity.These new panels will also be \u201cbifacial,\u201d meaning they will be able to gather light not only directly from the sun but also from stray beams that bounce off the ground.Enel expects that panels made in the first year will be able to convert around 20 percent of sunlight to energy, which is toward the higher end of industry averages. It hopes to reach 25 percent in five years \u2014 which would help offset their higher cost.That could make a big difference in winning projects. Bids on giant solar farms worth hundreds of millions of dollars are increasingly price sensitive, and costs are falling fast.Those efforts may amount to little, however, if Enel cannot produce its panels on a larger scale, sufficient to compete with rivals from China.For now, Enel aims to produce around 500,000 panels a year, a drop in the bucket compared with its Chinese competitors. In effect, it is \u201cshipping cartons and crates,\u201d said Chris Buckland, head of technology at Lightsource BP, a British solar developer. By contrast, Chinese companies are filling \u201c40-foot containers.\u201dThe Italian utility\u2019s difficulties ramping up output point to the vastly changing fortunes of the solar sectors in Europe and China.Solar energy was largely commercialized in Europe around 20 years ago. Governments stimulated demand with generous subsidies, encouraging homeowners to install panels on their roofs and utilities to invest in larger-scale solar farms.But its popularity was limited in those early years by the high cost of the electricity that was being generated. Seeing little prospect of widespread sales, companies in the West built small factories, the largest of which had only a few hundred workers.China now makes about 65 percent of the world\u2019s solar panels, and Chinese companies build at least another 10 percent at factories in Southeast Asia, according to GTM Research, a unit of the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.Europe, by contrast, has less than a tenth of the market. Dozens of American and European companies have gone bankrupt or closed production. Factories have shut down, and equipment makers have moved to Asia.A few companies, notably Tesla, are trying to establish production lines in the West, using new technologies that Chinese factories cannot easily emulate.That is the route Enel is trying to follow in Sicily. Although heterojunction technology is not patented, Enel hopes that refinements it has made to the manufacturing process will give it a head start on rivals.\u201cWe have to manufacture modern, advanced, innovative products in their initial life cycle,\u201d said Antonio Cammisecra, the chief executive of Enel Green Power.If Enel succeeds, it will give a crucial lift to a region that has lost as much as a quarter of its industrial capacity since the financial crisis, said Armando Castronuovo, an expert on the area at the University of Catania. The city\u2019s economic backbone \u2014 agribusiness and tourism \u2014 has held up relatively well, but youth unemployment remains around 40 percent.Enel has drawn on the local university to find the advanced science graduates necessary to ensure it can continue to come up with cutting-edge technology. In all, it has preserved some 300 jobs at the plant and a nearby research center.Andrea Canino, 38, said science students like himself had benefited from close collaboration between the university and companies like Enel.Mr. Canino obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Catania in 2008, at the depths of the downturn, but managed to get work at a research institute and, later, at a small semiconductor company. Finally, in 2012, he landed his job with Enel.\u201cHere in Sicily, it is not easy to find technology work,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prepared for other possibilities.\u201dStanley Reed reported from Catania, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}

As a result, they are reluctant to allow other events that could compete with it.The involvement of so many prominent people and companies who for years maintained strong ties with China makes the decision to move the event surprising.The group did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.Its request last week came as a blow to Mr. Bloomberg, who wants to engage with China on issues such as trade and climate change.Organizers scrambled to find another site, and prominent Singaporeans agreed to host, the people familiar with planning said. The Chinese center is still expected to send some participants, but there will now be less of a focus on China, and programmers are scrambling to line up speakers after some dropped out, the people said.\u201cI think it\u2019s more clear that the increasing tensions in the U.S.-China relationship are having an impact on everything,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, the former chief of staff to Max Baucus, an ambassador to China under the Obama administration, and founder of Aperture Strategies, a public relations firm. \u201cI think Bloomberg navigated this one impressively. It\u2019s not clear that everyone can.\u201dThe strengthening of authoritarianism in China poses a dilemma for Westerners who want to engage with the country but also say that they champion liberal thought and freedoms, as Mr. Bloomberg does.In that context, some experts say, the move to Singapore could benefit the event.In Washington, some policymakers are taking a more skeptical view of business executives who maintain friendly ties with Beijing.Organizers of the event said in a statement on Wednesday that their Chinese partner had asked to postpone the conference until fall 2019 and that Singapore was then chosen for this year \u201cbecause of its position as one of the world\u2019s leading international and business hubs.\u201d The statement was posted online after queries from The New York Times.Most topics for the forum listed on the event\u2019s website are broad and innocuous \u2014 global governance, technology, urbanization, climate, inclusion and finance and capital markets. But one topic \u2014 trade \u2014 has new contentiousness associated with it.One person familiar with conversations between organizers and the Chinese center said the Chinese side did not object to the programming.In recent years, Mr. Bloomberg has generally tried to stay on friendly terms with Chinese officials, though the relationship is complicated.Yet Mr. Bloomberg is also committed to free trade and global issues that require working with China, including climate change. Both Mr. Bloomberg and Chinese leaders have separately criticized the Trump administration for withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

The Department of Education recently provided this new data on over 5,000 schools across the country in response to my Freedom of Information Act request.The new data makes clear that the federal government overlooks early warning signs by focusing solely on default rates over the first three years of repayment. That\u2019s the time period Congress requires the Department of Education to use when calculating default rates.At that time, about one-quarter of the cohort \u2014 or nearly 1.3 million borrowers \u2014 were not in default, but were either severely delinquent or not paying their loans. Two years later, many of these borrowers were either still not paying or had defaulted. Nearly 280,000 borrowers defaulted between years three and five.Federal laws attempting to keep schools accountable are not doing enough to stop loan problems. The law requires that all colleges participating in the student loan program keep their share of borrowers who default below 30 percent for three consecutive years or 40 percent in any single year. We can consider anything above 30 percent to be a \u201chigh\u201d default rate. That\u2019s a low bar.Among the group who started repaying in 2012, just 93 of their colleges had high default rates after three years and 15 were at immediate risk of losing access to aid. Two years later, after the Department of Education stopped tracking results, 636 schools had high default rates.24.9%2015AVERAGE Default Ratesby school type14.6%13.5%trackingends1010.6%trackingends8.5%55.0%trackingends02012\u201813\u201814\u201815\u201816\u201812\u201813\u201814\u201815\u201816\u201812\u201813\u201814\u201815\u201816Private nonprofitPublic collegePrivate for-profitAVERAGE Default Rates by school typePrivate for-profit24.9%Trackingends14.6%Public college13.5%10.6%Private nonprofit8.5%5.0%2012\u201813\u201814\u201815\u201816For-profit institutions have particularly awful results.

This should include losing federal aid if borrowers are not repaying their loans \u2014 even if they do not default. Loan performance should also be tracked for at least five years instead of three.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Sheehan, Prescient Counterterrorism Expert, Dies at 63", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael A. Sheehan, a former top counterterrorism official for the State Department, the Pentagon and New York City, who sounded an early, and unheeded, warning about Osama bin Laden and the dangers of Al Qaeda before 9/11, died on Monday in Bethesda, Md. He was 63.His death, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, was confirmed by his wife, Sita Graham Vasan. He had multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, she said.Mr. Sheehan, an intensely energetic man, started a counterterrorism career of more than three decades as an Army Green Beret, leading a clandestine hostage-rescue assault team in Panama in 1979. Fluent in Spanish, he later carried out antidrug and counterinsurgency missions in El Salvador, Colombia and Honduras.A year after retiring from the Army, he was named, in 1998, the State Department\u2019s chief of counterterrorism. Soon he was presciently raising alarms about Al Qaeda and its leader.Mr. Sheehan\u2019s memo outlined a series of actions the United States could take toward Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen to persuade them to help isolate Al Qaeda. The document called Pakistan pivotal to the strategy, urged Clinton aides to work with the countries to curb terrorist financing, and recommended that the United States go public if any of the governments failed to cooperate.Mr. Sheehan\u2019s plan \u201clanded with a resounding thud,\u201d one former official told The Times.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get anyone interested,\u201d the official said.Mr. Sheehan pressed on.\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to get them to hit Al Qaeda?\u201d he asked colleagues in 2000. \u201cDoes Al Qaeda have to attack the Pentagon?\u201dAfter 9/11, the administration of President George W. Bush ultimately took the steps outlined in the Sheehan memo, but the Bush White House, too, was accused of having earlier ignored warnings about the threat of attack by Al Qaeda.After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Sheehan spent two years as an assistant secretary general of the United Nations, overseeing 16 missions and 40,000 military and police personnel in peacekeeping operations around the globe.In 2003, Raymond W. Kelly, commissioner of the New York Police Department, tapped Mr. Sheehan to run the force\u2019s new counterterrorism bureau. In three years, he created one of the world\u2019s elite terror-fighting units, overseeing some 220 officers and investigators.\u201cThe foundation of N.Y.P.D.\u2019s counterterrorism program was built by Mike Sheehan,\u201d Michael O\u2019Neil, one of his top police deputies at the time, said in a telephone interview.Mr. Sheehan was searingly critical of America\u2019s post-9/11 counterterrorism strategies. In \u201cCrush the Cell: How to Defeat Terrorism Without Terrorizing Ourselves,\u201d published in 2008, he argued that the United States was relying too heavily on bloated security bureaucracies instead of fighting terrorism primarily through the combined efforts of diplomats, commandos, spies and law enforcement.Attack Qaeda and other extremists with targeted raids fueled by specific intelligence, Mr. Sheehan wrote, but avoid the terrorist trap of overreacting to the inevitable domestic strike.\u201cWe must continue to crush their cells relentlessly for another generation, but not overreact to their occasional attacks in the interim,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cTerrorists succeed when we overreact.\u201dColleagues recalled Mr. Sheehan\u2019s passion \u2014 a soldier-statesman-scholar who described himself as \u201ca door kicker\u201d and \u201ca swamp drainer\u201d (of terrorists around the world).\u201cThat sometimes made him the squeaky wheel or the cranky contrarian voice,\u201d said Nicholas Rasmussen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \u201cBut his was a voice that carried unparalleled credibility with his peers in government.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Sheehan was named an assistant secretary of defense overseeing Special Operations forces and military drone policy worldwide. After leaving the Defense Department in 2013, he became a fellow at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point and lectured and consulted.Michael Andrew Sheehan was born on Feb. 10, 1955, in Red Bank, N.J., and grew up in Hazlet, N.J., the second of seven children of John and Janet (Purcell) Sheehan. His father was a construction engineer, his mother a kindergarten teacher.He entered the Special Forces after graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1977. He received a master\u2019s degree in 1988 from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a second master\u2019s, in 1992, from the Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.The next year, while still on active duty with the Army, he joined the staff of his former Georgetown professor, Madeleine K. Albright, when she was United States ambassador to the United Nations; he focused largely on peacekeeping issues. (Ms. Albright was later secretary of state in the Clinton administration.) He retired from the military in 1997 as a lieutenant colonel.Mr. Sheehan\u2019s first marriage, to Maria Eitel, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, of 18 years, whom he met on a blind date to play tennis, he is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Eitel, from his first marriage; a son, Michael V. Sheehan, from his second marriage; and his father, three brothers and two sisters.In his final weeks, friends and colleagues say, Mr. Sheehan was brimming with enthusiasm about a new e-textbook that he was writing for United States Military Academy cadets, an assessment on Afghanistan that he was writing for the State Department and a draft of a new security strategy for the 21st century.Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism scholar at Georgetown University, said of Mr. Sheehan, \u201cHe was always looking for new angles and new perspectives to solve problems.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "6 Takeaways From Michael Cohen\u2019s Guilty Plea", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaking matters more arcane, some of these purported crimes overlapped, the government said.Mr. Cohen, for instance, was said to have used a fraudulently obtained home-equity loan to pay off one of the women, a pornographic film star, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels.The charging documents describe a universe of shady dealings and unsavory characters. None of the revelations seem helpful to Mr. Trump.Here are six takeaways from what happened in court \u2014 and what was disclosed in court papers.She had what she believed was a hot story, the government said: the tale of her alleged affair with Mr. Trump.Court papers say Mr. Pecker and an editor at the National Enquirer then reached out to Mr. Cohen, putting him in touch with Keith Davidson, a Los Angeles lawyer who was representing Ms. Clifford. Over the next few days, the papers claim, Mr. Cohen negotiated a deal to pay Ms. Clifford $130,000 to keep her silent about the affair.By Oct. 25, however, just two weeks before voters would go to the polls, the deal had not been signed yet, the government said. And even worse, prosecutors claim, Mr. Davidson was threatening to take his client and her scoop to another publication.It was at that point, court papers say, that the unnamed editor from the National Enquirer sent Mr. Cohen a text message, saying, \u201cWe have to coordinate something on the matter\u201d or \u201cit could look awfully bad for everyone.\u201dNot long after, prosecutors said, the editor and Mr. Pecker called Mr. Cohen on an encrypted phone application, and Mr. Cohen agreed to make the payment.The very next day, the government said, Mr. Cohen withdrew $131,000 from the fraudulent home-equity loan he had gotten that year and placed it into the account of a shell company he had created, Essential Consultants LLC.Then, on Oct. 27, in an effort to influence the 2016 presidential election, prosecutors say, he wired $130,000 to Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Davidson, apparently keeping the extra $1,000 for himself.The plea agreement between Michael D. Cohen and prosecutors along with the charges to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty.In August that year, the National Enquirer struck a deal with Ms. McDougal and Mr. Davidson to purchase what court papers called the \u201climited life rights\u201d to her story of infidelity.In exchange, the government said, the National Enquirer agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 and promised to feature her on two of its covers and to publish more than 100 articles she wrote.Mr. Cohen was also part of this deal, prosecutors claim, and to facilitate it, he created another shell company called Resolution Consultants LLC.But before the agreement was consummated, court papers say, the National Enquirer\u2019s owner, Mr. Pecker, told Mr. Cohen to tear it up.Mr. Cohen, however, did not tear it up, the government said.The paperwork was later found by federal agents when they performed \u201ca judicially authorized search\u201d of Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, prosecutors said.Much of the 22-page criminal information detailing Mr. Cohen\u2019s alleged legal violations involved false statements he is said to have made to banks.Beginning in 2010, Mr. Cohen began to rack up debts with one bank that ultimately totaled about $20 million, according to court papers.But his problems started in earnest in 2013, the government said, when he successfully applied, through a different bank, for a mortgage for an apartment on Park Avenue and claimed in his paperwork that he only owed the first bank $6.4 million in outstanding loans.He neglected to mention he was also on the hook for another $14 million in lines of credit, according to court documents.Compounding his troubles, the government said, Mr. Cohen also tried to buy an $8.5 million summer home in 2015 and, once again, never disclosed his line of credit. When the second bank questioned him about the $14 million he owed, he \u201cmisled\u201d it, prosecutors said, saying he had closed the line of credit in 2014.In December 2015, Mr. Cohen asked the bank for more money \u2014 this time for a $500,000 home-equity loan, the government said. (The same one he is accused of having used to pay Ms. Clifford.)From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.In getting the loan, court papers say, Mr. Cohen \u201csignificantly understated\u201d his debt and falsely represented that he was worth more than $40 million at the time.Mr. Cohen had been involved in the taxi business for years, the government said, earning millions of dollars by leasing taxi medallions to operators in Chicago and New York who paid him a portion of their income.He also made money, prosecutors said, by offering what amounted to a total of $6 million in personal loans to one taxi operator and collecting interest.The problem was, the government said, Mr. Cohen did not pay taxes on much of the money he made from the medallions and the loans.Instead, the government said, he hid millions of dollars in profits in his and his wife\u2019s bank accounts and failed to tell his personal accountant.Mr. Cohen not only disguised the income he earned from his taxi business, prosecutors said, but he also failed to disclose $100,000 he made in 2014 from brokering the sale of a piece of property in \u201ca private aviation community\u201d in Ocala, Fla., and another $30,000 he made from brokering the sale of a Birkin bag, \u201ca highly coveted French handbag,\u201d the government explained.Then there was the $200,000 in consulting fees that he took in and did not disclose as income from working with \u201can assisted living company,\u201d prosecutors said, which he gave advice to about real-estate deals.At the moment, it\u2019s hard to say.Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea agreement with the prosecutors in Manhattan does not require him to cooperate with other pending investigations. But it also does not preclude him in telling what he knows about Mr. Trump to investigators working with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is looking into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Mr. Cohen\u2019s agreement with the government contains a provision that could allow him to receive a significantly reduced sentence. If Mr. Cohen were to substantially assist the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Mr. Mueller could recommend a reduction.Looming over negotiations between prosecutors and Mr. Cohen has been the possibility of a presidential pardon.By striking a deal with Mr. Cohen that includes prison time, federal authorities were aware of the risk that the president might pardon him.But the president has given no indication that he was leaning toward one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethan Hawke Is Still Taking Ethan Hawke Extremely Seriously", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "The critics used to hate him, but he worked in defiance of them. Now they\u2019re rapturous, and he\u2019s not sure what to do.Supported byMr. Hawke found that so moving, the idea of ignoring what the world was telling you about yourself and instead living only by standards that you had, yourself, carefully defined for your life and work. He vowed right then that he would do whatever it took to make good art on his own terms, no matter what anyone said. He would take himself seriously, even if no one else did.He\u2019d had his first starring role by then \u2014 in \u201cExplorers,\u201d when he was 14. By the time he was 20, he\u2019d already starred in \u201cWhite Fang\u201d and \u201cDead Poets Society.\u201d But he didn\u2019t just want to be a movie star. He started a theater company in 1991 called Malaparte with his friends, but the world didn\u2019t quite know how to react to his kaleidoscope ambitions. He debuted on Broadway in 1992 in \u201cThe Seagull,\u201d and The New York Times said he played Konstantin with an \u201carm-waving display of unfocused nervous energy.\u201d Variety determined that he gave the \u201csingle truly ineffective performance\u201d in 2003\u2019s \u201cHenry IV\u201d: \u201cMovie actor Ethan Hawke is simply out of his depth.\u201d Movie actor! The Chicago Tribune said his Macbeth in 2013 was a \u201ctragic hero without drive.\u201d I can\u2019t even bear to print what The New York Post said about his \u201cClive\u201d that very same year.Anytime he showed ambition outside the avenue of mainstream matinee idoldom, it was the same thing. In 1998, The Times said of \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d \u201cMr. Hawke seldom registers anything more interesting than astonishment at Finn\u2019s good fortune.\u201d Of his Hamlet in 2000, The Times wrote, \u201cMr. Hawke\u2019s moping slows things down too much.\u201d Variety wrote, \u201cThis slacker prince forms a sinkhole at the center of adaptor-helmer Michael Almereyda\u2019s otherwise compelling contempo update.\u201dHe wrote a novel, \u201cThe Hottest State,\u201d which Kirkus determined was \u201cclumsily written\u201d and \u201ctakes itself very seriously.\u201d The movie adaptation that he directed was similarly panned, with The Boston Globe writing that \u201cHawke has the instincts of an actor rather than a director\u201d; The Times described it as \u201cnearly two hours long, with a tenuous narrative continuity.\u201dO.K. Fine. But he never forgot Cassavetes. He never forgot that it was entirely possible that people wouldn\u2019t appreciate your work while you were doing it. That they might appreciate it only long after you were dead. Or maybe even never! But that didn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it. The critics \u2014 the ones who called him pretentious and too earnest and too overly serious for a movie star \u2014 became a force he worked in contrast to, a dark shadow that rode alongside him. He learned to defy them, if not ignore them. He learned to let them remind him what he was supposed to be, which is an artist, which is someone who tells the truth, not just a puppet who dances to please his audience in a series of films that resemble the one he just did.He wrote two more novels, thank you very much, plus a graphic novel called \u201cIndeh\u201d about the Apache nations. He continued to mount plays. He directed a music video, then a movie, then another, thank you very much again. He helped write the sequels to \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d \u2014 \u201cBefore Sunset\u201d in 2004, while his own marriage to Uma Thurman was \u201ccollapsing and I took all of that and put it into that movie\u201d; and \u201cBefore Midnight\u201d in 2013. He earned Oscar nominations for best adapted screenplay for both, thank you very much.He learned to look at the world that way: that the striving was the work of being an artist, that every good thing would lead to another good thing, that being taken too seriously at first might doom you in some ways but that taking yourself seriously means that at least one person takes you seriously.He never really thought about what would happen when and if he ever got to the point where he no longer had to fight. He never really thought that day would come.As it happened, one of Ms. Hawke\u2019s childhood friends was married to Ben Dickey, a folk musician who bore a strong resemblance to Foley. Back during New Year\u2019s 2016, Mr. Hawke and Mr. Dickey had been drinking, and Mr. Dickey pulled out a guitar and began to sing the Blaze Foley song \u201cClay Pigeons.\u201d He was sad; his own band was dead, and he sang it in a particular, mournful way, and it was as if Blaze Foley himself were in that room. That night, Mr. Hawke asked if he\u2019d ever consider starring in a movie about Foley. Mr. Dickey hadn\u2019t acted before, but yes, he\u2019d do it.Mr. Hawke wrote the screenplay with Sybil Rosen, Foley\u2019s former romantic partner, and the author of a memoir of her time with him, \u201cLiving in the Woods in a Tree.\u201d They shot the film, a \u201cgonzo country western opera,\u201d as Mr. Hawke called it, last summer in Baton Rouge, La. They\u2019d find old cars driving through town, and they\u2019d give the drivers $50 to drive back and forth through a scene so that they\u2019d have 1982 Cutlasses in the background of a shot. He bought a \u201973 pickup truck that they\u2019d drive to the set every day in case of a problem \u2014 if you look in the background the truck \u201cdrives through the movie about 90,000 times.\u201dHe wanted the set to feel like a Sunday afternoon, where you wake up late and decide to \u201clisten to music and watercolor while you watch a football game or something like that.\u201d He wanted the stakes to feel low even though they weren\u2019t. He told Mr. Dickey that they\u2019d be spending the first week just doing screen tests, and Mr. Hawke would let the camera run while Mr. Dickey and Alia Shawkat, who played Ms. Rosen, sat and talked. But they weren\u2019t screen tests. Mr. Hawke was making his movie.He\u2019d never been part of a successful project that used improv before. People think the \u201cBefore\u201d trilogy is all improv, though absolutely none of it is. \u201cCassavetes, Charles Bukowski, Jack Kerouac and Richard Linklater have all inspired more bad art because they make it look so easy,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, oh, \u2018I\u2019ll just write a novel about my friends, it\u2019ll be great.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll just write a poem about being hung over.\u2019\u201dThe movie cost about $1.2 million to make, a figure he didn\u2019t really want to give me. He hates when filmmakers brag about how little they spent. \u201cIt actually doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s either good or it\u2019s not good.\u201d Robert Altman\u2019s \u201cNashville\u201d is brilliant and made for cheap, he said, but also \u201cBlade Runner\u201d is brilliant and it cost a ton of money, so what are you really asking?Over the years, he\u2019d somehow worn his critics down with his earnestness and his dedication and his sincerity \u2014 the same things that caused the ridicule in the first place. Then there was the patronizing surprise that the acting, the directing, the writing wasn\u2019t as bad as one would imagine. And now \u2014 now! Now here he was, a nearly 100 percent surefire Oscar contender for his performance as a pastor in this spring\u2019s \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d the kind of role he would never even dream of asking to audition for 10 years ago. \u201cBlaze\u201d is entering theaters attached to early reviews that offer no qualifiers when they mention their admiration for it and its director.By the time he sat down with me in July at a restaurant in Brooklyn, near his home, he didn\u2019t even have to appear in his own movie to get it into festivals. His pursuits had become markedly unchallenged. He was able to do the work he wanted to do without any resistance. The battle that defined the first part of his life was won. And Mr. Hawke, with no tide to fight against, found himself happy and satisfied. Maybe. O.K., not truly. Because if he was honest, well, now what?\u201cDead Poets Society\u201d wasn\u2019t his first movie, but it was the one that made him a star: 1989, 18 years old, and the offers just start coming in. He drops out of college. He does \u201cMystery Date.\u201d He announces that he\u2019s going to start Malaparte. He does \u201cA Midnight Clear.\u201d He\u2019s going to use the money from those movies to mount a newly translated Pirandello play. His mother, who had him when she was 18 in Austin, Tex., and raised him herself from a young age on the East Coast, worked so hard to give him a chance at life \u2014 she can\u2019t stop crying. Sure, she\u2019s supportive, but all she ever wanted was his solvency, and he\u2019s putting the first money he\u2019s earned into the paper shredder known as Off Off Broadway. She doesn\u2019t understand that he was balancing out his universe with the necessary corrections that a handsome (he will only cop to \u201cphotogenic\u201d) man with a soul must make.He has the 20-something actors he needs for the play. Thing is, they need a man in his 50s. Someone suggests Austin Pendleton, one of the \u201cmagic elves that run through the bloodstream\u201d of the theater world in New York. He\u2019d worked with Orson Welles and Olympia Dukakis and Blythe Danner. So Mr. Pendleton agrees to do it, and Mr. Hawke watches his process and his performance. He learns something from Mr. Pendleton for sure that he\u2019d only guessed at instinctively: that there is the true value of a performance, and that value is wildly overinflated when you\u2019re extremely good-looking and have a few hits behind you.He\u2019s just real, Mr. Hawke said now. \u201cHe\u2019s a real actor. And when you listen to him talk about art and the value of performance and what it means when you can be a part of this other realm where consciousness exists and it actually doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s Madison Square Garden or a 90-seat house, or whether it\u2019s published in a \u2019zine or at Random House. It doesn\u2019t matter. Ideas have energy and meaning. It was really inspiring.\u201dHe began to live a kind of penance for his good luck and his good looks. Anyone who has spent enough time downtown in the last 20 years will tell you they\u2019ve seen Mr. Hawke somewhere around, looking slightly unwashed and underdressed for whatever the situation. He learned to telegraph to the world that he wasn\u2019t vain and guarded like other handsome actors. Maybe he looked like a movie star, but he had the beating heart of an artist.(Even now, sitting with me at the restaurant, he wore a trucker hat over hair that maybe hadn\u2019t been shampooed that day, and maybe not the day before, either. He wore yellow-tinted aviator glasses that he took off and put on periodically, though it was hard to discern if they were for distance or reading; it mostly felt like he took them off when he was finally comfortable enough to let me look at him directly.)He couldn\u2019t get Austin Pendleton \u2014 and the Austin Pendletons of the world \u2014 off his mind. There was something enviable about creating art without introducing wholesale commerce into it \u2014 doing what you wanted to do in front of as large an audience as possible before the audience and conditions compromise the work. You can be a rock star playing stadiums, or you can be someone playing his guitar in the subway station. \u201cAnd you can play for people, and some businessman stops and he sits there and cries while he listens to the song you wrote, and it\u2019s a meaningful exchange. You\u2019ve made your art.\u201dCould he possibly use his position as one of the anointed photogenic talents to even the field out a little? He could do a movie for money, then use some of the money to fund a new project that wouldn\u2019t otherwise get off the ground. Or he could use his status as a Person Whom People Like to See Onscreen to get movies that didn\u2019t stand a chance off the ground.He could take, say, a \u201cGetaway\u201d or a \u201cSinister\u201d and know that it would buy him the juice to help, say, a \u201cBefore the Devil Knows You\u2019re Dead\u201d or a \u201cWaking Life\u201d get made. He could do \u201cThe Purge\u201d and use the money to make \u201cSeymour: An Introduction.\u201d He could use his box office notoriety to help get \u201cMaudie\u201d with Sally Hawkins made, or \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan\u201d with pre-\u201cLady Bird\u201d Greta Gerwig.Richard Linklater, who directed Mr. Hawke in \u201cBoyhood\u201d and the \u201cBefore\u201d trilogy, said Mr. Hawke has had this instinct since the earliest days of his career. When he was casting \u201cBefore Sunrise,\u201d he remembers that Mr. Hawke was \u201creally at that moment getting offered everything from Hollywood, but here he is talking to an indie film guy about going to Vienna and doing a film for no money, super low budget, that he thinks probably won\u2019t work, and would take a huge effort to make it work as a film. Ethan has turned down a lot of fame, in Hollywood terms.\u201dBy the time 2012 came along, and Anthony Lane, the New Yorker movie critic whom he admires, wrote a nasty review of \u201cSinister,\u201d saying not a bad word about Mr. Hawke \u2014 in fact, he talked about how such a terrible movie is unfair to someone with the kind of talent Mr. Hawke has \u2014 he no longer cared what people thought of his trajectory. He thought he\u2019d like to go to dinner with Mr. Lane and ask him, \u201cDo you know it is hard to grow up?\u201d What was Mr. Lane doing with his life that\u2019s so interesting? Did Mr. Lane know how many people told Mr. Hawke how much joy that movie gave them? How could Mr. Lane not notice the thread that all the projects had in common was that he never phoned in a performance, that he brought the same work ethic to everything, no matter how high or low? How could Mr. Lane not know it\u2019s all worth taking seriously? What is more serious than art? What is more serious than a person?See, he finally figured out how to exist as an artist in contrast to the noise, just the way he wanted to. But just like that, the minute he figured it all out, it changed again.Yes, he knows Gary Coleman had a medical condition. Don\u2019t miss the point. Mr. Hawke was so focused on getting to adulthood, he didn\u2019t realize that he\u2019d done it and had no real model for how to do what came next. It was looking like he was going to live longer than any of his heroes \u2014 than Elvis or John Lennon. Even Townes Van Zandt, whom he fell in love with in his 20s, was 52 when he died. Fifty-two used to seem so old to him.Mr. Hawke was frozen. He was afraid. He couldn\u2019t perform. He couldn\u2019t figure out how to be or what he wanted. He thought his career was over. Well, he\u2019d had some fun; he\u2019d done what he could. He\u2019d worked longer than a lot of his friends who started out at the same time. Maybe he could just write novels now.That\u2019s when he met Seymour Bernstein, who had been a friend\u2019s piano teacher. Mr. Hawke told him about his stage fright. He told Mr. Hawke, \u201cMost artists are not nervous enough. You\u2019re reaching a point where now your awareness of death is increased at such a point that you are aware, painfully aware, of how important this moment is. This, you will never return to right now, and if this doesn\u2019t go well, it matters.\u201dHere\u2019s something. It\u2019s a little on the nose, he knows that, but it\u2019s true, and sometimes a condition of things that are true is that they\u2019re also a little on the nose: A few years ago, Mr. Hawke had a dream he hasn\u2019t been able to shake. He\u2019s in a dressing room at a theater, and Liam Neeson opens the door and congratulates him. \u201cYou\u2019re crushing it, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going great. Get out there, give them hell.\u201d Mr. Hawke thanks him, Mr. Neeson leaves, then Helen Mirren walks in. She\u2019s being flirty with him, and says, \u201cFirst act was amazing.\u201d She leaves, too. Then the prop guy comes by and Mr. Hawke says, \u201cWhat play is this?\u201d And the prop guy laughs and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ethan, you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d And Mr. Hawke says, \u201cNo, seriously, what play is it?\u201d He looks around. There are like five different costumes. His heart is racing. He remembers that Mr. Neeson was close to getting the teacher role in \u201cDead Poets Society.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s why Mr. Neeson is in the dream, or if it\u2019s because he, like Ms. Mirren, has had a surprisingly interesting second half of a career. Still, it makes no sense and he still doesn\u2019t know what play he\u2019s in. Mr. Neeson calls for him, says the second act is about to start. He looks at Mr. Neeson, he looks out at the house.That\u2019s when he wakes up. He lies in bed, blinking into the darkness, not quite sure exactly what to do next. But then, after a few minutes, he gets up and goes to work.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the surname of an actress pictured with Ethan Hawke. She is Tyne Daly, not Daley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Far America Has Fallen", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe thing with every shocking revelation about Trump is that it's already baked into his image. I've never met a Trump supporter who did not know exactly who he is.Opinion ColumnistThat\u2019s the bit of the United States the rest of the world finds hardest to fathom. Why the scorn for handouts, the equating of universal health care with socialism, the obsession with self-reliance, the refusal to see that a profusion of guns leads to a profusion of mass shootings? Of course a crowded Europe with its wounds seeks solidarity in the name of stability, while America with its wide-open spaces embraces the right to be left alone (at least until you need Medicaid) and the right, whatever its risks, to the next frontier.I said it\u2019s different in the West. It\u2019s not so different in the West, it\u2019s just that you see more clearly what the country stood for in its own mythologized self-image, what it was to be an American, what it was to aspire to some new and exemplary measure of freedom, and how far things have fallen to produce President Donald Trump.No part of the country today is immune to American fracture or the squalid Trump wars, to cultural confrontations over identity and gender and race, to the effects of stagnant incomes over decades, or to the narcissism of modernity.In a purple state, unlike in Brooklyn, N.Y., or Palo Alto, Calif., these differences press in on each other. Conversations occur that break through ideological lines. Grand Junction, in western Colorado, voted for Trump at the last election. There, I spoke to Robert Babcox, a pastor, who praised the president for sticking to his campaign promises and, \u201cfor all the bravado,\u201d getting the economy revved up.Words don\u2019t kill, I said. Some things are worse than death, he said. So, I asked, Trump\u2019s great? No, the pastor said. He only trusted Trump \u201cto a degree.\u201d Someone should take away his cellphone, he said. Americans can come together, he said, praising John F. Kennedy. \u201cI served in the Navy,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw so many taken before their time \u2014 white, black, Hispanic. It all hurt me just the same, and they all bled red, and that lesson stayed with me.\u201dIt\u2019s also why the itch to believe that the moment has come when everything starts to unravel must be viewed warily. Sure, Trump sounds more desperate. But who\u2019s the enforcer if Trump has broken the law? It\u2019s Congress \u2014 and until things change there (which could happen in November) or Republicans at last abandon a policy of hold-my-nose opportunism, Trump will ride out the storm.Trump was a symptom, not a cause. The problem is way deeper than him.For William Steding, a diplomatic historian living in Colorado, American individualism has morphed into narcissism, perfectibility into entitlement, and exceptionalism into hubris. Out of that, and more, came the insidious malignancy of Trump. It will not be extirpated overnight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fact Check on Cuomo-Nixon Debate: Who Stretched the Truth?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHEMPSTEAD, N.Y. \u2014 The lone debate in the Democratic primary pitting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo against his challenger, Cynthia Nixon, featured its fair share of brickbats and bon mots. Here\u2019s a quick look at some of the candidates\u2019 statements, and when they may have stretched the truth.Mr. Cuomo has seemingly sought to make the race less about Ms. Nixon and more about President Trump, who has dismal approval ratings in his home state. Mr. Cuomo said that he was \u201cin a fight\u201d with Mr. Trump and said that the president uses Twitter to attack him \u201cweekly.\u201d \u201cKnow me by my enemies,\u201d the governor said in the early moments of the debate.Mr. Cuomo has countered that he has made a record investment in the M.T.A., and that New York City needs to pay its fair share for the repairs on the ailing system. Ms. Nixon argued strenuously that Mr. Cuomo had allowed the subways to deteriorate, saying he \u201cstole hundreds of millions\u201d of dollars from the system. \u201cHe used the M.T.A. like an A.T.M.,\u201d Ms. Nixon said.Mr. Cuomo aggressively and repeatedly attacked Ms. Nixon over her tax returns, saying at one point that \u201conly Donald Trump has done less transparency than my opponent\u201d and accusing her of only putting out the returns late in the campaign for three hours \u201con a Friday.\u201dWhile that might qualify as a loophole, it is also legal. Ms. Nixon also noted that Mr. Cuomo had not released his taxes during his 2010 run for governor.In 2014, several major unions \u2014 including the New York State United Teachers, the Public Employees Federation, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u2014 declined to back his bid for a second term; the P.E.F. endorsed his primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration has been buffeted by the dual-barreled convictions of one of his closest aides and friends, Joseph Percoco, and the overseer of his most prominent economic development program, Alain E. Kaloyeros.Ms. Nixon\u2019s suggestion that Mr. Cuomo might have known about the misdeeds of Mr. Percoco, however, seems unsupported by the facts: Federal prosecutors who tried the former aide never accused Mr. Cuomo of wrongdoing.Mr. Cuomo said that he had wanted campaign finance reform and other ethics reforms, but had been stymied by a Republican Senate. While that is technically true, Mr. Cuomo had long tolerated a group of rogue Democrats in that chamber, the Independent Democratic Conference, who collaborated with the Republicans to help them rule the Senate.Ms. Nixon also pointed out that the governor has been a frequent beneficiary of the so-called \u201cL.L.C. loophole,\u201d which allows limited liability companies to contribute an almost unlimited amount to political campaigns.Ms. Nixon defended her request as \u201ca favor to the people of New York.\u201dMr. Cuomo then suggested that Ms. Nixon used her clout to help Sarah Jessica Parker, her friend and co-star in \u201cSex and the City.\u201d\u201cHow about for the teahouse for Sarah Jessica Parker, that wasn\u2019t a favor?\u201d the governor said.Tyler Pager reported from New York.Advertisement"}

Mr. Turnbull could yet be turned out of office as rivals rally support for another challenge as soon as Thursday. If that happens, he will be the third Australian prime minister in the last decade to lose the position over a climate dispute.Total campaign contributions are extremely hard to track in Australia \u2014 a lack of transparency that serves big business well \u2014 but in the narrow band of reported spending, coal industry lobbyists poured roughly $3.6 million ($5 million Australian) into campaigns last year as the energy debate intensified.Four of the country\u2019s main environmental groups \u2014 Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, Environment Victoria and the Sunrise Project \u2014 spent just $135,000 combined ($183,000 Australian).\u201cIf you look at lobby lane, who is always around, it\u2019s the Minerals Council by a country mile,\u201d said Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand how dominant it\u2019s been here.\u201d\u201cThe Europeans think we\u2019re crazy,\u201d she added. \u201cWho\u2019s got more solar, who\u2019s got more tidal power than us? It just goes to show the strength of that particular group.\u201dThe trend of hyper-partisanship has not helped. Just as climate and energy issues in the United States create a toxic divide, with many on the right opposing anything the left supports \u2014 including well-established science \u2014 any mention of emissions control tends to create an anaphylactic reaction among Australian conservatives.The arguments differ. Some make a case for free markets, despite subsidies granted to fossil fuel companies, or they say action works only when all nations act. Others, like Mr. Turnbull\u2019s opponents this time, emphasize local priorities such as reduced energy prices for consumers.The reaction to emissions management nonetheless tends to be universal, at least on the far right.\u201cConservatives just see red when anything like a price or tax on carbon is introduced,\u201d said Bruce Wolpe, the chief of staff for Julia Gillard, the former prime minister who passed such a plan only to see it dismantled after losing an election to Tony Abbott. \u201cThat has become as powerful a driver here as it is in America.\u201dScientists all over the world have become increasingly disappointed in the country\u2019s climate policies.Some climate scientists were only a bit less emotional and argumentative.\u201cThe scientific community in Australia is unified in knowing that climate change is a problem and will become a bigger problem,\u201d said James W. Porter, a professor of ecology at the University of Georgia, specializing in the biology and ecology of coral reefs. \u201cThe government of Australia, on the other hand, has the same problems as the government in the United States and other developed countries, in that some conservative politicians don\u2019t want to believe in facts.\u201dWhat are some of those facts?Australia\u2019s climate has now warmed by 1 degree Celsius since 1910, she said.\u201cThis makes our climate even more extreme than it otherwise would be,\u201d she said. \u201cOur droughts are getting hotter, our heat waves have become more intense and our bush fire season is now extending into winter.\u201dThe bleaching and damage to roughly half the Great Barrier Reef \u201cis not a natural disaster,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is one of the clearest signals that our planet is warming.\u201dFarmers see their own problems looming, and even those undecided about the cause of the drought are fed up with the political bickering.\u201cIt\u2019s another example of politicians looking after themselves and not looking after the country,\u201d said Charles Alder, the chief executive of Rural Aid, a group that helps drought-affected farmers.When and if the moment comes, Dr. Gergis said, \u201cbipartisan climate change policy will be a defining moment in Australian politics.\u201dRick Rojas contributed reporting from Sydney, and Livia Albeck-Ripka from New York.Rick Rojas contributed reporting from Sydney, and Livia Albeck-Ripka from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Erdogan Faces a Challenge He Can\u2019t Easily Bully: Turkey\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long made clear that he considered no part of Turkish life beyond his reach, not least the economy.Now Turkey\u2019s worst economic crisis since 2001 \u2014 the currency hit another new low on Monday \u2014 has confronted Mr. Erdogan with the limits of his authoritarian approach and could end his long run of success.Turkey\u2019s economic troubles, analysts say, are largely of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s own making. They have less to do with his dispute with the United States and the prospect of greater sanctions than with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s deepening economic interference as he attempts to bend the logic of monetary policy and global financial markets to suit his political purposes.Yet while Mr. Erdogan asserts greater control over life in Turkey \u2014 including the media, the judiciary, foreign policy and political decision-making \u2014 it is far less clear that he can bully an economy increasingly beholden to global markets to submit to his will, they say.Business leaders warn that the many strands of the president\u2019s authoritarian approach are intertwined, and that Turkey will not climb out of its hole until the country enacts major structural reforms that would undo many of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s constraints.Those would include allowing a free press, an independent judiciary and returning powers to Parliament. Another step, the release of political prisoners, would help repair relations with Europe.\u201cWe have to do something at home,\u201d said Umit Pamir, a former ambassador to NATO. \u201cOnly then can investors come.\u201dWhile Mr. Erdogan could still change course, whether he will is far from certain. In the meantime, the levers available to him will not avert the economic pain that is now inevitable, they say.\u201cThe interest-rate hikes and budget cuts will be painful,\u201d said Atilla Yesilada, an Istanbul-based consultant at Global Source Partners, a management consultancy. \u201cThere will be bankruptcies.\u201dMany analysts say that, as he has accumulated power, Mr. Erdogan has become increasingly isolated, surrounding himself with advisers who reinforce his own views, while sidelining real expertise.In particular, Mr. Erdogan has insisted on following a policy of keeping interest rates low to allow a huge program of fiscal stimulus based around the construction industry to generate high growth.In May, in an interview with Bloomberg TV, Mr. Erdogan explained why he wanted more control over the central bank and interest-rate policy.\u201cWhen the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?\u201d he asked. \u201cSince they\u2019ll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who is influential on monetary policies,\u201d he added.\u201cIt is the fundamental view of the true populist,\u201d explained Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, also known as E.D.A.M. \u201cThe fact of his being elected gives him the right to be responsible for all executive authority.\u201dYet most economists argue that the policy is no longer tenable and that the economy is already in recession amid mounting foreign debts and a current account deficit. Keeping interest rates low is driving up inflation, which is hurting people\u2019s pocketbooks.For months credit-rating agencies and investment specialists have been signaling that the political management of Turkey\u2019s economy is scaring away investment.Turkey has weathered financial storms before thanks to its size and diversity, but the outcome will depend on the \u201ccoherence and predictability of the policies that are pursued,\u201d the credit-rating agency Moody\u2019s advised in a statement in June.In July, after Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election, and after he appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak to the newly combined position of treasury and finance minister, Moody\u2019s announced another downgrading of Turkey\u2019s credit rating.\u201cAny perception of encroachment into the independence of the central bank and other public institutions will likely exacerbate investor concerns,\u201d it wrote in a statement.The changes center power increasingly in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s hands, allowing him to appoint senior officials in almost every area of life. Far beyond the central bank, analysts warn, the changes represent a creeping politicization of the state.Among the changes is the elimination of senior Civil Service positions in the powerful Turkish bureaucracy.Turkey has always had a strong bureaucracy, modeled on the French system, with a senior bureaucrat, called an undersecretary, in every ministry, assisted by deputy undersecretaries. Those positions have been eliminated and the civil servant positions replaced with deputy ministers appointed by Mr. Erdogan.The change is being felt across the administration, Mr. Ulgen said. \u201cThere is no top bureaucrat who sees 360 degrees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all silos.\u201dAny positive gain from bringing outsiders into the administration has been tempered by the polarizing nature of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule, which has increasingly pushed out people who are seen as ideologically or politically opposed to his Justice and Development Party, and favored party loyalists.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a convergence of the party and the state, more so than in the past, and the top bureaucrat representing the state will not be there,\u201d Mr. Ulgen added. \u201cThe lower levels of the bureaucracy will be open to politicization as career advancement will be increasingly linked to political affiliation.\u201dYet relying on the party for appointees excludes a vast pool of talent, something that has also been evident with the purges of 150,000 public employees since the failed coup of 2016.The appointment of Mr. Albayrak to the post of treasury and finance minister has been taken as a signal not only of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s determination to control monetary and fiscal policy, but also of his intention to prepare a dynasty.Mr. Albayrak, 40, holds an M.B.A. from Pace University in New York, and worked as the United States representative for Calik Holdings, a Turkish construction and trading company known for its close links to the government.In 2004 he married Esra, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s eldest daughter, who studied at the University of California at Berkeley, and two years later they returned to Turkey.Mr. Albayrak entered politics in 2015, becoming a member of Parliament, and later that year was appointed energy minister. He was appointed treasury and finance minister to the new cabinet after the June 24 elections.Even as the business world regretted the departure of more experienced officials from the government, some hoped that Mr. Albayrak, being a relative, might be able to persuade Mr. Erdogan to moderate his insistence on keeping interest rates low.But so far Mr. Albayrak has not done enough to stem the damage, Mr. Yesilada said.At a news briefing Friday, Mr. Albayrak gave assurances of the independence of the Central Bank, yet that the fact that the bank failed to act to shore up the lira showed it was either not independent, or amiss at its job, he said.\u201cNo Central Bank would stand by while its currency is depreciating,\u201d he said.Mr. Albayrak was undergoing a \u201cfast on-the-job training,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the business community and banks tell him what dire straits we are navigating, he may make the right decision.\u201dAs for the immediate crisis, Mr. Yesilada called for a hefty interest rate hike of at least 5 percentage points and said that a \u201chandshake with the United States is an absolute minimum.\u201dAnkara kept asking for other options to the crisis, he said, but he predicted that Mr. Erdogan would have no option in the end.\u201cHe will wake up and smell the coffee,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Turkey\u2019s Crisis Feels Familiar for Emerging Markets: It\u2019s the Debt", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, the borrowing binge that fueled rapid growth in emerging markets and piled up returns for their investors is looking like a problem.Financial experts worry that the turmoil in Turkey, which for the better part of a year has been contained, will spread, following the path of other emerging market meltdowns like those in Mexico in 1994 and Asia in 1997.\u201cThe risk of contagion is pretty high,\u201d said Robert Subbaraman, an emerging market economist at Nomura in Singapore.\u201cTurkey is a symptom of the growing challenges for emerging markets,\u201d said Mr. Subbaraman. \u201cDue to super-low interest rates, investors have been on the hunt for yield \u2014 until this year. Now they will be blindsided by the risks.\u201dIn a research note that Mr. Subbaraman published on Monday, he pointed to South Africa, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Chile and Mexico as having the most vulnerable economies. South Africa, for example, has significant levels of dollar debt and a sizable current account deficit.A country runs a current account deficit if it takes in more money \u2014 in investments and trade \u2014 from foreigners than it sends to other countries. That leaves the country at the mercy of international investors to keep it afloat financially, and those investors could find other markets more enticing \u2014 particularly when emerging markets see their currencies lose value. That is precisely what forced Argentina to go to the I.M.F., the first major emerging market to take such a step during this period of uncertainty. Pakistan may soon have to forge its own deal with the fund for similar reasons.Mr. Subbaraman said the buildup in cheap dollar credit could ultimately threaten South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and even China, whose currency, the renminbi, weakened further against the dollar this week. But analysts have long believed that these economies are strong enough to withstand a traditional contagion attack. By his own account, Mr. Subbaraman has one of the more gloomy views on the future of these markets \u2014 earlier this year he published a report titled \u201cEnjoy the Party, but Stay Close to the Door.\u201dRegulators also took an unusual step to help troubled banks, suspending the requirement that banks book losses on the value of their plummeting securities.Global markets were shakier, though. Emerging market currencies, especially the South African rand, the Russian ruble and the Mexican peso, were down sharply against the dollar. European banks with exposure to Turkey, like BBVA in Spain, UniCredit in Italy and BNP Paribas in France sold off as well.\u201cThis development has broken the link between fickle outflows and economic catastrophe,\u201d Mr. Dehn said. \u201cBefore, a country could collapse if there were outflows \u2014 even if it did nothing wrong. That is not true anymore.\u201dTake Turkey, she said. As long ago as 2011, 70 percent of the debt held by the Turkish construction industry was in foreign currency. That figure, she contends, has surely risen since then, as the country has experienced a real estate boom.\u201cThis corporate debt issue is bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is going to blow up at some point.\u201dEven if the other emerging markets do not succumb to the pressures Turkey is experiencing, there is another route for trouble to spread: European banks, many of which have been enthusiastic lenders to Turkish corporations and financial institutions.Shweta Singh, an analyst at TS Lombard, a London research house, points out that the European banks with the most significant exposure to Turkey \u2014 BBVA, BNP Paribas and UniCredit \u2014 are among the weakest in the eurozone in terms of their equity cushions.During the Greek debt crisis, the panic began over concerns that large European banks holding dodgy Greek bonds would suffer bruising losses. And that\u2019s what happened.Should such banks experience the same problem with Turkish loans, \u201cthe ripple effect could be tremendous,\u201d Ms. Singh said.Advertisement"}

The assistant returned with the drug, but it did not help Mr. Shields. Emergency medical technicians who were called to his apartment \u2014 No. 42B \u2014 could not revive him, the police said.The police said it appeared Mr. Shields had taken too much of the painkiller OxyContin, but a spokeswoman at the medical examiner\u2019s office said a cause of death had not been determined. It remained unclear if the drug was prescribed to Mr. Shields or not.The police were called to Trump Tower at about 9:20 a.m., and Mr. Shields was pronounced dead just before 10:15 a.m., the authorities said.For several years, Mr. Shields has been romantically linked to Ms. Frankel, who is known for founding Skinnygirl Cocktails and for appearing in several reality shows, notably \u201cReal Housewives of New York City.\u201d They had dated since 2016, but were friends for many years.

{"Headline": "In \u2018Small Fry,\u2019 Steve Jobs Comes Across as a Jerk. His Daughter Forgives Him. Should We?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "ProfileLisa Brennan-Jobs has written a memoir about her famous father. The details are damning, but she doesn\u2019t want them to be.Supported byWhen Steve Jobs told his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs that the Apple Lisa computer was not named after her, it was not a cruel lie to a little girl, she insists \u2014 he was teaching her \u201cnot to ride on his coattails.\u201dWhen Mr. Jobs refused to install heat in her bedroom, he was not being callous, she says \u2014 he was instilling in her a \u201cvalue system.\u201dWhen a dying Mr. Jobs told Ms. Brennan-Jobs that she smelled \u201clike a toilet,\u201d it was not a hateful snipe, she maintains \u2014 he was merely showing her \u201chonesty.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange thing to write a devastating memoir with damning details but demand that these things are not, in fact, damning at all. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Ms. Brennan-Jobs has done in a new memoir, \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d and in a series of interviews conducted over the last few weeks.Thanks to a dozen other biographies and films, Apple obsessives already know the broad outlines of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s early life: Mr. Jobs fathered her at 23, then denied paternity despite a DNA match, and gave little in financial or emotional support even as he became a god of the early computing era. \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d which goes on sale Sept. 4, is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort to reclaim her story for herself.The backdrop to her raw depictions of life with and without Mr. Jobs is 1980s Silicon Valley, where artists and hippies mixed with technologists, ideas of how to build the future flourished, and a cascade of trillions of dollars was just beginning to crash onto the landscape. Ms. Brennan-Jobs navigated a childhood on welfare with her mother, the artist Chrisann Brennan, and an adolescence ensconced in her father\u2019s wealth.In passage after passage of \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs is vicious to his daughter and those around her. Now, in the days before the book is released, Ms. Brennan-Jobs is fearful that it will be received as a tell-all expos\u00e9, and not the more nuanced portrait of a family she intended. She worries that the reaction will be about a famous man\u2019s legacy rather than a young woman\u2019s story \u2014 that she will be erased again, this time in her own memoir.On the eve of publication, what Ms. Brennan-Jobs wants readers to know is this: Steve Jobs rejected his daughter for years, but that daughter has absolved him. Triumphantly, she loves him, and she wants the book\u2019s scenes of their roller skating and laughing together to be as viral as the scenes of him telling her she will inherit nothing.Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s forgiveness is one thing. What\u2019s tricky is that she wants the reader to forgive Mr. Jobs, too. And she knows that could be a problem.\u201cHave I failed?\u201d she asked, in one of our conversations. \u201cHave I failed in fully representing the dearness and the pleasure? The dearness of my father, and the outrageous pleasure of being with him when he was in good form?\u201dAfter college, Ms. Brennan-Jobs left the United States to work in finance in London and Italy; she later shifted into design, and then freelance writing for magazines and literary journals. Now 40, she has long avoided publicity. She has never been profiled, and she has carefully eluded most of her father\u2019s chroniclers. (One exception: Aaron Sorkin, who called her \u201cthe heroine\u201d of his 2015 Steve Jobs biopic.) Ms. Brennan-Jobs said she did not trust Walter Isaacson, who wrote the definitive, megaselling biography of her father in 2011.\u201cI never spoke with Walter, and I never read the book, but I know I came off as cold to my father and not caring whether he felt bad,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said in late July, sitting in Cantine, a small, vegan-friendly cafe in Brooklyn\u2019s Carroll Gardens neighborhood. \u201cI was devastated by it.\u201d\u201cI felt ashamed to be the bad part of a great story,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I felt unresolved.\u201dAnd so in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she seeks to resolve some of that shame by describing how her childhood unfolded, who key characters were, why it all happened. Ms. Brennan-Jobs went back to Silicon Valley and interviewed her family, her friends, her mother\u2019s ex-boyfriends, and her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In her childhood, the region had been green with eucalyptus and full of garage hackers. Now it is the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of the world, and Mr. Jobs remains its towering hero.Ms. Brennan-Jobs began work on what would become \u201cSmall Fry\u201d not long after her father\u2019s 2011 death. Years into writing, she felt rushed by her publisher, Penguin Press, and feared being \u201ctarted up\u201d and made to take advantage of her father\u2019s legacy. She wanted to be with a smaller publisher who would work with her and give her more time, and switched to Grove, taking what she says was a 90 percent cut in her advance. (A spokesperson for Penguin declined to comment.)One result of the delay is that \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is entering the public conversation at a time when, across industries, formerly disempowered or ignored women are having their say about powerful men. A memoir by Steve Jobs\u2019s firstborn was always going to be a publishing sensation, but Ms. Brennan-Jobs has inadvertently timed hers to land when the public is even more attuned to marginalized voices \u2014 and when many are having darker thoughts about the world Mr. Jobs created with his attention-devouring devices.None of that, of course, was imaginable when Ms. Brennan-Jobs was born on May 17, 1978, on a commune farm in Oregon. Her parents, who had met in high school in Cupertino, Calif., were both 23. Mr. Jobs arrived days after the birth and helped name her, but refused to acknowledge that he was the father. To support her family, Ms. Brennan cleaned houses and used government assistance. Only after the government sued Mr. Jobs did he agree to pay child support.\u201cSmall Fry\u201d describes how Mr. Jobs slowly took a greater interest in his daughter, taking her skating and coming over to her house for visits. Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with him for a time during high school, when her mother was struggling with money and her temper, but Mr. Jobs was cold and had extreme demands for what being a member of the family entailed. The neighbors next door worried about the teenage Lisa, and one night, when Mr. Jobs was out, they moved her from his house and into theirs. Against Mr. Jobs\u2019s wishes, the neighbors paid for her to finish college. (He later paid them back.)In an interview, Ms. Brennan-Jobs spoke of \u201cnot wanting to alienate people\u201d she loves, but acknowledged that her memoir might do just that. Aside from Mr. Jobs, all the central characters are very much alive. \u201cI hope Thanksgiving\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said.Her mother, Ms. Brennan, is portrayed as a free spirit who nurtured her daughter\u2019s creativity \u2014 but could be mercurial, hot-tempered and sometimes neglectful. \u201cIt was horrendous for me to read,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in an interview. \u201cIt was very, very hard. But she got it right.\u201dMr. Jobs\u2019s infamous venom is on frequent display in \u201cSmall Fry.\u201d Out one night at dinner, Mr. Jobs turns to his daughter\u2019s cousin, Sarah, who has just unknowingly offended him by ordering meat. \u201c\u2018Have you ever thought about how awful your voice is?\u201d Mr. Jobs asks Sarah. \u201cPlease stop talking in that awful voice,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cYou should really consider what\u2019s wrong with yourself and try to fix it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs describes her father\u2019s frequent use of money to confuse or frighten her. \u201cSometimes he decided not to pay for things at the very last minute,\u201d she writes, \u201cwalking out of restaurants without paying the bill.\u201d When her mother found a beautiful house and asked Mr. Jobs to buy it for her and Lisa, he agreed it was nice \u2014 but bought it for himself and moved in with his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.Ms. Brennan said that her daughter has, if anything, underplayed the chaos of her childhood. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that,\u201d she said.But \u201cSmall Fry\u201d also contains moments of joy that capture Mr. Jobs\u2019s spontaneity and unparalleled mind. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs goes on a school trip to Japan, he arrives unannounced and pulls her out of the program for a day. Father and daughter sit, talking about God and how he sees consciousness. \u201cI was afraid of him and, at the same time, I felt a quaking, electric love,\u201d she writes.\u201cWhen I started writing,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so interesting on the page, and I was almost frustrated that he pulled so much gravity.\u201dAfter Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with Mr. Jobs as a teenager, he forbade her from seeing her mother for six months, as a way to cement her connection to his new family. At the same time, Mr. Jobs shifted from neglectful to controlling. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs was getting increasingly involved at her high school, starting an opera club and running for freshman-class president, he got upset. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out. You\u2019re not succeeding as a member of this family,\u201d Mr. Jobs says in the memoir. \u201cYou\u2019re never around. If you want to be a part of this family, you need to put in the time.\u201dTo appease her father, Ms. Brennan-Jobs transferred to another school that was closer to her father\u2019s house. She persisted in becoming editor in chief of the school newspaper. Her mentor there, a journalism teacher named Esther Wojcicki, says \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is a faithful account.\u201cThe dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cThe book is a gift to all of us.\u201dEarly copies of the memoir have circulated among family and friends. Ms. Powell Jobs, her children and Mr. Jobs\u2019s sister, Mona Simpson, gave this statement to The Times: \u201cLisa is part of our family, so it was with sadness that we read her book, which differs dramatically from our memories of those times. The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew. Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood. It was a great comfort to Steve to have Lisa home with all of us during the last days of his life, and we are all grateful for the years we spent together as a family.\u201dOn a hot August day in Brooklyn, Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I walked to her studio, a small apartment with brick walls she painted white and a bamboo floor she painted black. While writing \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she told me, she covered the mirrors around her work space with paper. \u201cI don\u2019t like catching myself in the mirror,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, self.\u2019\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she was nervous about how she would be described physically in a profile, and so I asked her to use her own words. \u201cMy face is uneven,\u201d she said. \u201cI have small eyes. I wish I had dimples, but I don\u2019t. I think right now I look jowly.\u201dI interjected to say she had delicate features, and freckles, and was about 5 foot 2, with slightly reddish brown hair.\u201cMy nose,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs replied, \u201cis not particularly delicate.\u201dShe is deeply self-deprecating, saying she was horrified to be doing \u201ca celebrity memoir.\u201d She said she was sure The New Yorker would not review the book, and that years ago, her first meeting at Grove only occurred because Elisabeth Schmitz, the editorial director, was doing a favor for a mutual friend.\u201cMy first thought on being pitched the book was, \u2018I don\u2019t do this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to publish a celebrity memoir,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Schmitz, who has acquired literary memoirs like the naturalist Helen Macdonald\u2019s \u201cH is for Hawk.\u201d But something about Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s writing made her reconsider. \u201cFrom the first page,\u201d she said, \u201cher language is fresh, surprising, unpredictable.\u201dI\u2019ve read it, and her writing really is compelling. Ms. Brennan-Jobs takes the same linguistic knife to herself as she does to others. She writes with disgust about using anecdotes from her childhood to elicit sympathy from others, and she is ashamed to have dropped her father\u2019s name during an interview to get into Harvard.On Aug. 1, Vanity Fair published an excerpt from \u201cSmall Fry\u201d under the digital headline \u201cI Have a Secret. My Father Is Steve Jobs.\u201d A few nights later, Ms. Brennan-Jobs called me, worried. She hated the title, and on social media, readers were feasting on the more savage details of her account \u2014 especially the \u201ctoilet\u201d comment.\u201cHe was telling me the truth,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, adding that the rosewater perfume she wore had turned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. Sometimes it\u2019s nice of someone to tell you what you smell like.\u201dIt was another uncomfortable reminder that even though \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s story \u2014 one written in a precise, literary style \u2014 her father\u2019s myth looms so large that she cannot control how her words are received. When choosing a narrator for the audio version, she nixed the ones who spoke his lines too harshly or without humor.So much of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort with the memoir seems to be to show how brutal Steve Jobs could be \u2014 and, in doing so, to reclaim that brutality for herself. And how she wants to reclaim it is to love it.\u201cYou get your inheritance, delivered in a lump of coal or whatever in a sort of awful package,\u201d she told me at one point. \u201cAnd you have to take a lot of time to turn the awful package on its head, and it reveals something kind of glorious, and then you\u2019re set free.\u201dIf Ms. Brennan-Jobs was alarmed by the reaction to the toilet-water excerpt, she may be unprepared for what happens when readers encounter more disturbing material. Several times in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs engages in what seems like inappropriate affection in front of his daughter.Ms. Brennan-Jobs describes him embracing Ms. Powell Jobs one day, \u201cpulling her in to a kiss, moving his hand closer to her breasts,\u201d and up her thigh, \u201cmoaning theatrically.\u201dWhen Ms. Brennan-Jobs tries to leave, her father stops her: \u201c\u2018Hey Lis,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stay here. We\u2019re having a family moment. It\u2019s important that you try to be part of this family.\u2019 I sat still, looking away as he moaned and undulated.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs emphasized in an interview that she never felt threatened by her father, and that to her, these scenes show he was \u201cjust awkward.\u201dThis kind of display was not an isolated incident, said Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019 mother, who described an upsetting, sexualized conversation between Mr. Jobs and their daughter in her 2013 memoir, \u201cA Bite in the Apple.\u201d One evening, Ms. Brennan writes, she let Mr. Jobs babysit 9-year-old Lisa. When Ms. Brennan came home early, she found Mr. Jobs with the girl, \u201cteasing her nonstop about her sexual aspirations,\u201d \u201cridiculing her with sexual innuendos,\u201d and \u201cjoking about bedroom antics between Lisa and this or that guy.\u201dMs. Brennan, in her memoir, describes feeling scared for her daughter that night, and wanting to place her body between them and get out of there. \u201cI will be clear,\u201d Ms. Brennan writes. \u201cSteve was not a sexual predator of children. There was something else going on.\u201d Still, after that night, Ms. Brennan tried to make sure there was \u201ca chaperone\u201d when Mr. Jobs was with his young daughter for long hours, she told me recently.\u201cHe was so inappropriate because he didn\u2019t know how to do better,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. In her book, she characterizes Mr. Jobs as \u201con a slide whistle between human and inhuman.\u201dOne afternoon in August, as Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I talked in her kitchen, she made a juice of dandelion greens, pineapple, turmeric and ginger roots. She eats an extremely healthy diet and knows it mirrors her father\u2019s, which veered into esoteric California wellness trends, even as pancreatic cancer took over more of his body.Ms. Brennan-Jobs has a husband, Bill, a longtime Microsoft employee now launching a software start-up. He has two daughters, aged 10 and 12, and he and Ms. Brennan-Jobs have a 4-month-old son. As she drinks her juice, Bill is nearby with the children, and there\u2019s an easygoing energy in the house.\u201cI see my husband and the way he is with his daughters \u2014 responsive and alive and sensitive in ways my father would have liked to be,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. \u201cMy father would have loved to be a man like that, and he surrounded himself with men like that, but he couldn\u2019t be.\u201dDecades after his child-support lawsuit, Mr. Jobs erased his paternity again. \u201cSmall Fry\u201d notes that on his corporate bio on the Apple website, the detail-obsessed chief executive was listed as having three children. But of course he had four.The most public torchbearer for Mr. Jobs\u2019s character and legacy is Ms. Powell Jobs. With an inherited fortune of some $21 billion, she has engaged in philanthropy and launched the Emerson Collective, an organization that pursues liberal political activism and for-profit investments, and owns a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine.Ms. Powell Jobs plays a somewhat \u201ctonic note\u201d in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. Her stepmother brings her into family photos, for example, but many of the descriptions of Ms. Powell Jobs are biting.Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me that she gave Ms. Powell Jobs \u201cthe best line\u201d in the book. It appears in a scene where Ms. Powell Jobs and Mr. Jobs go to a therapy session with a teenage Lisa. Ms. Brennan-Jobs cries and says she feels lonely and has wanted her parents to say good night to her.Ms. Powell Jobs responds to the therapist: \u201cWe\u2019re just cold people.\u201dToward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life, he finally apologized to his daughter.

Mr. Jobs answers that he acted the way he did because she had offended him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was busy. It was because I was mad you didn\u2019t invite me to the Harvard weekend,\u201d he says in the book, referring to a matriculation event.He also cries and tells her over and over again, \u201cI owe you one\u201d \u2014 a famously articulate communicator unable to summon the basic language of contrition.Ms. Brennan-Jobs may be experiencing a kind of author\u2019s remorse as her book makes its way toward store shelves. But details as lethal as these \u2014 they sink into Mr. Jobs\u2019s legend like daggers to the hilt \u2014 are more proof than any DNA test that she is her father\u2019s daughter.Ultimately, Mr. Jobs left his daughter an inheritance in the millions \u2014 the same amount as his other children \u2014 and she is not involved in the allocation of his financial legacy. If she was in charge of his billions, she says, she would give it away to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 a curious twist given her father\u2019s epic rivalry with Apple\u2019s archnemesis.\u201cWould it be too perverse?\u201d she asked. \u201cI feel like the Gates Foundation is really doing good stuff, and I think I would just hot potato it away.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she wrote \u201cSmall Fry\u201d in part to figure out why he withheld money from her even as his wealth ballooned, and as he spent it more freely on the children he had with Ms. Powell Jobs. She said she now sees it was about teaching her that money can corrupt.The ethos \u201cfelt true and kind of beautiful and kind of enlightened for somebody like that,\u201d she said. Still, the question was \u201cwhy he would have taken that value system and applied it so severely to me.\u201d\u201cYou can have a value system and be unable to totally live it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can imagine being that rich and famous and how amazing it is if you can hold on to some of your value system. He didn\u2019t do it right. He didn\u2019t apply it evenly. But I feel grateful for it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs told me she likes toying with the strange power of being a memoirist writing about trauma because the reader knows she made it out O.K. She is here in the privileged position of writing this book, after all. And as a memoirist, even a reluctant one, she gets the final word.One night toward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life \u2014 and the end of the book \u2014 he is watching \u201cLaw and Order\u201d in bed.\u201c\u2018Are you going to write about me?\u2019\u201d he asks her.She tells him no.\u201c\u2018Good,\u2019 he says, and turns back to the television.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described an Emerson Collective investment.

{"Headline": "When Is an Offense Impeachable? Look to the Framers for the Answer", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There are more serious crimes than violating campaign finance laws. Some offenders face jail time, while others catch a break.\u201cAt the constitutional convention, the framers repeatedly expressed anxiety about the president seeking to obtain office through corrupt means,\u201d said Joshua Matz, an author of \u201cTo End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.\u201d\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cthat was one of the principal reasons they included an impeachment power in the first place.\u201dMr. Trump is unlikely to face criminal prosecution while he is in office, as the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding policy and something approaching a scholarly consensus say that the Constitution does not permit criminal proceedings against a sitting president. And political realities will probably protect him from impeachment proceedings, at least as long as Republicans control the House of Representatives.When the framers met in Philadelphia in 1787, they singled out one offense in particular as worthy of impeachment: a candidate\u2019s interference with the Electoral College.\u201cIf the president bribes members of the Electoral College in order to obtain office, it was clear from the debates that that was thought to be an impeachable offense,\u201d said Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at Harvard and the author of \u201cImpeachment: A Citizen\u2019s Guide.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an exception to the general proposition that it has to be abuse of the authority you have by virtue of being president,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an effort to protect the sanctity \u2014 and I think sanctity is the right word \u2014 of the process by which someone becomes president.\u201dGeorge Mason, a leading voice at the convention on the question of impeachment, said it was imperative for Congress to have the means to remove a president who had gained his office by undermining democracy and the rule of law.\u201cShall the man who has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his guilt?\u201d he asked.Of course, bribery is not the same thing as depriving voters of information by paying hush money. But both interfere with the democratic process, said Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, the other author of \u201cTo End a Presidency\u201d and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump.\u201cThe felonies of which Cohen, in statements that were self-incriminating and thus particularly trustworthy, accused his former client, the president, didn\u2019t literally involve bribery,\u201d he said, referring to Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, \u201cbut certainly involved criminal conduct designed to reduce the risk that disclosure of his extramarital affairs and dalliances on the eve of the election would cost him the votes he ended up needing in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u201dMost scholars agree that the impeachment clause covers abuse of official power by a sitting president but not wholly private conduct committed before assuming office.Earlier impeachment proceedings are instructive. When the House Judiciary Committee adopted articles of impeachment in 1974 against President Richard M. Nixon, it accused him of obstructing justice while in office by interfering with the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into the Watergate burglary. Mr. Nixon resigned rather than face what seemed like inevitable impeachment.President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in 1998 for obstruction of justice while in office in connection with a civil suit in a sexual harassment case and a grand jury investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Legal experts have questioned whether the charges \u2014 which involved private rather than official conduct, some of it before Mr. Clinton became president, and no obvious abuse of presidential power \u2014 satisfied constitutional standards.Mr. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate, where removal requires a two-thirds majority.Misconduct before assuming office is not typically a fit subject for impeachment, legal scholars said. But there is one important exception.\u201cThe main and possibly only form of pre-Inauguration Day conduct that would properly qualify as an impeachable offense is conduct relating directly to the acquisition of the presidential office,\u201d Mr. Matz said.Richard L. Hasen, an expert in election law who teaches at the University of California, Irvine, said the crime that Mr. Cohen described Tuesday in court was a serious one.Mr. Cohen said he had arranged to make large, secret payments to a pornographic film actress whose stage name was Stormy Daniels and to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to buy their silence. He indicated that Mr. Trump had instructed him to make the payments, and that he had acted to influence the election.\u201cIt\u2019s a felony,\u201d Mr. Hasen said. \u201cIt\u2019s serious enough that prosecutors would consider jail time for it. If someone is a first-time offender, prosecutorial discretion could lead to no jail time or little jail time.\u201dBut for purposes of impeachment, though, it is the nature of the conduct that matters.\u201cNot every impeachable offense is a crime, and not every crime is an impeachable offense,\u201d Mr. Matz said. \u201cImpeachment is not about punishing the president. That\u2019s what criminal liability is for. It\u2019s about getting him out of office so he can\u2019t use its powers in a harmful manner going forward.\u201dMr. Matz added that the crime Mr. Trump is accused of may not cross a constitutional line.\u201cIf Cohen is correct and the president conspired with him or aided and abetted him in violating a campaign finance law to benefit Trump during the election,\u201d Mr. Matz said, \u201cthat would be an extraordinarily troubling concern that obviously merits comprehensive congressional investigation and political accountability. It is less apparent whether standing alone it qualifies as a high crime or misdemeanor.\u201dThere is, in any event, a gap between constitutional theory and political reality. That was reflected in Gerald R. Ford\u2019s famous statement about what conduct should subject an official to impeachment.But Professor Sunstein said that substituting politics for the commands of the founding document would be a violation of lawmakers\u2019 constitutional oaths.\u201cThe Constitution does not allow the House to impeach the president for reasons that fall short of a high crime or misdemeanor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to refuse to impeach the president \u2014 and here I disagree with many people \u2014 when the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor, that\u2019s also unconstitutional.\u201dProfessor Tribe took the opposite view.\u201cThe bare conclusion that a president has committed legally impeachable offenses does not mean that the House has a constitutional duty to impeach or that the Senate has a constitutional duty to convict,\u201d he said. \u201cThe survival of our democracy depends on the sound exercise of judgment as to when such awesome powers ought to be deployed.\u201d\u201cThat said,\u201d Professor Tribe continued, \u201cfor Congress not to initiate a comprehensive inquiry into the 2016 election and the means by which Trump secured an Electoral College victory would be a grave dereliction of duty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Russian Money Ends Up in U.S. Elections", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerica needs a new model of campaign finance not to supplant the political marketplace but to correct for its inadequacies. Mr. Bauer is a professor of practice and distinguished scholar in residence at New York University School of Law. This, then, is the state of campaign finance: a no-holds-barred competition that has proved irresistible to foreign state actors. With the collapse of the 1970s model of regulation, the question is what should take its place \u2014 and what role should the United States government play? In effect, where reform once aimed to have government structure campaign finance with comprehensive rules, we have something close to an unregulated political marketplace. There are benefits: innovation, as in the development of advanced technologies and new forms of organization. But there are also steep costs: Markets can fail, delivering well \u2014 especially for the affluent \u2014 on some but not all measures of democratic health and vibrancy, and opening up opportunities for new and dangerous sources of abuse such as the Russian electoral intervention of 2016. What remains of the old legal framework is largely a study in unintended consequences, such as the effect of restrictions on the political parties in weakening them and aiding the rise of the super PACs. The government\u2019s role in reform needs a reorientation. A better model for the times could be built by putting less emphasis on elaborate, restrictive and increasingly futile regulation and instead providing public resources \u2014 and where necessary, facilitating access to private funding \u2014 for critical electoral functions. The goal would not be to supplant the political market, but to correct for its inadequacies. For example, candidates for national office are now entirely dependent on private funding. The federal government once offered matching funds and grants for presidential campaigns, but public support withered. The sums available through this program dwindled, and as campaign costs soared, few candidates had any reason to elect this option over private fund-raising. In 1986, Congress eliminated a tax credit for small donations that had been in effect for 14 years and claimed by millions of taxpayers. The government has also ineffectively regulated the rates charged to candidates for television and cable advertising, which is a significant factor in the astronomic campaign costs that drive frenetic fund-raising. A refreshed reform initiative could include among its aims bringing these programs back to life. We often hear a simplistic objection to providing public resources in support of the democratic process: It\u2019s \u201cwelfare for politicians.\u201d The answer lies in a step-by-step approach of targeting public support for specific, vital electoral functions. Funding to safeguard the electoral process and replace voting machinery should enjoy bipartisan public support. Both parties would benefit from assistance in conducting voter registration programs and in sponsoring candidate debates. In addition to government assistance, in the form of cash grants or tax credits, the government could also channel private financing to achieve specific goals, such as through regulatory relief to facilitate the ability of particular political actors, like the parties, to finance specific activities and strengthen their position relative to the super PACs.There remains the hard task of devising transparency rules appropriate to the changing modes of spending to influence elections. Recent experience also underscores the need to shore up the ban on foreign-national spending to influence elections and the disclosure of foreign government programs that seek to influence United States government policy. But the government has the affirmative obligation to underwrite or facilitate the financing of certain basic costs of a functional, flourishing democracy. It cannot leave all of these expenses to the market and to the private contributors who make up so small a share of the population. And it should act now \u2014 before the United States is spending less than the Kremlin on our elections.

{"Headline": "David Pecker, Chief of National Enquirer\u2019s Publisher, Is Said to Get Immunity in Trump Inquiry", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors reached an immunity deal with the tabloid executive David J. Pecker, a key witness in their monthslong investigation into payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Donald J. Trump, according to two people familiar with the investigation.Mr. Pecker is the chairman of American Media Inc., the nation\u2019s biggest tabloid news publisher, which was involved in the payments, which prosecutors have identified as illegal contributions made in violation of campaign finance law.As prosecutors in New York built a case against Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer, that resulted in a guilty plea on Tuesday, Mr. Pecker emerged as an important figure. The investigation appears to be continuing, and as a longtime friend and ally of Mr. Trump, Mr. Pecker could have additional information valuable to the prosecutors.In pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump directed him to arrange the hush money payments to protect Mr. Trump from embarrassing stories during the campaign. The cooperation of Mr. Pecker is another potential blow to the president from a former loyalist.Court documents included detailed descriptions of Mr. Cohen\u2019s interactions with A.M.I. as the hush money payments to the women \u2014 a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model \u2014 were arranged.It was unclear where prosecutors might be taking their investigation. Court papers said that several other people \u2014 in Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and executives at the Trump Organization \u2014 were involved or knew of the illegal payments. Mr. Cohen, under oath in court, said Mr. Trump directed him to make the payments.The prosecutors\u2019 agreement with Mr. Pecker adds another twist to a highly unusual case implicating the president. It means that a company that operates as a news organization is cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation that involves its work with a campaign.And when the authorities subpoenaed the company in April, its executives decided against fighting it, agreeing to cooperate where warranted, and where they deemed officials were not violating First Amendment rights.The company\u2019s cooperation has provided prosecutors with a second line of access to communications about the effort to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s secrets involving women during the campaign, on top of the information provided by Mr. Cohen.Though several people familiar with American Media\u2019s operations have said that the company keeps a strict records policy that ensures that emails are deleted regularly, it is not clear that the same held for encrypted communications or recordings. Dylan Howard, the company\u2019s chief content officer, who is also said to be cooperating, was known to have a recording device in his office, according to people familiar with his operations. American Media would not comment.In court documents filed on Tuesday, federal prosecutors cited \u201cencrypted\u201d communications among Mr. Pecker, Mr. Howard and Mr. Cohen regarding the payoff to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had a brief affair with Mr. Trump.Among the records prosecutors subpoenaed last spring were communications between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard. According to the court documents made public this week, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard had been in touch with Mr. Cohen about both Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who said she had a 10-month affair with Mr. Trump that began in 2006, and Ms. Clifford.In June 2016, when Ms. McDougal approached American Media, whose tabloids include The National Enquirer, about selling her story, both Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard provided Mr. Cohen a heads-up, prosecutors said.A.M.I. negotiated American Media\u2019s eventual purchase of the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story for $150,000 in August 2016 as part of a deal designed specifically to suppress information of the affair, according to Mr. Cohen. As the presidential election neared, Mr. Cohen sought to buy those rights from the American Media executives, prosecutors revealed, though the transaction was never completed.While Mr. Cohen went on to negotiate directly for Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence about Mr. Trump, she, too, had initially considered selling her story to the media. Upon learning that, American Media alerted Mr. Cohen and then helped him arrange his own deal to pay Ms. Clifford $130,000 for her silence in the final days of the 2016 campaign.Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard did not respond to requests for comment.In bringing their charges against Mr. Cohen this week, prosecutors defined American Media\u2019s payment to Ms. McDougal as an illegal, coordinated campaign expenditure. Election law prohibits corporations from spending money to influence elections in conjunction with candidates or their representatives.\u201cHe reminded us,\u201d Robert S. Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said of Mr. Cohen when he announced the charges in Manhattan this week, \u201cthat it is illegal for corporations to make contributions to candidates.\u201dKaren Zraick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stormy Daniels, Feminist Hero ", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor once we\u2019re listening to a woman who refuses to wear either a scarlet letter or a superwoman\u2019s cape.Ms. Filipovic is the author of \u201cThe H Spot: The feminist Pursuit of Happiness.\u201dLet\u2019s take a moment for Stormy Daniels. It\u2019s an extraordinary admission, and an extraordinary political moment \u2014 not just because of what it means for Mr. Trump. It marks an unanticipated feminist turning point. Ms. Daniels is an adult film star and, like the president, an unapologetic self-promoter. Hers is not a female archetype that has historically garnered much respect, trust or sympathy. Yet here she is, an imperfect, entirely self-possessed woman telling her story with clarity and without shame. And here we are, actually listening to her. Mr. Trump\u2019s own incompetence, inexperience and misogyny didn\u2019t stop his ascent to the White House; neither could a woman who spent her life cultivating capability, expertise and political pedigree. The usual rules don\u2019t seem to apply to Mr. Trump. And under the usual rules, a woman who so thoroughly breaks norms of female decorum and political propriety would be shamed into silence. Ms. Daniels is a sex worker, making her the kind of \u201cbad woman,\u201d scorned for her work, who is not often believed when she indicts a powerful man. The threat is that Mr. Giuliani would do to Ms. Daniels what lawyers have done for centuries to imperfect women (and in particular, rape victims): Humiliate them on the witness stand by suggesting their sexual histories render their testimony unreliable and their credibility questionable. Mr. Giuliani contrasted Ms. Daniels with the three \u201cbeautiful women, classy women, women of great substance\u201d who Mr. Trump has married, perfectly encapsulating the profoundly misogynist virgin/whore dichotomy imposed on women, where we can be only perfectly good or entirely bad. A woman who behaved like the thrice-married and affair-prone Mr. Trump \u2014 going on the radio to brag about her promiscuity, leaking sordid details about her sex life to the tabloids \u2014 would be unlikely to fall in the \u201cvirgin\u201d category. But men don\u2019t have to navigate these poles at all. It would be hard to invent two people who better encompass one of the longest-standing sexist double standards than Ms. Daniels and Mr. Trump. But Ms. Daniels also undercuts liberal impulses to turn her into an oversimplified feminist hero. She is a vastly imperfect person by any standard, at times brave and at times venal, obviously admirable and obviously self-interested. These complications, of course, exist in most human beings. But most human beings could not survive the scrutiny she is under, nor so deftly dodge efforts at simplistic caricature. What\u2019s incredible is to see Ms. Daniels embody so many human extremes \u2014 so much boldness, so many flaws, and so many taboos broken \u2014 and to see her story nonetheless believed and acted upon.Mr. Trump has built his image on gold-plated decadence and acts of dominance and degradation; in a sexist society, money and power continue to be the blunt masculine equivalents of the more enigmatic female sex appeal (which itself is largely measured and rewarded by men). There\u2019s little cost to men flaunting their wealth as extravagantly as Mr. Trump has. Women who have affairs with married men, whether those women are Ms. Daniels or Mr. Trump\u2019s second wife, are held more culpable as seductresses than the men who, like Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, actually broke their vows. But it\u2019s women who cross the line from looking sexy for pay to having sex for pay, like Ms. Daniels, who face the most judgment. The men who pay for it, or pay to watch it, are generally unremarkable. We are far from transcending the pervasive assumption that a woman\u2019s sexual decisions are decisive of her character and her integrity. In many swaths of the country, Ms. Daniels continues to be written off as a pole-dancing Hester Prynne \u2014 a woman not to be trusted. But the country is also watching her dogged refusal to be quiet and her unflagging insistence that she isn\u2019t the one who should be embarrassed. We\u2019re seeing a woman who refuses to wear either a scarlet letter or a superwoman cape, and she stands in sharp contrast to a self-aggrandizing president who may face serious consequences once this all unspools. The potential triumph of a deeply imperfect woman over a powerful man won\u2019t exactly break a glass ceiling. But it could put a little crack in a stereotype just as tough to shatter.

{"Headline": "Trump Denounces Justice Dept. as Investigations Swirl Around Him", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump blamed the Justice Department on Thursday for the investigations surrounding him, criticized the deal struck with his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen and lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who countered with a rare public rebuke of the president.\u201cIt\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview that aired on Fox News.Asked whether he was considering firing Mr. Sessions, the president only reiterated his longstanding objection to Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal from the Russia investigation and his insistence that he would have chosen another person for attorney general had he known someone else would oversee the inquiry. \u201cHe took the job and then he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to recuse myself,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sessions. \u201cI said, \u2018What kind of a man is this?\u2019\u201dIn an implicit but pointed reply, Mr. Sessions warned the president not to intrude on federal law enforcement. \u201cWhile I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\u201d he said in a statement issued shortly before he met with Mr. Trump at the White House about criminal justice overhaul.\u201cJeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the \u2018other side,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in a pair of Twitter posts early Friday morning. \u201cCome on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting!\u201dMr. Trump listed people and political enemies who he believes deserve the attention of the Justice Department, including the targets of conservative conspiracy theories that claim the Russia investigation was motivated by politics.The exchanges escalated the public war that Mr. Trump has waged for more than a year on the Justice Department, training most of his fire on the special counsel investigation. Mr. Sessions\u2019s response, his most forceful public pushback yet on Mr. Trump, showed the treacherous political terrain he is navigating: appointed by a president who has made apparent that he views law enforcement as loyal protectors but overseeing a Justice Department that views independence from political pressure as essential to the rule of law.Republicans on Capitol Hill stood firm behind Mr. Sessions, who spent two decades as a senator, publicly cautioning Mr. Trump against firing him. They cited a packed calendar and a lack of confirmable replacements for a closely divided Senate where Democrats are watching vigilantly for any moves by the president that could undermine the Russia investigation.\u201cWe don\u2019t have time, nor is there a likely candidate who could get confirmed, in my view, under the current circumstances,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a key Republican swing vote, warned that removing Mr. Sessions because of his recusal from the Russia investigation \u201ccertainly would not be a wise move.\u201d A spokesman for the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he was not aware of any change in the leader\u2019s support for Mr. Sessions.During Thursday\u2019s meeting at the White House, the president held off on backing the proposal at least until after November\u2019s midterm elections, concluding that an endorsement now carried too much political risk, according to a senior White House official who was not authorized to disclose the private discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cThe president remains committed to meaningful prison reform and will continue working with the Senate on their proposed additions to the bill,\u201d Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in a statement.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision notably aligned him with Mr. Sessions, at least in the short term, and Mr. Grassley signaled his displeasure with the attorney general\u2019s interference by suggesting he would be open to confirming a possible replacement for him. \u201cI\u2019ve got time for hearings this fall,\u201d he told reporters. He had protected Mr. Sessions last year amid rumors of his firing by saying that the Senate would not make room for confirmation hearings for a new attorney general.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also hedged his support for Mr. Sessions, noting that it was obvious Mr. Sessions had lost the president\u2019s confidence and that he did not necessarily object to Mr. Trump replacing him under the right circumstances after the midterm elections. Mr. Graham had previously said that Mr. Trump would have \u201choly hell to pay\u201d if he fired Mr. Sessions.Mr. Trump, who tends to be far less confrontational with perceived foes in private settings, was cordial with Mr. Sessions at their meeting on criminal justice overhaul. Neither man brought up their barbed exchange, according to two senior administration officials who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.After the meeting, Mr. Kushner sped to Capitol Hill to meet with Mr. Grassley, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Cornyn to try to find a path forward for the legislation.Mr. Trump, who had been relatively subdued in the day or so after Mr. Cohen\u2019s and Mr. Manafort\u2019s convictions, had grown enraged by Wednesday night, according to people who spoke to him.The president privately vented to associates that he was furious with Mr. Sessions for failing to protect him in the way he believes Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had protected President Barack Obama.Mr. Trump wanted to rebut Mr. Sessions\u2019s statement on Thursday on Twitter, but his advisers stopped him, according to people briefed on the matter, at least into the evening.But he appeared to chiefly blame Mr. Sessions for his legal woes. \u201cI put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cJeff Sessions never took control of the Justice Department and it\u2019s a sort of an incredible thing.\u201dThe president\u2019s comments showed that his feud with federal law enforcement has taken on a new urgency.Mr. Grassley also reached out on Thursday to lawyers representing Mr. Cohen, inviting him to testify privately before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans on the panel have led an intermittent investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia but have not sought new witness testimony in months.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Eileen Sullivan from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Beats Watching Netflix\u2019: Graft Scandal Engrosses Argentina and Heralds Change", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Corruption investigations in Argentina historically have moved at a glacial pace, slogging through a labyrinthine judicial system often seen as beholden to the powerful and unwilling to hold them accountable.But in recent weeks, Argentines have been stunned by a series of head-snapping developments in an enormous corruption inquiry: at least 26 high-profile arrests, with 15 of those detained still in prison.This was quickly followed by an unprecedented race by 15 prominent business leaders and two high-ranking government figures to strike tell-all deals with prosecutors.Then, just this past week, investigators raided homes owned by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina\u2019s former president.\u201cThis whole process is completely novel for Argentina,\u201d said Manuel Garrido, a former corruption prosecutor who resigned in protest in 2009 after many of his cases had reached dead ends. \u201cWe really have no idea where it could lead.\u201dSince news of the notebooks became public, powerful figures in business and the government, implicated in the scandal, have come forward, describing to prosecutors a vast system of kickbacks involving government contracts said to have proliferated during the administrations of former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner and his widow and successor, Mrs. Kirchner, who governed from 2003 to 2015.Argentines have been so riveted by the revelations since the notebooks emerged in late July that President Mauricio Macri compared the case to a binge-worthy television series.But what has kept Argentines engrossed is the large-scale collaborations with the law by such well-known figures, a novel development. This legal deal-making was made possible only recently by a law signed in November 2016 that established a mechanism for criminal suspects to negotiate leniency in exchange for cooperation with law enforcement officials.Known as the \u201cley del arrepentido,\u201d or the \u201claw of the remorseful,\u201d it allowed plea bargains in a number of crimes, including corruption, drug smuggling and human trafficking.The investigations that arose from Mr. Centeno\u2019s notebooks, which contained lists of names of contractors, public officials and others, seemed tailor-made for the new law, experts said.Confessions of wrongdoing started as a trickle, with business leaders the first to come forward \u2014 including a cousin of Mr. Macri\u2019s, \u00c1ngel Calcaterra. News reports said these leaders initially had tried to explain that the cash was nothing more than forced campaign contributions.Then people started racing to talk to the authorities.\u201cBusiness leaders in Argentina simply aren\u2019t used to explaining their actions in court,\u201d said Natalia Volosin, an Argentine lawyer who specializes in corruption. \u201cAs soon as they saw there was a risk of going to prison, they started talking \u2014 and that changed everything.\u201dA key turning point came when Carlos Wagner, who led the Argentine Construction Chamber, a trade group, was reported to have disclosed to investigators that up to 20 percent of the value of public works contracts was funneled back to the government officials who approved the deals.Public transportation contractors described a similar unspoken rule: in their case, news reports said, it involved kicking back 5 percent of public transportation subsidies to the government officials who approved them.In a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost of all this corruption, Ariel Coremberg, an economics professor at Buenos Aires University, estimated the total amount of bribes could have totaled at least $36 billion between 2004 and 2015.\u201cBribery was like an additional tax that increased the total cost of any project or investment,\u201d Mr. Coremberg said.Claudio Uberti, the former head of the agency that oversees highway concessions, described the Kirchners as obsessed with cash, and claimed he had to collect $150,000 a month from every holder of a concession.Some business leaders claimed they had to pay off government officials to simply do their jobs.In one of the most stunning developments, the Italian-Argentine business leader Paolo Rocca, head of the conglomerate Techint Group and one of Argentina\u2019s richest men, admitted at a business conference that his company paid bribes.Mr. Rocca said his organization did this to ensure the safety of its employees and their families and to make certain that the Argentine government would keep Techint afloat after Venezuela nationalized one of the group\u2019s companies.In another revelation reported in the press, Gabriel Romero, the owner of the industrial conglomerate Emepa, confessed to having paid $600,000 for a presidential decree that extended Emepa\u2019s concession to operate an important commercial waterway.\u201cNo one ever paid me to sign this or any other decree, nor to move forward with any measures in my government,\u201d Mrs. Kirchner wrote in an Aug. 17 statement posted on her website.Polls suggest that many Argentines, particularly among Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters, are skeptical of prosecutor impartiality. She has been charged in several corruption cases since her term ended in 2015, and has frequently maintained that the current government is using the judiciary for political ends.Mrs. Kirchner is a senator, which affords her a degree of immunity. In a fiery, 45-minute speech before the Senate, which voted unanimously on Wednesday to allow the raids in her homes, Mrs. Kirchner seemed to imply corruption was a way of life in Argentina that preceded her and her husband and would continue under Mr. Macri\u2019s government.\u201cWe are in the Argentina that is led by Mauricio Macri, the son of Franco,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Macri\u2019s father, Franco Macri, who made part of his fortune through public contracts.Despite lingering skepticism, the possibility of change has appealed to many in Argentina.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty about what could happen in the short term,\u201d said Miguel Kiguel, a former finance secretary who runs Econviews, a consultancy. \u201cBut if we manage to get a country with less corruption in the long term, it will be positive for Argentina.\u201dAt a protest Tuesday night, when tens of thousands rallied outside Congress and across the country to demand an end to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s immunity, there was optimism that the scandal would mark a before-and-after in Argentine politics.\u201cThis can\u2019t be covered up anymore,\u201d said Patricia Basald\u00faa, a 59-year-old psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s way too big.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canadian Court Halts Expansion of Trans Mountain Oil Pipeline", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 A Canadian court on Thursday froze plans to expand an oil pipeline that the government is about to purchase, ruling that the government\u2019s National Energy Board had not adequately consulted with Indigenous people along the pipeline\u2019s route or assessed the project\u2019s potential effects on the waters off British Columbia.After the pipeline\u2019s owner, Kinder Morgan of Houston, abandoned its plans to add a second pipeline along the existing Trans Mountain route in April, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government stepped in to buy the 715-mile pipeline for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, or about $3.4 billion. The sale is expected to be completed soon, possibly this week.Environmentalists and some Indigenous groups immediately called the ruling a major victory, and some of them urged Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government to give up on plans for the expansion, which has drawn widespread protests driven by environmental concerns.The ruling was a setback for Mr. Trudeau, not least because he has repeatedly vowed to consult with Indigenous groups as part of efforts to make amends for past injustices.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s political critics on the right charged that he had bungled the project.\u201cThis is just a complete failure for the Trudeau government\u2019s handling of the energy sector,\u201d Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party, told reporters. \u201cThis is just another gut punch.\u201dBut Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, told reporters in Toronto that the government would still complete the expansion project.\u201cWe are absolutely committed to moving ahead with this project,\u201d Mr. Morneau told a news conference in Toronto. \u201cWhat the decision today asked us to do is to respond promptly.\u201dMr. Trudeau\u2019s backing of the pipeline, which is not universally popular among his supporters, was to some degree a move to persuade Alberta to join his national carbon-tax program. Alberta\u2019s energy industry, particularly the oil sands, is a major carbon emitter, making the province\u2019s cooperation vital.On Thursday night, however, Rachel Notley, the province\u2019s premier, said that Alberta was withdrawing from the carbon-tax program until construction began on the Trans Mountain extension.\u201cI am announcing that with Trans Mountain halted until the federal government gets its act together, Alberta is pulling out of the federal climate plan,\u201d Ms. Notley said in a speech. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear: Without Alberta, that plan isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u201dMs. Notley blamed \u201csuccessive federal governments\u201d for the situation and said that she had told Mr. Trudeau to immediately appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. She also wants the federal Parliament to hold an emergency session to \u201cassert its authority.\u201dThe case against the expansion was brought by several Indigenous groups, the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby, British Columbia, and two environmental groups.While most of the consultation with Indigenous groups took place under a previous government led by Conservatives, Canada\u2019s Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday found that a final phase during 2016, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s first full year in office, \u201cfell well short of the mark set by the Supreme Court of Canada.\u201dSpecifically, the court found, \u201cvery few responses were provided by Canada\u2019s representatives in the consultation meetings.\u201dIt added that \u201cwhen a response was provided it was brief, and did not further two-way dialogue.\u201dBut improving the process may be a straightforward matter.The court said that the new set of consultations it had ordered would most likely be \u201cbrief and efficient while ensuring it is meaningful,\u201d making for \u201ca short delay\u201d in the pipeline project.Gordon Christie, a professor of law at the University of British Columbia and a prominent authority on Indigenous legal issues, said that it might take only a few months for the government to engage in more meaningful consultations with Indigenous groups.\u201cThis has nothing to do with not building a pipeline,\u201d he said from Vancouver. \u201cAll they\u2019re required to do is go back, review the concerns and show that they are going to take them seriously and respond in some way. These are not negotiations.\u201dNor, he added, does the ruling give Indigenous groups the power to shut down the pipeline project.Chief Spahan said that the Coldwater Band was looking for specific assurances that the expansion would not lead to oil leaks that threatened its drinking water, which comes from wells.\u201cWhen they moved forward, they totally disregarded Coldwater,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like stabbing us in the back.\u201dMany people in Canada\u2019s energy industry said they were frustrated and disappointed by the prospect of a further delay to the pipeline expansion.\u201cWe\u2019re just tired of this stuff,\u201d said Chris Bloomer, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association. \u201cWe, as an industry, just sit here and go: We\u2019re responsible, we\u2019re safe, what more can we do?\u201dThe expansion will put a second pipeline alongside about 610 miles of the 715-mile Trans Mountain pipeline, which opened in 1953. It will increase the system\u2019s capacity to 890,000 barrels a day, from 300,000, at a cost of $7.4 billion.Most of the oil sent through the Trans Mountain pipeline heads to the United States, mainly through a spur pipeline. Supporters of the expansion argue that it will open Asia as a second market for Canadian oil.Advertisement"}

He unleashed among Republicans the ugliness that mainstream Republicans always knew was there \u2014 indeed, they exploited it \u2014 but always thought they were smart enough and strong enough to control.Viewed that way, Trump\u2019s base itself becomes the enemy of the Republic. It is its enthusiasm for Trump that is the greatest impediment to a genuine search for truth and an honoring of it.Every time Trump\u2019s followers turn a blind eye to his corruption, dishonesty or hatred, they say to the Republicans they sent to Washington, \u201cIf you are my representative, you will follow my lead and promote my desires.\u201dIn effect, that means that if the base loves Trump, the base\u2019s senators and congressmen and women are obligated to also love Trump \u2014 or at least fake it.These mainstream Republican politicians seem to be making a different calculation: Trump will be gone soon, and as long as he doesn\u2019t literally destroy the country, they will be able to wrestle back a post-Trump party and restore things to some sense of normalcy.But I have a message for these Republicans: The party you romanticize in your heads, the one that exists in exile waiting to one day make its valorous return, is gone, gobbled up by the beastly base.Mainstream Republicanism is an artifact of another age, its adherent now skirting the margins, homeless, looking on from the other sides of burning bridges.Will you stand up for what is right? Will you stand up for the health of the country and be on the right side of history? Will you at least initiate an investigation into Cohen\u2019s accusation?I hold out no real hope that the answer is yes, but questions must be asked so that history can record the answers. It must be noted forever that Republicans had a chance to choose courage, but they chose cowardice. They had a chance to prioritize national interest, but they chose personal interest.It can\u2019t be pleasant to fall on a sword, but that is now the only honorable way out for these Republicans and, by extension, for the rest of us.For many, their entire life\u2019s work has led them to the halls of Congress. Their political lives and their personal lives are indistinguishable. They are political creatures. They can\u2019t imagine their lives apart from the offices they hold.But in a life there often comes a moment when life asks of you the ultimate ask. And it is only through submitting to what is right, even if at great cost, that the rest of one\u2019s life can be judged as respectable.This is one of those moments for Republicans. In this moment they have to separate career goals and personal ambitions for the high requirement to properly serve the country and protect its Constitution.Up to this point, these Republicans have failed miserably. In a few months, many will likely be shown the door in the midterms. Democrats will likely take control of the House and thus will likely conduct investigations. But Republicans now have a window to stand up before they are voted down \u2014 to say to history that they may have failed so far, but they came around in the end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Baseball\u2019s Long Run in Pawtucket Has an Expiration Date", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPAWTUCKET, R.I. \u2014 For the Massachusetts city of Worcester last week\u2019s announcement that the top minor league team of the Boston Red Sox was coming to a new downtown ballpark for the 2021 season was a shot in the arm.For the Rhode Island city of Pawtucket, which has been the home of the team since 1973, the news was a punch to the gut.The Class AAA PawSox, as they\u2019re known locally, are an institution in this former mill town of 71,000. Players like Jim Rice, Wade Boggs and Carlton Fisk passed through on the way to Hall of Fame careers in Boston (and elsewhere), and the club became a national model for success in the often-challenging world of minor league baseball.But a change in ownership three years ago, political disagreement over funding for a new stadium and the impending expiration of the lease at 77-year-old McCoy Stadium created the conditions for an event many thought would never happen.In the wake of Friday\u2019s announcement, the PawSox opened a weekend series at home against the Durham Bulls. The outward vibe at McCoy was no different, but there was no escaping the fact that the team\u2019s time in Pawtucket now appeared to be slowly, and sadly, moving toward a conclusion.Mike Haught, 60, said he drives to McCoy from Chester, N.H., about 90 minutes away, because \u201cthe games here are much more fun than anywhere else.\u201dAnother fan, Ed Fratus, 64, of Chepachet, R.I. said he was angered by what had occurred. \u201cThere should have been a deal to keep the team here months ago,\u2019\u2019 he said.But Skeffington died of a heart attack three months later, the Providence plan fell through, and the team then embarked on plans for a new stadium in Pawtucket, close to I-95.The team negotiated a stadium-financing plan with Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo last year that had the backing of the State Senate, but it failed to gather sufficient support in the House of Representatives. In June, House and Senate approved a stadium plan that would have cost the Pawtucket Red Sox more money, but by then the club was already negotiating a more attractive deal with Worcester, which was able to garner state, local and private help.The result was the letter of intent signed by the PawSox last week to move to Worcester.In Rhode Island, elected officials bore the brunt of the blame for the fact the PawSox were leaving. Some fans blamed the governor for not rallying more support for the 2017 plan. Others blamed the state\u2019s legislators, particularly Nicholas Mattiello, the Speaker of the House.What it came down to, said Sandi Barber, 67, who was at Saturday night\u2019s game with five friends, was that Worcester \u201cwas proactive about this and we weren\u2019t.\u201dLucchino, who was directly involved in the construction of Camden Yards in Baltimore and Petco Park in San Diego as well as the renovation of Fenway Park, said at Friday\u2019s announcement that the PawSox could not wait any longer for Rhode Island officials to come through with an acceptable plan for a new local stadium.If the deal that Raimondo backed 15 months ago had received full legislative approval, he said, \u201cwe\u2019d probably be building a ballpark right now in downtown Pawtucket.\u201dIt was back in 1970 that the Boston Red Sox put their Class AA franchise in Pawtucket. Three years later, Pawtucket moved up a notch when Boston\u2019s Class AAA team moved here from Louisville. The club was immediately successful on the field, winning the International League championship \u2014 the Governor\u2019s Cup.Off the field, it was a different story. By the end of the 1976 season, the team had declared bankruptcy, and in January 1977, the league revoked the franchise. The Pawtucket Red Sox were on their way somewhere else, when Mondor, a retired Rhode Island businessman, intervened.He bought the team in February of that year, although so bereft was the club that three weeks before the start of the 1977 season, it still didn\u2019t have uniforms. The Boston Red Sox stepped in and sent 48 sets of old uniforms to help out.But Mondor knew what he was doing. One of his first moves was to hire Mike Tamburro, who was then 24, as the team\u2019s general manager, and together they began to turn the Pawtucket Red Sox around.\u201cWe wanted to create the feeling that you were coming home when you came to a ballgame,\u201d said Tamburro, now vice chairman of the PawSox and a co-owner. \u201cAt the same time, we wanted to create a safe and inexpensive and service-oriented environment.\u201dThe season attendance that first year was just 111,224. But by 1991, it exceeded 400,000, and it peaked at 688,421 in 2005, six years after a major renovation of McCoy.Mondor, Tamburro and Lou Schwechheimer, who had become the team\u2019s general manager after Tamburro was promoted, worked together for more than three decades in Pawtucket, a remarkable run considering the transient nature of the minor leagues. The PawSox became an entity that bound the state together and, fittingly, a statue of Mondor now stands outside the main entrance to McCoy.That\u2019s why the news hit Pawtucket so hard. Last December, the town had witnessed the closing of Memorial Hospital. Now this.Bob Tracey, 68, a retired physical therapist, grew up in Pawtucket and, when he was younger, went to games at McCoy with his father. This year, he took a job as an usher at the stadium, figuring the place wouldn\u2019t be the home of the PawSox much longer. What he didn\u2019t foresee was that the team leaving Pawtucket altogether.He said the team\u2019s departure would be a blow to the city and the community of fans. \u201cThis place is a neighborhood thing,\u201d he added, citing the atmosphere Mondor forged.The team\u2019s new ballpark will be built as part of a mixed-use development 42 miles from McCoy and eight miles closer to Fenway Park than the PawSox\u2019s current home.The move won\u2019t officially be a franchise relocation, since Worcester is within Pawtucket\u2019s territorial area. Though it\u2019s little solace for current PawSox supporters, a familiar sight could greet them when Polar Park, named for Polar Beverages, founded in Worcester in 1882, welcomes its first fans in April 2021.After all, Pawtucket\u2019s current mascot, Paws, is a polar bear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bad News Piles Up, Senate Republicans Hardly Flinch", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 For those wondering if the latest disclosures from the Trump legal file are finally weighty enough to cause top congressional Republicans to break from the president, the answer is no.Twenty-four hours after President Trump was hit with a double-barreled barrage of felony convictions against two former close advisers, leading Senate Republicans did not appear particularly agitated. They found several reasons to look past sworn testimony by the president\u2019s former personal lawyer that Mr. Trump had directed him to break the law by preventing two women from providing pre-election accounts of their sexual relationships with Mr. Trump \u2014 accounts that could have conceivably changed some votes in November 2016.There were mentions of the strained credibility of the former Trump lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. And references to Bill Clinton\u2019s dalliances and how Democrats didn\u2019t think those were such a big deal 20 years ago. And a belief that some of that misbehavior was far in Mr. Trump\u2019s past.\u201cEight years ago to 10 years ago, Trump was not what I consider to be a pillar of virtue,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican member of the Senate. \u201cI think he has changed a lot of his life once he was elected. I think Trump is a much better person today than he was then.\u201dMr. Hatch continued: \u201cI think most people in this country realize that Donald Trump comes from a different world. He comes from New York City, he comes from a slam-bang, difficult world. It is amazing he is as good as he is. If anything, you have to give him plaudits for the way he has run the country as president.\u201dIn addition to crediting Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential performance, other top Republicans suggested that Mr. Cohen was not to be believed and that this was a matter for the courts \u2014 not Congress \u2014 to explore.\u201cHis credibility is going to be a critical issue because he\u2019s, frankly, told a lot of different and inconsistent stories,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. (The No. 1 Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, did not publicly address the guilty plea by Mr. Cohen or the near simultaneous conviction on Tuesday of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, on financial fraud charges.)\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some drumbeat for impeachment, but I, perhaps having been a lawyer and a judge, I just think we ought to see how this thing plays itself out,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cIt is hard to make a rush to judgment based on just what we saw yesterday.\u201dFor those eagerly awaiting a rupture between Mr. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, the current straw should always be the last one.The attacks on Senator John McCain\u2019s stint as a prisoner of war in Vietnam were going to end any chance that they could support him. Then the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Once in office, he suffered few defections even as he equivocated over white nationalists in Charlottesville and made disparaging remarks about undocumented immigrants and just-as-disparaging remarks about some of their home nations. So far it seems that his determined push for tariffs against party orthodoxy has been the biggest friction point.Publicly and privately, Republicans conceded that the guilty pleas did not look good and were not optimal heading into the midterm election \u2014 especially as the party struggles to keep its hold on the House. But there was no obvious movement to do anything about them, and lawmakers said they were focused on the business at hand, which did not include castigating the president.\u201cIt is bad news for the country, bad news for these people involved who either pled or were found guilty,\u201d said Senator Richard C.

But for Mr. Shelby, appropriations bills are what are occupying him these days.\u201cI don\u2019t know other than what I read and see,\u201d Mr. Shelby said. \u201cI\u2019m going to focus on what we\u2019re doing here, try to, and move on.\u201dRepublicans also pointed to the continuing Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the last presidential election and the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as reasons to hold back judgment on Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\u201cWhat am I waiting for?\u201d asked Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who, as a House member, helped lead the impeachment of Mr. Clinton. \u201cMy No. 1 goal right now is to keep doing my day job, help the president where I can, but let Mueller do his job.\u201dMr. Graham said his own experience with Mr. Clinton, who was acquitted by the Senate, showed him that it would be fruitless to move against a president without a solid foundation of public opinion.\u201cRemoving a president from office, I\u2019ve learned once before, you can feel passionate about your case, but if you can\u2019t convince the people, then you are not going to be successful,\u201d he said.With the Russia investigation in mind, Mr. Cornyn called on Mr. Mueller to bring his investigation to a speedy conclusion to clear the air before the election.\u201cIt would be nice for him to wrap this up, the Russian investigation, because otherwise the Department of Justice is going to become one of the main actors in the upcoming election as well, just as they were in the 2016 election, which is traditionally something the Department of Justice has tried to avoid like the plague,\u201d he said.House Republicans, no doubt grateful to be out of town on their August recess, were generally spared having to face reporters\u2019 questions about their reaction to the convictions. Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s office said he was awaiting more information before rendering his verdict.Democrats were not about to allow Republicans to dismiss the growing number of Trump intimates about to become prison inmates, and called for Republicans to delay the coming Supreme Court confirmation hearings given mounting legal questions around the president. That request was denied.\u201cHistory will judge us harshly if we collectively shrug our shoulders and disregard our constitutional responsibility to oversee the executive branch in this moment,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the longest-serving member of his party in the Senate. \u201cWe represent a coequal branch of government. It is time we act like it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Worst Kerala Floods in a Century, India Rejects Foreign Aid", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 After devastating floods killed more than 400 people and engulfed entire towns in a southern state in India, the United Arab Emirates offered $100 million to help the recovery.The Indian government\u2019s response: thanks, but no thanks.Indian officials, in turning down the offer on Wednesday, said the country had a longstanding policy of relying on domestic resources, which they insist are adequate. Since a giant tsunami hit India\u2019s southern coast in 2004, killing at least 10,000 people, they say, the central government has built up a disaster relief agency, modeling it on the Federal Emergency Management Agency.The central government has promised $85 million for the recovery from the floods this month, the worst in Kerala state since 1924. This is not only less than the amount offered by the United Arab Emirates, it is a tiny fraction of the $3 billion damage estimate by the state finance minister, Thomas Isaac.Although the floodwaters receded this week, they left astonishing devastation. In addition to more than 400 deaths, about 1.8 million people were displaced and entire towns and major public works were submerged, including the state\u2019s main international airport.\u201cThe government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods,\u201da spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs, Raveesh Kumar, said late Wednesday night.\u201cIn line with the existing policy, the government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts.\u201dThe government has asked individuals and international foundations that want to contribute to do so through the existing relief funds of India\u2019s prime minister or the chief minister of Kerala, which allows them to control how the money is spent.Because New Delhi declined the U.A.E.\u2019s offer, Kerala officials said the central government should compensate the state for the loss and pledge more aid.In Kerala, some politicians see the central government\u2019s rejection of the Emirati offer as punishment for the state\u2019s lackluster support for the national governing Bharatiya Janata Party.\u201cI think the reason the central government might have taken that stand is because of political discrimination, as we are a leftist government in Kerala,\u201d Mr. Isaac, Kerala\u2019s finance minister, said in a telephone interview.Communist parties, which are extremely influential in Kerala, currently lead the state government. In contrast, the national governing party, known as the BJP, is widely viewed as a right-wing party that courts Hindu hard-liners.Others see India\u2019s rejection of the Emirati offer as a matter of pride, an attempt to dispel the old stereotype of the country as wracked by extreme poverty, incapable of taking care of its own citizens and beholden to the altruism of foreign governments.Mr. Modi has championed India as the world\u2019s next great power, and he has tried to make the country more self- sufficient in many respects, including industrially.\u201cIndia would like to become or at least change its identity from an aid receiver to an aid giver,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a research organization based in New Delhi.But the strategic posturing is bumping up against Kerala\u2019s grim realities.\u201cThe wells have been contaminated with carcasses of dead animals and filled with mud,\u201d said Esther Mariaselvam, a regional manager for Action Aid, a nonprofit organization coordinating relief work in Kerala. \u201cThe septic tanks need to be rebuilt and the entire sanitation system has to be restored.\u201dIn addition, she said, there are concerns about the supply of clean water.Swami Chakrapani, the chief of a Hindu nationalist party, said that while Kerala needs help, the aid should be reserved for observant Hindus.\u201cHelp should be given to those who respect nature and creatures,\u201dMr. Chakrapani said.\u201cWhen roti was available to people in Kerala, they were slaughtering the cow to eat her meat,\u201d he added, referring to an Indian flatbread. \u201cWhat I mean is that Hindus should provide help to those who avoid cow meat.\u201dAyesha Venkataraman reported from Mumbai and Suhasini Raj and Maria Abi-Habib from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018How Did We End Up Here?\u2019 Trump Wonders as the White House Soldiers On", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the hours after two of President Trump\u2019s former advisers delivered his administration potentially grave legal setbacks, the mood inside the White House was grim, a return to a trench-warfare mentality born out of muscle memory. But there remained a pervasive belief, rightly or wrongly, that things have looked this bad before.That was little consolation to advisers who admitted they had no strategy for countering the news that Mr. Trump\u2019s former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, had admitted in federal court that Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to silence them from talking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump. Nor was there a plan, according to interviews with half a dozen current and former aides, to put a spin on the conviction of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, on eight counts of financial fraud.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, was left to repeatedly refer to the president\u2019s past comments on the matter.\u201cHe did nothing wrong,\u201d Ms. Sanders said at least three times in a briefing to reporters, a sentiment that White House employees have told themselves in private conversations. \u201cThere are no charges against him.\u201dBut this time, advisers noticed that the president, a man who has in the past relished the idea of leading his troops into political battle, seemed subdued. He appeared to realize the serious nature of what had just taken place, and yet his relative calm \u2014 contrasted with his more typical lashing out when he is anxious \u2014 unnerved some of his aides.\u201cWe started with collusion,\u201d the president mused, according to several people who witnessed Mr. Trump\u2019s somber mood. \u201cHow did we end up here?\u201dWell into the president\u2019s second year, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have learned to weather, deflect or completely ignore developments that critics of the administration viewed as insurmountable. This spring, aides faced near constant questions about how the White House doled out security clearances. In May, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for payments to one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress, contradicting the president\u2019s prior claim that he had no knowledge of them.This summer, the White House has faced a self-inflicted firestorm over its immigration policies, which led to thousands of family separations at the border; questions about why Mr. Trump stood by Scott Pruitt, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who faced more than a dozen investigations into his spending and management practices before eventually resigning in July; and Mr. Trump\u2019s cozy, widely criticized news conference with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland.On Wednesday, several aides dismissed the news about Mr. Cohen as just another bad headline lacking the silver bullet that they say the special counsel would need to prove that the president conspired with Russian officials.Mr. Trump spent the early hours of Wednesday tweeting \u2014 he called the convicted Mr. Manafort a \u201cbrave man\u201d who, unlike Mr. Cohen, \u201crefused to \u2018break\u2019\u201d or \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019\u2019\u2019 He also monitored headlines, as he did after his news conference with Mr. Putin. In the interview with Fox News, he asserted that money for the payments to the women had come not from his campaign, but from his own accounts.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the interview, \u201cbut I tweeted about the payments. But they didn\u2019t come out of the campaign.\u201d Campaign finance laws still prohibit Mr. Trump from making unreported payments related to the campaign, regardless of where they came from. Neither payment was disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.On Air Force One on Tuesday night on the way back from a rally in West Virginia, Mr. Trump repeatedly minimized the news, telling aides that the legal developments were not about him, but about Mr. Manafort and Mr. Cohen. He also groused over the optics of the rally, telling a person close to him that the crowd seemed flat and that some chairs were empty.By Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers were arguing privately that Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission and guilty plea to violating campaign finance laws was a punch but not a knockout blow, and were assessing what options they had for fighting back. They stressed that Mr. Cohen had said repeatedly in previous accounts that Mr. Trump was not aware of his payment to Ms. Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels.In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken at length with Mr. Trump, but that the president had wanted to move on from legal tangles to other topics \u2014 including the golf game that Mr. Giuliani was playing at a course in Scotland on Wednesday.Mr. Giuliani said the two had discussed the political fallout should Mr. Trump grant a pardon to Mr. Manafort.\u201cYesterday\u2019s plea and Manafort\u2019s conviction, none of it had to do with collusion, none of it has to do with obstruction,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said, echoing much of what the president has said in public and in private. \u201cHe really thinks Manafort has been horribly treated.\u201dHe added that Mr. Trump\u2019s team was looking at the possibility of making public at least one recording of Mr. Cohen speaking to journalists about his payments to Ms. Clifford, in which he said he made the payments on his own initiative to spare the Trump family pain.People who have known Mr. Trump for years pointed out that he has never been as cornered \u2014 or as isolated \u2014 as he is right now, and that he is at his most volatile when he feels backed against the wall. They pointed to his reaction after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of him boasting of grabbing women\u2019s genitals was released in October 2016. Mr. Trump responded by parading Bill Clinton\u2019s female accusers in front of Hillary Clinton at the presidential debate in St. Louis, and acted like a man with nothing to lose.This dynamic has led Mr. Trump to publicly praise \u2014 and privately muse about pardoning \u2014 Mr. Manafort. Mr. Trump has exercised his pardon power several times since he took office, including for Joe Arpaio, the anti-immigration sheriff in Arizona, and Dinesh D\u2019Souza, the conservative writer who was prosecuted for campaign finance violations. One official said that there was a list of people Mr. Trump has said he would like to consider for pardons or commutations, but that Mr. Manafort\u2019s name had never been on the list.Mr. Giuliani said in the interview that a pardon for Mr. Manafort was not under consideration.Ms. Sanders said that, to her knowledge, Mr. Trump had not discussed the idea of pardoning Mr. Manafort. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers said that he was uncertain about the political fallout and was not quite ready to do so.Mr. Manafort, 69, is in the meantime facing another trial next month on seven charges, including obstruction of justice, failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money.Michael D.

{"Headline": "After Italy Collapse, Europe Asks: How Safe Are Our Bridges?", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The collapse of a highway bridge last week in Genoa, Italy, that killed 43 people has set off warnings across Europe about aging infrastructure and the need for new inspections, better record-keeping and more investment.Experts say many Western countries, including the United States, do not spend nearly enough on maintaining or replacing older bridges and other structures, a problem that worsened after the financial collapse of 2008.How safe, then, are highways and bridges in Europe?On average, it takes 22 years for a bridge to be repaired after it first shows signs of degradation, the consultants who conducted the study reported. They said that spending on the upkeep of highways and bridges needed to double, and noted that France spends far less per mile on maintenance than Britain does.After the collapse in Italy, the transportation ministry said it would put forward a new law dealing with infrastructure planning.While there is unease about bridges and highways in France, the government\u2019s awareness of the problem and the absence of major bridge failures in decades have tamped down the public outcry.\u2014 Alissa RubinBut politicians and some engineers insist that fearful news coverage since the Genoa disaster is overblown. Infrastructure spending in Germany has rebounded recently, and Andreas Scheuer, the federal transport minister, said the government would spend 1.3 billion euros, around $1.5 billion, on bridge replacement and renovation this year.\u201cIn Germany, we have a proven system of controls for bridges,\u201d he told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag last weekend. \u201cI put my trust in it and citizens can trust it, too.\u201dMany of Germany\u2019s bridges, like Italy\u2019s, date to the era of postwar reconstruction and are showing signs of age. In recent years, some major highway bridges have been closed to heavy trucks because of stability concerns. The problem is less pronounced in the less affluent eastern part of the country, where much of the infrastructure was upgraded or replaced after East and West Germany were reunified in the 1990s.In what officials said was a coincidence of timing, repairs began Monday on the Rader bridge about 20 miles east of the northern city of Kiel, which in 2013 was found to have damage to 29 support posts.But Germany has a thorough inspection regimen that is tracked by the central government, with each bridge surveyed at least once every three years.\u201cEvery six years, bridges are inspected extensively and closely \u2014 the inspector taps or scans the structure centimeter by the centimeter,\u201d Burkhard K\u00f6tter, a bridge expert, told the German automobile association ADAC.\u2014 Christopher F. SchuetzeThe Norwegian Road Supervisory Authority, which monitors road safety, made a chilling discovery two years ago: The government had failed to keep track of the condition of many of the country\u2019s 17,500 bridges, and reports of damage and unsafe conditions went unheeded for years.Since the turn of the century, the Public Roads Administration, which is in charge of building and maintaining roads, has phased in a computer system to replace paper records on the state of bridges. That was supposed to have made oversight easier, but in some cases information was not entered properly, and in others the system\u2019s warnings failed to draw the staff\u2019s attention.Trude Tronerud Andersen, the director of the Road Supervisory Authority, said the roads administration had put too much faith in a flawed information system. \u201cThey were believing and hoping, but they didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said.The Public Roads Administration is carrying out new inspections of all of Norway\u2019s bridges, and the government has given it until the end of this year to update its computer system.\u2014 Martin Selsoe SorensenThis month, a far-left Catalan member of the Spanish Parliament, F\u00e8lix Alonso Cantorn\u00e9, asked the government to supply details about some of the country\u2019s bridges and tunnels. He cited a report from a Spanish road association, whose members include highway operators, that said Spain had a backlog of needed maintenance that would cost \u20ac6.6 billion.But many of Spain\u2019s bridges are relatively new, built or renovated after it joined the European Union in the 1980s. And government officials have repeatedly offered assurances that all of the country\u2019s 22,500 bridges have been inspected within the past five years.Just months ago, Atlantia, the Italian infrastructure company that operated the Genoa bridge through a subsidiary, completed the purchase of Abertis, a major Spanish highway operator, together with ACS, another Spanish company. Threats by the Italian authorities to impose heavy financial penalties on Atlantia have driven down its stock price, but the company said in July that it had secured all of the financing for the Abertis deal.\u2014 Raphael MinderBut many bridges in the Netherlands were built generations ago and now carry far more traffic than they were designed for.\u2014 Claire MosesAn earlier version of this article misstated the month in which a study commissioned by France\u2019s transportation minister of the nation\u2019s road and bridge network was released. It was July, not June.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the location of the \u00cele de R\u00e9 bridge.

{"Headline": "Their First Temple Was a Tent. Now Sikhs Walk New Jersey\u2019s Halls of Power.", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 1980s, when Sikh immigrants from India began arriving in New Jersey in significant numbers, they lacked a proper house of worship, so they set up a tent on a patch of dirt and began to pray.Much has changed since then. The tent in Glen Rock, a town in northern New Jersey, has been replaced by an imposing gurudwara, or temple, with a red brick facade and white domes. The congregation that once comprised 10 families now has hundreds of families drawn from across New Jersey and New York, two states that have among the largest populations of Sikhs in the country.Today, after a long history of dealing with bigotry, Sikhs have begun to acquire power.All three grew up together and have attended the temple since they were children \u2014 Mr. Grewal and Mr. Bhalla served as best man at each other\u2019s wedding. They are now in their 40s and embody the political maturation of Sikh Americans. They gathered recently in a conference room at the temple to reflect on how their faith has shaped their progressive values.Childhood in New Jersey was marked by \u201ca lot of bullying, a lot of teasing, a lot of animosity,\u201d said Mr. Grewal, who, abiding by Sikh tradition, covered his hair from a young age. But on weekends, within the grounds of the gurudwara life was different. When they were not attending religious instruction, the three boys bonded over baseball or sneaked out for pizza; they got in trouble together.\u201cOne time our mom didn\u2019t let us bring our bat and ball,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cI had a ball but we used a stick to hit the ball. And I whacked an auntie, an elderly woman, by mistake and she cursed me in Punjabi.\u201dFor the small Sikh community in which they were raised, a transformative moment came in 1984. That year, political tensions in the Indian state of Punjab erupted into violence between Sikh militants and the Indian military at the Golden Temple, the most sacred site in Sikhism, a monotheistic faith founded in South Asia in the 15th century that distinguished itself by emphasizing equality for all.Mr. Bhalla said this bloody period introduced him to \u201cthe concept of injustice.\u201d Sikhs began organizing and staging demonstrations in Washington and meeting with members of Congress to raise concerns about human rights.Mr. Singh recalled being in a home and watching a man roll up his pant leg \u201cto show how the Punjab police had helped to crush his muscles with a heavy roller. And for someone who was just in college, it sort of impacts you.\u201dHe joined Amnesty International, helped form student groups and was the first of the three friends to go to law school. Throughout the 1990s much of the political focus of the Sikh American community was centered on what was happening thousands of miles away in India.At the time, Mr. Grewal was working in commercial litigation at a private law firm in Washington and he remembers some of the looks he got in public. One homeless man, he said, would routinely accost him outside his office building.\u201cHe\u2019d start yelling at the top of his lungs, \u2018I found him! I found him! I found bin Laden!\u2019\u201d Mr. Grewal said.Eventually, after trying to avoid the man, Mr. Grewal said he took him to a McDonald\u2019s.\u201cHis name was Jimmy,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cI explained who I was and where I came from, and gave him a stack of coupons for McDonald\u2019s, and we were friends ever since.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Singh worked with others to form the Sikh Coalition, met with Attorney General John D. Ashcroft and helped ensure that protections for Sikhs were included in the Patriot Act. They also persuaded the Department of Transportation to issue guidelines on searches of Sikh passengers and pushed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to educate employers on workplace discrimination.\u201cThat level of advocacy, that fast, could not have happened if we didn\u2019t have some practice,\u201d said Mr. Singh, a program officer for the Open Society Foundations, a group financed by George Soros that works to promote human rights and democracy. \u201cThat really came out of the \u201984 experience.\u201dOne challenge for Sikhs after Sept. 11 was how often they were being mistaken as Muslim. Some Sikh leaders argued that Sikhs needed to make the distinction clear as an act of self-preservation. But Mr. Bhalla and others strongly rejected such a strategy, arguing that Sikhs should \u201cstand up for injustice not just against the Sikh community but really against anybody who is treated unfairly.\u201d\u201cIn the eyes of God, there is no Hindu, there is no Muslim,\u201d Mr. Bhalla said, quoting Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. \u201cIn God\u2019s eyes everyone is equal. That\u2019s something that\u2019s foundational in Sikh philosophy and belief.\u201dMr. Bhalla said this basic Sikh value \u2014 he described its modern, secular equivalent as \u201cradical egalitarianism\u201d \u2014 explained his first executive order as mayor, declaring Hoboken to be a fair and welcoming city. He followed this with an order intended to protect transgender people by making all single-occupancy public restrooms gender-neutral.While the concentration of Sikhs in New Jersey is a relatively recent development, Sikhs were among the earliest South Asian immigrants in the country, arriving over a century ago to work primarily as farmers and loggers on the West Coast. Their presence inspired one newspaper in Bellingham, Wash., to ask, \u201cHave We a Dusky Peril?\u201d in 1906, amid fears \u201cthat the dusky Asiatics with their turbans will prove a worse menace to the working classes than the \u2018Yellow Peril\u2019 that has so long threatened the Pacific Coast.\u201d\u201cSikhs have been seen and treated in America as perpetually foreign and automatically suspect and since 9/11, as potential terrorists,\u201d said Valarie Kaur, a prominent Sikh American activist. \u201cRavi and Gurbir\u2019s visible presence on the nation\u2019s stage as public servants is breaking down these stereotypes and reshaping the nation\u2019s moral imagination for \u2018who counts\u2019 as American. In a time of heightened racism and bigotry, their leadership provides hope and inspiration and offers us a glimpse of the America that is possible, the America worth fighting for.\u201dMs. Kaur said she and other Sikhs regularly draw upon \u201cthe Sikh spirit of Chardi Kala,\u201d meaning a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity.This principle may help explain why the three childhood friends from the temple in Glen Rock are optimistic about the country\u2019s future.\u201cPeople far greater than us and far braver than us have overcome far more than us in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Grewal said. \u201cAnd this is just another moment that\u2019s testing the foundations of our nation\u2019s democracy.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cI think the institutions will survive.\u201dArun Venugopal is a reporter for WNYC.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s an elite that, rather than pushing for systemic change, only reinforces our lopsided economic reality \u2014 all while hobnobbing on the conference circuit and trafficking in platitudes.Anand Giridharadas, a former columnist for The New York Times, spoke about this phenomenon at an Aspen Institute conference in 2015, and he takes his ideas further in his entertaining and gripping new book, \u201cWinners Take All.\u201d As the Democratic Party struggles to figure out its future and global demagogy thrives, it\u2019s worth considering where we went wrong and how best to save the world from the dangerous turn it has taken. It\u2019s now very clear that globalization, technology and market liberalization did not bring their promised benefits \u2014 at least not for the vast majority of Americans and those in advanced countries around the world.For those at the helm, the philanthropic plutocrats and aspiring \u201cchange agents\u201d who believe they are helping but are actually making things worse, it\u2019s time for a reckoning with their role in this spiraling dilemma. I suggest they might want to read a copy of this book while in the Hamptons this summer.In a series of chapters centered on different individuals who are part of this rarefied class, Giridharadas exposes the rationalizations of the 0.001 percent who actually believe they are making the world a better place. The Sacklers helped create the opioid crisis but give money to important causes. The chief executive of Cinnabon thinks that being transparent about the fat and sugar she peddles offsets the harm her company creates. It\u2019s a land of PowerPoint presentations and cuddly good intentions.Giridharadas calls this prevailing ethos \u201cMarketWorld,\u201d made up of people who want \u201cto do well and do good.\u201d He beautifully catches the language of Aspen, Davos and the recently extant Clinton Global Initiative, which will doubtless reappear in the newly born Bloomberg initiative. It\u2019s a world of feel-good clich\u00e9s like \u201cwin-win\u201d and \u201cmake a difference.\u201d The rote conversations of this crowd were on recent display at the Public Theater, in the beginning of the second act of the Bruce Norris play \u201cThe Low Road.\u201d As Giridharadas describes the ethos of MarketWorld, it\u2019s made up of people like former President Bill Clinton who saw the anger bubbling up but proved unable to \u201ccall out elites for their sins: or call for power\u2019s redistribution and fundamental systemic change; or suggest that plutocrats might have to surrender precious things for others to have a mere shot of transcending indecency.\u201dLike the dieter who would rather do anything to lose weight than actually eat less, this business elite would save the world through social impact investing, entrepreneurship, sustainable capitalism, philanthro-capitalism, artificial intelligence, market-driven solutions. They would fund a million of these buzzwordy programs rather than fundamentally question the rules of the game \u2014 or even alter their own behavior to reduce the harm of the existing distorted, inefficient and unfair rules. Doing the right thing \u2014 and moving away from their win-win mentality \u2014 would involve real sacrifice; instead, it\u2019s easier to focus on their pet projects and initiatives. As Giridharadas puts it, people wanted to do \u201cvirtuous side projects instead of doing their day jobs more honorably.\u201dIn order to really have an economy with the greatest opportunity for all, the kind of economy they seem to champion, the MarketWorlders would have to pay high levels of corporate and personal income tax, offer decent wages to their workers, allow unions, fund public schools (instead of pet charter projects) and support some form of single payer health care and campaign finance reform. One simply can\u2019t arrive at a more economically equal reality when the rungs of the ladder are so far apart.At Davos and the other international conclaves where the muckety-mucks celebrate the new economic world they have helped create, which has rewarded them so amply, corporate leaders move seamlessly from sessions discussing the risks of climate change, growing inequality and financial instability, to dinners at which they praise tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and applaud proposals for deregulation. They conveniently don\u2019t mention the increases in taxes on a majority of those in the middle, the Republican moves to eliminate health insurance for some 13 million in a country where life expectancy is already in decline, the increase in pollution, the risk of another financial crisis, the ever increasing evidence of moral turpitude \u2014 whether it\u2019s Wells Fargo cheating its customers or Volkswagen cheating on its emission tests. Cognitive dissonance is intrinsic to MarketWorld.Giridharadas rightly argues that this misallocation of resources creates a grave opportunity cost. The money and time the MarketWorlders spend fixing the edges of our fraying social order could be used to push for real change. This is especially so in the political battles in which the country is currently engaged, where a majority of the Supreme Court and members of Congress seem hellbent on rewriting the rules of the American economy and political system in ways that will exacerbate economic disparities, increase monopoly power, and decrease access to health care and women\u2019s reproductive rights.Moreover, the ideology of the MarketWorlders has spread and just espousing it has come to seem like a solution instead of the distraction that it is. Giridharadas shows how this is done. One category of enabler he describes is the cringeworthy \u201cthought-leader,\u201d who nudges plutocrats to think more about the poor but never actually challenges them, thus stroking them and allowing them to feel their MarketWorld approaches are acceptable rather than the cop-outs they are. Another recent book, the historian Nancy MacLean\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in Chains,\u201d provides a salutary lesson on the dangerous ways a self-serving ideology can spread.Giridharadas embedded himself in the world he writes about, much as the journalist David Callahan (who edits the Inside Philanthropy website) did for his recent book, \u201cThe Givers: Wealth, Power and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age.\u201d And like Callahan, Giridharadas is careful not to offend. He writes on two levels \u2014 seemingly tactful and subtle \u2014 but ultimately he presents a devastating portrait of a whole class, one easier to satirize than to reform.Perhaps recognizing the intractability and complexity of the fix we are in, Giridharadas sidesteps prescriptions by giving the book\u2019s last words to a political scientist, Chiara Cordelli. \u201cThis right to speak for others,\u201d Cordelli says, \u201cis simply illegitimate when exercised by a powerful citizen.\u201d Although a more definitive conclusion would have been welcome, Cordelli does point to the real lesson of the book: Democracy and high levels of inequality of the kind that have come to characterize the United States are simply incompatible. Very rich people will always use money to maintain their political and economic power. But now we have another group: the unwitting enablers. Despite believing they are working for a better world, they are at most chipping away at the margins, making slight course corrections, while the system goes on as it is, uninterrupted. The subtitle of the book says it all: \u201cThe Elite Charade of Changing the World.\u201dJoseph E. Stiglitz was chief economist of the World Bank from 1992 to 2000 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001. He is a professor at Columbia and has been writing about inequality since the late 1960s.Advertisement"}

During the renovation, they also installed air-conditioning and an elevator.The front door opens into an entry hall, with a second hallway to the right and a courtyard straight ahead. The second hall connects to a reading room and the kitchen, which opens onto an outdoor eating area. The living room, dining room and a sitting room form a single elongated space beyond the reading room, running nearly the length of the house. It has a vaulted ceiling punctuated by a series of stone arches, typical of Maltese country homes from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Ms. Podgorska said. At the opposite end of the house are the elevator, a half bathroom and a study. Near the entrance is a combined half bathroom and laundry room, as well as a staircase up to a long gallery connecting the five bedrooms. The master bedroom has an en suite bath, while two of the bedrooms share a full bathroom and two more have separate access to a full bathroom and a half bathroom. Some bedroom walls feature original frescoes, and one bedroom has a terrace. The house, which is being sold furnished, includes pieces from Morocco, India, China and Malta, Ms. Sandars said.The lot is 12,917 square feet, with a two-car garage and a garden with a lawn. The centerpiece is an 82-foot lap pool surrounded by vine-covered stone walls.Gozo, about nine miles from one end to the other, draws outdoor sport enthusiasts with scuba diving, hiking, biking and abseiling, Ms. Podgorska said. The property is a two-minute walk from the main piazza of the village of Xewkija, which has a population of around 3,000. It is a 10-minute drive to the ferry port, where a boat to the main island of Malta takes 25 minutes. Malta International Airport is on the main island, about a 30-minute drive from the port. Malta\u2019s housing market has been strong in recent years, with prices rising and demand steady, real estate agents said. Foreign buyers once sought second homes there, but increasingly they are buying to relocate, often because businesses that employ foreign workers \u2014 including multinationals, financial services, and internet gaming and gambling companies \u2014 have set up offices in Malta in the past decade. Most foreigners tend to buy either move-in ready seafront apartments or older palazzos in need of renovation, Ms. Podgorska said. Prices for high-end apartments start at 2,750 euros (or about $3,220) a square foot, she said, adding that in exclusive, waterfront areas popular with foreign buyers, one-bedroom apartments start at 900,000 euros ($1.05 million) and two-bedrooms can sell for 1.5 million euros ($1.75 million). Prices per square foot for villas are lower, she said, but asking prices are higher, starting at 3 million euros ($3.51 million) for a modern villa with a pool and 5 million euros ($5.86 million) for restored historic properties with a water view and ample land.In luxury developments in areas where foreigners can buy homes without restrictions, prices range from 1,375 euros ($1,609) a square foot to about 3,975 euros ($4,651) a square foot, Mr. Buttigieg said.But Gozo, a 25-square-mile island that is less developed than the main island of Malta, has lower prices, Ms. Podgorska said: A traditional villa there might cost 50 to 75 percent of what it would fetch on the main island.Ms. Podgorska said her agency\u2019s luxury buyers \u2014 about 80 of whom are foreign \u2014 are evenly split between people moving to Malta for work and those buying vacation homes. Malta has traditionally attracted mostly British and Scandinavian buyers, she said, but in the past two or three years she has been seeing more buyers from the United States, Canada and Russia.Mr. Buttigieg said that, in the past year, about a quarter of his agency\u2019s buyers \u2014 and 10 to 12 percent of those who bought high-end properties \u2014 were foreigners, most of them from Britain, Russia, Germany and Italy. Buyers also came from South Africa, Egypt, Libya, Algeria and Nigeria, he said.Malta also attracts residents of neighboring countries looking for economic stability and lower taxes, said Mr. Hili, whose agency has worked with buyers from France and Italy in the past year, as well as those from Germany, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Buyers pay for notary services, which cost between half a percent and three-quarters of a percent of the sale price, he said. A lawyer can be useful for drawing up a legally binding preliminary sale and purchase agreement, ideally before a notary is involved, Mr. Dingli said. The legal fee is typically 1 percent of the sale price, he said.Other closing costs include searches by the notary; a stamp duty that is typically 5 percent, but is reduced in some cases; and an 18 percent value-added tax on any legal or notary services.Maltese, English; euro (1 euro = $1.17)There are no property taxes in Malta, Ms. Podgorska said.

{"Headline": "Trump Asks S.E.C. to Study Quarterly Earnings Requirements for Public Firms", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider eliminating requirements that publicly traded companies post quarterly earnings reports, a move that could do away with a cornerstone of American capital markets.In speaking with some of the world\u2019s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. \u201cStop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,\u201d said one. That would allow greater flexibility & save money. I have asked the SEC to study!The directive does not mean the imminent demise of quarterly earnings reports, which keep investors informed on the financial health of publicly traded companies. The disclosures are required under federal securities law. The commission is independent of the executive branch, although the White House nominates the chairman of the S.E.C. and the other four commissioners, who all serve staggered, five-year terms.\u201cThe president has highlighted a key consideration for American companies and, importantly, American investors and their families \u2014 encouraging long-term investment in our country,\u201d the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement. \u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s division of corporation finance continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s suggestion is not unheard-of. In 2013, the European regulators abolished requirements that publicly listed companies file quarterly reports. On the other hand, Japan has moved closer to current American rules, requiring quarterly reporting starting in 2008.Still, any move away from the system of quarterly reporting would be a significant shift for investors, who have come to rely on the regular financial disclosures on the performance of publicly held companies.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, investors are used to getting updates four times a year on the status of companies\u2019 financials, and changing that would require a change in behavior,\u201d said Ed Clissold, the chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research. \u201cOn the positive side, getting frequent updates holds companies accountable. They lay out plans to grow their business, and quarterly updates are a chance for investors to see the progress toward those objectives. The downside is that companies have occasionally managed their businesses to meet those quarterly objectives.\u201dThe paper also found that once companies go public, their appetite for capital spending tends to diminish. That finding is consistent with the idea that being a public company can promote short-term thinking, perhaps because of the scrutiny of disclosures such as quarterly earnings reports. But the authors of the paper also emphasized that other explanations could also be responsible for the shift.Investors, on the other hand, are less likely to support the idea floated by Mr. Trump, which would cut down on the information available about how the companies were performing.\u201cInvestors and other stakeholders benefit when regulations ensure that important information is promptly and transparently provided to the marketplace,\u201d said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group representing large investors such as pension funds and endowments. \u201cInvestors need timely, accurate financial information to make informed investment decisions.\u201dJames Chanos, a well-known investor who specializes in shorting stocks, or betting on their decline, agreed.\u201cI\u2019m in the camp of more disclosure is better than less,\u201d Mr. Chanos said. \u201cAnd the U.S. financial disclosure is the best in the world.\u201dHe added, however, that some elements of the quarterly reporting process should be re-examined, including the \u201crampant\u201d release of quarterly numbers that do not conform to the standard set of accounting rules used in the United States, a practice that often makes a company\u2019s financial results look better.Others argue that longer stretches without corporations providing public information could lead to to abuse by those with inside information.\u201cQuarterly disclosures are very important. A lot can happen in six months, and it\u2019s just not appropriate to reduce disclosures,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, the policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of foundations, unions and public interest groups that pushes for stronger financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to advantage insiders further.\u201dEven those who criticize quarterly earnings may not want to abolish them altogether. In an essay published in The Wall Street Journal this summer, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett said that they favored eliminating quarter-earnings guidance, which are the targets companies hope to hit, but not the quarterly earnings results themselves.\u201cTransparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe support being open with shareholders about actual financial and operational metrics.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $70 Billion Deal for Tesla? Elon Musk Faces 2 Huge Questions", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk is plotting the biggest ever attempt to take a company private, but it\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll pay for it \u2014 or if it\u2019s really worth it.Investors were not too bothered by this lack of clarity: Tesla\u2019s shares jumped 11 percent. They should be.Tesla may find it difficult to line up banks and investors to lend it large sums. Typically, companies taken private have somewhat steady cash flows. Tesla does not. In the second quarter, it recorded another huge loss and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash.Companies that are taken private usually have low valuations and are unloved by investors. Tesla does not fit that description, either, which could prove partly useful.In theory, Mr. Musk could pull off the transaction without taking on massive amounts of debt. He could persuade as many current investors as possible to exchange their public shares for new ones in the private company. The more that agree, the less debt needed.Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, holding 20 percent of its stock. The next four largest hold nearly 30 percent combined. He might not get all of those to buy into his plan. (One, Fidelity, also has a stake in SpaceX, a private company led by Mr. Musk.)He could also turn to his individual investors, who own nearly 13 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. Many of those are incredibly bullish about the company.To increase the chances of success with all of his investors, Mr. Musk has to convince them that their shares in a private Tesla will one day be worth more than the $420 that the transaction offers them.Doing so will require convincing them that Tesla will perform better out of the spotlight. Shareholders would also have to be willing to potentially get less information about the company\u2019s performance and have less opportunity to sell their shares if it is no longer publicly traded.\u201cBeing public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dArguably, though, the public markets have been very good to Tesla. The company has successfully tapped them for capital, and, even when it has racked up losses and consumed cash, its market value has marched higher and higher. Its stock market value currently exceeds that of General Motors.Investors are, in effect, giving Tesla much the same leeway as it would get if it were private. Big institutional shareholders have remained patient as the company strives to achieve long-term objectives, and have stood by the company even when Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior was unorthodox. They have even tolerated a board that has been criticized for its oversight.Investors must now weigh whether giving even more freedom to Mr. Musk, and the extra debt the deal may incur, is worth it. It very well may not be.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s right, a Thursday.The election was initially scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11, but it was changed amid concerns that the date coincided with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana and the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Primary elections generally suffer from abysmal turnout, but the decision by the Legislature to hold the primaries on a Thursday \u2014 rather than another Tuesday \u2014 is likely to confuse voters and to lower turnout further, giving a bigger boost to incumbents. Here are a few ideas to fight back and make these races for governor, attorney general, State Legislature and local judgeships more competitive. Depending on their party registration (and Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two to one in New York), voters have the chance to weigh in on Democratic, Republican or third-party primaries, and even unaffiliated voters can cast ballots, in the Reform Party primary.Mayor Bill de Blasio could ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts by allocating more money to the New York City Campaign Finance Board, a nonpartisan agency that sends people to knock on doors and call voters.The board might even still have time to place ads in subways and buses.

{"Headline": "Colin Kaepernick Is Not Going Away", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballProving that a team or a league colluded to keep a player off the field has been difficult over the years.\u201cSmoking gun\u201d documents that show owners acted in a coordinated way are rare. Aggrieved players have a hard time proving teams deliberately passed them over in favor of less talented alternatives because teams hire and fire players for subjective reasons all the time, and are well within their rights to do so.Then there is the case against the N.F.L. brought by Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has accused the league\u2019s owners of snubbing him because of his decision to protest by kneeling during the national anthem.A case that was originally about Kaepernick\u2019s skills has turned into something much larger: a referendum on his politics, free speech and even his legacy. N.F.L. teams have signed players who have beaten their spouses and run operations that killed dogs for sport, but protesting during the national anthem may prove to be the unforgivable sin, it seems.On Thursday, the arbitrator hearing Kaepernick\u2019s grievance dismissed the N.F.L.\u2019s bid to throw out the case. He determined that Kaepernick\u2019s lawyers had unearthed enough credible evidence during the first stages of discovery to allow the case to go forward.This sets the stage for owners and league executives to be questioned in a trial-like setting. Kaepernick faces an uphill legal battle, but even proceeding to a full hearing amounts to a victory because it allows his lawyers to continue to search for evidence of collusion, while keeping Kaepernick\u2019s name in the news during the N.F.L. season, when attention on football is at its peak.There is a sensible and common solution to get out of this jam: a settlement.The league has been desperately trying to extinguish the continuing protests \u2014 which are an attempt to raise awareness about police brutality and economic inequality \u2014 and the fiery debate they have sparked. But the case is expected to drag on for months, so the league could reach a deal to pay Kaepernick damages equal to twice what he might have made if he were still playing.In a normal case, Kaepernick, who hasn\u2019t played since 2016, might decide he has won enough already, agree to a settlement, walk away with millions of dollars and move on with his life. Or some team in a progressive city could just put Kaepernick on a roster for the season, which could take a lot of steam out of his complaints.This, however, is not a normal case. Both sides appear to be fighting about something larger than dollars.\u201cEveryone should be motivated to settle,\u201d said Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports labor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cThat said, neither Kaepernick nor some of the owners are the type to settle. They are putting principle above money.\u201dKaepernick appears interested in continuing to raise awareness about police brutality and other forms of social injustice, not about winning monetary restitution. While he has not spoken to the media since he filed his grievance in October, he has sent messages about his agenda through social media and a handful of planned public appearances.He has used Twitter to cheer players who continue to protest during the national anthem. Pictures have also surfaced of Kaepernick teaching young people about their rights when approached by police officers. After he received an award from Amnesty International, Kaepernick spoke about his goals of addressing police brutality.Kaepernick has not shied away from taunting the N.F.L. He showed up to the deposition of an N.F.L. owner wearing a black T-shirt with the name Kunta Kinte on it, a reference to the slave at the center of the book and television drama, \u201cRoots.\u201dMany owners, meanwhile, have spoken about wanting the players to stop protesting. In May, they tightened a league policy that now obligates players to stand for the anthem when they are on the field, but it allows players to remain in the locker room if they choose.Some owners said they would not penalize players if they continued to protest on the field, but the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, broke ranks in July when he said that all of his players must stand on the field for the anthem. Jones said he would not even abide by players remaining in the locker room. His son Stephen, the team\u2019s chief operating officer and director of player personnel, suggested that Cowboys players who protested might not be long for the team.Jones is the most outspoken owner to oppose the protests, but he speaks for more than a few of his colleagues. He has also donated to President Trump, who has frequently attacked the owners for not firing players who protest and who publicly praised Jones for his hard-line stance.Jones and the owners who stand with him do not seem willing to settle with Kaepernick, lest they appear to be backtracking, to say nothing of possibly giving him a job. They fear they would alienate the sizable subset of fans upset with the protesting players.\u201cAll of a sudden, the arms of politics could have a far longer reach, where the president can put his finger on the scale and influence how the N.F.L. and players resolve their conflicts,\u201d said Charles Grantham, a former executive with the National Basketball Players Association who now teaches at the Center for Sport Management at Seton Hall University.It is possible, Grantham said, that the arbitrator, in allowing the case to go forward, is in fact nudging the N.F.L. to settle. Like most judges, arbitrators prefer that the two sides come to their own conclusion. At the very least, \u201cit does put pressure on the N.F.L. because it does allow Kaepernick to do more discovery, question witnesses and present this full case in front of the arbitrator,\u201d said Gabe Feldman, who teaches sports law at Tulane University.Then again, the N.F.L. could have settled the case months ago, but chose not to. Kaepernick, too, has shown no interest in that, and for now, at least, he appears to have won the right to continue his crusade.Advertisement"}

Another state-owned Chinese company is revamping a harbor along the fiercely contested South China Sea.Nearby, a rail network mostly financed by a Chinese government bank is being built to speed Chinese goods along a new Silk Road. And a Chinese developer is creating four artificial islands that could become home to nearly three-quarters of a million people and are being heavily marketed to Chinese citizens.Each of these projects is being built in Malaysia, a Southeast Asian democracy at the heart of China\u2019s effort to gain global influence.But where Malaysia once led the pack in courting Chinese investment, it is now on the front edge of a new phenomenon: a pushback against Beijing as nations fear becoming overly indebted for projects that are neither viable nor necessary \u2014 except in their strategic value to China or use in propping up friendly strongmen.His message throughout his meetings with officials, and in public comments, has been unambiguous.\u201cWe do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said on Monday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after meeting with Premier Li Keqiang.For a time it appeared that China\u2019s standard playbook for gaining favor was working in Malaysia. It had successfully courted Mr. Mahathir\u2019s predecessor, Najib Razak, with easy loans and showcase projects, and secured deals that were of strategic value for its ambitions.Mr. Mahathir, 93, was voted into office with a mandate that included getting the country out from under its suffocating debt \u2014 roughly $250 billion of it, some of it owed to Chinese companies.Fears are growing that China is using its overseas spending spree to gain footholds in some of the world\u2019s most strategic places, and perhaps even deliberately luring vulnerable nations into debt traps to increase China\u2019s dominion as the United States\u2019 influence fades in the developing world.\u201cThe Chinese must have been thinking, \u2018We can pick things up for cheap here,\u2019\u201d said Khor Yu Leng, a Malaysian political economist who has been researching China\u2019s investments in Southeast Asia. \u201cThey\u2019ve got enough patient capital to play the long game, wait for the local boys to overextend and then come in and take all that equity for China.\u201dIn his action in Beijing on Tuesday, Mr. Mahathir said he was halting a contract for the China Communications Construction Company to build the East Coast Rail Link, thought to have cost the government around $20 billion, along with a $2.5 billion agreement for an arm of a Chinese energy giant to construct gas pipelines. He had earlier suspended the projects, leading some analysts to believe he wanted to renegotiate the terms during his China trip. Instead, he announced that the deals were off for now.\u201cIt\u2019s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don\u2019t need these projects in Malaysia,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\u201cCountries participating in BRI could develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests,\u201d the report said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation like Sri Lanka where they couldn\u2019t pay and the Chinese ended up taking over the project,\u201d Mr. Lim said.In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mahathir made clear what he thought of China\u2019s strategy.\u201cThey know that when they lend big sums of money to a poor country, in the end they may have to take the project for themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cChina knows very well that it had to deal with unequal treaties in the past imposed upon China by Western powers,\u201d Mr. Mahathir added, referring to the concessions China had to give after its defeat in the opium wars. \u201cSo China should be sympathetic toward us. They know we cannot afford this.\u201dMalaysia has long served as a prize of empire, with a geopolitical importance that belies its relatively small size. The Portuguese, Dutch and British flocked here, eager to control a fulcrum linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans. China is the latest power to try to share in the riches.Kuantan, a Malaysian city nestled on the South China Sea coast, had never been a hot spot. But then China began adding military heft to its territorial aspirations in the sea, where five other governments, Malaysia\u2019s included, have competing claims.Chinese financing began washing over Kuantan five years ago. Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group, a state-owned firm from an obscure Chinese autonomous region, won a contract supported by the Malaysian government to build a deepwater terminal and industrial park. Nearby was a planned stop on the East Coast Rail Link that would mostly be financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, a government institution.Presiding over the official launch for the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park in 2013, Mr. Najib conferred on the project a global import.\u201cChina and Malaysia remain closely connected at a time when the balance of global trade is tilting in Asia\u2019s direction,\u201d he said. \u201cOn economic cooperation \u2014 and diplomatic \u2014 I am proud to say that Malaysia is ahead of the curve.\u201dKuantan residents, though, have long worried that the city could be saddled with white-elephant projects.\u201cWe welcome foreign investment and development, but we question the huge price that we will have to pay,\u201d said Fuziah Salleh, a Kuantan lawmaker for Malaysia\u2019s new governing coalition. \u201cWho is the real beneficiary of all this financing? The Malaysians or the Chinese?\u201d\u201cI am worried that our sovereignty has been sold,\u201d Ms. Fuziah said.Mr. Mahathir, however, is not averse to standing up to the superpower of the day. He was prime minister before, from 1981 to 2003, and back then he railed against the United States and other Western countries for what he said was a plot to hold back developing nations like Malaysia.\u201cMahathir thinks China is a hegemonic force that can control economies like Malaysia,\u201d said Edmund Terence Gomez, a political economist at the University of Malaya. \u201cHe\u2019s always been worried about powerful forces. Before it was the U.S., now it\u2019s China.\u201dMr. Mahathir\u2019s administration has been in power for little more than 100 days. In that time, Malaysian officials say, they have discovered that billions of dollars in inflated Chinese contracts were used to relieve debts associated with a Malaysian state investment fund at the heart of a graft scandal that led to Mr. Najib\u2019s downfall.The United States Department of Justice has accused Mr. Najib and his family and friends of plundering billions of dollars from that fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. When the indebted fund began a fire sale of assets, two Chinese state-owned giants, the China General Nuclear Power Corporation and the China Railway Engineering Corporation, moved in, prompting speculation that Beijing was happy to keep Mr. Najib\u2019s cash-strapped government afloat.Sitting at his desk during an interview after the election, Mr. Mahathir pointed to a sheaf of papers before him. It was a proposal from a Malaysian construction company that he said contained evidence that the East Coast Rail Link could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half of the $13.4 billion contract won by the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned Chinese firm with extensive operations overseas.Notably, the bidding process for the rail contract was closed.Last week, Mr. Lim, the finance minister, told Parliament that Malaysia would not be able to cover the operational cost for the railway, much less the capital expenditure, which he estimated at nearly $20 billion rather than $13.4 billion.Neither the Chinese company nor its Malaysian partner responded to requests for comment.\u201cIt looks like not all the money is being used for building the railway line,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the East Coast Rail Link deal. \u201cThe likelihood is the money has been stolen.\u201dMalaysian investigators are looking into whether an associate of Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson may have brokered the rail deal to alleviate the debt accrued by 1MDB or to fund Mr. Najib\u2019s re-election campaign.Malaysia\u2019s new administration, which unseated a coalition that had ruled, in one form or another, since independence in 1957, has also been scrutinizing the $2.5 billion deal for a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation to build energy pipelines in Malaysia. Mr. Lim said he had discovered upon taking up his post that the Malaysian government had already disbursed more than $2 billion for the project.There was one catch. \u201cFrom what we understand,\u201d Mr. Lim said, \u201czero percent of the construction work has been carried out.\u201dWhile the role of Chinese money in bailing out Mr. Najib\u2019s indebted administration has received the most attention, another Chinese megaproject raises even sharper questions about Beijing\u2019s geopolitical aims.The Malaysian city of Malacca was once a conduit for spices and treasures that flowed from Asia to Europe. The strait named after the city is still the channel through which much of Asia\u2019s seaborne trade \u2014 and most of China\u2019s oil imports \u2014 flows.But Malacca\u2019s port silted up centuries ago and is now a backwater. Instead, nearby Singapore, which sits at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca, ranks as the world\u2019s busiest transshipment hub.A $10 billion development project \u2014 backed by PowerChina International, a major Chinese utility, and two Chinese port developers \u2014 is supposed to propel Malacca back into global significance, as a vital stop on a maritime trade route that stretches from Shanghai to Rotterdam.The plan for this project, Melaka Gateway, includes three artificial islands and an expanded natural islet, which will hold an industrial park, cruise terminal, theme park, marina, offshore financial hub and self-styled seven-star hotel.And there will be a new deepwater port, with berths large enough to host an aircraft carrier. The port operator was given a 99-year lease for the deepwater terminal, rather than the more common 30-year time frame.The local partner in Melaka Gateway is KAJ Development, which counts among its previous accomplishments building the local zoo and bird park.To explain how a little-known company was able to work with Chinese firms to transform such a strategic spot, locals have remarked on the close ties between the head of KAJ Development and Mr. Najib\u2019s party machine. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cWe have so many questions about the project but no answers,\u201d said Sim Tong Him, a former lawmaker from Malacca. \u201cHow did KAJ get the contract? What might happen if the Malaysian side can\u2019t pay up? The Chinese are so secretive about this. It leaves us with a very bad feeling.\u201dMalacca State\u2019s new chief minister has promised an investigation into the feasibility of the entire project, including the possibility that land on one island could be sold as a freehold to a Chinese state-owned company.Melaka Gateway\u2019s necessity, at least for locals, has never been clear. After all, the nearby Singaporean port is unlikely to be eclipsed. And Malaysia is already expanding other ports, even as many are running under capacity.\u201cWe are very concerned because in the first place we don\u2019t need any extra harbor,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the Malacca project.\u201cWe don\u2019t have to depend upon foreigners to come,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they build, they use foreign labor, foreign materials. What do we get? Nothing.\u201dBut Beijing has funded the building of ports across the Indian Ocean, a strategy known as the string of pearls. Military experts have raised the possibility that these ports could one day welcome Chinese warships and submarines.\u201cYou look at a map and you can see the places where China is plotting ports and investments, from Myanmar to Pakistan to Sri Lanka, on toward Djibouti,\u201d said Liew Chin Tong, Malaysia\u2019s deputy defense minister. \u201cWhat\u2019s crucial to all that? Our little Malaysia, and the Malacca Strait.\u201dUnder Mr. Najib, Malaysia conducted joint military drills with China and allowed Chinese attack submarines to make a port call. Mr. Mahathir has shifted course.\u201cI say publicly that we do not want to see warships in the Strait of Malacca or the South China Sea,\u201d he said.Forest City, he said in Mandarin, was a jewel on the South China Sea.Best of all, he said, everything in the city was designed for a Chinese clientele, from the layout of the luxury apartments to the signage in Mandarin.The development \u2014 four artificial islands covering around eight square miles, or enough space for around 700,000 people \u2014 was conceived of by Country Garden, one of the largest private Chinese property developers, in cooperation with an investment entity whose largest shareholder is the local sultan.In the sales gallery, an electronic display plays up Forest City\u2019s \u201cstrategic location\u201d and places it at the center of a map of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative projects.\u201cWe are doing something that will alter the world map,\u201d the sales pitch reads.More than any other project, Forest City helped turn local sentiment against Chinese cash, amid suspicions that a private Chinese property developer was somehow secretly plotting to reshape Malaysia\u2019s delicate ethnic balance.\u201cThis is not Chinese investment but a settlement,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said during the election campaign, using Forest City as a frequent punching bag.Forest City is not a strategic play by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army to station warships in Malaysia. Nor is it viewed as a way for Beijing to finance the excesses of a corrupt leader. Instead, it represents something even more alarming to the average Malaysian \u2014 four man-made islands on which Chinese can live as they like and, in the process, dilute the Malaysian national identity.Although the majority of Malaysians are Malay Muslims, the country\u2019s second largest ethnic group is Chinese, followed by an Indian population. Many Chinese migrated to Malaysia during the colonial era, and the feeling that they were given preferential treatment by the British lingers to this day.Affirmative action programs that gained full force during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s first stint as prime minister ensure that Malays and indigenous populations get a leg up over ethnic Chinese Malaysians.In that context, the prospect of a new wave of Chinese migration, even if only a population of part-time sunbirds, is politically sensitive in Malaysia.But what if that wave doesn\u2019t even materialize? Capital controls in China have made it far more difficult for Chinese to get their money out to pay for overseas real estate, worrying the Mandarin-speaking sales staff at Forest City. Who will buy all these condominiums, which are priced far above the local property market, if not the Chinese?\u201cWe all want Forest City to succeed, because we cannot afford for it to fail and become an empty ghost city,\u201d said Wong Shu Qi, a member of parliament for the Democratic Action Party, which is part of the governing coalition.\u201cThe reality is that wishing for a Chinese concession in Malaysia is the best thing we can hope for,\u201d she added. \u201cHow sad is that?\u201dSharon Tan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tommy Robinson, Anti-Muslim Activist, Is Freed on Bail in U.K.", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Tommy Robinson, the jailed British far-right activist backed by the former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon but reviled by others who call him a violent purveyor of hate, was ordered to be freed on bail Wednesday, after challenging his conviction for contempt of court.Who is Tommy Robinson?Mr. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, is the founder of the English Defense League, an anti-Islam and anti-immigration movement known for violent street protests.Born and raised in Luton, north of London, he worked at the town\u2019s international airport but lost that job after assaulting an off-duty police officer. He was also arrested after being accused of inciting soccer violence, as a supporter of the Luton soccer club.\u201cWherever he has gone in his career he organized demonstrations that have resulted in extreme violence,\u201d said Joe Mulhall, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate, an organization in London that researches hate groups.In 2012, Mr. Robinson was jailed for trying to enter the United States on somebody else\u2019s passport, and broke ties with the English Defense League.He founded a local branch of the German anti-Islam movement, Pegida, which was known for mass demonstrations against Islam in cities in eastern Germany. He drew support from right-wing politicians in Europe, like Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom.He contends that Muslims are disproportionately responsible for crime in Britain, particularly crimes against women and girls.He has claimed that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, \u201cis busy enforcing elements of Shariah right now.\u201dAnd he says that the people presented by mainstream media as moderate Muslims are actually dangerous extremists.Mr. Robinson was arrested outside a court in Leeds during a child sexual abuse trial. The restrictions on the news media in this case were common practice in England for trials in which judges fear that any media reports could influence the outcome.He had live streamed on Facebook for over an hour outside Leeds Crown Court, near the entrance, on May 25. In the broadcast, he revealed the identities of the defendants and the charges against them, and confronted some of them as they arrived in court.This fits very much Mr. Robinson\u2019s playbook, said Julia Ebner, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic Dialog, which works to counter extremism.\u201cEvery time he wants a campaign to go viral, he manages to trigger that with some provocative tweet or video,\u201d Ms. Ebner said. \u201cHe knew, of course, that he was crossing the boundaries of the law, but he did it because he has to feed his fan base through provocative actions.\u201dMr. Robinson and his supporters have argued that his case was about free speech. Yet, at rallies in Central London, his supporters were allowed to set up a stage and speak through loudspeakers near Britain\u2019s center of power.The judge added that an aggravating feature was that Mr. Robinson had encouraged others to share the video.Mr. Robinson attacked the judgment on a procedural basis, arguing that the court in Leeds had dealt with him summarily, as his sentence was pronounced hours after his broadcast occurred.\u201cTommy Robinson is not innocent today,\u201d Mr. Mulhall said, \u201cdespite how his supporters are attempting already to spin this.\u201dMr. Robinson previously had a nearly identical run-in with the law, after he broadcast video during the 2017 trial of four men who were later convicted of gang-raping a teenage girl. In that case, he was convicted of contempt of court, but received a suspended sentence.Mr. Robinson holds a prominent place among far-right groups, especially in the United States, who argued that his conviction had been in breach of free speech.He said, \u201cYou lose guys like Tommy Robinson you\u2019re not going to have a country.\u201dMr. Mulhall, of Hope Not Hate, said of Mr. Robinson, \u201cHe has become a rallying point around which people on the international far right have gathered.\u201dThis support has allowed Mr. Robinson, who had no regular income, to finance his activities through crowdfunding and financial help from like-minded organizations.While alliances among nationalist groups may seem a contradiction and have failed in the past, this new form of \u201cnationalist networking\u201d has been a success, Ms. Ebner said.\u201cBy partnering up internationally, they can really influence political discourse in their home countries by having such a loud voice,\u201d she said.Mr. Robinson is \u201cemblematic of the climate in which we are operating, the diminished power and importance of truth,\u201d Mr. Mulhall said, adding that the campaign for Mr. Robinson was \u201cin line in many ways with what we saw around the election of Donald Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vatican Calls Abuses by Pennsylvania Priests \u2018Criminal and Morally Reprehensible\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Vatican responded on Thursday to the horrors of a Pennsylvania grand jury report on clergy sex abuse, saying it felt shame and sorrow over the findings that more than 1,000 children had been abused by hundreds of priests over decades while bishops covered up their crimes.\u201cVictims should know that the pope is on their side,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose who have suffered are his priority, and the church wants to listen to them to root out this tragic horror that destroys the lives of the innocent.\u201dIt was one of the strongest mea culpas to date on an issue that Pope Francis has tried to address head-on in recent months, after mounting criticism that the pope had a blind spot when it came to dealing with the sexual abuse of minors by clerics.As part of what appeared to be a coordinated response intended to stem a spiraling crisis within the Roman Catholic Church in America, the head of the American bishops also released a statement on Thursday that contained the first outlines of how the bishops plan to reform the church in reaction to the abuse revelations, as well as emotional pleas for forgiveness.Mirroring the language of the Vatican, Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, expressed shame and remorse, acknowledging that much of the blame lay on the shoulders of bishops and promising that there would be change.\u201cI apologize and humbly ask your forgiveness for what my brother bishops and I have done and failed to do,\u201d Cardinal DiNardo wrote. \u201cWhatever the details may turn out to be regarding Archbishop McCarrick or the many abuses in Pennsylvania (or anywhere else), we already know that one root cause is the failure of episcopal leadership. The result was that scores of beloved children of God were abandoned to face an abuse of power alone.\u201dTo address what he called a \u201cmoral catastrophe,\u201d Cardinal DiNardo called for a Vatican-led investigation into the abuses of Archbishop McCarrick and questions surrounding them. He also called for improved channels to report complaints against bishops, including new review bodies that would be able to operate with independence, and \u201csubstantial leadership by laity.\u201dAmerican Catholics have been deeply shaken by the recent abuse revelations, which come after years in which the church insisted that the problem of clergy sex abuse had largely been dealt with after reforms passed in 2002.\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that they will follow through with everything, but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said Ian McMeans, 32, a churchgoing father of four who lives outside of Pittsburgh.The revelation that Cardinal McCarrick, who was first removed from ministry on June 20 after a substantiated complaint of abuse against an altar boy, was able to rise to the highest levels of the church in America despite repeated warnings that he was routinely sleeping with seminarians generated deep anger among American Catholics. Then a man, known only as James, came forward to accuse Cardinal McCarrick, a close family friend, of molesting him over two decades, beginning when he was 11. Compounding the sense of hypocrisy, Cardinal McCarrick had been a prominent voice for adopting the 2002 reforms.When the clergy sex scandal broke 16 years ago, some staunch Catholics defended the church, calling the outpouring of abuse stories anti-Catholic. This time, Catholics across the political spectrum in America are united in the belief that something must be done, prominent Catholics said.Brian Burch, the president of Catholic Vote, a Catholic organization for supporting conservative social causes, said that conservatives \u201cunderstood there was a problem, and we knew that it hadn\u2019t been totally resolved since 2002.\u201d\u201cBut having now seen the evidence of how bad it really is, it is even worse than we thought. And this has caused an unbelievable amount of discouragement and despair on the part of the laity about what the future holds for the institution of the church.\u201d\u201cIn terms of having watched this over 15 years, I have never seen a reaction like I saw over the grand jury report, even among bishops,\u201d said Rocco Palmo, a well-known Catholic commentator and blogger based in Philadelphia. \u201cJust a sense of complete horror and disgust.\u201d\u201cThis is worse than 2002, and they know that,\u201d Mr. Faggioli said. \u201cThey know that the future of the U.S. church is not clear. Because if you look at the rage that there is out there, you don\u2019t know what kind of trust there is left between the people and the leaders. And this is not something that can be played according to the usual rules.\u201dPope Francis seemed to acknowledge the depth of the crisis in the Vatican statement, which was released by Greg Burke, the director of the Holy See Press Office.\u201cThe Holy Father,\u201d the Vatican said Thursday, \u201cunderstands well how much these crimes can shake the faith and the spirt of believers and reiterates the call to make every effort to create a safe environment for minors and vulnerable adults in the church and in all of society.\u201dIn its statement, the Vatican noted that the grand jury mostly referred to cases dating back decades, a sign that headway had been made in the United States when it came to this blight. \u201cBy finding almost no cases after 2002, the grand jury\u2019s conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse,\u201d the statement said.In its recommendations, the grand jury report called for lifting the criminal statute of limitations on sex abuse crimes and giving all victims an opportunity to sue the Roman Catholic Church in Pennsylvania, no matter how long ago the abuse occurred. Bishops in Pennsylvania have been actively lobbying against those reforms, a fact not lost on the official who investigated the church\u2019s actions.\u201cI appreciate the validation of our work in Pennsylvania and the expression of remorse on behalf of Pope Francis,\u201d said Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, reacting to the pope\u2019s statement. \u201cI hope that under the Holy Father\u2019s leadership, the church will now embrace and support the grand jury\u2019s recommendations.\u201dCampbell Robertson contributed reporting from Pittsburgh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Zimbabwe Is the New Zimbabwe ", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZimbabwe\u2019s constitutional court has upheld the election of Emmerson Mnangagwa as the president of the country. Ms. Chigumadzi is the author of a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe.According to the official results, the incumbent ZANU-PF led by Mr. Mnangagwa narrowly won the elections \u2014 the first after the fall of Robert Mugabe \u2014 with 50.8 percent of the vote, and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance led by Nelson Chamisa won 44.3 percent of the vote. Mr. Chamisa disputed the results, describing them as \u201cfraudulent, illegal and illegitimate,\u201d and claimed he had won 56 percent of the vote. On Aug. 10, he challenged the results in the constitutional court, which led to the postponement of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s inauguration. Despite the opposition\u2019s optimism, the legal challenge was not expected to succeed owing to the judiciary\u2019s tilt toward ZANU-PF since independence from British colonial rule in 1980. Mr. Mnangagwa, as mandated by the constitution, is expected to take the oath as president within 48 hours of the court\u2019s ruling. After replacing Mr. Mugabe in November, Mr. Mnangagwa has been eager to gain legitimacy and would repeatedly say in public that \u201cthe people\u2019s voice is the voice of God.\u201d The ouster of Mr. Mugabe did bring about the end of petty oppression. The police stopped harassing and taking bribes from drivers on the roads. Zimbabweans actively exercised their newfound freedom to speak out: Many energetically insulted President Mnangagwa in their comments on his social media accounts. Murehwa, my ancestral village in Zimbabwe, is a ZANU-PF stronghold. In late March, as the campaign season was picking up, my family was surprised to see Mr. Chamisa lead the first opposition rally in the area in years, without any incident. In April, I attended a performance of \u201cOperation Restore Regasi,\u201d a political satire about the ouster of Mr. Mugabe, in Harare. The play was directed by the celebrated Zimbabwean playwright Daves Guzha. Despite these tentative democratic openings, the cynicism about a fair electoral process remained. On the eve of the elections, a young cousin who supports the charismatic and young Mr. Chamisa remarked, \u201cThe boy will win, but the old man will rule.\u201d Many of us, though hopeful about change, were hard-pressed to see an outcome where the old men, the veterans of the liberation struggle of the 1970s, would cede to young Mr. Chamisa the power they consolidated after deposing Mr. Mugabe. The actions of the military and police after the elections made it clear that in Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s \u201cNew Zimbabwe,\u201d citizens enjoy their constitutional rights at the discretion of the state. Members of the opposition parties continued to be harassed, assaulted and arrested. On Aug. 4, riot police interrupted a news conference held by Mr. Chamisa in Harare. To control the bad press, Mr. Mnangagwa sent a minister to disperse the riot police, tweeted his regrets and promised an independent investigation. The police have reportedly suspended 16 officers for their conduct during the crackdown on postelection demonstrations.Police had also charged Tendai Biti, an opposition leader and former finance minister, with inciting violence and protests by proclaiming that the opposition had won the elections. A threatened Mr. Biti sought refuge in Zambia but the Zambian officials handed him over to Zimbabwean police. When Mr. Biti was produced in a Harare court, many foreign diplomats and election observers attended to observe the proceedings. Mr. Biti\u2019s case became a test of Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s treatment of his political opponents and had ramifications for Zimbabwe\u2019s attempts to better its relations with the global political and business community in the post-Mugabe world. The United States, the European Union, the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees and several additional countries criticized the mistreatment of the opposition leaders and activists. To contain the fallout, Mr. Mnangagwa tweeted that he had \u201cintervened\u201d to ensure that Mr. Biti gets bail and is released. Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s announcement revealed the judiciary\u2019s lack of independence from the governing party. The new United States law insists that the recent Zimbabwean election must be \u201cwidely accepted as free and fair,\u201d and its army has to act as \u201cnonpartisan\u201d and \u201crespect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons,\u201d before the sanctions can be removed. Without shedding the sanctions, Zimbabwe cannot readily get loans from global financial institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The sanctions ban defense-related trade with Zimbabwe as well as government assistance for numerous programs.The postelection repression and the renewed American sanctions are derailing Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s attempts to find international acceptance and secure funding from the international community to rebuild Zimbabwe\u2019s fragile economy. Zimbabwe is rife with tales of multiple centers of power within the establishment. Many believe that Mr. Chiwenga, the army general who ensured Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ouster and Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s ascension as president, is the power behind the throne. As with Mr. Mugabe, the biggest challenge to Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s rule is likely to come from his own ranks.

{"Headline": "Trump Organization Could Face Criminal Charges From Manhattan D.A.", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is considering pursuing criminal charges against the Trump Organization and two senior company officials in connection with Michael D. Cohen\u2019s hush money payment to an adult film actress, according to two officials with knowledge of the matter.A state investigation would center on how the company accounted for its reimbursement to Mr. Cohen for the $130,000 he paid to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, who has said she had an affair with President Trump, the officials said.Both officials stressed that the office\u2019s review of the matter is in its earliest stages and prosecutors have not yet made a decision on whether to proceed.State charges against the company or its executives could be significant because Mr. Trump has talked about pardoning some of his current or former aides who have faced federal charges. As president, he has no power to pardon people and corporate entities convicted of state crimes.\u201cOn its face, it certainly would be problematic,\u201d said one of the officials familiar with the district attorney\u2019s office review, noting that listing the reimbursement as a legal expense could be a felony under state law.The Trump Organization\u2019s lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, declined to comment.As the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., considers opening an investigation, the New York State attorney general\u2019s office has moved to open a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Cohen has violated state tax law, an inquiry that would be unrelated to the federal tax evasion charges that he pleaded guilty to on Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of the state matter.The attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, in recent days sought a referral from the state Department of Taxation and Finance, which is needed to conduct such an inquiry and to prosecute any violations of state tax law it might uncover, the person said. Such requests are seldom denied. The state\u2019s double jeopardy laws do not apply to tax crimes.Mr. Cohen\u2019s Washington lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, declined to comment.Prosecutors in the district attorney\u2019s office have reviewed the court papers containing the campaign finance charges and other federal crimes to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday in United States District Court in Manhattan, the officials said. The papers provide some details about how two Trump Organization executives handled the reimbursement and recorded them as legal fees.Manhattan prosecutors are focused on whether business records were falsified, one of the officials said. That could be charged as a low-level felony, or as a misdemeanor. It\u2019s a misdemeanor for a person or company to make a false entry in a business record or cause one to be made, with intent to defraud. It becomes a felony if it is done to commit or conceal another crime.One of the officials stressed that a state investigation into possible violations of state law could be complicated or delayed by three other open inquiries relating to Mr. Trump: The federal investigation into Mr. Cohen; the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election; and a lawsuit that the state attorney general has brought against the Trump Foundation, a charity.Court papers in the federal case against Mr. Cohen said he ultimately received $420,000 from the Trump Organization to reimburse him for his $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford. That is because the Trump Organization included money to cover his taxes on the $130,000, a bonus for him and reimbursement for other campaign expenses.The company, according to the court papers, accounted for the payment as legal expenses and Mr. Cohen issued phony monthly invoices for $35,000 \u201cpursuant to retainer agreement.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and China to Rekindle Trade Talks as More Tariffs Loom", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and China will return to the negotiating table late this month in an attempt to ease months of tensions that have been building since trade talks broke down this year and both countries began imposing escalating rounds of tariffs on each other.The talks come as the trade relationship between the two countries faces further deterioration. The Trump administration is preparing far more expansive tariff measures, including levies on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products that are expected to go into effect next Thursday. The administration is also scheduled to hold six days of hearings over the next two weeks to allow up to 370 witnesses to weigh in on plans for tariffs on a further $200 billion worth of Chinese products, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative said.If all of those tariffs go into effect, the United States would be taxing roughly half of the goods it imports from China each year, raising prices for a broad swath of manufacturers, retailers and other industries.The meeting between midlevel officials is a departure from the formal rounds of talks between top economic teams from the United States and China that took place during the early days of the Trump administration and the trade meetings led by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier in charge of economic policy, this spring.Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, sought to lower expectations on Thursday and insisted that President Trump had no intention of backing down on his demands.\u201cAny time you\u2019re talking, that\u2019s better than not talking,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said in an interview with CNBC.Mr. Kudlow said that the demands of the United States have not changed, and that China must lower its tariff and non-tariff barriers and cease the theft of American intellectual property.\u201cThe Chinese government in its totality must not underestimate President Trump\u2019s toughness and willingness to continue this battle,\u201d Mr. Kudlow added.Beyond tariffs, currency concerns have re-emerged as an issue in the Trump administration, and they are expected to come up during this round of talks.The value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has fallen roughly 10 percent against the dollar since the beginning of April, a change that makes Chinese products cheaper for foreigners to purchase and helps offset the impact of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs.Economists say the currency has weakened because of market forces and the strengthening of the dollar, as well as the influence of the Chinese government, which sets a baseline for the currency and then allows its value to fluctuate within a narrow band.That drop in value will put pressure on the Treasury Department in advance of an October report in which Mr. Mnuchin is charged with deciding whether to label countries currency manipulators. So far, the Trump administration has declined to give China the label, saying that while China manipulated its currency in the past, that problem had dissipated for now.But in the last month, China\u2019s currency has once again become a target for Mr. Trump.In its coming talks, the Treasury Department will seek to pressure the Chinese to lift the value of their currency, a person briefed on the plans said. But additional American tariff measures going into effect in coming months could further push down the value of the renminbi against the dollar, complicating those efforts.The Trump administration is engaged in trade clashes on multiple fronts, as American negotiators seek to wrap up talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico and hold additional talks with European and Japanese counterparts in coming months.In the meantime, talks with China have moved slowly. The White House has seemed unimpressed by China\u2019s offers to purchase tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of additional American products, which Trump administration trade officials say fall short of the substantial changes they want China to make to its partly state-run economy.Mr. Malpass is even less empowered than Mr. Mnuchin to strike a deal, and while the Treasury Department has been the agency most aggressively pushing for a trade truce, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, led by Robert E. Lighthizer, is formally charged with overseeing the lists of Chinese goods facing tariffs.At the Group of 20 summit meeting of finance ministers in Argentina last month, Mr. Mnuchin said that he had engaged only in \u201cchitchat\u201d with his Chinese counterparts and that the ball was in China\u2019s court to initiate a breakthrough.\u201cThis looks like it will be a waste of time for the two govts,\u201d Scott Kennedy, the director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on Twitter. \u201cWho thinks US Treasury Dept is empowered to make THE deal to end the trade war?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Trump\u2019s Missing Signature Force Him to Testify?", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the history of presidential scandals, it is often hidden things that end up proving decisive. Think, for example, of Monica Lewinsky\u2019s stained blue dress or of Richard M. Nixon\u2019s secret Oval Office tapes.The missing item is the signature that Mr. Trump failed to place on Ms. Clifford\u2019s non-disclosure deal. If her lawyer has his way, there is a chance that inch-long blank space could force Mr. Trump to testify about what he knew of the arrangement.In admitting to the scheme, Mr. Cohen not only implicated himself, but also possibly his former boss, in a violation of federal campaign-finance law. It remains unclear, however, whether Mr. Trump, as president, can be held accountable for that offense.That\u2019s where the missing signature comes in.Earlier this year, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, claiming that the non-disclosure contract was \u201cnull and void\u201d because Mr. Trump left empty the line where he was meant to write his name. Mr. Avenatti has also said it is unenforceable because it broke the law.But now that Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty, he may no longer be able \u2014 or choose \u2014 to use his Fifth Amendment\u2019s safeguards. Because of that development, Mr. Avenatti asked the judge in court papers filed on Monday night to let him take the president\u2019s deposition. He also said he wanted documents from Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen about \u201call factual matters\u201d regarding the agreement with Ms. Clifford.The legal maneuver is arguably something of a longshot. Still, if Mr. Avenatti is permitted to depose Mr. Trump, he could direct his inquiries toward several unanswered questions that have lingered at the heart of the hush-money arrangement:Was Mr. Cohen indeed reimbursed, as prosecutors claim, by the Trump Organization? Which executives there were involved in the transaction? Was the payment made, as Mr. Cohen noted in his guilty plea, to influence the election?The agreement silencing Ms. Clifford was dated Oct. 28, 2016, and was meant to be signed by four people: her first lawyer, Keith Davidson; Mr. Cohen; Ms. Clifford herself (who was identified as \u201cPeggy Peterson\u201d); and Mr. Trump (who was identified as \u201cDavid Dennison\u201d).While it may be curious that Mr. Trump never signed the deal, the omission squares with his latest explanation for his role in the imbroglio.After denying for months that he had sex with \u2014 or paid \u2014 Ms. Clifford, the president said last week that even though he was the source of the money, Mr. Cohen struck the deal without his knowledge and that he learned about it only after it was inked.Charles J. Harder, a lawyer representing Mr. Trump, did not return phone calls seeking comment on the suit. But in Monday\u2019s court filing, he argued that the case should be stayed at least until after Mr. Cohen is sentenced in December.Legal experts were divided about whether Mr. Avenatti had sufficient legal grounds to take Mr. Trump\u2019s deposition.\u201cThis is exactly the kind thing that Avenatti can take a deposition about,\u201d said Debra Katz, an employment and whistleblower lawyer based in Washington who has negotiated several non-disclosure deals. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no criminal case pending now and Cohen is out of jeopardy, it would be appropriate for the court to lift the stay and let the case go forward.\u201dFirst, Mr. Wigdor said, Mr. Cohen could ask for the stay to remain because his guilty plea does not protect him from other potential charges, and he could still invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. It also often happens, Mr. Wigdor said, that executives of companies are sued, and the companies themselves negotiate deals and pay settlements without the executives being involved.As long as Ms. Clifford was paid, Mr. Wigdor added, \u201cTrump could have known or not known \u2014 signed or not signed \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dIf it could be proven, Mr. Wigdor said, that the two lawyers did collude with one another \u2014 especially for Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit \u2014 then Mr. Avenatti would have \u201ca stronger argument\u201d for asking Mr. Trump what he knew about the deal.The president could only be deposed, Ms. Troiani said, if he continues seeking to enforce the deal.\u201cIf there is no contract, then no one is breach of it \u2014 and it\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cMy advice?

{"Headline": "\u2018The Biggest Climate Story No One Is Talking About\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week: Germany\u2019s moment of reckoning, a new way to forecast future temperatures and the last of the fin whale hunters.Germany, which has long cast itself as a global leader in the fight against climate change, is facing a moment of reckoning.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest climate story no one is talking about,\u201d said Justin Guay, director of clean energy at the ClimateWorks Foundation.Getting rid of coal power is a huge challenge. Even as Germany has scaled up wind and solar, it has also been shutting down its low-carbon nuclear plants. Coal \u2014 the most carbon-intensive energy source \u2014 has been largely left untouched, and now generates 40 percent of the country\u2019s electricity. Much of that is from lignite, a low-grade and particularly dirty form of coal.And politicians have been reluctant to confront the influential coal industry, which employs some 32,000 workers and has been the backbone of the country\u2019s industrial base.So, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel did what politicians often do when faced with a thorny policy challenge: They kicked the issue to a commission, with representatives from government, industry groups, labor unions and environmental organizations. The task force is supposed to negotiate a date by which coal in Germany should be phased out. It will also propose a plan to aid workers who will be hurt by the transition.Germany has set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and another 15 percent by 2030. Many analysts think the country will miss those targets unless most coal plants either shut down or start capturing and burying their emissions by 2030.Faced with a choice between cutting emissions rapidly or avoiding social disruption, the commission may opt for the latter, some analysts say. \u201cI would be surprised if they agreed to an end date before the 2040s,\u201d said Rebecca Bertram, an energy expert with the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation in Germany.The commission\u2019s final report is due in December, when the world\u2019s nations will meet for a fresh round of climate talks in Poland, another European country that relies heavily on coal. What Germany decides could have ripple effects around the world.\u201cIf Germany takes it easy on coal, it will be a lot harder for climate negotiators to go to Poland and say you need to close your plants,\u201d Mr. Marquina said.What does this mean in practical terms? Not much. But the specific prediction matters less than how the researchers arrived at it: by using a model that could be run on a laptop.Ordinarily, the sheer volume of data involved in simulating the Earth\u2019s climate necessitates the use of intense computing power. \u201cWhen you do a typical climate model, they are run on supercomputer,\u201d said Florian S\u00e9vellec, a professor in ocean physics at the University of Southampton and an author of the study.But Dr. S\u00e9vellec\u2019s method, rather than simulating the entire climate system, uses a statistical forecasting model that requires much less computing power. That could eventually benefit regional forecasters in parts of the world where access to supercomputers is scarce.The researchers developed the model by leveraging a number of existing climate and weather simulations. By looking at how temperatures changed from year to year in these simulations, they could develop a statistical model to predict how temperatures will evolve in the future.The model projects that the next five years are likely to be warmer than they would normally be, even when human greenhouse gas emissions are taken into account, because of \u201cthe internal variability of the climate.\u201dMany of the benefits of the new model are still to come, Dr. S\u00e9vellec said. \u201cWhere it might be useful for more people is if we are able to move to a regional version of our predictions, being able to predict for North America, Africa and so on,\u201d he said.\u201cThen I can imagine it will be quite interesting for some scientists to use this method rather than a supercomputer which they may not have access to.\u201dYou could say Kristjan Loftsson is keeping a legacy alive.Mr. Loftsson, 75, runs the last commercial fin whale hunting operation in the world. Last month, I sat down with him in a restaurant by the harbor in Reykjavik, Iceland.He told me the story of how after World War II, his father and his partners set up a whaling station on an abandoned Allied naval base in a fjord north of the city. That\u2019s where Mr. Loftsson spent many of his childhood summers, he told me, sleeping in a corrugated metal hut and watching as whales were brought to shore. After his father died, he took over the company.When the photographer Bara Kristinsdottir and I were driving up to the station to see the processing of a fin whale, she pulled over to take pictures of one of Mr. Loftsson\u2019s old whaling boats chugging along the fjord, hauling its catch to the station. The boat is 70 years old, and Mr. Loftsson says it runs partly on whale oil. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs Is Said to Be Under U.S. Scrutiny in Malaysian Inquiry", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors in Los Angeles drafted a criminal complaint against a former Goldman Sachs banker early this year for his alleged role in a vast Malaysian fraud, but the charges were never filed because of a Justice Department turf battle, according to two people familiar with the investigation.Now, these people and two others say, the inquiry is solely in the hands of federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who are investigating a target much bigger than a single Wall Street banker: Goldman Sachs itself.The investigation centers on the disappearance of about $4 billion from a giant Malaysian government investment fund known formally as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.Goldman provided an array of services to the fund, including helping it sell billions of dollars in bonds to investors. The bank earned about $600 million in fees for its work. Authorities are examining whether the firm played a role in the 1MDB fraud or should have done more to uncover the misappropriation of funds, the four people said.Goldman has repeatedly played down its role in the 1MDB scandal, saying it was unaware of how money from the fund was being used. The firm has said it was cooperating with the investigation. \u201cGoldman Sachs had no visibility into whether some of the funds we helped raise for 1MDB may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes,\u201d said Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman.The investigation is one of the marquee efforts by government authorities under President Trump to pursue a top Wall Street firm. Since the financial crisis, Goldman\u2019s prestige and profitability have made it an enticing target for prosecutors, and the 1MDB case has attracted the interest of law-enforcement authorities in multiple jurisdictions in the United States and in several other countries.The result of the tug-of-war within the Justice Department is that the investigation is now more intensively focused on the potential culpability of Goldman Sachs, the four people said.Officials in the United States attorney\u2019s office in the Central District of California, in Los Angeles, have spent nearly three years investigating the 1MDB case. In January, prosecutors from that office told their counterparts in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn, that they planned to criminally charge the former Goldman Sachs investment banker, Tim Leissner, who had worked closely with the Malaysian fund, two of the people familiar with the investigation said.The prosecutors in California hoped to use the charges against Mr. Leissner as leverage to negotiate a plea agreement with him and to secure his cooperation in potential cases against several other people, one of the people said. The charges that were drawn up against Mr. Leissner included an accusation that he had provided misleading information to Goldman, something he was previously sanctioned for by securities regulators in Singapore.The prosecutors in Brooklyn, who joined the investigation about two years ago, objected to the filing of charges against Mr. Leissner, which they said would hamper their investigation into Goldman\u2019s possible role in the scandal, the people said. The worry was that accusing Mr. Leissner of tricking Goldman could undermine their case by casting the firm as a victim, one of the people said.The unusual dispute between the United States attorneys\u2019 offices eventually made its way to Justice Department headquarters in Washington, which also has been heavily involved in the investigation. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, sided with the prosecutors in Brooklyn, handing them full responsibility for the 1MDB criminal investigation, the four people said. The prosecutors in Los Angeles were left to pursue civil cases involving the forfeiture of assets bought in the United States with money diverted from the investment fund.The prosecutors in Brooklyn are now considering their own criminal charges against Mr. Leissner, which they hope will motivate him to cooperate and to provide more information about Goldman\u2019s overall role and the roles played by others at the Wall Street firm, the people said.Mr. Leissner recently hired Robert E. O\u2019Neill, a former United States attorney in Florida, to negotiate with the Brooklyn prosecutors. Mr. O\u2019Neill did not respond to requests for comment. Marc Harris, another criminal defense lawyer representing Mr. Leissner, declined to comment.When the prosecutors in Brooklyn started to investigate the matter in late 2016, a few months after the first civil forfeiture action was filed, their interest was on whether Goldman and other financial institutions had done enough to stop the fraud, the four people said. Since then, authorities in Brooklyn have focused primarily on Goldman\u2019s activities.Goldman has disclosed receiving subpoenas \u201cfrom various governmental and regulatory bodies\u201d as part of the 1MDB investigation. The bank has sought to distance itself from Mr. Leissner, who left Goldman in early 2016 after Goldman learned that he had provided Mr. Low with a reference in an unauthorized letter.\u201cSince we suspended Mr. Leissner, we have discovered certain activities he undertook that were deliberately hidden from the firm, which we have brought to the attention of the relevant authorities who continue to receive our full cooperation,\u201d said Mr. DuVally, the Goldman spokesman.Earlier this year, Malaysian voters ousted Mr. Razak, who was prime minister when the money was allegedly siphoned out of 1MDB. Authorities believe that some of the diverted money went into bank accounts and limited liability companies controlled by Mr. Low, Mr. Razak and the former prime minister\u2019s family and friends.A representative for Mr. Low\u2019s lawyers declined to comment.Follow Matthew Goldstein on Twitter @mattgoldstein26Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The 52 Places Traveler: A Road (and River) Trip Through Western Germany", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlace 31A four-day loop through the German states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Rheinland-Pfalz and Hessen was made all the better by unexpected company.  The thick trees had opened up to a view of an endless river valley and mountains covered in evergreens so dense they indeed looked black. We felt powerless to do anything but pull over and take pictures that will never do it justice. If this is what happens when robots take over the world, I might be O.K. with it. JADA: We seemed to have similar road-trip styles: Head to a signpost destination and do a lot of meandering along the way. Once I drove from Frankfurt to meet you in Stuttgart, I didn\u2019t care where we went, as we eventually got to the ice age caves in the Swabian Jura, or Swabian Alps, which was a reason this area was on the 52 Places list.Frankfurt is really a cosmopolitan city. More than half of its inhabitants or their parents were born in another country. It is a city of finance, beautiful riverbanks and Germany\u2019s main airport. Locals tell me that people there are pretty open-minded and inviting.At the same time, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the southwestern German state that was on the itinerary, is known to be more conservative and maybe more traditionally German as foreigners might envision the country.  JADA: Frankfurt felt really alive to me. A friend\u2019s husband took me around before you and I met up, and explained that Germans see it as ugly and functional. The city was flattened during World War II, so it\u2019s now a hodgepodge of Modernist architecture mixed with reconstructed medieval buildings. JOHN: After leaving the cuckoo clock, we snaked through the countryside; I did a double-take when we were driving through this speck of a village, Fl\u00f6zlingen, and I saw a black man sitting outside of a garage. Being a black man myself, I am always interested in hearing the stories of black people I meet in Germany \u2014 a small but growing part of German society. Patrick Koffi Agbavon-Wolf, with blue overalls and a cigarette, was winding down after a day of factory work. He\u2019s 52 and originally from Togo but has been in Germany for more than two decades, settling here after several visits to Europe.What struck me was that he said he did not really have to confront the far-right, xenophobic populism that is growing in Germany (and all over Europe, for that matter). Not that he was na\u00efve to the challenges presented by that rise; but I think that Mr. Agbavon-Wolf represented how immigrants can sometimes integrate into quiet corners of the country, even as debate rages over their place in German society.Unfortunately, all that talking set us back on our journey to Lichtenstein (a municipality, not to be confused with the nearby principality of Liechtenstein). We arrived around midnight and almost didn\u2019t get to check in to our hotel because there was no nighttime front-desk service. JADA: The one boon of all our bad timing is we often got to see Germany\u2019s fiery sunsets over fields of hay or sunflowers. Two travel lessons learned: call small hotels and warn them if you\u2019re coming in after 8 p.m., and plan for dinner or you\u2019ll end up eating sad schnitzel in a gas station. Lichtenstein was way more remote than we\u2019d anticipated, but at least it was stunning in the daylight. JOHN: I certainly saw that the next morning when I went for a run into the woods and ended up taking a hike. I struggled up the mountainside, beneath a beautiful canopy of trees and rugged track. It ended up being totally worth it, though. At the top of the incline, I reached Lichtenstein Castle. I did not have the 2 euro entry fee with me \u2014 I don\u2019t typically run with cash \u2014 but one of the groundskeepers was nice enough to let me in for a quick peek. It was built in 1842 at the edge of a cliff for a rich art collector who wanted to live in a castle.That collector had an amazing view. You can see the entire Echaz valley: lush greenery surrounding charming houses with pitched roofs. The park felt more like a children\u2019s museum, with activities like racing the clock while dragging a sled of hides and throwing spears into foam mammoth targets. There is also a delicate 40,000-year-old figurine of a mammoth carved from a mammoth tusk \u2014 art that apparently grew out of inspired boredom, since hunting and gathering only took up a few hours of the day. But I think we were both most intrigued by the Euro-centric way the exhibits described how Neanderthals migrated to Germany from Africa, followed by homo sapiens.JOHN: Yes, the story was definitely framed from a white European perspective. I was happy to see a sign explaining that Africa was the cradle of mankind. JADA: It was a ton of fun squeezing through all the tiny entryways. I loved the story the guide told, about how the cave\u2019s namesake, Queen Charlotte of W\u00fcrttemberg, visited in 1893, but she didn\u2019t get to see the whole thing because the passages got too narrow for her hoop skirts. JADA: Germany is famous for its beer, of course, but this part of the country is really known for its dry white wines. Rieslings get a bum-rap in the states for being too sweet, but after trying these, I\u2019m convinced we\u2019re just importing the wrong stuff. JOHN: I prefer dry reds. And apparently there are some good pinot noirs in Germany as well.JADA: The food recommendation you gave me that I liked the most was maultasche, at a beer garden on the Neckar in T\u00fcbingen. It\u2019s a Swabian specialty, a dumpling filled with minced meat (there\u2019s a veggie version, too). I had mine in a soup with a tasty broth.JOHN: That quick stop we made in T\u00fcbingen was a highlight for me. One-third of the city\u2019s 85,000 residents are university students. Culturally, it\u2019s an interesting mix of young and vibrant and classically traditional: the old brick city wall that bordered a main thoroughfare stood right across from a crowd of millennials gathered at sidewalk tables, enjoying libations.And, as you know, I have a bit of an ice cream addiction. At the market, I was able to sate myself with yogurt ice topped with fruit preserves. We only did part of the route, getting off at the St. Goar castle, but if you did the entire trip from R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein to Koblenz, you can see about 40 hilltop castles in a 40-mile stretch. And, of course, the region has wineries galore. Interestingly enough, though, unlike many other wine regions in the world, you don\u2019t taste wine at the vineyards here. Instead, there are wine shops in towns where there are tastings. The way back is slower because it\u2019s upriver, so we took the speedy train that runs along the Rhine and cut our travel time by two hours. Pretty much every second, you\u2019re looking at cute villages or hills covered in vineyards. It made me regret the two decades of my life I had spent riding New York City subways to work. JOHN: It was a fortunate circumstance that we sat next to a man named Clemens on the boat. He lives in Munich but was on his way to Koblenz for work. He\u2019s a lawyer and had court the next day. The 65-year-old could have just taken a train all the way, but he realized that he had never taken this beautiful boat ride that was right in his backyard. JADA: The heavy downpour that started right after we boarded was a bummer, but in a magical moment, the rain cleared up just around the time we reached the famous Lorelei rock, which juts out of the water just before the tiny town of St. Goarshausen. Clemens told me it was named after a young siren who used to sit on the rocks, singing, distracting men in passing boats so they crashed to their deaths. As we floated by, a group of women started singing a song of Lorelei they said they had all learned in school, and then others on the boat joined in. It was wonderful.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: Ypres, BelgiumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s Former Campaign Chairman, Guilty of 8 Counts", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was convicted on Tuesday in his financial fraud trial, bringing a dramatic end to a politically charged case that riveted the capital.The verdict was a victory for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose prosecutors introduced extensive evidence that Mr. Manafort hid millions of dollars in foreign accounts to evade taxes and lied to banks repeatedly to obtain millions of dollars in loans.Mr. Manafort was convicted of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining 10 counts, and the judge declared a mistrial on those charges.Kevin Downing, a lawyer for Mr. Manafort, said the defense was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the verdict and that his client was \u201cevaluating all of his options at this point.\u201dPeter Carr, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller\u2019s office, declined to comment.Mr. Manafort\u2019s trial did not touch directly on Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election or on whether Mr. Trump has sought to obstruct the investigation.But it was the first test of the special counsel\u2019s ability to prosecute a case in a federal courtroom amid intense criticism from the president and his allies that the inquiry is a biased and unjustified witch hunt. And the outcome had substantial political implications, if only in denying Mr. Trump more ammunition for his campaign to discredit Mr. Mueller.Roger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.Before and during the trial, Mr. Trump both sought to defend Mr. Manafort as a victim of prosecutorial overreach and to distance himself from him, saying that Mr. Manafort had worked for him only relatively briefly.After the verdict was announced, Mr. Trump said he felt \u201cvery badly\u201d for Mr. Manafort and continued to maintain that the prosecution had been politically motivated.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t involve me,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters after landing in West Virginia for a rally on Tuesday evening. \u201cIt had nothing to do with Russian collusion.\u201dDefense lawyers had argued that Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort\u2019s former right-hand man and the government\u2019s star witness, was the real mastermind of the frauds. Mr. Gates had been charged along with Mr. Manafort in the case, but pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Mr. Manafort in exchange for the dismissal of a host of other charges and the possibility of a more lenient sentence.The defense lawyers also suggested that Mr. Manafort had been targeted by prosecutors to pressure him into cooperating with Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry into possible collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia in the 2016 election.In his summation on Wednesday, Greg D. Andres, the lead prosecutor, told the jurors that the essence of the scheme was not complicated. \u201cMr. Manafort lied to keep more money when he had it, and lied to get more money when he didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.Mr. Manafort faces a second criminal trial next month in Washington on seven other charges brought by the special counsel, including obstruction of justice, failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money.Mr. Gates, who was on the stand far longer than any other witness, appeared confident when questioned by prosecutors. But his credibility came under assault during cross-examination by defense lawyers, who questioned him about his \u201csecret life\u201d with a paramour in a London flat.Mr. Andres and Judge T. S. Ellis III, who presided over the trial, butted heads repeatedly. Mr. Andres complained that the judge interrupted every time the prosecution questioned a witness. Judge Ellis responded that Mr. Andres was so frustrated that he appeared on the verge of tears, which Mr. Andres denied.As the prosecution wound up its case last week, the proceedings suddenly ground to a mysterious halt, raising hopes among Mr. Manafort\u2019s allies that the judge might declare a mistrial. But after hours of secret discussions between the judge and the lawyers for both sides, the trial resumed.Mr. Andres argued that the evidence of Mr. Manafort\u2019s guilt was contained in documents that he himself wrote or signed and sent to his accountants, to loan officers and to Mr. Gates. While Mr. Gates was \u201cno Boy Scout,\u201d Mr. Andres said, his account was buttressed by other witnesses, including Mr. Manafort\u2019s tax accountant.Testifying under a grant of immunity, the accountant, Cynthia Laporta, said that she forwarded documents from Mr. Manafort to bank loan officers even though she believed they were false.The defense said that Mr. Manafort had foolishly trusted Mr. Gates to handle his personal and business finances, and had relied on a phalanx of accountants and loan officers to flag serious mistakes in his financial filings.Only after investigators from the special counsel\u2019s office began \u201cgoing through each piece of paper and finding anything that doesn\u2019t match up to add to the weight of evidence against Mr. Manafort\u201d did the discrepancies come to light, said Richard Westling, one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s five lawyers.Using multicolored flow charts in an attempt to simplify complex transactions, prosecutors tried to show that Mr. Manafort concealed more than $60 million in income in 31 foreign bank accounts opened in the names of shell companies.The money came from Ukrainian oligarchs who paid Mr. Manafort to boost the political career of Viktor F. Yanukovych, a pro-Russian politician who, with Mr. Manafort\u2019s help was elected president of Ukraine in 2010.Financial analysts for the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service testified that Mr. Manafort transferred more than $15 million from those accounts to pay for landscaping, clothing, rugs, home renovations and entertainment systems. In 2012 alone, he wired enough money from the hidden accounts to purchase a loft in SoHo, a brownstone in Brooklyn and a residence in Arlington, Va., they said. Mr. Manafort also disguised some of his income as loans to avoid taxes, witnesses testified.Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Manafort initiated another scheme after Mr. Yanukovych was forced out of office in 2014.Defense lawyers acknowledged that Mr. Manafort had no income by the time the Trump campaign hired him in March 2016 as a volunteer, first to manage delegates to the Republican National Convention, then as campaign chairman. Still, he bought his annual season tickets to the New York Yankees, charging $210,600 to his American Express card that went unpaid for nearly a year.In order to persuade three banks to loan him a total of $20 million, prosecutors said, Mr. Manafort added millions of dollars in fake income to his financial statements. Defense lawyers contended that the banks were well aware of Mr. Manafort\u2019s overall financial situation, and gave him loans because he had a net worth of $21.2 million and valuable real estate as collateral.Out of the jury\u2019s earshot, Mr. Andres complained repeatedly to Judge Ellis that he was erecting unfair obstacles for the prosecution, interjecting when they tried to examine their witnesses on the stand. \u201cThe court interrupts every single one of the government\u2019s directs, every single one,\u201d he said.The judge had criticized independent counsels this year, apparently conflating them with special counsels like Mr. Mueller, who operates under the supervision of the Justice Department. By the midpoint of the trial, he was markedly more polite to the prosecutors. He agreed to apologize to the jury for wrongly accusing them of making a courtroom mistake with a key witness.Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers said the prosecutors were engaging in overkill. \u201cThey had already thrown the kitchen sink at him,\u201d one of them, Thomas Zehnle, told the judge at one point. \u201cNow they are throwing the plumbing and the pipes.\u201dWithout directly accusing the prosecutors of selective prosecution, they tried throughout the trial to sow doubt about their intentions. At the government\u2019s request, Judge Ellis instructed the jury to \u201cignore any argument about the Justice Department\u2019s motive or lack of motive,\u201d a last-minute warning that might only have underscored the question.Emily Cochrane and Emily Baumgaertner contributed reporting from Alexandria, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Charleston, W.Va.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Journey of the \u2018Sex Cult\u2019 Heiress: From Reluctant Recruit to Criminal Defendant", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the summer of 2013, with his health failing, the billionaire businessman Edgar M. Bronfman was visited at home by his youngest daughter, Clare. She brought with her a production crew that was making a film about a self-help group called Nxivm.Mr. Bronfman, the former chairman of Seagram Company, had long clashed with Clare and her sister Sara over their lavish financial support of the group. A decade earlier, they had given $65 million of his liquor fortune to its leader, Keith Raniere \u2014 money that he promptly lost in the commodities market. Soon afterward, Forbes published a critical article about Mr. Raniere in which Mr. Bronfman described Nxivm as a \u201ccult.\u201dBut Clare Bronfman had not come on that day in 2013 to make peace with her father, who died later that year. Instead, she pressed him to admit on camera that he had been wrong to criticize Mr. Raniere, said a former Nxivm official who was present at the meeting.\u201cHe was very sick,\u201d said the official, Mark Vicente. \u201cHe appeared to be very saddened by her questioning.\u201dIn the indictment, Ms. Bronfman is accused of identity theft in order to access other people\u2019s computers; of money laundering to abet the entry of an alien into the United States; and of improperly paying off the credit card of Mr. Raniere\u2019s dead girlfriend, so that he could continue to use it after her death. (Ms. Bronfman did not respond to numerous emails seeking an interview, and her lawyer, Susan R. Necheles, also did not respond to emails.)Ms. Bronfman\u2019s arrest was astonishing in part because of the Bronfman family\u2019s standing in New York business and philanthropic circles. Her father was a major benefactor of Jewish organizations, and several of the five children from his first marriage have had high-profile careers. A son, Edgar Bronfman Jr., once served as chief executive of Warner Music.It was Sara Bronfman who introduced her sister to Nxivm in the early 2000s. The group, which was based in Albany, N.Y., offered its members workshops that it said were designed to help participants achieve greater self-fulfillment by removing emotional and psychological roadblocks.At the time, the Bronfman sisters, who were then in their early 20s, were opposites in both appearance and personality. Sara was blond, outgoing and likable, and appeared to be seeking a direction in life. Clare, who is extremely thin and has a narrow face and brown hair, struck Nxivm members as dour and socially awkward. She also already had a passion. As a teenager, she had become an equestrian, going on to compete in international events and open a farm to train horses.At first, Clare Bronfman appeared to have little interest in joining Nxivm. But several meetings with Mr. Raniere turned her into a believer. She also apparently fell in love with Mr. Raniere, who had sexual relationships with many Nxivm women, several former members said. Starting in the late 1990s, approximately 16,000 people took his courses, and some were drawn deeply into the group, giving up careers and past ties to become followers of Mr. Raniere, who was referred to as \u201cVanguard.\u201dIn the mid-2000s, Edgar Bronfman Jr., while he was head of Warner Music, also apparently once came to Albany at the request of his sisters to help judge a Nxivm-sponsored a cappella singing contest, said several people familiar with his visit. (Mr. Bronfman did not respond to emails seeking comment.)As Clare Bronfman\u2019s authority within Nxivm grew, she did not hesitate to wield it, several former members of the group said. When people she hired to work for her asked for higher pay, for example, the heiress said no and lectured them about appreciating the value of money.\u201cI found her very degrading and very reprimanding,\u201d said one ex-Nxivm member, Bonnie Piesse, who is married to Mr. Vicente, the former Nxivm official who witnessed Ms. Bronfman interviewing her father about the group. \u201cShe was very cold.\u201dFor more than a decade, the Bronfman sisters used their substantial fortunes to underwrite Nxivm in a variety of ways. To raise Mr. Raniere\u2019s profile, they arranged for the Dalai Lama to visit Albany. The group made use of a private jet they provided to ferry celebrities it was courting as recruits. Clare Bronfman also bought an island in Fiji that Mr. Raniere and other Nxivm officials used as a retreat.Sara Bronfman eventually married and had children, and her involvement in the group diminished. But Clare Bronfman\u2019s singular focus stayed on Mr. Raniere and Nxivm. Along with financing the organization, she started two nonprofit organizations to promulgate its ideas.One of them, the Ethical Science Foundation, conducted a study to see if Nxivm\u2019s training techniques could be used to treat people with Tourette\u2019s syndrome, a disorder marked by involuntary tics or verbal outbursts. A Nxivm-affiliated doctor associated with that study also carried out a bizarre experiment in which female followers of Mr. Raniere were shown films containing scenes of extreme violence while their facial expressions were videotaped.It is not known whether Ms. Bronfman was aware of that study and, if so, whether she approved of it. But none of the recent revelations about Mr. Raniere or Nxivm\u2019s practices appear to have shaken her belief in the group.By all accounts, Ms. Bronfman was initially unaware of the secret sorority within Nxivm, or the branding of its members\u2019 flesh. But after its practices became public in October 2017, she leapt to Mr. Raniere\u2019s defense, posting a statement that extolled his virtues and described the sorority as a voluntary group whose members benefited from it.By the time of her statement, the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Nxivm was underway, and the story\u2019s more sensational aspects \u2014 squandered fortunes and human branding \u2014 had created a media frenzy. News outlets in multiple countries described Nxivm as a \u201csex cult.\u201d Ms. Bronfman traveled with Mr. Raniere to Mexico, where they attempted damage control. They hired a local lawyer, who sent threatening letters to Nxivm defectors, warning they could face unspecified criminal charges. Around that same time, Ms. Bronfman also filed complaints with police authorities in Vancouver against two former Nxivm members living there, accusing them of fraud. (Canadian officials have not acted on those complaints.)About a month before Ms. Bronfman\u2019s arrest, a lawyer for Mr. Raniere unsuccessfully tried to convince a federal judge overseeing the Nxivm case to free him from prison by offering a $10 million bail package. The individual offering to finance Mr. Raniere\u2019s bail package was not identified in court filings, but a person involved in his case said he believed that it was Ms. Bronfman.Soon enough, the heiress herself was in court. After Ms. Bronfman was arrested in July, her own bail was set at $100 million. During a hearing in a Brooklyn courtroom, she sat on a wooden bench, looking bewildered and frightened while she held the hands of her mother and her sister\u2019s husband.They had come to court to assure the judge that they would make certain she complied with the terms of her release. While they answered questions, Ms. Bronfman, who was wearing a thin blue sweater and baggy blue pants, dabbed at her eyes. No other members of the Bronfman family appeared present.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Fans of Rare Retro Soul Get Their Groove on", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeighborhood JointMatt Weingarden was running late. Clutching a box of records, he asked the couple in the window seat at the candlelit bar to relocate. He bussed a pint glass from their table, set up two turntables and a mixer, and set his records up on the windowsill. Switches were flipped. Knobs were turned. A green light blinked on. Finally, he put the needle down.About 15 people milled about. Some snapped fingers. Some clapped hands. A group started dancing.Fans and collectors of Motown-era music come from all over to hear Mr. Weingarden spin from his collection of some 20,000 45s.During the 1960s and \u201970s, Detroit had a \u201chuge\u201d underground scene, said Mr. Weingarden. Thousands of records never got picked up for distribution, so originals sat in garages or landed in random shops, and they have become collectors\u2019 items. Some sell for thousands.While soul was made all over the country, much of Mr. Weingarden\u2019s collection is from Detroit, where he grew up. \u201cI like it the best and collect it the most,\u201d said the D.J., 54, who works as a copy editor at People magazine.Richard Lewis, a.k.a.

{"Headline": "The N.F.L. Stiff-Armed Trump. Now He Is Heckling From the White House.", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "FeatureWhat is a team owner to do under pressure from the president of the United States?Supported byBut opening night in January 2017, Super Bowl LI, also offered something else: an early indication that professional football, like so many other American cultural institutions previously safe from partisan politics, would be twisted and pounded and very much transformed by the infant presidency of Donald J. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m not talking politics at all,\u201d Tom Brady insisted, responding to the several questions concerning just that \u2014 namely, his old golfing pal who had moved into the White House a few days earlier. \u201cI\u2019m just a positive person,\u201d Brady went on to say in what became his formulaic response. \u201cI just want the best for everybody.\u201dThe media throng at Minute Maid Park in Houston did not play along. This was not going to be an Obama-era Super Bowl, much less one of those pre-high-def Super Bowls from back when coaches wore fedoras. The 45th president wasn\u2019t in attendance, but he had an uncanny knack, or need, to soak up as much attention as possible from the bizarre American moment he was leading the nation through. He was thrilled to inflict politics in every direction, even (or especially) onto the toy armies of pro sports. As with so many of Trump\u2019s fixations, this one came with a back story of personal grievance: repeated rejection in his efforts across four decades to buy an N.F.L. team. His most recent attempt was in 2014, when Trump tried to buy the Buffalo Bills. But an N.F.L. owner\u2019s box is so exclusive as to make even the White House a consolation prize.Instead, Trump became a heckler from the bully pulpit. His attacks on the league began during the campaign, especially after Colin Kaepernick and then other players knelt during the national anthem to protest police violence against African-Americans. A week before the election, for example, at a campaign rally in Greeley, Colo., he jeered Kaepernick, citing the quarterback as a reason the N.F.L. was \u201cway down in the ratings.\u201d Now, after his inauguration, he was basking in his victory. \u201cPolitics has become a much bigger subject than the Super Bowl,\u201d Trump boasted in the run-up to the big game. \u201cThis is usually Super Bowl territory, and now they\u2019re saying that the politics is more interesting to people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good.\u201dNot for the N.F.L., which, in its ham-handed, Kremlin-like way, went so far as to scrub from the event\u2019s official transcripts nearly every mention of \u201cTrump\u201d or \u201cpresident.\u201d Nothing to see here, just football. \u201cWe offer a respite,\u201d Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 owner, once told me. \u201cWe are a respite that moves you away from your trials and missteps, or my trials and missteps.\u201dBut the folly of creating a safe space from Trumpian discord became more and more inescapable as Super Bowl week ground toward game day. Trump\u2019s relentless embrace of the Patriots, his touting of his friendships with Brady, Belichick and their team\u2019s owner, Robert Kraft, made it impossible for many citizens not to treat this game as a proxy war for our national divisions. White nationalists embraced the team from deeply liberal New England as their own. Richard Spencer dubbed Brady an \u201cAryan Avatar\u201d and said the Patriots\u2019 winning the Super Bowl would be \u201ca victory for the #AltRight.\u201d On the other side, about 40 percent of the Falcons\u2019 season-ticket holders were African-American, and the team\u2019s slogan was #RiseUp. The game felt like Make America Great Again versus The Resistance.When Atlanta scored first, the reaction on Twitter reinforced the impression. \u201cAmerica 7 Trump voters 0,\u201d the parody account @NotBillWalton tweeted. \u201cThe Falcons respect an independent judiciary,\u201d the writer and critic Andy Greenwald added. During timeouts, partisans scrutinized the TV commercials, looking for signs that they were playing to the political moment. Did everyone see that Budweiser ad depicting the journey of the company founder, Adolphus Busch, as he immigrated to America from Germany? #BoycottBudweiser was up and running before halftime. \u201cThese commercials have been a bonanza of leftist activism,\u201d a Breitbart News editor complained. \u201cTwo immigration commercials, a feminist commercial, now an eco wacko commercial? Am I missing anything?\u201dSpeaking as a Pats fan (sorry!), I was simply missing my football team. We were getting clobbered 28-3 well into the third quarter. Trump left his Super Bowl viewing party early. But he would be heard from again, and so would the Patriots, after they came back to win in overtime, 34-28. In the postgame commotion, someone swiped Brady\u2019s jersey (a heist Kraft would liken to \u201ctaking a great Chagall or Picasso\u201d). The F.B.I. and other law-enforcement agencies eventually located it \u2014 in Mexico. Really, how on-message could Trump\u2019s team be?By those early days of the Trump presidency, I had embarked on writing a book about the N.F.L., the country\u2019s most popular and prosperous sports league. In every empire, there comes a time when, despite all its riches and power and apparent invincibility, a catastrophic downfall seems to loom. I wanted to know: Had Peak Football been achieved? In a matter of years, the N.F.L. had for a variety of reasons (many of them self-inflicted) gone from being one of the most unifying institutions in America to the country\u2019s most polarizing sports brand. This was true before Donald Trump ever ran for anything. Still, I held out some na\u00efve hope that this book project would offer me a respite from the perennial silly season of my day job, which is writing about politics. Maybe next book.Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, put that question to me at the first N.F.L. owners meeting I attended, in March 2016, at the Boca Raton Resort and Club. We were chatting at a reception that featured mountains of lobster and crab meat and more paella than I\u2019d ever seen in my life. Johnson wore a white Jets baseball cap, a knapsack over both shoulders and a daydreamy expression that made him look like an overgrown third grader who collects toy trains and terrible quarterbacks. Trump at that time was stampeding his way through the Republican primaries. Johnson had served as the national finance chairman of Jeb Bush\u2019s ill-fated campaign until it was officially euthanized a few weeks earlier. Trump made a point of taunting Johnson via a tweet, saying, \u201cIf Woody would\u2019ve been with me, he would\u2019ve been in the playoffs, at least!\u201d Johnson told me he was slowly warming up to Trump and hopeful that the candidate would act in a more restrained manner going forward.I next encountered Johnson eight months later, on election night. It was around 2:30 a.m., and I passed him walking on 57th Street. He was coming from Trump\u2019s election-night party and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. The Johnson & Johnson heir, who had raised tens of millions of dollars for Trump, predicted to me that Trump\u2019s great victory would bring \u201chope\u201d to all the \u201cblue-collar guys\u201d he knew in Staten Island. Yes, I said, but could Trump bring hope to the New York Jets? As it turned out, maybe he could \u2014 by sending Johnson out of the country. (Trump wound up appointing him ambassador to the United Kingdom.)The degree to which Trump had become a preoccupation of N.F.L. owners cannot be overstated. A few days before Super Bowl LI, I published an article in which I quoted Trump from an older interview criticizing the Patriots owner Robert Kraft for not suing the league over Deflategate, the silly \u201cscandal\u201d about underinflated footballs. Kraft did not perform well under pressure, Trump told me in late 2015. \u201cHe choked, just like Romney choked.\u201d In Houston, Kraft pulled me aside at a pre-Super Bowl tailgate party. \u201cDid Trump really say that I choked?\u201d he wanted to know.When I confirmed it, Kraft shook his head and appeared wounded, even with his team preparing to play in its seventh Super Bowl in 15 years. People kept coming over to give hugs and whisper into his ear, paying respects.Jerry Jones, sharing a table with Kraft, was riding high, too, having just learned the night before that he would be inducted into the Hall of Fame with the class of 2017. Everyone knew that Jones had long craved the call to Canton \u2014 and all the deference paid to the gold jacket that comes with it.Kraft, of course, felt the same, but his call had yet to come. As I watched the rival septuagenarians seated at the same table a few feet from each other, I wondered whether Jones would trade his gold jacket for another Super Bowl ring \u2014 or whether Kraft would trade one of his rings for a gold jacket.I eventually put the question to Kraft in his office at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., a few months after he won his fifth title. \u201cNo way,\u201d he declared. Hall of Fame voting tends to be political. \u201cA ring is earned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you\u2019ve out-managed your competition and you\u2019ve managed excellence at the highest level. To me, that\u2019s more of a turn-on.\u201dWhen I asked the same of Jones, his response was somewhat less clear. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cBoy. Boy! Boy! Boy! Boy.\u201d We were sitting aboard the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 bus in the parking lot of a golf course not far from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. As a general rule, the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 bus is not a place for the faint of heart or liver.\u201cI do like to have a drink,\u201d Jones confirmed, something I\u2019d heard from a few people. \u201cDo you want a shot of Scotch?\u201d he asked me. Sure, I said, not realizing that by \u201cshot,\u201d Jones was talking about large blue plastic souvenir cups bearing the Cowboys\u2019 logo, soon to be filled (and refilled) with Johnnie Walker Blue Label, Jones\u2019s favored libation.I relay this by way of transparency into Jones\u2019s inhibitions, which were relaxing rapidly. When I asked him again whether he would trade his gold jacket for another ring, Jerry\u2019s face assumed a kind of happy grimace at this high-class dilemma. Finally, he answered. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.Sitting a few feet away, Rich Dalrymple, the Cowboys\u2019 longtime head of public relations, shook his head. \u201cYou messed that one up,\u201d he told his boss. Dalrymple wanted Jones to amend his answer to \u201canother Super Bowl ring.\u201d That would reassure fans that nothing was more important to their owner than winning another championship more than 20 years after the last one. Otherwise, it\u2019s just a rich guy\u2019s ego trip (which it is, of course, but you\u2019re supposed to hide it better).Some of Jones\u2019s fellow owners have described him as the N.F.L.\u2019s Donald Trump, a blustering billionaire showman easily dismissed as a carnival barker. When I asked Jones how he felt about this, he was thrilled. Trump\u2019s rise, he said, \u201cis one of the great stories in America. And let me tell you this,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe president ain\u2019t no joke. He\u2019s got as good a chance to be right as any of them.\u201dSeveral N.F.L. owners had known Trump for years, with Kraft being his highest-profile friend among them. (Kraft has given him a Super Bowl ring.) But Kraft, too, is a politician, of sorts, who seems to do his best to please as many audiences as he can; in part through having mastered the art of saying quite different things for public and private consumption. His friendship with Trump provides a case in point. Kraft loves being a presidential buddy but is also aware that many of his plutocrat friends don\u2019t approve. So Kraft is quick to mention to his friends \u2014 privately \u2014 that he disagrees with Trump on many issues and with many of the incendiary things the president has done and said. But he would rather have the presidential ear and try to be a positive influence. Arthur Blank, the Falcons owner, told me that Kraft tried to sell him on this line, but he wasn\u2019t buying. \u201cI said, \u2018You [expletive], you\u2019ve given him a lot of money,\u2019\u2009\u201d Blank told his friend Kraft (who disputes parts of Blank\u2019s account of their conversation). Blank\u2019s own line on Trump, which he says he also told Kraft, is that \u201cthere are things he\u2019s saying and doing that are not great for this country.\u201dThe roiling politicization of the game, though, seems a different sort of problem \u2014 one unlikely to abate as long as Trump remains in office. As a Trump hobbyhorse, the anthem protests pack all the key elements: They provide a grand spectacle, undercut an institution that Trump feels personal spite toward and highlight an issue that he believes he can exploit for political gain. \u201cThis is a very winning, strong issue for me,\u201d Trump told Jerry Jones, according to a Wall Street Journal account of a deposition Jones gave in connection with the lawsuit that Colin Kaepernick has filed against the league. \u201cYou can\u2019t win this one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis one lifts me.\u201d Last September, at a rally in Alabama, he received cheers when he said about any player who knelt, \u201cGet that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he\u2019s fired!\u201dSince that first Super Bowl, Trump has neglected his bullying campaign against the N.F.L. for stretches, but his presence always hovers. Super Bowl LII was much less about the president than the year before \u2014 until he uninvited the champion Philadelphia Eagles to the White House the day before the team\u2019s scheduled visit in June. The reason, Trump said, was that the Eagles disagreed \u201cwith their president\u201d and his insistence that they \u201cproudly stand for the National Anthem.\u201d (In fact, all of the Eagles did stand for the anthem last season; reportedly only a small number of players had planned to visit the White House anyway.)A collision between Trump and pro football was probably inevitable: There was only so much room in the national head space for these dueling soap operas of American carnage. Now Trump gets to terrorize the club that would not have him as a member. It must give him immense satisfaction to know that the N.F.L. \u2014 on the eve of a new season \u2014 has no clue how to handle him or what to do about the national-anthem protests that a few players are still engaging in. Trump might not be allowed into the select membership of N.F.L. owners, but at least he still occupies prime real estate in their thoughts.The league is \u201cunder assault,\u201d the Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula said in a private meeting between a group of players and owners and league executives at the height of the national-anthem crisis last fall \u2014 a recording of which was given to The New York Times this April. It was Pegula who, along with his wife, Kim, paid $1.4 billion for the Bills in 2014, beating out Trump for the team. Trump assured fans via Twitter that he had dodged calamity. \u201cWow, @N.F.L. ratings are down big league,\u201d he wrote shortly after the Pegulas bought the team. \u201cGlad I didn\u2019t get the Bills.\u201dIt\u2019s an interesting thought experiment: What if Trump had got a team after all? Would he still have felt the need to run for president?But we\u2019re left with the reality we have, and a president who keeps returning to football as a wedge issue \u2014 even a security blanket. \u201cI\u2019m calling on you to join me in denouncing this SPINELESS surrender to the politically correct liberal mob,\u201d Trump said in a fund-raising email sent out in late August after ESPN announced it would not be televising the national anthem before \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d games this season. It didn\u2019t seem like a coincidence that the email went out just one day after Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign-finance violations and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of eight tax and bank-fraud charges. On one of the worst days of his presidency, it seemed, Trump, too, was turning to football for a respite.This article is adapted from \u201cBig Game: The NFL in Dangerous Times,\u201d published by Penguin Press.Mark Leibovich is the chief national correspondent for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New High-Rent Districts", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPricey New York City neighborhoods have seen some of the lowest rent increases since 2010, while recently gentrified areas have had the biggest ones.For most New Yorkers \u2014 about two-thirds of whom are renters \u2014 living in the city means accepting the painful reality of ever-increasing rents, which are as much a part of the experience as noisy neighbors, hissing steam radiators and cramped kitchens. Some of the smallest rent increases were in already pricey neighborhoods in Manhattan, like Central Park South and Midtown, which both saw increases of just 16 percent in the last eight years. The desirable neighborhoods of Gramercy Park, the Upper West Side and Dumbo, Brooklyn, also all saw comparatively modest 21 percent increases. In 2010, the median rents in the 10 neighborhoods with the biggest increases averaged $1,695, compared to $2,800 in the 10 slowest. The report tracks rent increases among more than a million apartments rented at least twice over the past decade. It does not take into account the rent increases of tenants who stayed in place during that time, but it gives an indication of the pressures felt by longer-term residents in certain neighborhoods, as renters priced out of more expensive Manhattan neighborhoods pushed into those areas. \u201cWhat characterizes a lot of neighborhoods that saw the largest increases is relatively easy access to the city and relative value for your money, especially in 2010,\u201d said Grant Long, a senior economist at StreetEasy who led the research team. \u201cAs rents rise, people start looking at the next neighborhood over, and then the next neighborhood over.\u201d But the same market forces that have sent middle-class renters in search of affordability farther north in Manhattan and farther south in Brooklyn have also made it harder for lower-income and working-class residents to remain in those neighborhoods. The resulting gentrification has left newcomers feeling uneasy and longtime residents insecure, with both groups hoping they will be able to afford to stay in the neighborhoods \u2014 and the city \u2014 they love. By the time Matt Tenero graduated from New York University in 2012, he had already moved several times in search of lower rent, leaving behind dorm housing for a room share in Alphabet City, followed by a $2,600-a-month, three-bedroom share in South Slope, Brooklyn. When he and his girlfriend, also an N.Y.U. grad, decided to move in together three years ago, they looked first in South Park Slope, and then in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, which Mr. Tenero thought of as the more affordable \u201cnext neighborhood over.\u201d But neither was affordable for a couple on a $2,000-a-month budget. Their real estate agent, Chris Lucas at Level Group, suggested they try the other side of Prospect Park, where they were able to find a large rent-stabilized one-bedroom for $1,900-a-month by the southern edge of Crown Heights, close to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\u201cWhen we moved here we didn\u2019t know the neighborhood at all and, as young people who have been priced out of higher-income neighborhoods, we were worried about how we would be perceived,\u201d Mr. Tenero said. \u201cBut everyone here has been so awesome, and we like our apartment so much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s only been three years, but already I feel myself on the other side of it,\u201d Mr. Tenero said, referring to the ongoing changes in the area. \u201cAt the same time, I know that I\u2019m part of that gentrification.\u201dMr. Lucas and Sheldon Hosten, an associate broker at Level Group, said that clients looking to rent in Crown Heights, Prospect-Lefferts and Flatbush are often fleeing higher rents elsewhere. Many are leaving a roommate situation, either to live alone for the first time or to move in with a significant other, and have a limited budget. Seven years ago, one-bedrooms were going for $1,000 to $1,200 a month by Empire Boulevard, the street that some consider the line separating Crown Heights from Prospect-Lefferts and Flatbush, Mr. Hosten said; now it is $1,600 to $1,700.But long-term residents who have watched prices surge in their neighborhoods say that they are far from insulated from the changes happening around them. Lloyd Smith, a retired representative for retail union Local 1102, has lived with his wife in a two-bedroom on East 18th Street in Flatbush for the past 40 years. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three different landlords in the time I\u2019ve lived here, and the present landlord is the worst of the worst,\u201d Mr. Smith said, adding that the new landlord has initiated legal action against many of the building\u2019s long-term residents in an attempt to oust them and use vacancy bonuses to get higher rents. Mr. Smith\u2019s rent, for example, is $800 a month, he said, but two-bedrooms in the area now rent for upward of $2,000.A review of housing court records found scores of suits that had been filed by the landlord, Landau Real Estate, in the last few years for nonpayment of rent, and five active cases with court dates scheduled in the next month. \u201cLandlords have become so aggressive with their tactics lately,\u201d said Estefania Trujillo Preciado, an organizer with the Flatbush Tenant Coalition, which is working with residents in Mr. Smith\u2019s building. With rising rents in the neighborhood, the apartments have become so valuable \u2014 especially the larger ones that can be broken into two or three units \u2014 that some landlords are denying succession rights and refusing to accept rent payments as a ruse to bring tenants to housing court, she said.Natasha Worthen, who in 2009 took over the three-bedroom on Ocean Avenue in Flatbush where she grew up, said that her landlord has not accepted her $915 rent check for 10 months. Ms. Worthen works for the Department of Education in Downtown Brooklyn; she has had several knee surgeries and worries that if she is forced to move farther away, the commute will be unmanageable.\u201cLiving in this neighborhood, being close to the B and the Q trains and having the option to take the bus when I\u2019m injured, is integral to my lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Worthen said. \u201cFor 45 years, this apartment has been a lifeline for my family. We\u2019re all veterans and city employees.\u201dBut landlords trying to maximize their profits are not the only force displacing people. Any number of changes \u2014 starting a family, say, or getting a divorce \u2014 can push long-term residents back into the housing market, where they must contend with current prices. In Bushwick, Brooklyn, where rents have increased 35 percent since 2010, many buildings have fewer than six units and are therefore not rent-regulated, said Jaquelin Rodriguez, the program director of Churches United for Fair Housing. As a result, longtime residents with changing family situations are especially vulnerable to displacement.Antioquia Villalona, 33, has lived half her life in the neighborhood, but worries about losing her apartment. When she got a job as a teaching assistant in 2008, she moved into a two-bedroom that cost $1,050 a month. A short time later, her mother, who is also a teaching assistant, got divorced and moved into the other bedroom. When Ms. Villalona\u2019s sister, who works as a medical assistant and has two young children, got divorced a few years after that, she found rents unaffordable. Now she and her children share one of the bedrooms and Ms. Villalona and her mother share the other.\u201cLiving together is better than living with strangers,\u201d Ms. Villalona said. \u201cBut it feels really crowded.\u201dExpanding to a three-bedroom, however, is out of the question. Ms. Villalona is only a few credits away from earning a master\u2019s degree in teaching, but even with a salary increase \u2014 she would earn approximately $63,700 a year \u2014 they will only be keeping pace with rising rents. Their rent is increasing to $1,500 in September. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not rent-stabilized, so the landlord could change his mind at any time,\u201d Ms. Villalona said. According to real estate agency MNS, the average price for a two-bedroom in the neighborhood this July was $2,558.\u201cI sometimes wonder if everyone who comes here is rich,\u201d Ms. Villalona said. \u201cWe all work. I\u2019ve been working since I was 16. We were doing just fine, but the rate the rent is going up is too much, too fast.\u201dIn Manhattan below 110th Street on the West Side and 97th Street on the East Side, rents went up 27 percent. Upper Manhattan, however, saw a 41 percent increase. Shawn Hindes, a teacher in Washington Heights who runs the brokerage TeacherSpace, said that Harlem, Washington Heights and Inwood are essentially the last neighborhoods in Manhattan where teachers can afford a shared apartment, paying $800 to $1,000 a person. A number of his students\u2019 families are either sharing an apartment with members of their extended family or moving to the South Bronx for lower rents. Part of the solution lies in ensuring that New Yorkers who live in gentrifying neighborhoods have access to the higher-paying jobs coming to the city, said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer. But as Ms. Villalona\u2019s situation illustrates, the affordability challenges in the city run deeper than climbing one \u2014 or even several \u2014 rungs on a career ladder.Jonathan Lumley, a retired lighting director, said he spent 35 years living in the West Village before realizing that almost everyone \u2014 and everything \u2014 of his class and kind were long gone. \u201cI had a beautiful apartment on Washington and 10th Street; it was fabulous. I\u2019d made it very much my home,\u201d said Mr. Lumley, who paid just over $2,000 a month. When the building was bought a few years ago by a developer planning a condo conversion, Mr. Lumley rejected an initial buyout offer of $250,000. But after reflecting on how many of his favorite businesses had left the area, he changed his mind. The neighborhood had become \u201cextremely high rent, lots of fashion shops,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were buying apartments as investments and not living there.\u201d He and his wife used their buyout money to help pay the rent on a light-filled two-bedroom with a balcony and a river view on West 143rd Street in Hamilton Heights.LargestSmallestDitmas Park, Brooklyn $1,388 to $2,01845%Riverdale, the Bronx$1,638 to $1,937Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn$1,382 to $2,00045Long Island City, Queens$2,444 to $2,88118Midtown, Manhattan$3,406 to $3,96216Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn$1,712 to $2,40741Central Park South, Manhattan$6,590 to $7,65116Crown Heights, Brooklyn$1,685 to $2,34939Inwood, Manhattan$1,416 to $1,97039Ridgewood, Queens$1,977 to $2,27115LargestDitmas Park, Brooklyn $1,388 to $2,01845%Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn$1,382 to $2,00045Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn$1,712 to $2,40741Crown Heights, Brooklyn$1,685 to $2,34939Inwood, Manhattan$1,416 to $1,97039SmallestRiverdale, the Bronx$1,638 to $1,937Long Island City, Queens$2,444 to $2,88118Midtown, Manhattan$3,406 to $3,96216Central Park South, Manhattan$6,590 to $7,65116Ridgewood, Queens$1,977 to $2,27115Source: StreetEasy Rent IndexBy The New York TimesNow Mr. Lumley worries when he reads complaints about loud music in a local newsletter. Even his new neighborhood could soon be transformed. \u201cIt\u2019s gentrifying,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while I would like to have a better grocery store, I don\u2019t want to lose the guys playing dominoes.\u201dRents are now climbing in East Flatbush, he said, along the 2/5 line toward Brooklyn College, and in East New York, too. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard for working-class people to be able to afford to live in the city,\u201d he said. \u201cBut middle-class people are having a hard time living in a lot of parts of Brooklyn, too. To rent a place that\u2019s $2,500 a month, you should be making $100,000. What percentage of people are making $100,000 a year?\u201dAlong with rising rents, sales prices have also spiked in many of these neighborhoods, forcing some who, a generation ago, might have become homeowners to linger in the rental market.When Daniel Kuperhand, an agent at B & H Properties, was growing up 20 years ago in the Midwood/Gravesend area, he said, \u201cThe thought process was that you\u2019d be able to buy a house like where Mom and Dad live. Now a property in the area will be like a million dollars.\u201dAs working- and middle-class neighborhoods dwindle, and the last pockets of affordability in the boroughs vanish, some wonder if it is not only the fate of those who live here that is now in question, but that of the city itself.\u201cWe\u2019ve always been a place where everyone comes to, immigrants, people of all different backgrounds,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cIf we become a city of the very, very wealthy, it will not be the same city in generations to follow. I think it would be a terrible mistake.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Africa Vows to End Corruption. Are Its New Leaders Part of the Problem?", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIDDELPLAAS, South Africa \u2014 The little girl hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the girl, Ziyanda Nkosi, a 6-year-old first grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.\u201cMommy! Mommy!\u201d she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former math teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress and was positioning himself to become South Africa\u2019s deputy president.One of the party\u2019s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. A.N.C. leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school, and Mr. Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the A.N.C., the education system has been in shambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda\u2019s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local A.N.C. leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mr. Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents \u2014 and for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mr. Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the A.N.C. tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mr. Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire A.N.C., launching him into an even more prominent post \u2014 as South Africa\u2019s deputy president, second only to the nation\u2019s leader.Mr. Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the A.N.C. is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mr. Mandela\u2019s legacy. After all, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country\u2019s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mr. Mabuza\u2019s spectacular climb, current and former A.N.C. officials say: He siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.\u201cHe didn\u2019t become what he is now because of his political capability,\u201d said Fish Mahlalela, a senior A.N.C. figure in the province and a national lawmaker.\u201cNo, no, it was out of money and the manipulation,\u201d he added. \u201cNothing else.\u201dBut to seal his new post, Mr. Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mr. Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa\u2019s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mr. Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Mr. Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country\u2019s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mr. Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the \u201ctragedies that take away the innocence of our children.\u201dHe spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a 5-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of feces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolizing the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.Yet under Mr. Mabuza\u2019s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required, and school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mr. Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to A.N.C. officials, high-ranking defectors and anticorruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled, for unexplained reasons, to $30 million each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province also became known as one of South Africa\u2019s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the A.N.C., were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new A.N.C. members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the A.N.C.\u2019s second-biggest voting bloc. Under the party\u2019s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria, with a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s role as the second-most powerful politician in the country casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its bold assertions that the A.N.C. is turning the page on corruption.But the nation\u2019s poor schools are perhaps the A.N.C.\u2019s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans \u2014 some of whom have turned to burning down schools in protest.Mr. Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile; he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.But the schools also offered him a rich political opportunity, officials say. Education represents about half of provincial budgets, followed by health. Officials from the National Treasury recently warned in a parliamentary hearing that misspending and mismanagement in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province were especially rampant in those two departments.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: The new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration\u2019s future \u2014 as well as the country\u2019s \u2014 rests in the hands of Mr. Mabuza.\u201cIf there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa\u2019s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, the author of \u201cRamaphosa\u2019s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?\u201d\u201cWe are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.\u201dThe numbers just didn\u2019t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mr. Mabuza got his first big break: He became Mpumalanga\u2019s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The son of farmers, Mr. Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalled Reginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.A bright student, Mr. Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught math at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers\u2019 association.\u201cThe teachers were at the center\u201d of the movement, said Sandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mr. Mabuza into the main student organization. Mr. Mabuza quickly stood out, he said, traveling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.\u201cHe was a leader in his own right,\u201d Mr. Sukati said.But after apartheid ended, Mr. Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province\u2019s first big scandal of the democratic era.Mr. Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful A.N.C. leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former A.N.C. officials said.\u201cI am in a tight situation,\u201d Mr. Mabuza told some of the teachers, recalled Mr. Sukati, who worked under Mr. Mabuza at the education department.The next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 percent \u2014 an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to No. 2 among the nation\u2019s nine provinces.\u201cI was suspicious,\u201d said Mr. Sukati, who is now a senior education official. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t just happen like that.\u201dA whistle-blower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, the authorities announced, was under 53 percent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mr. Mabuza\u2019s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired, current and former A.N.C. officials said.An investigation was never completed. Mr. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the A.N.C. across South Africa, current and former party officials say.\u201cI think, the man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don\u2019t know what went wrong,\u201d said Ronnie Malomane, an A.N.C. official who was taught math by Mr. Mabuza in the early 1980s. \u201cThey were just giving him position after position.\u201dNationally, Mr. Mabuza\u2019s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Mr. Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mr. Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move \u2014 called the \u201cRapid Implementation Unit\u201d \u2014 as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.\u201cThat\u2019s how he managed to loot,\u201d said Collen Sedibe, a former A.N.C. leader who grew up on the same street as Mr. Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures \u201cincurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier.\u201dBut parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.\u201cWe are teaching because we have to teach, but proper teaching and learning is not taking place,\u201d said Bernard Shakwana, a teacher at Ziyanda\u2019s school, Mpumelelo Primary. Last year, he tried teaching the 60 students in his class under a tree because deep cracks in the school walls and floors suggested that the building might collapse.Tifonto Masuku, who taught at the school for 35 years, said she retired early because the conditions had become unbearable. The quality of education had suffered so much that she considered it even worse than under apartheid.\u201cAll this is because of the A.N.C.,\u201d Ms. Masuku said. She now runs a butcher shop.It took four days of rage before the local A.N.C. councilor showed up.The councilor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: He is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.He certainly understood the parents\u2019 anger, he said. During the 1980s, he walked more than six miles a day to school, skipping bus fare to save enough money to eat.But these days, he said, most students graduate without a command of the English language, dooming their job prospects.\u201cThe foundation before was better,\u201d he said of the quality of education in the province.By the time he got to Ziyanda\u2019s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the A.N.C.\u2019s leaders.Mr. Siboza made sure to bring a gun.Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he said. \u201cYou must stay with him,\u201d he said of his gun.The A.N.C. has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mr. Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the A.N.C. as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several A.N.C. officials said, Mr. Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the A.N.C. ensures its dominance.But Ms. Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mr. Mabuza, rejected any suggestion that the A.N.C. had failed to prioritize education.Before becoming deputy foreign minister, she served as Mr. Mabuza\u2019s education minister in the province for nearly a decade. The A.N.C., she said, had built schools in every corner of the country, making education accessible to all. The government gives students meals, books and, to the poorest, free education. It also issues monthly grants to children, pensions to the elderly and free houses to many, she said.She dismissed the argument that education had been as good, or better, during apartheid, calling it a false depiction of the nation\u2019s brutal past.\u201cIf you know the Bible, the story of the Egyptians moving from Egypt to Canaan, when they were faced with the Red Sea, they said, \u2018Why did you take us out of Egypt? It was good there,\u2019\u201d she said.Officials like Ms. Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Mr. Siboza, the local A.N.C. councilor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.\u201cThey wanted to kill me,\u201d the councilor said.Mr. Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun \u2014 firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. \u201cThis man is a church member,\u201d he said.A few days later, the A.N.C. councilor visited the children he had wounded.\u201cThe councilor said he was very sorry,\u201d said the girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councilor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she said. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy\u2019s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councilor, about $150.The boy\u2019s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplored the state of education.\u201cThey promise,\u201d she said, \u201cand they just disappear.\u201dStill, she would remain loyal to the governing party.\u201cYes, of course, I vote A.N.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s our freedom.\u201dThe protests spilled into September, but the country\u2019s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Mr. Zuma as South Africa\u2019s president.The all-important A.N.C. party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the A.N.C. released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mr. Mabuza: His previously low-ranking province was now the A.N.C.\u2019s second-most powerful.Mr. Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, A.N.C. membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 percent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 percent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga\u2019s explosive growth.But Mr. Mabuza\u2019s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former A.N.C. officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money \u2014 with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that \u201cirregular expenditures\u201d more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, A.N.C. officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students\u2019 expense.As premier, Mr. Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11 million to around $30 million.Asked whether Mr. Mabuza wanted the mega schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Ms. Mhaule, his former education minister, laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dBut other officials say the mega schools were overpriced projects to reward Mr. Mabuza\u2019s allies and finance his A.N.C. membership drive.Mr. Mabuza \u201cdecided that they\u2019re going to build mega schools because that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d said Mr. Mahlalela, the senior A.N.C. official. \u201cThese small schools where there\u2019s a crisis of 16 toilets, it\u2019s not a big sum of money. So it\u2019s not easy to steal.\u201dWith the money Mr. Mabuza amassed, current and former A.N.C. officials said, his operatives signed up supporters by providing jobs, money or even just lunch, illegally inflating the party\u2019s membership rolls by paying people\u2019s annual dues with government money.Mr. Malomane, the A.N.C. official who learned math from Mr. Mabuza in high school, said his former teacher used other tricks to exaggerate the ranks of party loyalists, like \u201ccloning,\u201d in which one person appeared on several party membership rolls at once.On Mr. Mabuza\u2019s farm in Barberton, south of the provincial capital, his power was on full display, current and former A.N.C. officials said. He received contractors and took his cut before projects were awarded, they said. Those who refused to participate often faced exile.Mr. Sedibe, his former ally, recounted how young party workers went to the farm for wads of cash from Mr. Mabuza \u2014 often about $750 \u2014 to wage his recruitment drive.\u201cHe always had money in his house,\u201d said Mr. Sedibe, who is now an opposition leader.\u201cI\u2019m here to serve South Africans,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s give this government a chance.\u201dHe beamed: He now served under President Ramaphosa, who had served under President Zuma, who had served under President Thabo Mbeki, who had served under President Mandela. All of them, except for Mr. Mandela, were forced out by their successors.Asked whether Mr. Mabuza would lead the nation one day, Ms. Mhaule, his former education minister, sounded confident.\u201cHe may,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will. Not he may, he will.\u201d\u201cHe is very safe with me next to him,\u201d Mr. Mabuza has said.But back in Mr. Mabuza\u2019s province, the government is in trouble. The two biggest departments in the budget \u2014 education and health \u2014 are plagued by mismanagement, the National Treasury says. The health department is at risk of being taken over by the provincial treasury. Political killings have resumed.\u201cThe center does not hold anymore,\u201d said Mr. Sedibe, the former A.N.C. leader.In June, residents furious over poor government services set four schools on fire.\u201cWhere are the children going to learn?\u201d asked Sdudla Mlambo in a township called Matsulu.The night before, a fire tore through six classrooms in her granddaughter\u2019s school. Yellow tape cordoned off the site.A neighbor, Jessica Sibiya, a 17-year-old high school student, said she used to attend the school. But with Mr. Mabuza\u2019s ascent, she said with a smile, things were looking up. Surely his hour would come.\u201cI\u2019ll be happy if D.D. becomes president,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019ll help this province.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "These Companies Really, Really, Really Want to Freeze Your Eggs", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEgg-freezing clinics are aggressively courting a new generation. Younger millennials are heeding the call. Jennifer Lannon lay, her feet propped in stirrups, on an examining table at Extend Fertility, an egg-freezing clinic in Midtown Manhattan. A screen at her right displayed the results of her ultrasound, the image closely monitored by Ms. Lannon and her doctor, Joshua Klein. How many eggs could she expect to see? she asked. She would likely end up with some 20, Dr. Klein told her. He was making no promises. \u201cBut to the extent you can ensure fertility later,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are in very good shape.\u201d She ought to be. Ms. Lannon, who works for Dot.Health, a website that stores participants\u2019 medical data, is 26, more than a decade younger than most women freezing their eggs in the hope of maximizing their chances, when they are ready, of conceiving and bearing a healthy child. She has no known reproductive issues or urgent health concerns. But in her mind the clock is ticking.A self-defined take-charge personality, Ms. Lannon would be taking no chances. Her objective, she said, was \u201cto know that later in life I\u2019m going to have the best shot at having viable frozen eggs for when I need them.\u201d She is also, she knows, a target for the many egg-freezing clinics springing up across the country, facilities that tout the procedure as a breezy, accessible and eminently sensible lifestyle choice for the youngest members of the millennial generation. \u201cWe are now targeting women in their 20s and early 30s,\u201d Ms. Herzberg said. Her company, like many others, is intent on spreading the gospel that for the youngest consumers, as she said, \u201cthe process has never been better, faster or cheaper, or more likely to yield a better store of high-quality eggs.\u201d It\u2019s a message the company plans to magnify via a national advertising campaign encompassing radio, television, print and social media. A half-dozen years ago, around the time freezing technology had advanced to the point that the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (A.S.R.M.) no longer deemed the procedure experimental, clinics like Prelude, Pacific NW Fertility in Seattle, Shady Grove in Washington and Ova in Chicago began reminding their youngest target customers that fertility is finite and begins to wane as early as one\u2019s 20s. Those clinics once catered almost exclusively to women at the older end of their childbearing years.Their messaging, generally friendly and fact based but in some cases alarmist in tone, varies from Ova\u2019s invitations to \u201cfreeze for your future,\u201d to Extend\u2019s more urgent \u201ceggs are a nonrenewable resource.\u201d The exhortations are underscored by cheery images variously showing gaggles of young women gathered over drinks or ambling arm in arm down a city street. To provide intelligence to consumers, and presumably whip up business, some clinics are hosts to \u201clets chill\u201d egg-freezing parties, inviting guests to take in facts and figures along with Champagne and canap\u00e9s. Others glamorize the procedure in Instagram posts that feature women like Kaitlyn Bristowe, a lead on \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d who have tweeted independently about their own freezing experiences. Kindbody, a clinic in New York, takes an even more aggressive approach, inviting potential clients to hop aboard a pop-up van to have their hormone levels tested. Clinics have further eased barriers with significant price drops. Once as high as $19,000 for the cost of a single cycle, fees today can vary from about $4,000 to $7,000 for a procedure that entails one to two weeks of birth control pills to turn off natural hormones, nine or 10 days of hormone injections to stimulate egg production, followed, once the eggs have matured, by retrieval and freezing. (Initial consultation and storage are not generally included.) Moreover, some boutique-like freezing facilities offer financing incentives to clients still advancing in their careers or paying off college debt. No surprise, then, that millennials are heeding the call, intent on securing their reproductive futures. They form part of the population of some 76,000 women expected to freeze their eggs in the United States this year, according to Gina Bartasi, the former chief executive of Progyny. \u201cNow I\u2019m hearing from parents who have teenagers and college-age daughters who are looking at this as a future gift,\u201d Ms. Landis said. \u201cI have 25-year-olds call me because their parents are willing to foot the bill.\u201d For better or worse, enthusiasm for the procedure reflects a sense of social entitlement that some say is coupled, as often as not, with a scanty grasp of facts. Biology is often at odds with feminist ideals, Ms. Selvaratnam argued in an interview, and science, while promising, has yet to produce miracles.Inflated expectations are \u201cpart of a collective phenomenon,\u201d she said, referring to a widely held conviction that when it comes to assisted reproduction, the options are virtually limitless. That notion is particularly appealing to single women with no imminent prospect of finding a partner with whom to start a family. Motivations remain as varied as the profiles of women who freeze. Some, like Ms. Swarm of Freeze.Health, who has heard her share of distress stories from older women with problems conceiving, views the procedure as a matter of course. \u201cI wear sunscreen to protect myself from future sun damage,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI work out to keep off my weight. Why would I not do something to prevent future emotional pain and suffering?\u201d For others, freezing and storing one\u2019s eggs can enhance a sense of material worth. \u201cThese young women they are putting their eggs on ice as part of a list of things they are accomplishing,\u201d Ms. Landis said. \u201cIt's like getting a master\u2019s degree or buying a house, all in the name of making themselves more valuable.\u201dMs. Lorenz has no regrets. The process, she said, \u201cis a way for you to feel like you\u2019re in control of your life, at least at the time you are doing it.\u201dVictoria Reitano, a 27-year-old former television producer turned branding entrepreneur, is more steely in her conviction. \u201cThis is not just some whim, like I\u2019m 17 years old and I want kids someday,\u201d she said. \u201cMy life plan at some point is to have at least two children. I\u2019ve already made provisions for that.\u201dThat mind-set, however, can be illusory. Undertaking the procedure in one\u2019s 20s can give a false sense of security, a certainty that, responsibly or otherwise, marketers tend to encourage. \u201cYou are dealing with women\u2019s existential desire to start a family,\u201d Ms. Selvaratnam said. \u201cYou are playing to their vulnerabilities.\u201d Freezing, as some argue, may even be counterproductive. \u201cAssuming you have normal fertility and nothing unusual in your family history, there\u2019s definitely a point where it\u2019s too early, and we don\u2019t know what the shelf life of these eggs are,\u201d Dr. Janis Fox recently told The New York Times. Dr. Fox is an assistant professor of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Harvard University and an obstetrician-gynecologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. He advises patients that the procedure can take a toll, both physical and emotional. Bloating and mood swings are among the most common side effects, as his patients attest. \u201cIn the first few days after I started my injections, I felt incredible,\u201d Ms. Reitano said. \u201cBut close to a week later, I started getting \u2018mommy brain.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t remember my words. I was very tired. I would take a nap, and then I would just not want to do anything.\u201dToward the end, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to see another human being.\u201d Danielle Page, who underwent the process at Extend shortly before her 30th birthday in February, had been similarly advised that she might experience emotional swings. In the weeks after starting medication, her spirits plummeted. \u201cPeople asked, \u2018Oh, is it like PMS?\u2019\u201d she said, then added emphatically: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like PMS. I never understood what depression was like, about not being able to pull myself out a dark mood. It was very scary at the time, but it helped to know that it was going to end eventually.\u201dSuccess rates can be less than impressive. According to the A.S.R.M., there is a 2 to 12 percent chance that a single frozen egg will result in a birth. And eggs may be lost. Refrigeration failures reported last spring resulted in the destruction of thousands of eggs at University Hospitals clinic in Cleveland and at Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco, in which Prelude Fertility owns a majority stake. Lawsuits have been filed in both instances. \u201cYou take care of your body as you would your home,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hope your house doesn\u2019t flood, but you get the insurance just in case it does.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the Shady Grove fertility clinic. It is in Washington, not New York.An earlier version of this article misattributed a statistic about egg freezing.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Take Tesla Private. Can He Make the Math Work? ", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA buyout of the electric-car maker would be complicated and costly.The public markets have treated Mr. Musk well, supplying him with plenty of equity capital over the years. He also has many patient shareholders who have stood by him as he has behaved in unorthodox ways, missed important production targets and used Tesla to purchase his solar company, SolarCity. And Tesla\u2019s shares were on a tear just before he fired off his tweet.Mr. Musk is the single largest Tesla shareholder, owning just under 20 percent of the company. After Mr. Musk, there is a steep drop-off. Baillie Gifford, an investment firm based in Scotland, is Tesla\u2019s second-largest shareholder, with about 8 percent of the shares. Mr. Musk has made clear that he is not envisioning a traditional leveraged buyout, in which buyers borrow money to take a company private and then saddle the company with the new debt. Few banks would be willing to back such a transaction, given that Tesla\u2019s cash flows are erratic and it already has a fair amount of debt. Instead, Mr. Musk believes that \u201capproximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how he came up with that number, and which investors, if any, have committed to take part in a deal. If Mr. Musk did get shareholders owning two-thirds of the stock to take part, he would need around $24 billion to buy out the others at $420 a share. But if he is unable to muster that much support, the deal could get much costlier. But not all of these investors might be able to own substantial stakes in a private company. Some big institutional investors hold Tesla shares in index funds, and would most likely sell in the event of a deal. And in recent months, two of Tesla\u2019s largest holders, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Management, sold large chunks of their shares in the company.Here's where Tesla\u2019s broad investor base may help Mr. Musk: Even if some of the top shareholders don't stick around, allowing many of the smaller shareholders to buy in could, in theory, replace the loss of one or two big investors. That\u2019s the $24 billion question. Mr. Musk suggested that financing was secured for the deal when he sent his Twitter message on Aug. 7. In his blog post, Mr. Musk elaborated, saying that he had been discussing taking Tesla private with the Saudis for nearly two years. Mr. Musk said he was working with Silver Lake, the private equity firm. Silver Lake took part in the buyout of Dell, and could contribute capital to a deal for Tesla. Institutional investors like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity sometimes take equity stakes in private technology companies, and could do something similar here. And Mr. Musk, a billionaire, could draw on his broad network of relationships and companies, including SpaceX. Another, more likely maneuver would see Mr. Musk sell some of his SpaceX stake to help finance the Tesla deal, or use it as collateral for a big loan. In that case, Mr. Musk would need a buyer for his SpaceX shares. \u201cThe intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla,\u201d he wrote in the letter to employees.If Mr. Musk can muster enough support for a deal, he will bring forward a proposal. If the board approves it, shareholders will be given the opportunity to roll into a newly private Tesla, or tender their shares. But to ensure that the deal is protected against legal challenges, a majority of Tesla's shareholders, excluding Mr. Musk, would most likely have to vote for the deal, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware. So instead of simply needing 31 percent of Tesla shareholders to combine with Mr. Musk's 20 percent stake, a much larger proportion of the minority shareholders would in theory need to vote for the deal.

This is where we are now: building coalitions around causes, often with those to whom we take offense or even despise. The enemy of my enemy is my temporary tool.Hopefully these coalitions will not need to be longstanding. Trump\u2019s fortress of fraudulence is showing cracks. A life lived on the edges of the law is inching into full view. Justice is yearning to be served.Cohen flipped, and Trump flipped out. \u201cIf somebody defrauded a bank and he is going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail, but you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you will go down to two years or three years, which is the deal he made, in all fairness to him, most people are going to do that. \u2026 And I have seen it many times. I have had many friends involved in this stuff. It\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal.\u201dThe use of informants is a central part of how some criminal prosecutions are executed. This is how the justice system works.Trump is a man who has lived a life evading justice, using the legal system and the threat of legal action against people. For him, the justice system is a tool at the disposal of the wealthy and the ruthless, one to be used against anyone of lesser means and lesser fortitude. In his mind, the fact that he may be implicated by the justice system is a blasphemy, a distortion of the American power structure, in which the wealthy almost always win.As he told Fox: \u201cI\u2019ve always had controversy in my life and I\u2019ve always succeeded. I\u2019ve always won. I\u2019ve always won.\u201d\u201cFederal prosecutors in Manhattan struck a deal earlier this summer with Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, granting him immunity for his grand jury testimony about Michael D.

Trump demands loyalty, and loyalty freely given should be honored and revered. When the dishonorable attempt to purchase it, either with money or fear, it will always prove false in the end.No one can outrun the truth forever. Eventually, the truth always catches up. It comes out. It shines. I predict that the whole truth of Trump will shock the world, even more than it is already shocked. Trump may have the undying loyalty of the zombies who rose from what was once the mainstream Republican Party, but not even that can forever stave off the reckoning.I\u2019m not a very religious person, but I am fond of Galatians 6:7 in the Bible:\u201cBe not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rand Paul Continues His One-Man D\u00e9tente With Russia, This Time in Moscow", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 There may be little that pleases Senator Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican, more than thumbing his nose at Washington groupthink.So it was on Monday when Mr. Paul, decamping for the Senate\u2019s one-week recess, took his lonely defense of President Trump\u2019s Russia policy to Moscow to deliver a show of contrarianism all too familiar to his colleagues back home.\u201cI\u2019ve traveled here to say that there are many Americans who want to have diplomacy, that want to have engagement; I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Mr. Paul said, standing beside Konstantin Kosachyov, the chairman of the foreign relations committee of Russia\u2019s senate who has been subject to American sanctions since April.Mr. Paul has something else in mind \u2014 maybe even taking some Russian lawmakers back to Washington.\u201cOur biggest issue right now is no dialogue,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the issues at hand. The issue is that we can\u2019t have discussion of issues because we have no dialogue.\u201dAs he stepped out of a meeting with senators of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament, on Monday, Mr. Paul said that he had extended an invitation to members of its foreign policy committee to visit Washington. The two sides would also try to arrange a meeting in a neutral third country, he said \u2014 which presumably would allow Mr. Kosachyov to attend without the pesky issue of sanctions hanging over his head.Later in the day, in a meeting with members of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, Mr. Paul said he would oppose the passage of new Russia sanctions proposed by his Senate colleagues. He complained about \u201csanctions hysteria\u201d in Washington, according to a report by RIA Novosti, a Russian state-run news agency.\u201cIf you, Senator Paul, stand up in defense of Maria Butina, even in order to get her restrictive measure changed, even to get her released from custody \u2014 and we are seeking her release and the opportunity for her to return to her homeland \u2014 you will really show yourself to be a real human being,\u201d the Interfax news agency quoted the lawmaker Leonid Slutsky saying.Mr. Paul was the only lawmaker on the trip, which was financed by the Cato Institute, a leading libertarian research organization in Washington. He was accompanied by Peter Goettler, Cato\u2019s president and chief executive, and Don Huffines, a Texas state senator who was chairman of Mr. Paul\u2019s presidential campaign in the state.Speaking to journalists, Mr. Kosachyov denied that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and said that it would not intervene in future races.\u201cWe had a constructive meeting and agreed on concrete plans on how we can restore contacts between our committees in the near future,\u201d Mr. Kosachyov said. \u201cWe are absolutely ready for this. The rest is up to the American side.\u201dMr. Paul described his meeting with senators of the Federation Council as \u201cvery successful,\u201d saying that he came to Moscow \u201cto renew diplomacy, engagement and communications with Russia.\u201dRussia\u2019s relations with the West have not improved since then, as Moscow has backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, played a central part in supporting the government in Syria\u2019s civil war, interfered in other countries\u2019 elections, and been accused of using a nerve agent in an assassination attempt on British soil.And while other lawmakers may be incensed by Russia\u2019s meddling in American elections, Mr. Paul has suggested that the United States has done the same thing.Mr. Trump\u2019s performance at the meeting was viewed even less kindly. But that has not stopped the president from pushing ahead with his campaign to warm relations: Just days after he returned, Mr. Trump said he planned to invite Mr. Putin to Washington.Ivan Nechepurenko reported from Moscow, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}

Opinion Columnist\u201cThe president has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, calling it \u201ccallous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle.\u201dThen there was Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea for criminal violations of campaign-finance laws. This was soon followed by the usual casuistry from Donald Trump and his defenders explaining why the offense, as it related to the president, was legally trivial; or that the economy would collapse in the event of impeachment; or that Trump\u2019s critics were mentally deranged; or that the president was entitled to the sort of deference due to kings.It was all vintage Bill: deploying minions to lie about illicit sex (and twist the meaning of words); abusing the powers of the presidency to trash the reputations of others; converting his character flaws into a national convulsion. Clinton did all this, and so has Trump. What the former pioneered, the latter has simply taken to the next level. By the same token, liberals now calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment ought to rethink the excuses so many of them made for Clinton 20 years ago. That it was \u201cjust sex.\u201d Or that \u201clying about sex\u201d doesn\u2019t rise to the level of an impeachable offense (even if it\u2019s lying about sex under oath). Or that \u201ccharacter doesn\u2019t matter\u201d so long as the administration produces peace and prosperity. Or that the motivating animus of the president\u2019s critics is reason enough to dismiss the criticism.These excuses were toxic not because they had no merit, but because they sidestepped the core of the issue: that the survival and ennoblement of democracy depend on holding people in high office to higher, not lower, standards.Then, too, the Clinton machine\u2019s relentless efforts to delegitimize the independent counsel by claiming Starr had gone far beyond his original remit to investigate the Whitewater case mirror the Trump machine\u2019s attacks on Robert Mueller today.Yet what Starr did then is what Mueller and other prosecutors are doing now: uncovering wrongdoing where they find it. That Trump\u2019s hush money to two women has nothing to do with Russia makes the wrongdoing no less contemptible, illegal \u2014 and, because it\u2019s about the president, impeachable.Because the Clinton impeachment saga is still relatively recent, it\u2019s been depressing \u2014 and instructive \u2014 to watch the two sides in that drama conveniently adopt the other\u2019s former rationale for their own partisan convenience. (Lindsey Graham, this means you.)But anyone who now calls for Trump to be judged severely should acknowledge that we would have been in a better place today if Clinton hadn\u2019t been so fervently defended back then. Among other things, it might have dissuaded other sexual predators and congenital liars from running for high office.We can still get it right. Some intellectual consistency would go a long way.Advertisement"}

It sets up twin governors\u2019 races in neighboring Southern states between left-leaning African-Americans banking on the region\u2019s new, diversifying electorate, and ardent, Trump-style nationalists.Georgia\u2019s Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, will now be joined by Mr. Gillum, while its Republican candidate, the secretary of state Brian Kemp, has a mirror to the south in Mr. DeSantis.And here, with redistricting looming after the next census, Medicaid expansion on the line and control of the most crucial presidential battleground at stake, the Florida governor\u2019s race is shaping up to be a titanic showdown. The specter of two young, hard-charging politicians who represent the beating heart of their parties facing off will supercharge the fall campaign.\u201cWe\u2019re going to make clear to the rest of the world that the dark days that we\u2019ve been under, coming out of Washington, that the derision and the division that has been coming out of our White House, that right here in the state of Florida we are going to remind this nation of what is truly the American way,\u201d Mr. Gillum told jubilant supporters in Tallahassee.In Arizona, Republican primary voters chose the establishment favorite, Representative Martha McSally, to replace Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken G.O.P. critic in the Senate, Jeff Flake, in a contest that evolved into a test of which candidate could embrace Mr. Trump most snugly. In the Arizona governor\u2019s primary, Democrats again chose an outspoken progressive over a pragmatist.Lifted by a June endorsement from Mr. Trump, Mr. DeSantis overwhelmed Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner and one-time favorite for the nomination, taking 57 percent of the vote to Mr. Putnam\u2019s 37 percent with all precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press.But the surprise of the night was Mr. Gillum\u2019s victory over Ms. Graham, the daughter of governor-turned-senator Bob Graham. Propelled by an endorsement from Senator Bernie Sanders and financing from Tom Steyer, George Soros and Collective PAC, a group dedicated to electing African-Americans, the 39-year-old mayor surged at the end of the campaign to upset Ms. Graham, the establishment pick.See full results and maps from the Florida primaries.With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Gillum won 34 percent of the vote while Ms. Graham had 31 percent, The A.P. reported.Beyond Ms. Graham, Mr. Gillum defeated five other rivals. Three opponents \u2014 Ms. Graham, Philip Levine and Jeff Greene \u2014 far outspent the Tallahassee mayor.Campaigning in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood on Saturday, Mr. Gillum relished his underdog status.\u201cMy opponents have spent, together, over $90 million in this race. We have spent four\u201d million, he said. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t vote. People do.\u201dMr. Gillum edged out Ms. Graham, a former North Florida congresswoman who finished second, and Mr. Levine, the former Miami Beach mayor who finished third after dropping nearly $30 million of his personal fortune into the campaign. Ms. Graham, a moderate, had been considered the favorite in a midterm year in which many Democratic women have fared well.But her centrism and the implicit case for electability proved to be of little asset in a year when emotions have gripped both parties.In the final weeks of the election, Mr. Gillum aired an ad trumpeting his support for universal health care, legalizing marijuana and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He is also a vocal advocate of impeaching Mr. Trump.Addressing supporters at her election night party at a bar in downtown Orlando just before 10 p.m., Ms. Graham called Mr. Gillum a friend before, during and after the campaign.\u201cI said, \u2018Now, Andrew, go out and win this damn thing,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this is too important.\u201dMr. Gillum\u2019s unexpected nomination represents a sharp break with recent Florida midterm elections, in which Democratic voters nominated somewhat bland moderates to try to win in a purple state. Instead, they lost over and over again: Democrats have not held the Florida governor\u2019s mansion in two decades, and they lost the past two governor\u2019s elections by a single percentage point.Mr. Gillum argued Democrats needed to back a progressive who could expand the electorate by attracting more black, Latino and millennial voters who might otherwise sit out the midterm.\u201cWe\u2019re showing that we can bring together the Bernie Sanders wing of the party and the Hillary Clinton wing of the party,\u201d he said in a recent interview. Democrats cannot win, he added, by \u201ctrying to be Republican-lite.\u201dFlorida Democrats have long considered Mr. Gillum a rising star in a state party with few of them. He was elected to the city commission while still a student at Florida A&M University, and he spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.But only in the last few weeks of the governor\u2019s race did Mr. Gillum start looking like a serious contender. Early on, he struggled to raise serious money, as donors worried about an F.B.I. investigation into City Hall corruption \u2014 an inquiry that Mr. DeSantis wasted no time in raising Tuesday night. \u201cHe\u2019s embroiled in corruption scandals,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy can\u2019t even run the city of Tallahassee.\u201dThe mayor, who has said he is not the investigation\u2019s target, consistently placed fourth out of five in public polls, despite outperforming his opponents in debates with his charisma on stage and grass-roots support in the audience.His poor showing in surveys, however, kept his rivals from attacking him, allowing Mr. Gillum to move up unscathed by the pointed television attacks that engulfed Ms. Graham, Mr. Levine and Mr. Greene, a billionaire Palm Beach real estate investor who spent nearly $40 million but finished fourth.But Mr. Trump was grateful for Mr. DeSantis\u2019s televised advocacy, believed the former JAG officer looked the part of a governor and had little relationship with Mr. Putnam. In June, Mr. Trump offered, as he put it on Twitter, his \u201cfull Endorsement.\u201dRecounting his intervention in the Florida race last week at a rally last week in West Virginia, Mr. Trump said of Mr. DeSantis: \u201cHe was at three, and I gave him a nice shot, and a nice little tweet \u2014 bing bing \u2014 and he went from three to like 20 something.\u201dMr. DeSantis was almost certainly winning more than 3 percent of the vote when Mr. Trump weighed in, but there is little doubt that the president\u2019s support dramatically reshaped the race.Mr. DeSantis trumpeted the endorsement in his advertising and basked in the president\u2019s praise when they stood together on stage in Tampa in late July.Mr. Putnam fought back, emphasizing his deep knowledge of Florida and chiding Mr. DeSantis for his television ubiquity. The son of a citrus farming family who was elected to the State Legislature when he was 22, he went on to serve in the House leadership in Washington.\u201cFlorida\u2019s not picking an apprentice; we\u2019re picking a governor,\u201d Mr. Putnam said.Her Republican opponent will be Maria Elvira Salazar, a former Spanish-language television journalist who on Tuesday bested a crowded field, including a rival who said as a child she went up on a spaceship with aliens. Democrats are expected to pick up the liberal-leaning seat, which is currently held by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a veteran Republican who is retiring.In Orlando, Representative Darren Soto, the first Puerto Rican elected to Congress from Florida, fended off a Democratic primary challenge from former Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal firebrand who has struggled in his attempt to return to Washington.In Arizona, just three days after the death of Senator John McCain, Republicans demonstrated how much the party had drifted from Mr. McCain\u2019s pragmatic style of politics to Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line nationalism.After asking the president to stay out of the race, Ms. McSally, who would not say how she voted in 2016, sought Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement earlier this month.Ms. McSally, one of the first women to fly in combat for the Air Force, handily beat two far-right conservatives who divided that part of the electorate: the former Maricopa County sheriff, Joe Arpaio, whom Mr. Trump pardoned last year, and Kelli Ward, a former state senator who garnered nearly 40 percent in a 2016 primary against Mr. McCain and sought to capitalize on his death Monday by saying \u201cpolitical correctness is like a cancer.\u201dMs. McSally will now take on the Democratic primary victor, Representative Kyrsten Sinema, in a contest that could help decide control of the Senate.Speaking to supporters, Ms. McSally called for a moment of silence for Mr. McCain, but then quickly targeted Ms. Sinema. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between a doer and a talker, between a patriot and a protester,\u201d Ms. McSally said.Ms. Sinema also bowed to Mr. McCain and placed herself in his tradition of \u201calways putting country over party,\u201d saying that Arizonans need \u201can independent voice\u201d in the Senate.In the governor\u2019s race there, David Garcia, a liberal Democrat, defeated his centrist opponent, Steve Farley, to take on Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who may be vulnerable in November.Mr. Garcia, a former executive at the State Education Department, has sought to rally progressives, urging them to \u201cimagine no wall in southern Arizona.\u201d Mr. Farley argued that Democrats can win in a red-tinted state only by presenting themselves as pragmatists.In Oklahoma, Republicans nominated the Tulsa business executive Kevin Stitt in the runoff for governor, spurning former Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, who was attacked as being insufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump. With Gov. Mary Fallin, the Republican lame duck, leaving office with dismal approval ratings, Democrats believe they could be competitive in what is generally a deeply conservative state.Simon Romero contributed reporting from Tempe, Ariz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Struggling to Get Pregnant Turn to Fertility Apps", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Nicole and Christopher Roberts of North Stonington, Conn., decided to start a family in 2016, Nicole quickly became pregnant, but then miscarried three months later.Getting pregnant a second time became far tougher than they expected. Mrs. Roberts, 32, started taking neonatal vitamins, tracking her menstrual cycle carefully, taking over-the-counterovulation tests, and even trying a few wacky internet suggestions, such as putting her legs up in the air after sex and not moving for half an hour.\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the months dragged on, there was a feeling of desperation because we wanted it so badly.\u201dThen she saw an ad for Ava, a Fitbit-like device that\u2019s worn on the wrist at night and uses sensors to identify the five fertile days in a woman\u2019s monthly cycle to improve her odds of conception. \u201cIt almost felt too good to be true,\u201d Mrs. Roberts said. She started using the device in March 2017, was pregnant by June, and gave birth to Amelia this year on March 19.Mrs. Roberts is among a growing number of women who are seeking out fertility apps and wearable devices, like Ava, to help grow their families.Busy lifestyles have made it tougher for working couples to find the time to track menstrual cycles, take ovulation tests, measure their daily temperature, and then make that all-important physical connection at just the right time in the cycle to create a baby.Also, many women, especially among millennials, are focusing on careers and putting off marriage and children until later, which poses additional challenges as conception rates are lower in older women. \u201cFor a 28-year-old woman, roughly 10 of the 12 eggs she releases each year are viable,\u201d Ms. Von Bidder said. \u201cBut for a 38-year old woman, perhaps only two of the 12 eggs will be viable.\u201d So pinpointing those fertile days becomes even more critical.The birthrate among women under 30 has been falling steadily since 2010 while the rate among women in their late 30s, 40s and 50s has been rising, according to National Center for Health statistics.\u201cIn my mind, if you had [unprotected] sex, you got pregnant and that was it,\u201d said Kate Campbell, a 32-year-old Nashville resident, who was measuring her body temperature and taking ovulation tests twice a day for months to try to conceive \u2014 without success. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting any positives. I was really shocked. How do people get pregnant by accident?\u201dAfter purchasing an Ava bracelet in April 2017, she discovered she had been missing her fertility window by about a week because her cycles were longer than normal and regular period-tracking apps didn\u2019t pick that up. By August, she was pregnant, and her son, Canaan James, was born on April 27, 2018.The internet is filled with women on forums, Facebook and videos seeking fertility advice. They say the problem is highly misunderstood and deeply underestimated.The Ava bracelet collects data on nine parameters, including skin temperature, resting pulse rate, breathing, sleep movement, and stress levels, while the woman sleeps. Once the bracelet is synced to the person\u2019s phone in the morning, Ava\u2019s proprietary algorithm achieves an 89 percent accuracy rate at detecting 5.3 fertile days each cycle, according to the company.By measuring temperature and other variables, Ava is able to track changes in both progesterone and estrodial levels, Ms. Von Bidder said.\u201cI didn\u2019t have to worry about peeing on a stick and stressing out,\u201d said Krystal Noon, a 30-year old Branchville, N.J., resident, who struggled for months to conceive before using Ava. \u201cI would just put this bracelet on at night and it does all the work,\u201d said Mrs. Noon, who conceived two months after using Ava.Since its introduction in 2016, Ms. Von Bidder said, 10,000 Ava customers have become pregnant and at least 1,000 have given birth. Sales are on track to triple this year, she added.But Ava isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s limited to women with cycles between 24 and 35 days, and is not for those with PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, who face hormone imbalances and highly irregular cycles.And Ava has some competitors.But none track all of the parameters that Ava does, Ms. Von Bidder said. \u201cBecause we measure more physiological parameters than just temperature, we can actually detect the fertile window earlier and with a higher accuracy.\u201d.One wearable, OvuSense, is worn like a tampon and measures temperature and other factors. Its readings are considered more accurate than those taken by external devices and can even predict ovulation days for people with PCOS. However, the device is more intrusive than wearing an Ava bracelet.\u201cI would be a little bit more leery of it because that sounds a little more invasive,\u201d said Tara Perez, a 34-year-old Cartersville, Ga., resident who used the Ava bracelet to help conceive.A big Ava perk is its wildly popular Facebook groups, where 25,000 registered Ava users ask questions, share experiences and encourage each other. \u201cThat community of women is unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Mrs. Perez, who credits the group with helping her through her fertility struggles. Mrs. Perez said family members had told her she likely would never be able to have children because she was Type 1 diabetic. But the Ava community helped and encouraged her through the loss of one baby to heart failure at 34 weeks and another through a form of early miscarriage, or \u201cchemical pregnancy,\u201d at five weeks \u2014 before giving birth to a healthy baby girl, Selene, on May 30, this year.Still, Ava has its skeptics. On Reddit, some questioned Ava\u2019s efficacy, given that it had been tested on only 41 women in its original trial.Then there\u2019s Ava\u2019s $249 price tag. \u201cWhile it was expensive, it was a whole lot less expensive than trying to look into something like in vitro or trying to ovulate via medication,\u201d Mrs. Perez said.Some critics noted that none of the fertility apps and devices have proven data that shows they significantly shorten the time it takes for a woman to become pregnant. \u201cNone of them have undergone time-to-pregnancy studies,\u201d said Dr. Victoria Jennings, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Reproductive Health. \u201cBut it won\u2019t stop women from using them or the developers from promoting them.\u201dAva has raised $42.3 million in financing.And Pascal Koenig, chief executive and co-founder of Ava, said three studies were underway, including one with more than 430 participants, on expanding Ava\u2019s use to include detecting infections during pregnancy, helping women with highly irregular cycles and helping perimenopausal women.Dr. Zev Williams, chief of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility at Columbia University Medical Center, sees value in both fertility apps and wearables. Even a basic app can help a woman see if her cycles are seriously irregular and require medical attention, he said.But he\u2019s particularly interested in Ava.\u201cIt seems pretty sophisticated,\u201d said Dr. Williams, who is in talks with the company about doing a more extensive joint study on the device. \u201cWe have an overarching goal of trying to make fertility treatment easier for women and couples going through it, and if this worked out, it would have the potential to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Duncan Hunter\u2019s Indictment in California Opens the Door for a Long-Shot Challenger", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN DIEGO \u2014 Ammar Campa-Najjar is the son of an Arab father and a Mexican-American mother. His campaign for Congress has been embraced by Democratic activists across the nation. He is an advocate of tough environmental measures, including a permanent moratorium on offshore drilling, and legal protections for immigrants who were brought into this nation as children.The indictment came on the same day that President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman was found guilty of defrauding the federal government and his longtime personal lawyer pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes, which he said he committed at the direction of Mr. Trump.Mr. Campa-Najjar\u2019s campaign had been something of a stepchild in a state that had been at the forefront of the Democratic battle to win control of Congress, attracting little attention. (\u201cThere were other mouths to feed,\u201d he said of the party\u2019s California priorities.)But on Wednesday, he found himself in a whirlwind: calls from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a run of media interviews and an influx of contributions, as he became the latest rallying point for party activists excited by the prospect of a blue victory in a deeply red region of the nation.Democrats had been focusing on seven Republican-held seats in this battleground state; that number has now grown to eight.\u201cPeople are giving me a second glance today who might not have before this indictment,\u201d Mr. Campa-Najjar said, wearing a shirt and tie in an interview at an outdoor cafe here. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for months now that we need more ethical leadership.\u201d\u201cThe question for voters, especially for conservative voters I\u2019ve spoken to, if we have a congressman who can\u2019t follow the law, how can we expect him to enforce the law?\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a dereliction of duty. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s fit to serve.\u201dAt least by the standards of the Democratic Party\u2019s activist wing this year, Mr. Campa-Najjar is hardly a hard-core liberal. In the interview, he said he does not have enough information to take a position on whether Mr. Trump should be impeached. He said he liked the idea of Medicare-for-all, but that his support for it would be contingent on being convinced the government could afford it.And he suggested that the Democratic Party was making a mistake in writing off supporters of President Trump. Mr. Campa-Najjar said he was actively recruiting Californians who had voted both for President Barack Obama in 2008 and President Trump in 2016.\u201cI come down hard on my party and people in my party who write them off,\u201d he said. \u201cThese Trump supporters aren\u2019t ignorant. They are ignored.\u201dThose positions to some extent seem tailored to the decidedly uphill battle any Democrat would face \u2014 indictment or not \u2014 running in a district where Mr. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a margin of 16 points.\u201cThis looks like the sequel to the Alabama senate race,\u201d said Thad Kousser, a political scientist at University of California, San Diego, referring to the defeat of the Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, by a Democrat, Doug Jones. \u201cHis district is almost as red a district as Alabama is a red state. Hunter still looked untouchable in this district. In any normal year and with any normal candidate, he would really be in a district that would make him untouchable.\u201dMr. Moore confronted allegations of sexual misconduct in his loss to Mr. Jones. In this case, the 47-page indictment filed against Mr. Hunter lays out an wide array of allegations against him and his wife, who are accused of using campaign funds as a personal piggy bank to pay for mundane expenses like dentist and water bills, supplies at Michael\u2019s craft store, groceries at Albertson\u2019s and their children\u2019s school lunches and tuition.They also used the money for more extravagant purchases like luggage sets, sneakers and new clothes to take with them on vacations in Lake Tahoe, Hawaii and Italy, as well as a plane ticket for a family pet, according to the indictment.While the Hunters burned through campaign cash, their own bank accounts remained in nearly constant disarray. They overdrew their more than 1,100 times in a seven-year period, according to the indictment, racking up roughly $37,761 in \u201coverdraft\u201d and \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d bank fees.The indictment also lists an incident in which Mr. Hunter\u2019s wife advised the congressman to falsely describe a personal clothing purchase as an expenditure on golf balls \u201cfor wounded warriors,\u201d an apparent reference to the Wounded Warrior Project. That offense was particularly striking in a district that has historically had such a strong military presence because of Camp Pendleton. Military veterans make up roughly 10 percent of the population.Scott Hickey, an Army veteran who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said he was extremely offended by that allegation.\u201cIt\u2019s a form of stolen valor,\u201d Mr. Hicken said, standing at the veteran\u2019s art nonprofit where he works in Fallbrook. \u201cFor somebody to say they\u2019re donating to a veteran\u2019s organization, especially a nonprofit, that\u2019s just a really crappy thing to do.\u201dMr. Hickey, who described himself as politically conservative, said he had not decided whom to vote for in November.Even as California has drifted increasingly Democratic, this inland, upper-middle-class suburb has remained solidly Republican. Mr. Hunter won by 27 percentage points in 2016. More than 40 percent of voters are registered Republicans, compared to 27 percent who are Democrats.But like other suburban districts in Southern California, the area Mr. Hunter represents is shifting \u2014 Latinos now make up roughly a third of all residents. Mr. Campa-Najjar would, if elected, be the first member of Congress of Mexican and Arab decent, though, he disputed the suggestion that his background might be a hindrance in attracting local voters.\u201cI think it\u2019s more of an asset,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people caricature my district. We\u2019re not a bunch of backwards, backwoods, bigoted people. The district\u2019s changing. I think it\u2019s an asset for me to turn out the Latino population.\u201dMr. Campa-Najjar \u2014 who worked at the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, for the Obama re-election campaign and at the Labor Department \u2014has emphasized his family\u2019s background as the child of a Mexican-American mother and a father who immigrated from the Middle East. When he was a child, his family moved to Gaza for several years, returning to San Diego when a war broke out there. Mr. Campa-Najjar\u2019s grandfather led the plan to murder Israeli Olympians at the games in Germany in 1972; Israeli military commandos assassinated his grandfather, Muhammed Yusuf al-Najjar, in 1973.\u201cThe question now is about the challenger: Is he really the right challenger who can oust the incumbent under fire. Is he a moderate person?\u201d said Mr. Kousser, the political scientist. \u201cDo the Democrats have and spend enough money to get him known as a Mexican-American who grew up in the district and had his first job with a church ministry? Or do voters just stop when they hear his name and that his grandfather was a terrorist? Is that what happens in a conservative military district?\u201dMr. Campa-Najjar has, over the years, repeatedly distanced himself from his grandfather, whom he never met, and said he was prepared for Republicans to try to use the episode against him.\u201cIf Hunter has to go back three generations to attack me, that must mean I\u2019m a pretty clean candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cI can go back two days ago and tell you an indictment he had.\u201dThere is no process to remove Mr. Hunter from the ballot under the nonpartisan open primary system that California uses. Still, support for Mr. Trump remains strong in this district, and members of Congress under indictment have been known to win re-election.Even before the indictment, Mr. Campa-Najjar had raised more money than Mr. Hunter, bringing in nearly $1.1 million by the end of June, compared to $850,000 for Mr. Hunter.Michael Sugamele, 66, a conservative who supported Mr. Trump, said he did not trust the media and was withholding judgment on this indictment.\u201cHow can you have an opinion about it if you don\u2019t really know the circumstances?\u201d he said. \u201cPeople get charged in this country all the time who are innocent.\u201dErica Salinas, 28, a graduate student who is Latino, said she thought Mr. Hunter had neglected the district\u2019s sizable Latino community as he served in Congress, in contrast to Mr. Campa-Najjar.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about his politics, but he\u2019s been showing up to events, he has made his presence known,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Duncan? He\u2019s under indictment.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Ammar Campa-Najjar\u2019s age. He is 29, not 28.Adam Nagourney reported from San Diego.

{"Headline": "Costas Kondylis, Go-To Architect in a High-Rise Town, Dies at 78", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump Plaza. Trump Place. Trump Park Avenue. Trump World Tower. Trump International Hotel and Tower. They all have another name in common:Costas Kondylis.Mr. Kondylis was the architect of choice for Donald J. Trump and other developers of luxury apartment towers in New York for three decades. He died on Aug. 17 at his home in Manhattan at 78.The cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, his daughter Alexia Leuschen said.Mr. Kondylis (pronounced kon-DEE-lis) was a senior partner at Philip Birnbaum & Associates from 1979 to 1989, when he founded Costas Kondylis & Associates. That practice, renamed Costas Kondylis & Partners in 2001, dissolved in 2009.\u201cCostas was an incredible friend to our family and a remarkable architect,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump of the Trump Organization said in a joint statement on Thursday. \u201cHe leaves behind an amazing legacy.\u201dPresident Trump checked in with Mr. Kondylis throughout his illness, Ms. Leuschen said.As an architect, Mr. Kondylis did not so much have an aesthetic style as a business formula. He provided developers with efficient, marketable, dependable, comfortable buildings. The designs won few prizes or critical plaudits, but they also caused few headaches for those who financed and built them.Trump World Tower, completed in 2001, was a striking 861-foot-tall exception to his conservatism. Erupting from a block opposite the United Nations, it was a monolithic slab of bronze glass so dark that it almost appeared black from some angles at certain times of day.Mr. Kondylis was credited with persuading Mr. Trump not to clad the building in gold-tinted glass, though in his characteristically courtly way he demurred. \u201cWe discussed it together,\u201d he said.In retrospect, Trump World Tower can be seen as setting Manhattan on course to being a modern-day, stratospheric version of the medieval Italian city of San Gimignano, with a skyline pierced by a dozen or more towers for the rich and powerful, far out of proportion to anything around them.Well-heeled neighbors were infuriated by its size, and preservationists were dismayed that a new skyscraper visually overshadowed the United Nations Secretariat Building.\u201cThe tower\u2019s appeal is as much polemical as it is aesthetic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt punches through the morbid notion that the Midtown skyline should be forever dominated by two Art Deco skyscrapers, the Empire State and Chrysler buildings, as if these cherished icons couldn\u2019t stand the competition.\u201dMr. Muschamp contrasted Trump World Tower with the six \u201creactionary\u201d buildings Mr. Kondylis designed \u2014 three in association with Philip Johnson \u2014 at Trump Place, along the southern extension of Riverside Park in Manhattan.Mr. Kondylis also reshaped the skyline around West 42nd Street with the twin Silver Towers for Larry A. Silverstein. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do a residential building in New York, the most natural thing in the world is to pick up the phone and call Costas,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said in 2007.Costas, as everyone called him, earned a master\u2019s degree in architecture from the University of Geneva and, in 1969, a master\u2019s degree in urban design from Columbia University.Besides Ms. Leuschen, Mr. Kondylis is survived by another daughter, Katherine Cary Kondylis; four grandchildren; and two sisters, Mary Kalogreas and Penelope Kondylis. His marriage to Gretchen Barnes ended in divorce. His second marriage, to Lori Lotte Neuner, ended with her death in 1995.Architecture may have been Mr. Kondylis\u2019s great love, but it was not his first.\u201cHis best childhood memory was lying on the back ledge of the interior of the new Studebaker my grandfather had delivered to Bujumbura each year while they lived there, and looking up at the sky as his parents drove around,\u201d Ms. Leuschen said in an email. \u201cHis earliest wish was to be a car designer, but my grandmother directed him to architecture.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the given name of Mr. Kondylis\u2019s mother and the middle name of one of his daughters. His mother was Vassiliki Kondylis, not Vassilikis; his daughter is Katherine Cary Kondylis, not Kary.Advertisement"}

He won 52.6 percent of the vote in June, 22 percentage points ahead of his main challenger.At every venue, people press forward to greet him and to take photos with him. The scenes are carefully choreographed amid heavy security \u2014 snipers take up positions on the rooftops and a Black Hawk helicopter circles above \u2014 yet the people\u2019s enthusiasm is sincere.\u201cYou stand upright, do not bow your head, this nation is with you,\u201d the crowd chanted to him on Aug. 10 in the town of Guneysu, in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ancestral province, Rize, which hugs the Black Sea coast in northeastern Turkey. The province gave him his highest vote in the election, a resounding 82 percent.That day, the lira fell 13 percent against the dollar to a record low, and it continued to drop on Monday before rebounding. The currency has lost almost 40 percent of its value since mid-February, driving prices sharply higher in Turkey.But Mr. Erdogan promised that the country would pull through.\u201cWe have worked hard, and we are working hard,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhere were we 16 years ago, and now where are we? We will be better.\u201dMr. Erdogan has for years struck a chord with the working-class, conservative base of Turkish society, talking to its members in their own vernacular and addressing people simply and affectionately, as if they were family. His supporters often say they like him because he is one of them, a poor boy made good.He stirs them with historical and religious references, offering to restore Turkey to the glory of the Ottoman Empire. He frames the economic crisis as \u201cthem\u201d against \u201cus,\u201d a national struggle comparable to Turkey\u2019s war of independence against Western colonialist powers a century ago.\u201cThey didn\u2019t leave a thing undone to make our country kneel down,\u201d he said, harking back to the Allied occupation of parts of the Ottoman Empire, in a speech the same day in Bayburt, another northeastern town. \u201cThey demolished the enormous Ottoman sycamore with thousands of types of traps, tricks and alliances.\u201d\u201cThe sapling of the Republic that our nation gave life to with enormous sacrifices now again is on the way to becoming a sycamore,\u201d he added. \u201cThey tried to paralyze our democracy with coups, memorandums.\u201dHe praised Bayburt, \u201can ancient city with its plain, castle, river and mountains, and most importantly with its people with iron ankles but hearts soft as cotton,\u201d who knew the importance of independence because the city \u201cduring the Ottoman period tasted both captivity and freedom.\u201dA few days later, he told members of his Justice and Development Party that the West could not stomach Turkey\u2019s progress under his rule.\u201cThere is an obvious economic attack against Turkey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep our political stance firm since this economic attack is not related to our real economic state; there are other intentions behind it.\u201d\u201cWe have made a big leap in the economy with 3.5 percent growth in the last 16 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is understandable that some people are uncomfortable with this.\u201dThe West also could not bear the enduring popularity of his Islamist government, he said: \u201cThe biggest change we brought was to reconcile the relationship between the state and the people. They are having a hard time digesting that our country has more strength than the distance we covered in the economy.\u201dMr. Erdogan was badly shaken by an attempted coup against him in 2016, and has become bitterly resentful of the United States for not showing him greater support at the time, said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations.His supporters came out in droves and faced down tanks in the streets on the night of the coup attempt, but 250 people were killed in the clashes, including Mr. Erdogan\u2019s campaign manager, one of his closest friends.Mr. Erdogan has accused the United States-based cleric Fethullah Gulen of being behind the failed coup \u2014 which Mr. Gulen denies \u2014 and clings to the suspicion that the American government was seeking to remove him from power.\u201cThe Turkish establishment \u2014 and certainly Erdogan \u2014 still suspect the U.S. had a role in it,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said. \u201cThere are people in the West, and also in D.C., who wouldn\u2019t have minded if the coup had succeeded.\u201dMr. Erdogan used the failed coup as an opportunity to move against his political opponents, imprisoning more than 100,000 people, and to turn the country against Gulenists, the West and the United States in particular.In a similar manner, he has used the recent United States sanctions, and in particular President Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks about Turkey on Twitter, to whip up nationalist sentiment. Mr. Trump imposed the sanctions for Turkey\u2019s refusal to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was jailed and accused of terrorism in the wake of the coup attempt. On Friday, Mr. Brunson, who is under house arrest, lost the latest in a series of appeals for his release.Even Turkey\u2019s main opposition parties signed a joint statement to condemn Washington\u2019s sanctions rather than criticize Mr. Erdogan.\u201cAs we didn\u2019t surrender to the coup makers, and stood against the tanks with our bare hands, we will not surrender to the economic hit men,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cWe will struggle with all we have.\u201dMr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters show no sign of wavering, and in his weekend visit to the northeast, he thanked them warmly and appealed for their help in propping up the lira.\u201cCome on, and exchange your dollars, euros and gold, if it exists under your pillows, for local currency, and let\u2019s give the best answer to them as a nation,\u201d he urged. \u201cAre you in?\u201dAs members of the crowd chanted back, \u201cWe are in!\u201d he commended them.\u201cThis togetherness,\u201d he said, \u201cthat will be the best answer to the West.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Take advantage of that protection.So how much do you make?It\u2019s a loaded, deeply personal and often uncomfortable question. Along with our weight and age, our salary is a number to which we\u2019ve assigned almost incomparable value.And, when we\u2019re asked, what many of us really hear is this: What\u2019s your worth as a person?She added: \u201cSalary is so close to our identity. It\u2019s the core part of all of this.\u201d\u201cSo policies that discourage or prohibit employees from discussing these are problematic not just because of the National Labor Relations Act\u2019s clear prohibition,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also because they can make it difficult for employees in the private sector to learn that there are unlawful disparities.\u201dOpen discussion of salaries among peers and co-workers, experts said, is a powerful tool to fight pay inequity. Not only does it serve both selfish and altruistic means \u2014 it simultaneously puts you and your co-workers in a better position during salary negotiations \u2014 but pay transparency can even protect companies by \u201cminimizing the risk of disparate treatment claims and increasing job satisfaction for workers,\u201d Ms. Cornell said.Still, prohibiting or discouraging workers from openly discussing salaries, whether codified or implicitly built into a company\u2019s culture, is somewhat commonplace in workplaces.\u201cIt\u2019s been the law of the land for many years that employers can\u2019t have policies or practices or discipline employees for discussing wages,\u201d Ms. Cornell said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t been a common practice.\u201d \u201cI got a call on my work phone to come to the board room,\u201d Elizabeth said. Her manager was there \u2014 \u201cit was very dramatic, with the lights off\u201d \u2014 and she told Elizabeth she wasn\u2019t allowed to share her salary, and she was creating a \u201cbad environment,\u201d Elizabeth said.Knowing that she was legally in the right, Elizabeth brushed off the encounter, and 10 minutes later her manager rushed over to apologize.\u201cShe had gotten reprimanded herself from our H.R. department,\u201d Elizabeth said. Still, that experience was a major factor in Elizabeth\u2019s decision to leave the company a few months later.Even the savviest among us can get caught up in the pressures of salary secrecy.\u201cThat is not a good thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can lead to low morale, and there was no objective justification about the disparity in pay.\u201dAfter a few months on the job, my friend whispered that she\u2019d received a small raise. Armed with this knowledge, I politely made the case for my own, without mentioning anything but my work ethic and commitment. My boss relented, but reprimanded me in the process.\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like my employees talking about money,\u201d she said. You don\u2019t have to read too hard between the lines to grasp the real meaning: Employers can get away with paying workers less when those workers don\u2019t talk about money.In just the past few years, cultural norms and legislation have begun to unravel some of the forces that discourage open salary discussion, sometimes even tilting pay negotiations in favor of employees.After interviewing for jobs at competing marketing agencies last year, he realized he was being paid below the market rate for someone at his experience level. He told co-workers his discovery, and he said many of them were in the same situation.\u201cEventually rumors started flying about: \u2018Hey, this person said this to leadership; this person is also complaining about it,\u2019\u201d he said.After initially responding with halfhearted gestures and speeches about workplace culture, Evan said, leadership at the agency eventually succumbed to the pressure and gave every employee a raise.\u201cPeople got what they wanted,\u201d he said.Jill Duffy, a writer, said for years she has been open about sharing her salaries, and that she has been able to use that knowledge to \u201cnegotiate raises because of the information I got.\"\u201cI went in feeling confident about my worth and my value and what the company could afford to pay me,\u201d she said.Having these conversations is much easier said than done, but there are ways to gain confidence in discussing your salary.Most important, Ms. McGurran said, is to be open and genuine, framing these conversations as beneficial for everyone involved. She suggests starting with people who are more senior than you, \u201cmaybe someone who has helped bring you on, or a previous manager, or someone who you really trust and wants to see you succeed.\u201d This can give you a bigger-picture view of your company\u2019s salaries.From there, try to approach peers, co-workers or fellow alumni in off-campus, laid-back settings, all while keeping the focus on the salary and not the person.Ms. Duffy, the writer, agreed that a win-win approach is the best way to get salaries out in the open.\u201cWhen you come at it from that clear sense of, \u2018I\u2019m doing this for both of our benefit, I\u2019m not doing this to shame you,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cpeople are generally more willing to share.\u201dMs. Duffy added, \u201cIt\u2019s important to know your own worth.\u201dIllustration by Benedikt RugarAdvertisement"}

Many of the organizers of a white supremacist rally last year in Charlottesville, Va., for instance, used Hatreon to raise money for the event.Mr. Wilson dismisses the idea that publishing gun blueprints is threatening or illegal.\u201cThe argument that I\u2019m making,\u201d he said, \u201calthough not always very well, is that what I\u2019m doing is actually a pretty mainline American idea.\u201dAsked about his political views, Mr. Wilson said he has voted only once in his life: for then-Representative Ron Paul in a state race in 2008.Born in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Wilson and his family moved to Cabot, Ark., when he was in the first grade. At Cabot High School, Mr. Wilson was elected student body president. He attended the University of Central Arkansas, where he majored in English, and studied abroad in China for a semester. After graduating in 2010, he went to law school at the University of Texas.In his second year there, Mr. Wilson began tinkering with a 3-D printer to design a functional gun. By 2013, he had created his company, Defense Distributed, and published online the blueprints for a gun that were downloaded more than 100,000 times. Dropping out of law school to pursue his new idea full-time, Mr. Wilson received a letter from the State Department in May 2013 ordering him to pull his files from the internet, citing arms export laws.While Mr. Wilson, 30, has described himself as a techno-libertarian, free-speech provocateur and online heretic, his critics have said he is a media hound and a peddler of \u201copen-source terrorism.\u201dCalled \u201cghost guns\u201d because they lack serial numbers and are made almost entirely of plastic, Mr. Wilson\u2019s blueprints would allow for the mass production of untraceable firearms that could be made at home, gun control advocates have warned, including by convicted felons, terrorists or other people currently prohibited from buying them.\u201cThe people who make them will be state actors or well-financed criminal cartels who have the ability to execute well-organized criminal attacks in the United States and elsewhere,\u201d said Avery Gardiner, the co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.Since starting his company, Mr. Wilson has faced pushback from all sides. YouTube has repeatedly pulled his promotional videos. Once it learned of his plans, Stratasys, the company from which he leased a 3-D printer, forced him to return it. Indiegogo canceled his crowdfunding campaign, forcing him to set up a Bitcoin account to receive donations. A company called Thingiverse, which publishes user-created design files, removed all of his designs.On Monday, attorneys general in eight states filed a joint federal lawsuit in Seattle to block Defense Distributed from publishing the files online.But Tuesday morning, things were looking up. With practiced calm, Mr. Wilson answered questions from reporters while also taking calls from his lawyers and monitoring judicial hearing updates.To him, Mr. Wilson explained, the fight over the publishing of his blueprints was less about guns than it was about renegotiating the relationship between citizens and the state.\u201cI think the state should be as weak as possible relative to the individual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe proper posture of the state is one that at least is in fear of its citizen, not one that lords over it.\u201dWhen asked about the potentially dire consequences of his 3-D printed weapons, Mr. Wilson often responds with a philosophical view. \u201cUnderstanding that rights and civil liberties are something that we protect is also understanding that they have consequences that are also protected, or tolerated,\u201d he said to Popular Science in 2012, shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting.Mr. Wilson\u2019s Twitter handle is @Radomysisky, named after the Russian revolutionary and leader of the Communist International who was executed for trying to kill Stalin. Among his heroes, Mr. Wilson cites Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a Frenchman considered by many to be the \u201cfather of anarchism.\u201dMr. Wilson is also a fan of Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal who is a staunch libertarian and funder of causes such as paying young people not to go to college. Mr. Thiel invited Mr. Wilson to a private Wyoming retreat, where the two men discussed the future of Bitcoin. Mr. Wilson was inspired by the potential of Bitcoin, an encrypted, digital currency that forgoes more traditional routes and works person to person online.The cryptocurrency\u2019s potential, he said, is to disrupt the ability of governments to raise taxes. This was partly his motivation for starting Dark Wallet in 2014, a secure online means of storing currency. With Dark Wallet, Mr. Wilson hopes to simplify Bitcoin, which can be tech-intensive and difficult to use.Mr. Wilson has said that the goal of Defense Distributed is to promote decentralized solutions in an ever-centralizing world. In recent media appearances, he said that companies like Google, Facebook and YouTube have tried to exert more control over public discourse, particularly after racial unrest last summer in Charlottesville.\u201cThey can decide at will who isn\u2019t able to participate,\u201d he told Reason magazine in April, adding that he hates Silicon Valley almost as much as he hates Washington, D.C. In the push to democratize information, Mr. Wilson has said, 3-D printers will only become revolutionary tools when they are used not for useless things like trinkets or lawn gnomes, but medical devices, drugs or guns.Mr. Wilson said that the Allies\u2019 efforts to liberate Europe in World War II partly inspired the development of the 3-D printed firearm. Before the invasion, he said, they contemplated dropping guns behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory.\u201cInstead of dropping the gun on Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cwe dropped it on the internet.\u201dSusan C.

{"Headline": "Congress Pays Tribute to John McCain", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Elected officials and the cabinet had a chance to pay their respects in a ceremony at 11 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence spoke on behalf of the Trump administration at a Capitol ceremony honoring Mr. McCain, who did not want President Trump to attend his funeral remembrances.\u2022 The Rotunda is now open for public viewing: A line snaking three rows of barricades stretched down the street by noon, as hundreds waited to pay their respects to the senator. Groups of sailors, wearing their dress whites, dotted the crowds and many held umbrellas aloft to shield themselves from the sun.Vice President Pence opened his speech by crediting the president who was excluded from the proceedings with his presence: \u201cThe president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation, to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served his country throughout his life.\u201dMr. Pence and Senator McCain joined together in the past to fight earmarks and on other fiscal issues while Mr. Pence was a conservative leader \u2014 and a bit of a maverick himself \u2014 in the House.The vice president, who almost always begins his remarks bringing greetings from Mr. Trump, was in the awkward position of having to eulogize a man whom the president has studiously avoided praising in the days since his death.With Mr. McCain\u2019s grief-stricken daughter Meghan McCain looking on with an icy gaze, Mr. Pence mustered one positive comment, referencing a remark from Mr. Trump during an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday: \u201cAs President Trump said yesterday,\u201d he offered, \u201cwe respect his service to the country.\u201dFor his own part, Mr. Pence praised Mr. McCain for his \u201ciron will,\u201d and called him a \u201cpatriot,\u201d while alluding to the fact that they had many differences.\u201cIn my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn\u2019t always agree either, and he almost always noticed,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cBut his support for limited government, for tax reform, and support for our armed forces surely made our nation more prosperous and more secure, and he will be missed.\u201dDuring a week when former colleagues and aides have spoken admiringly of Mr. McCain\u2019s stamina, Mr. Pence also recalled traveling with the senator \u2014 more than 20 years his senior \u2014 in Iraq and falling asleep in the middle of a dinner with Iraqi officials.Mr. McCain, the vice president said, walked up to him and suggested that he skip the rest of the scheduled meetings that night and go to bed, saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn in? You look like you could use some rest.\u201d\u201cI never traveled with a colleague who was better to our enlisted, or harder on our generals,\u201d Mr. Pence said.Among the attendees at Friday\u2019s ceremony at the Rotunda was Roberta McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s 106-year-old mother, who sat stoically gazing at the flag-draped coffin bearing the remains of the son she knew as \u201cJohnny.\u201dMs. McCain, dressed in black pants and a sheer white blouse that matched the snow-white of her perfectly coifed hair, appeared poised and serene during the service. At one point she reached out to grasp the hand of her granddaughter Meghan McCain who sat weeping beside her.Using a wheelchair to make her way to the center of the Rotunda, Ms. McCain crossed herself silently at the senator\u2019s coffin.Mr. McCain wrote in his 2005 book \u201cCharacter is Destiny\u201d that his mother and her identical twin sister, Rowena \u2014 now deceased \u2014 \u201cwere renowned for their beauty, which has hardly faded over the years that have passed since heads first turned in their direction. But their personalities have always been their most attractive feature.\u201dHe wrote that Ms. McCain had been \u201craised to be a strong, determined woman who thoroughly enjoyed life, and always tried to make the most of her opportunities.\u201dAt the White House, President Trump remained eerily quiet during the morning, and throughout the Capitol service for Mr. McCain. He did not tweet.The special split-screen televisions in the press areas of the West Wing showed the same thing on each of the four news networks: live coverage of the service. But White House officials said they did not know whether Mr. Trump was watching.The president was scheduled to leave the White House just before 1 p.m. for a trip to North Carolina before returning to Washington for what is expected to be a soggy weekend. A spokeswoman said the president has no public events on the schedule for the long, holiday weekend.\u2014 Michael D. ShearTai Bui, 79, of Maryland, had a very simple answer for why he was willing to wait in a long, hot line to see Mr. McCain: without the senator, he would not have been able to immigrate to the United States.Mr. Bui, born in Vietnam, aided American troops in their fight against the communists during the same war Mr. McCain fought in. His role in the war gave him a feeling of kinship with Mr. McCain: he too was imprisoned as punishment.\u201cI was put in a concentration camp for five years,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. McCain, too.\u201dTwenty years ago, he was able to come to the United States with his wife, thanks to the Arizona senator\u2019s efforts to help Vietnamese refugees relocate and reunite with their families.When asked about the complex relationship Mr. McCain had with his country, Mr. Bui shook his head and answered emphatically: \u201cHe\u2019s a hero. No question about it.\u201d\u2014 Catie EdmondsonAfter arriving in Washington earlier this week for a semester of classes and internships, a group of students from Marquette University agreed to upend their planned schedule and attend the memorial in the Rotunda.\u201cWe thought we\u2019d come live history,\u201d said Sean Jettner, a 20-year-old criminology and political science major.\u201cJust because he lived in a different time,\u201d he added. \u201cWhatever he proposes lives on.\u201dStanding in a clump in the sweltering Washington heat, six of the 16 students standing the line agreed that Mr. McCain\u2019s legacy carried a different meaning for them than their parents, who passed along prayer requests for a politician they had followed for decades.Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign for president was the first campaign the students all remembered \u2014 and his respect for opinions different from his own, they said, was something they were not accustomed to in Washington.\u201cHe muddied the lines of the political parties,\u201d said Alec Bodendorfer, 21, a political science and economics senior. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the coolest thing about him.\u201dThe diversity of the line in age and background was a relief, they said, and an example of the political legacy they hoped to see more of in the future.\u201cThey\u2019re able to set aside their differences and remember,\u201d said Matt Rabinovitch, 21. \u201cThis is America.\u201d\u201cWe can still come together on one thing,\u201d Mr. Jettner added.Mr. Pence was not the only person representing the Trump administration in the Rotunda on Friday. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, stood stony-faced at the ceremony. Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, was nearby, at one point chatting amiably with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, which Mr. Trump routinely decries as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dJeff Sessions, the attorney general whom Mr. Trump has berated publicly and privately for recusing himself from that probe \u2014 but praised during an interview on Thursday \u2014 was also present to honor a senator with whom he served. So was Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence whose conclusions Mr. Trump has publicly questioned, and who is also a former senator from Indiana.National security leaders who dealt extensively with Mr. McCain during his many on the Armed Services Committee also came to see him lying in state, including Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense; John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser; and Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force and a former House representative from New Mexico.Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, and Mr. McCain had a tempestuous relationship over their careers, fighting about campaign finance laws all the way to the Supreme Court. Mr. McCain was not easily led and Mr. McConnell\u2019s job was to lead.But they repaired any lingering damage in recent years and settled into a comfortable camaraderie that was upended a bit by Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to oppose Mr. McConnell\u2019s drive to repeal the new health care law. Still, there was a strong mutual respect for the abilities of one another.Mr. McConnell proudly took note of the occasional difficulties of dealing with John McCain.\u201cHe treated every issue with the intensity the people\u2019s business deserves,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe would fight tooth and nail for his vision of the common good. Depending on the issue, you knew John would either be your staunchest ally or your most stubborn opponent.\u201dSpeaker Paul D. Ryan was among those remembering Mr. McCain\u2019s fighting streak with fondness.\u201cI myself, from time to time, found myself on the receiving end of John\u2019s distinct brand of candor \u2014 happily so,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI remember thinking more than once, \u2018Yeah, he really does talk like a sailor.\u2019 \u201d\u201cWith John, it was never feigned disagreement,\u201d he added. \u201cThe man didn\u2019t feign anything \u2014 he just relished the fight.\u201dMr. Ryan quoted a passage from one of Mr. McCain\u2019s favorite authors, Ernest Hemingway, who wrote in \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d about how people grow \u201cstrong at the broken places,\u201d a trait he said the senator embodied.\u201cThough the highest office eluded him,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201che attained what is far more enduring: the abiding affection of his fellow citizens and an example for future generations.\u201dAnna Marie Farone had never followed Senator McCain\u2019s political or professional career before 2017. She knew he ran against President Barack Obama, but did not cast a vote.But Ms. Farone, 33, who suffers from a degenerative spine condition, avidly watched the debate over the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and celebrated when Mr. McCain made his dramatic thumbs-down vote on the Senate floor last summer, preserving the health care law.It was that vote that led her to travel to Washington for the first time since the Clinton administration \u2014 a 19-hour trip from Indianapolis that included a missed Greyhound connection and a last-minute flight out of Pittsburgh \u2014 and be the first in line outside the Capitol to make it into the Rotunda to pay her respects.\u201cIt was that one ACA vote,\u201d said the freelancer and urban farmer, who arrived outside the Capitol Visitor Center Friday just six hours after reaching Washington. \u201cHe did side with the humans when it mattered.\u201dAnd while Ms. Farone disagreed with some of his other votes, including his support for last year\u2019s Republican tax overhaul, she said she wanted to celebrate his willingness to work for bipartisan measures.\u201cHe may not have always done it right, but he did it well\u201d she said. \u201cHe was human.\u201dBehind her, dozens of people had started to gather in line to wait to pay their respects later this afternoon \u2014 sprawled out on beach towels and huddled under umbrellas that protected them from first the sweltering early morning heat and then scattered rain.\u201cLook at how willing everyone is to uplift him,\u201d Ms. Farone said. \u201cHe\u2019s not deceased as so much converted into a legend. A person of the ages.\u201dCarmine Garritano, 71, was one of several veterans who gathered outside, wearing symbols of the armed service they shared with Mr. McCain: hats from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, uniform hats and vests studded with badges and buttons reflective of their service.Mr. Garritano, a retired Army specialist, had served in Vietnam, but his time in the country overlapped with only a fraction of Mr. McCain\u2019s time as a prisoner of war. He had tried for years to find an opportunity to meet Mr. McCain in Washington. Instead, he drove down from New York with his daughter to pay his respects in the Capitol Rotunda.\u201cI wanted to come down and shake his hand, and say thank you,\u201d Mr. Garritano said, his voice shaking with emotion.\u201cThis is the least I could do,\u201d he concluded.As he wiped away a tear, another veteran, in a dress shirt and an American Legion hat, silently embraced him in the line.David Alvarez, 72, was 18 when he began his first tour with the Marine Corps in Vietnam. That experience, coupled with years spent outside the Senate doors as a Capitol Police officer gave him a kinship, he said, with Mr. McCain.\u201cI feel honored to be here,\u201d he said.Though there were at least a hundred people standing between him and the doors to the Capitol, he already grew emotional at the thought of what he would say before Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin.\u201cThank you for your service,\u201d he said, clapping his Vietnam Veterans cap to his chest. \u201cThen, slow salute,\u201d he added.Kyle Moses, an Army major stationed at Fort Meade, brought his young son Sam along to pay their respects to the senator he believed \u201cwas always looking out for the military.\u201d\u201cIt does make me think, \u2018Is this the end of an era?\u2019\u201d he said, looking down at his son, who was clutching a stuffed animal. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a good inflection point and not a bad one. I hope we swing back to the way that the senator conducted himself.\u201dSeveral of the people who gathered hours before the doors were opened to the public identified themselves as proud Democrats, who had never voted for Mr. McCain or frequently disagreed with his policies. With sharp criticism of the current administration and the polarization in Congress, they agreed that he was the last one of the last politicians willing to take bipartisan steps.\u201cWe lost a good one in John,\u201d said Kitt Rodkey, 64, who took a personal day from work to pay his respects to Mr. McCain. \u201cNo one is perfect, but he came pretty close.\u201dStanding next to him, Cooper Brockington, a therapist from Reston, Va., nodded emphatically as she fanned herself in the humidity.\u201cWe are all family,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in paying my respect to our great servants.\u201dShe had been to the Capitol for both Rosa Parks and Billy Graham\u2019s ceremonies in the Capitol, and saw this as another opportunity to recognize Mr. McCain\u2019s service in government and in war.\u201cWe\u2019re all saddened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re all inspired, to do more and be more.\u201dMourners from across the country and across the political spectrum gathered in the Rotunda to remember Mr. McCain. The actor Warren Beatty, whom Mr. McCain chose as a pallbearer, and his wife, the actor Annette Benning, made their way through the basement of the Capitol Wednesday morning on their way to the ceremony.Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and national security adviser, said the ceremony for a man he considered a friend for 50 years was moving. \u201cIt was a great honor,\u201d Mr. Kissinger, who is 95, said as he left the Capitol, \u201cto be able to say goodbye.\u201dSenator Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, caught up with Chuck Robb, a former Democratic senator from Virginia, outside the Old Senate Chamber. A few steps away, Mr. McConnell, who will deliver remarks at the service, got a rundown of the choreography of the day from an aide.Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee and current candidate for Senate, was spotted downstairs as was Governor Rick Scott of Florida, who is running to join the Senate.Military commanders and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as members of the House and Senate, began taking their places in the Rotunda, its doorways draped in black crepe, as Mr. Pence\u2019s motorcade made its way to the Capitol.The Lincoln Catafalque sat directly under the Capitol dome awaiting the arrival of Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin. High above it, a camera had been fitted to capture an aerial shot of a historic day.As if on cue, a steady rain began to fall as military pallbearers removed the coffin bearing Mr. McCain\u2019s body from the hearse and began to carry it up the steps to the Capitol, with his family looking on.Among those spotted standing in a cluster awaiting the arrival of the coffin in the Rotunda: John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.Mr. Pence is a logical choice to speak at the Capitol ceremony for Mr. McCain given the president\u2019s absence. As vice president, Mr. Pence also serves as president of the Senate.Mr. Pence was then the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservatives in the House that routinely railed against excessive spending. Mr. McCain was a seasoned senator who had made a trademark of his opposition to spending earmarks and what he called \u201cpork\u201d \u2014 line items lawmakers would insert in spending bills to fund strictly parochial projects.Their styles could not have been more different. Mr. Pence was a fresh-faced religious conservative with the earnest delivery of a radio host, Mr. McCain the sometimes irascible and profane maverick who liked to forge bipartisan alliances. But their shared passion for fiscal restraint threw them together in a fight that cleaved their party.The two would clash on other issues, most notably Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. McCain opposed despite a personal appeal from Mr. Pence on the Senate floor. But the vice president has praised Mr. McCain effusively since his death, something Mr. Trump has refused to do.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "All the President\u2019s Crooks", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of them, Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyer, has now implicated him in a crime. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.From the start of the Russia investigation, President Trump has been working to discredit the work and the integrity of the special counsel, Robert Mueller; praising men who are blatant grifters, cons and crooks; insisting that he\u2019s personally done nothing wrong; and reminding us that he hires only the best people. Let that sink in: Mr. Trump\u2019s own lawyer has now accused him, under oath, of committing a felony.The conviction of Paul Manafort, who ran the Trump campaign for three months in 2016, was a win for prosecutors even though jurors were unable to reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts against him. On the other eight, which included bank fraud, tax fraud and a failure to report a foreign bank account, the jury agreed unanimously that Mr. Manafort was guilty. He is scheduled to go on trial in a separate case next month in Washington, D.C., on charges including money laundering, witness tampering, lying to authorities and failing to register as a foreign agent. Mr. Manafort faces many decades behind bars, although he will probably serve less than that under federal sentencing guidelines. But back to Tuesday\u2019s news. Mr. Manafort was not an original target of the inquiry by Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May of last year to look into possible ties between the Trump campaign and efforts by Russian government officials to interfere in the election. But Mr. Mueller\u2019s mandate authorized him to investigate any other crimes that arose in the course of his work. It didn\u2019t take long. As soon as he and his lawyers started sniffing around, the stench of Mr. Manafort\u2019s illegality was overpowering.He also enriched himself by working for some of the world\u2019s most notorious thugs and autocrats, including Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (now called the Democratic Republic of Congo). He helped elect the pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych as president of Ukraine, a job that earned him millions until Mr. Yanukovych was ousted from power in 2014. Despite this mercenary history \u2014 or perhaps, more disturbingly, because of it \u2014 Donald Trump, while running on promises to clean up Washington, hired Mr. Manafort to run his presidential campaign, a job he may well have kept but for news reports that he was receiving and hiding millions of dollars from his work on behalf of Mr. Yanukovych.What does it tell you about Mr. Trump that he would choose to lead his campaign someone like Mr. Manafort, whom even on Tuesday he called a \u201cgood man\u201d? It tells you that Mr. Trump is consistent, and consistently contemptuous of honesty and ethics, because he has surrounded himself with people of weak, if not criminal, character throughout his career. Also remember we still don\u2019t know anything about the ultimate fate of several other Trump associates who have been under Mr. Mueller\u2019s microscope, including Roger Stone, Carter Page and Donald Trump Jr. (\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer\u201d). For a witch hunt, Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has already bagged a remarkable number of witches. Only the best witches, you might say. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andie MacDowell, Still Worth It", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "at home with \u2026One of the original 1980s model-actresses on her very modern maturity.Supported byThis early examination of digitally mediated relationships is worth a revisit: The success with which the protagonist\u2019s camera unzipped his subjects makes the Kardashians seem like pikers.The sex in that film was suggested. But in \u201cLove After Love,\u201d which entranced reviewers during an earlier theatrical release, Ms. MacDowell has the first nude scene of her long career.Hearty chuckle. With projects including playing a madcap American in the fifth season of \u201cCuckoo,\u201d a British farce, out later this year, and a bohemian hippie sidekick to Richard Dreyfuss and Chevy Chase in \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d for early 2019 (both on Netflix), Ms. MacDowell can afford to relax this summer. If only she could.It was teatime late last month, and Ms. MacDowell was sitting on a well-worn sofa upholstered in a faded cabbage rose print in the living room of her modest ranch house, mildly exasperated by her inability to recall the names of two current movie stars. A wheezy, nervous, rescued Chihuahua-Boston terrier mix named Ava Gardner clung to her lap as the actress, whose beauty still startles, explained how a 2016 film, \u201cCertain Women,\u201d was an exemplar of the kind of work she\u2019d like to be doing. Though she couldn\u2019t actually remember the title.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrific movie,\u201d she said, \u201cLaura Dern is in it and that girl from the vampire movies, what\u2019s her name? And that actress from Montana. Names! What the hell is that all about?\u201d(Why not Google? Because at a certain age, there is honor in eschewing that mnemonic short cut.)\u201cMichelle Williams!\u201d she said triumphantly, referring to a star of \u201cCertain Women.\u201dMs. MacDowell herself has passed in and out of stardom, as a model turned actress who never quite got her due, especially for her calm comic presence (she was marvelous in \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d). Often she was cast as a somewhat elusive, well-scrubbed ideal (as in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d in which she somehow made a fisherman\u2019s sweater seem sexier than a bikini). As has been the case for many beautiful women, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s extraordinary face has sometimes confused those seeking to employ her as an actress. Born in Gaffney, S.C., she came up as a model in the late 1970s, her rosy cheeks and untamed hair a welcome alternative to the sleek blondes \u2014 Cybill, Christie and Cheryl \u2014 who had dominated that decade. Since 1985, she has been under contract to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, that company\u2019s longest reigning spokesperson. In ads for Calvin Klein jeans, Ms. MacDowell improvised a naughtier sort of down-home girl. She is proud that Ram Dass is one of her over 45,000 followers and amused that Deepak Chopra followed her for one day. (He wanted to invite her to an event by direct message, she said. \u201cThen he unfollowed me. Whatever. I don\u2019t care. I have Ram Dass!\u201d)Yet in 2016, she was slammed as an elitist when she posted a selfie from an American Airlines flight that carried this caption: \u201cHELP, I paid for first-class and they put me in tourist because of my dog that I pre-booked and paid for.\u201d She was carrying Ava Gardner, whom she had just rescued, from Los Angeles to Charleston, S.C., and a steward bumped her to coach, saying there wasn\u2019t enough room in first class. Twitterers didn\u2019t like the word \u201ctourist,\u201d nor did they like a complainer, they complained.Ms. MacDowell\u2019s gracious response, offering to donate her refund to charity and noting how she\u2019d let the flight attendant\u2019s rudeness rub off on her, may serve as primer for more impulsive celebrities. She is lately more sanguine about the trolls, she said. \u201cPeople tell me I\u2019m not relevant anymore, blah, blah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut who wants to be relevant? It\u2019s a lot of work, to stay in that place forever. I\u2019ve never wanted to sell myself. All I ever wanted was for someone to take me seriously.\u201d\u201cShe was of the stature and the sort of person I wanted to impress,\u201d Ms. MacDowell said. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want to sell myself now, either. I\u2019m 60, for godsakes! There\u2019s this artist I saw at the Tate, a video artist, and she was so like me. She\u2019d set up her camera and come down in the morning and lean in like this,\u201d \u2014 Ms. MacDowell leaned forth, solemnly, and dropped her voice an octave \u2014 \u201cand say, \u2018Good morning.\u2019 And then in the evening she\u2019d come back and say, \u2018Good night\u2019. If I knew how to do my Instagram, I\u2019d be just like her. And if I could remember her name and meet her, I think she would like me and we\u2019d be friends.\u201dMs. MacDowell has quietly been part of this flowering.The experiences of her character in \u201cLove After Love\u201d \u2014 her sexual explorations, her sometimes hapless dating encounters and adult sons \u2014 dovetail somewhat with her own. Her son, Justin Qualley, who works in real estate in Montana, is 31; her daughters Rainey Qualley, a pop singer, and Margaret Qualley, an actress, are 28 and 23. Their father is Paul Qualley, a former model and contractor from whom Ms. MacDowell has been divorced for nearly two decades. She was married briefly to Rhett Hartzog, a businessman, whom she divorced in 2004. Having raised her children first here in Montana, and then in Asheville, N.C., where she was known as Rose Qualley, she is newly an empty nester and experimenting with life in Los Angeles, her first true immersion in that company town.\u201cYou know what\u2019s great?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a nobody there. Nobody cares that I\u2019m a movie star, whatever that is. Because everyone else is, too.\u201d Regarding solitude, she said, \u201cI do know from experience what\u2019s it like to be alone, but I am good at it. And I do know sadness. You can\u2019t get to my age without having felt some kind of intense pain.\u201dAt 23, Ms. MacDowell was working as a model in Paris when her mother died of heart failure. She was 53, and had been a severe alcoholic. Ms. MacDowell, the youngest of four daughters, had been her mother\u2019s caretaker: plucking the smoldering cigarettes from her fingers when she passed out on the floor and covering her with a blanket. When Ms. MacDowell was 16, she staged an intervention, which failed, and when her mother was fired from her job at the McDonald\u2019s where they both worked, it was Ms. MacDowell who drove her to work on that last day because her mother had lost her driver\u2019s license. \u201cInterestingly enough,\u201d she went on, \u201cwe had a good relationship. I had a lot of empathy for her. I was the last one home, and I didn\u2019t want to leave her like that.\u201dA few months before she died, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s mother wrote her a letter. \u201cShe told me she quit drinking,\u201d she said, \u201cand that she was very proud of me and that I deserved to have a mother who was sober. I was supposed to go home for Thanksgiving, but I did not. I really regret that. I\u2019m always trying to grab ahold of my children and spend time with them. I have to remember it\u2019s natural at that age to want to experience the world on your own.\u201dA few years ago, Ms. MacDowell was on another flight and began talking with her seat mate. \u201cWe had a nice chat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end she told me, \u2018I\u2019m a mindfulness therapist and I just wanted to tell you that you have a lot of anxiety.\u2019 Yeah, no kidding!\u201d Indeed, she said, being anxious is her legacy and that she\u2019s been amusing herself by trying to break down her tics (the constant motion of her hands, for example), so she can use them in her work. Russ Harbaugh, the 34-year-old director of \u201cLove After Love,\u201d said his first choice for the role was a more conventional bet, an older actress with three Oscar nominations who left before he was able to secure financing. There was some pressure to cast a surer box office wager, but all along Mr. Harbaugh felt that Ms. MacDowell would be, as he put it, transformative. On the night before filming was to begin, she called him into her hotel room. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d he recalled Ms. MacDowell saying.\u201cI think she was honestly feeling not good enough,\u201d Mr. Harbaugh said. \u201cSo I told her the story of how she was cast. In this business, you don\u2019t want people to feel like they\u2019re not your first choice but she didn\u2019t need me to lie to her. I wanted her to know that I sought her out.\u201dMs. MacDowell remembers the exchange differently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I could do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that the relationship between Russ and Chris\u201d \u2014 O\u2019Dowd, who plays one of her sons \u2014 \u201cwas so strong, I felt left out. There didn\u2019t seem to be any room for me. I didn\u2019t have any reservations about the role. I needed to know that he wanted me. I wanted to know that I was supposed to be there. I felt like the seventh child in a family that nobody notices. I guess I wanted to know that he loved me, and once I had that, I felt safe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wanted: \u2018Sheriff of Wall Street.\u2019 Letitia James Says No Thanks, and Her Rivals Pounce.", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe remark was music to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s ears.Dan Donovan, who was running for New York attorney general in 2010, said that he did not plan to be known as the \u201cSheriff of Wall Street,\u201d a sobriquet that Eliot Spitzer earned when he occupied the office.That sentiment could come back to haunt Mr. Cuomo\u2019s preferred candidate for the Democratic nomination for attorney general, Letitia James.Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham Law professor, said on Twitter that she \u201ccan\u2019t wait to be known as the Sheriff of Wall Street, the Nightwatchwoman, the Avenger: you name it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019s ready to be the Sheriff of Wall Street. You can\u2019t be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Ms. Teachout said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t be the Sheriff of Wall Street if you are awash in corporate cash and voted to roll back Dodd-Frank regulations,\u201d she added, referring to the vote of another Democratic candidate, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney to roll back regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr. Maloney, New York\u2019s first openly gay congressman, called Ms. James\u2019 remarks \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cdisqualifying\u201d in an interview.\u201cYou sure as hell better be the Sheriff of Wall Street because that is the job title. You have to walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Mr. Maloney said about juggling other types of enforcement as the attorney general.Ms. James \u201ceither doesn\u2019t understand the office or have the right priorities,\u201d Mr. Maloney said.\u201cYou want to be an honest sheriff and you want to be fair, but you are the cop on the beat. To say otherwise is strange,\u201d Mr. Maloney said.Despite the controversy, Ms. James is leading in fund-raising among Democratic candidates, according to campaign finance reports. Ms. James raised more than $434,000 and now has $1.2 million on hand. Mr. Maloney has received contributions of more than $696,000, with a closing balance of $795,000.In a statement, Ms. James said that she was willing to take on Wall Street.\u201cThe attorney general cannot be a one-trick pony. I will be laser-focused on taking on Wall Street abuses \u2014 I don\u2019t need a moniker for that,\u201d Ms. James said in the statement.But she also said that other issues such as gun violence, the environment and the immigration policies of the Trump administration deserved attention.\u201cAnyone suggesting otherwise is doing a disservice to the powers of the office and the people of New York,\u201d Ms. James said in her statement.\u201cGiven the huge contribution of Wall Street to the city economy and tax rolls, it makes sense that she would want to be a balanced and thoughtful regulator as opposed to a gunslinger,\u201d Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said in an interview.But for some good government groups, Ms. James\u2019 remarks raised eyebrows, given New York prosecutors\u2019 long history of using the Martin Act to go after fraud.\u201cWe would welcome a New York attorney general who prides themselves on being the Sheriff of Wall Street,\u201d Bartlett Naylor, a financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, a liberal consumer rights organization, said in an interview.The role of state prosecutors is more important than ever given the rollback of Dodd-Frank legislation and the less rigorous regulatory environment encouraged by the Trump administration, Mr. Naylor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Tweets on Tesla Started a Tizzy. Someone Should Hit the Brakes.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhy do people say the craziest things on Twitter?What is it about social media that makes powerful, accomplished individuals say things that they later need to recant, walk back or at least explain?This isn\u2019t about President Trump (although it could be). It is about chief executives.For years, companies and their executives were limited to disclosing market-moving information in news releases that were widely distributed over services like Business Wire or in interviews with media outlets. That is, until Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, broke ranks in 2012 and wrote on his Facebook page that the company\u2019s video-streaming service had \u201cexceeded 1 billion hours for the first time.\u201dThat, in turn, led to what\u2019s known as the Reed Hastings Rule, when the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted such use of social media. \u201cMost social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors,\u201d said George S. Canellos, the agency\u2019s acting enforcement chief at the time.But given the brevity Twitter requires \u2014 its character limit was doubled to 280 characters last year \u2014 it is perhaps inevitable that people will be misunderstood, even when they tweet with the best of intentions.\u201cAll tweets are misleading with such a short character limit,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be encouraging the use of Twitter for its executives. They should forbid it.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld said such a prohibition should be a company guideline, not a legislative requirement, adding he did not believe the government should get involved in what constitutes a news release.But still, regulators could at least encourage companies to remind their executives that Twitter is better used as a place to offer idle musings rather than corporate missives.Individuals are responsible for their own behavior \u2014 or what comes out of their mouth or keystrokes. Still, all too often, boldface-name executives, politicians and celebrities have needed to \u201cclarify\u201d their comments on Twitter. (I\u2019ve had to do it myself.)Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, once tweeted about \u201cscumbag celebrities\u201d only to return to Twitter with a clarification: \u201cI never referred to any particular people, just some \u2018dodgy\u2019 self promoting celebrities. Repeat apology for language.\u201dRob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, defended the company on Twitter over the role that Russia-linked advertisements played in the 2016 United States presidential election. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal,\u201d he wrote. The company ended up issuing a clarification.For reasons that remain inexplicable, Twitter seems to create an impulse control problem for too many \u2014 and when billions of dollars of investors\u2019 money is on the line and the credibility of the markets are at stake, that seems like a risk not worth taking.Regulators may end up not having a problem with Mr. Musk\u2019s message, but the existing rule has an important caveat that involves the audience it reached.In discussing enforcement of the Reed Hastings Rule, Mr. Canellos said social media was not an appropriate vehicle for announcements \u201cif the access is restricted or if investors don\u2019t know that\u2019s where they need to turn to get the latest news.\u201dThat means if companies and their executives want to use Twitter to disseminate news, they should not be allowed to block people from following their accounts, including those who manage to get under their skin. Mr. Musk has repeatedly blocked such trolls on Twitter.This issue is a variation of a theme that emerged in a court case this year in which a judge found it inappropriate for Mr. Trump to block users, given his public role.Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter has illustrated the danger of disclosing market-moving information, exemplified by his tweet before the employment report in which he seemed to hint the numbers were going to be good.It is perhaps an irresistible temptation, but one that companies have seen fit to punish in the past. Gene Morphis, chief financial officer for the specialty women\u2019s retailer Francesca\u2019s, was fired in 2012 for his use of social media posts like, \u201cBoard meeting. Good numbers=Happy Board.\u201dPerhaps the original executive maverick on Twitter was Alan Meckler, chief executive of WebMediaBrands. He started sending tweets in 2011 that would regularly move his company\u2019s stock.\u201cGood chance we will be making a few acquisitions by middle of March,\u201d he would write. Or he would send a tweet pointing out that the company\u2019s earnings report would be out in a week, with a winking reference to promising revenue numbers: \u201cRev. Growth big.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission inquired about Mr. Meckler\u2019s use of Twitter, but eventually closed the case.It shouldn\u2019t have, or at least it could have sent a warning. Maybe Mr. Musk would have heard it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Candidate Backed Medical Marijuana. Wells Fargo Closed Her Bank Account.", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNikki Fried, a Democrat running for agriculture commissioner in Florida, has made no secret of her support for medical marijuana.Even so, employees at Wells Fargo, where her campaign held an account, had questions about her platform.The bank, which says it has a policy against serving marijuana-related businesses, had noticed that Ms. Fried was \u201cadvocating for expanded patient access to medical marijuana.\u201d It asked the campaign in July whether it would be receiving money from \u201clobbyists from the medical marijuana industry in any capacity.\u201dThe campaign replied that, yes, Ms. Fried would be receiving donations from lobbyists as well as \u201cexecutives, employees and corporations in the medical marijuana industry.\u201dLast week, the campaign said it had received written notice that Wells Fargo was closing its account.On Monday, Ms. Fried urged her supporters to consider pulling their money from the bank.\u201cThis is absolutely unprecedented,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this campaign since the beginning of June. Everybody in Florida knows that I\u2019m one of the main proponents of the expansion of medical marijuana.\u201dWells Fargo isn\u2019t the first bank to close a customer\u2019s account over money that could be related to the sale of marijuana, which is legal in some form in states including Florida but still prohibited by federal law.The biggest banks are traditionally the most cautious. But Wells Fargo\u2019s scrutiny of Ms. Fried\u2019s political beliefs set its decision apart.\u201cIf a bank is going to start drawing a line based on a candidate\u2019s particular advocacy, where does a bank draw that line?\u201d asked Christian Bax, who until Aug. 10 was Florida\u2019s medical marijuana director. \u201cIs it going to extend to every candidate in Florida who advocates for medical marijuana?\u201dA Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to discuss Ms. Fried\u2019s case specifically, but said the bank has a policy of avoiding the marijuana industry.\u201cIt is Wells Fargo\u2019s policy not to knowingly bank or provide services to marijuana businesses or for activities related to those businesses, based on federal laws under which the sale and use of marijuana is illegal even if state laws differ,\u201d the spokeswoman, Bridget Braxton, said in a statement. \u201cWe continually review our banking relationships to ensure we adhere to strict regulatory and risk guidelines.\u201dErik Gordon, assistant professor at University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said that while it was highly unlikely that Ms. Fried could successfully claim Wells Fargo had impeded her right to free speech, the bank\u2019s move seemed to him \u201clike semi-paranoid overkill.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re seeing the word \u2018marijuana\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re seeing a word that could indicate danger \u2014 and are assuming that the danger exists without thinking carefully about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said.Banks generally take their cue from the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which, in 2014, offered a checklist of things to watch for when providing banking services to legal marijuana businesses, with an eye toward ensuring that banks don\u2019t end up accidentally providing services to criminals.Wells Fargo\u2019s regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said it did not encourage or discourage banks from providing services to specific industries.\u201cWe expect banks to assess the risks posed by individual customers on a case-by-case basis and to implement appropriate controls to manage their relationships,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the agency.Florida began in 2015 to put together a framework for giving patients, including people with chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder, access to medical marijuana. More than a dozen businesses are licensed to provide medical marijuana in the state, and around 120,000 people have cards that give them access to the drug.But some advocates, including Ms. Fried, say the state isn\u2019t moving fast enough to expand access, and four Democratic candidates for governor have advocated decriminalization or legalization of recreational marijuana in some form.Democrats and Republicans alike are getting the support of the marijuana industry. For example, one Florida marijuana grower, Surterra Holdings, gave $25,000 to the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign this year. Surterra also donated to four current Republican state representatives.Bank lobbyists say it\u2019s up to Congress to offer guidance.\u201cThis is symptomatic of the confusion created by conflicts between state and federal law on marijuana-related issues, and banks have no clear rules of the road,\u201d said Jeff Sigmund, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.But in closing a campaign account, Wells stands alone. Representatives for Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase said their banks did not have policies that would prevent them from offering services to a candidate like Ms. Fried.Neither, it seems, does BB&T, which now maintains Ms. Fried\u2019s campaign account.Follow Emily Flitter on Twitter: @FlitterOnFraudAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worried About Turkey\u2019s Economic Problems? China\u2019s Could Be Worse", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates a weakening currency and capital flight.Mr. Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Many emerging markets make themselves vulnerable to financial crisis by spending more than they can afford, and relying on foreign lenders to fund these profligate habits, but Turkey was an extreme case even before Mr. Erdogan took power in 2002. Of late, his reckless economic policies \u2014 including setting interest rates at artificially low levels, and driving up debts, deficits and inflation \u2014 have only made matters worse. Many wealthy Turks saw another crisis coming and were fleeing the country well before foreigners joined the recent rush, accelerating the fall of the Turkish lira over the past few days.Turkey\u2019s troubles are homegrown, and the economic war against it is a figment of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s conspiratorial imagination. But he does have a point about the impact of a surging dollar, which has a long history of inflicting damage on developing nations.Like many emerging world currency crises before it, this one comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, pushing up the value of the dollar. As the dollar strengthens, developing countries like Turkey have a harder time paying back their dollar debts, and eventually investors start to flee.Now the question is whether Turkey is poised to trigger a wider global crisis, the way the fall of the Thai baht did in 1997. The answer is not clear. The fall of the Turkish lira has had a negative effect on other emerging market currencies, but few of those countries share Turkey\u2019s dual problem of having large foreign debt and government policies that fuel inflation. But there is an even bigger question looming: The strong dollar that is weakening Turkey\u2019s economy may also be undermining the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China. China is vulnerable to the strong dollar for different reasons. At one level, China is far less dependent on imports than Turkey, which has to buy virtually all its raw materials, including oil from abroad. Unlike Turkey, China does not run a chronic trade deficit and does not have to borrow heavily in dollars to finance its purchases abroad. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, however, Beijing tried to keep its economy humming by ordering state banks to pump out new loans. More than half the increase in global debt over the past decade was issued as domestic loans inside China. There is now much more money circulating in China than in the United States, much of it in the hands of Chinese who are constantly on the watch for higher returns.So China also faces a serious risk of capital flight. The last bout began in 2015, amid early indications that the Federal Reserve was going to start raising interest rates. China stopped that exodus by tightening its currency controls, but controls rarely work for long. Savvy locals find creative ways to get their money out. This year, the Fed\u2019s tightening has further strengthened the dollar, while Beijing\u2019s easy money policies have further weakened the renminbi \u2014 increasing the incentive for Chinese investors to dump China\u2019s currency for dollars. Right now Chinese can earn the same interest rates in the United States for a lot less risk, so the motivation to flee is high, and will grow more intense as the Fed raises rates further. Beijing could also diminish the allure of the strong dollar by trying to raise the value of its own currency. But that would mean tightening the supply of renminbi, which is likely to derail the economy at a time when growth in China is already slowing under the burden of too much debt. More than 60 percent of the foreign currency held in reserve by central banks around the world is in dollars, and China\u2019s ambition to make the renminbi a reserve currency has attracted hardly any takers. Global central banks and investors are still wary of holding a currency that Communist authorities may slap controls on at any time \u2014 as they did in 2016.So China is in a tough spot. The strengthening dollar threatens to provoke more capital flight out of China, but any effort to shore up the renminbi in response could further slow the Chinese economy. For years Beijing has responded to signs of weakness in the economy by printing more renminbi, which worked fine when the United States was also running a very loose monetary policy. Now that the United States is raising interest rates, lowering rates in China will only give Chinese investors more reason to leave the country. The fate of the world economy depends on how China negotiates this dilemma. Its $14 trillion economy is more than 15 times larger than Turkey\u2019s, representing about 16 percent of the global economy. It is pivotal. For the rest of the world, the collapse of the lira may prove to be a passing event, and China is likely to decide which way this crisis goes. Advertisement"}
