That means American buyers could be required to pay 25 percent more for a Ming dynasty bowl sold by a British owner at an auction in New York, as well as for a painting by a young Beijing-based artist at a gallery in Hong Kong.\u201cIt will have a chilling impact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will quickly reduce the market for Chinese art in America to a backwater.\u201dProfessional organizations like the Art Dealers Association of America, the Association of Art Museum Directors and the British Antique Dealers\u2019 Association have also stated their opposition to the proposal.Peter Tompa, a lawyer based in Washington, represented two lobbying groups that work on behalf of museums, dealers and collectors at the hearings on Wednesday. Mr. Tompa said a member of the trade committee asked him one question: Since art is a luxury item, wouldn\u2019t people pay?Mr. Tompa said he had told the committee that the main problem was slow turnover of inventory in the art trade and that a tariff would mean greater capital outlays by dealers.Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and the Asia Week New York association of dealers said in a written complaint that the United States, not China, would be affected most. \u201cImposing duties on Chinese-origin art will not impact the trade practices or policies of China, since the vast majority of such artwork is imported into the United States from countries other than China,\u201d the complaint read.Dealers have pointed out that adding a 25 percent duty to the fees known as the \u201cbuyer\u2019s premium\u201d could deter both buyers and sellers of Chinese art at auctions in the United States, reversing growth in that sector.In recent years, sales of the finest Chinese antiques have been dominated by Chinese dealers and collectors. The market for international contemporary art, on the other hand, is dominated by American dealers and collectors. They are also alarmed by what the impact of a proposed tariff would be on the Chinese artists they sell.\u201cOne of the strengths of the American economy has been it\u2019s a free market for all,\u201d said Jeffrey Deitch, a leading New York dealer and curator. \u201cIt\u2019s made New York City the world capital of the art business. To jeopardize this situation could have very serious consequences.\u201dThe proposed import tariff would be determined by the \u201clocation of production, not the nationality of the person creating it,\u201d the office of the United States trade representative said in a statement emailed in response to questions. Mr. Ai\u2019s works, having been produced in Germany, would be exempt from any penalties.The situation would be different, however, for works from contemporary artists with studios in China.The show should open before any tariffs are imposed on imported artworks, but Marc Glimcher, the president and chief executive of Pace Gallery, is still concerned.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting a tariff on stocks: If the price of an item is significantly altered by a tariff, the market will look elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Glimcher said.Purchases in New York are already subject to a local sales tax of nearly 9 percent, he said, adding, \u201cIf we had to raise the prices by 25 percent, it would be difficult to sell the show.\u201d\u201cAny protection of the U.S. art market will have the opposite effect,\u201d Mr. Glimcher continued. \u201cIt does nothing positive.\u201dBut the imposition of punitive import tariffs would affect more than the art market in the United States. It would also make it difficult for Chinese artists to exhibit their work, diminishing cultural exchange.\u201cIt\u2019s about more than the money,\u201d said Mr. Deitch, a former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. \u201cThis is where the consensus is reached about what art is important.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re a Chinese artist,\u201d Mr. Deitch added, \u201cyou want to show your work here, you want to be in the center of the international art discourse.\u201dSo far, the Trump administration has gotten low marks for its concern for cultural matters. But, over the coming weeks, the art world says it will work to convince lawmakers that, if the United States wants to wage an economic war with China, taxing art would be a self-inflicted wound.Advertisement"}

Funding secured.Add it all together, and it appears that an investigation has the potential to move down a number of paths. The question is how this might play out for Tesla and Mr. Musk.A formal investigation does not mean a case will be filed. It does indicate that the S.E.C. is committing resources, and investigations tend to take on lives of their own. Where they end is not always where they started heading, especially when there is a thorough review of corporate records.Rule 10b-5 prohibits any scheme to defraud, which includes misstatements or omissions of material information that affect the market value of shares. Given how erratic Tesla\u2019s stock has been, and how it responded so quickly to Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, showing that the information was material and might have harmed investors if it was misleading does not appear to be difficult.One possible defense to a potential fraud charge would be that Mr. Musk reasonably believed there was sufficient financing at the time he posted the statement.But there are hurdles to that defense. The S.E.C. would need to prove only that Mr. Musk\u2019s actions had been reckless, defined as a significant departure from the proper standards of business conduct. Evidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund or the private equity firm Silver Lake had reservations about financing a deal, or that the discussions were still continuing, may be enough to show recklessness.It is a difficult violation to prove. It requires the S.E.C. to show that the person acted with that specific purpose. Making a case based only on a single tweet would be a challenge even though the statement drove up Tesla\u2019s stock. Mr. Musk could offer a more innocent explanation, such as he was merely jumping the gun to reveal his desire to take the company private.This tack has advantages for Mr. Musk, Tesla and the S.E.C. It requires showing only that the issuing of corporate information was mistaken or at least inartful. It would not jeopardize the company\u2019s ability to issue shares, because it is a claim only of negligence, not of fraud, and the S.E.C. appears to have stopped requiring companies and individuals to admit culpability as part of a settlement, so a resolution under this provision would not affect private litigation.If serious consideration is being given to taking Tesla private, the company and Mr. Musk have an incentive to reach a resolution with the S.E.C. as quickly as possible. The firms that might help fund a deal may be hesitant to commit financing if the cloud of an S.E.C. investigation is hanging over Tesla. But resolving the investigation will not be easy, at least not until there is greater clarity about what exactly Mr. Musk meant with his ill-fated tweet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Apple Is the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School.Those interpretations obscure Apple\u2019s other accomplishment \u2014 pioneering a financial model that is the envy of corporate America. Sure, Apple produces innovative phones and laptops, but look inside its sleek exterior and you\u2019ll find an elegant financial machine that has become the ideal for corporate America. Without investing significantly in hard assets, Apple spins cash and returns it to shareholders at a stunning rate. It\u2019s difficult not to admire.But the model that has been perfected at Apple is risky and imitated poorly by many American corporations. The next decade will reveal whether these imitations were a series of brilliant moves or large-scale financial engineering.Apple has $115 billion of debt outstanding, and it has distributed $288 billion to its shareholders in the past six years, most of it through share buybacks. In the most recent nine months alone, Apple bought back $54 billion worth of shares.This transformation is representative of trends in corporate America. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have issued on net over $1.3 trillion of debt and retired over $1.9 trillion of equity over the past four years. American companies are borrowing money to buy their own shares in what is tantamount to a huge, slow-motion leveraged buyout.Apple has conducted its buybacks responsibly: It bought shares when they were relatively cheap, rewarding the patient shareholder. Other companies have not been so prudent, taking on debt to make ill-timed purchases of expensive shares rather than investing in growth opportunities. In some cases, they have done so simply to push up share prices so that management can meet goals for quarterly earnings or metrics that trigger compensation.Second, Apple\u2019s financial model emphasizes cash flow over profits. Apple is not simply immensely profitable; in 2017, it generated $16 billion more in operating cash flow than profits. It does that in part by running its day-to-day operations in a distinctive way. Typically, a company has to use external funds to fund the process of stocking goods and collecting revenue from customers.Apple\u2019s model turns this upside down. Its retail stores collect cash from customers quickly, it is ruthless on keeping inventory low, and it takes forever to pay suppliers. In the process, Apple\u2019s operations are extremely effective cash generators. This is no coincidence. It is the result of the canny supply chain that Tim Cook built. In effect, Apple has largely been financed on the backs of its suppliers, who are willing to hold their inventory and wait more than 100 days to get paid, just for the pleasure of doing business with Apple.This restructuring of operations to minimize inventory, move to subscription models (which generate predictable streams of cash) and keep suppliers waiting has become the dominant pattern in large corporations. Amazon, for example, generates relatively small profits but mountains of cash through this process. But this emphasis on cash also means that executives can become wary of making capital expenditures, such as new factories or server farms. This kind of spending can increase profits in the long run but bites into cash flow in the short run. That is a recipe for sluggish corporate investment, just as we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the financial crisis.Finally, Apple is the epitome of an \u201casset light\u201d company: It owns very few hard assets and therefore needs almost zero outside capital to run its business. As of mid-2018, Apple has $105 billion of operating assets and $120 billion of operating liabilities. What does that mean? Miraculously, its operations rely on no capital from outside financiers.How does one achieve this apotheosis of the asset-light strategy? First, create a supply chain in Asia run by companies willing to invest in low-return projects that create your products. Second, hold those suppliers under your thumb. Idolizing asset-light strategies, however, can also lead to underinvestment, an excessive reliance on outsourcing and the artificial division of companies to avoid hard assets.The accomplishments of Apple\u2019s model are substantial. But the financial strategy that has worked so well for Apple is a risky one for less capable companies with weaker strategic positions. For them, aping Apple can just as easily result in too much debt on their balance sheets, precarious supply chains and deferred opportunities for investments.The financial archetype defined by Apple \u2014 asset-light strategy, leveraged share buybacks and cash flow above all \u2014 is a high-wire act. Boards should guard against the temptation to follow Apple\u2019s path blindly. Big investors, especially mutual funds and pension funds that represent so many individuals, should question the management of any company that does. Many of Apple\u2019s imitators are more likely to mortgage the future than create it.Mihir A. Desai, a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School, is the author of \u201cThe Wisdom of Finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plunge in Lira, Turkey\u2019s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTurkey\u2019s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets.The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable.Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets. Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns. But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes. A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing.After the Turkish lira fell even further \u2014 one dollar bought 3.8 liras at the start of the year, but at one point on Monday it was worth 7.2 liras \u2014 investors dumped other emerging-market currencies. The Indian rupee dropped to a record low against the dollar, the Indonesian rupiah flirted with a three-year low, and the South African rand lost 2 percent after falling nearly 6 percent last week.Stock markets across Asia, including in Hong Kong; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; and Tokyo, fell on Monday, with many exchanges dropping nearly 2 percent during the day. European markets fared only slightly better. The euro hovered around its lowest point against the dollar in a year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lagged for much of the day, and closed down 0.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent.\u201cTurkey\u2019s woes can ripple out to hammer European Union institutions,\u201d Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, N.Y., said in a note to clients on Monday.Shares of European banks suffered some of the biggest losses, including BBVA of Spain and UniCredit of Italy, which have large holdings in Turkey, and lenders such as Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which do not have major operations there.Investors were driven principally by fears of contagion, the notion that an economic or financial crisis in one country \u2014 in this case, Turkey \u2014 can quickly spread to other regions.Problems in Turkey have been brewing for years, but Turkish assets have fallen steeply in recent days as questions have mounted over the country\u2019s prospects. Price increases have quickened, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had undertaken increasingly authoritarian moves, from the appointment of a relative as an important minister to the erosion of the central bank\u2019s independence.Normally, a country in Turkey\u2019s situation would raise interest rates to stifle inflation and stop the currency\u2019s slide. But Mr. Erdogan\u2019s popularity has hinged on rapid growth fueled by credit, and he has often spoken against raising interest rates.Still, Turkey has political and economic problems not found elsewhere, and analysts were not yet ready to predict widespread panic.\u201cIn the very short term, we are seeing what we would describe as \u2018risk off\u2019 toward emerging markets,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, global head of macro and fixed income research at Exotix Capital, a research firm in London.But \u201cTurkey is following a path many other emerging markets aren\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to lead to a more systemic problem across emerging markets.\u201dBut it made no mention of raising the benchmark interest rate, which is already at 17.75 percent. Though high compared with other countries, it is only slightly above the rate of inflation and would have to be much higher to squelch rising prices.In a speech in the city of Trabzon on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan called on businesses to show solidarity in supporting the lira.\u201cDo not prefer to rush to banks and buy foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would do the wrong thing if you resort to such options just to be on the safe side. You should know that it is both our and industrialists\u2019 and merchants\u2019 responsibility to keep this nation on its feet. Otherwise, we would have to implement Plan B or Plan C.\u201dYet in a sign of nervousness in Turkey, rumors spread on social media that the Plan B or C would involve restrictions on foreign exchange bank accounts. The treasury and finance minister, Berat Albayrak denied the rumors in a post on Twitter late Sunday, and the semiofficial Anadolu news agency later reported that Turkey\u2019s interior ministry had opened investigations into 346 social media accounts officials said had helped \u201cmanipulate perceptions\u201d about the lira.Those debts in dollars, euros or other foreign currencies will quickly become unsustainable for borrowers that do not have corresponding revenue in those currencies.A worsening diplomatic dispute with the United States has also piled on the pressure for Turkey. Though tensions initially centered on the detention of an American pastor, they have since spread into the trade arena.\u201cThe catalyst for market volatility has been geopolitical uncertainties and trade,\u201d said Viraj Patel, a foreign-currency strategist at ING. \u201cThis is another knock for global markets and, taken together, it\u2019s a pretty toxic environment.\u201dChina\u2019s currency, the renminbi, which has been a casualty of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies for weeks, also weakened further against the dollar on Monday. The government in Beijing, which keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency, weakened the renminbi by 0.34 percent against the dollar, setting the benchmark rate for trading in Shanghai at its weakest level in 15 months.China\u2019s main stock index lost nearly 2 percent at one point on Monday, but it closed down 0.3 percent. The reaction was stronger in other Asian markets: In Tokyo, the main index fell 2 percent. Stocks in Seoul fell 1.5 percent. A broad index of Europe\u2019s biggest companies was down 0.4 percent in afternoon trading.A strengthening dollar is the biggest concern for officials in China and in other emerging markets. The upheaval in Turkey has fortified the dollar even further.Despite the panic in markets, one economist at Deloitte said he believed that uncertainty about Turkey did not signal a global contagion, yet. Turkey\u2019s economy is only the 17th-largest in the world, and it is not as integrated into the global financial system as countries like China and the United States.\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned, but I wouldn\u2019t be pressing the panic button,\u201d the economist, Xu Sitao, said.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Board Surprised by Elon Musk\u2019s Tweet on Taking Carmaker Private", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn abrupt tweet last week by Elon Musk about the prospect of taking Tesla private was dashed off with little forethought, and had not been cleared ahead of time with the company\u2019s board, two people familiar with the chain of events said Monday.The account raised new questions about the cryptic Twitter post last week in which Mr. Musk, the mercurial co-founder and chief executive of the electric-car maker, said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a buyout of the $60 billion company.Since early 2017, the fund \u201chas approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote. Two weeks ago, he added, the fund\u2019s managing director \u201cstrongly expressed his support for funding a going-private transaction.\u201d\u201cI understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed,\u201d he added.But three people familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund cast doubt on his account. They said the fund had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal.And even if the fund were ready to move forward with such an agreement, it would invite review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that reviews the national-security implications of such transactions.A spokesman for the Saudi investment fund declined to comment.In his blog post Monday, Mr. Musk portrayed his Twitter musings last week as part of a deliberate effort to be \u201ccompletely forthcoming\u201d with shareholders about his desire to take the company private.But the episode appears to have been much more extemporaneous.The tweet did not disclose the sum he had supposedly secured, its source, or any terms of the plan \u2014 the kind of transaction that would typically be detailed in documents of 200 pages or more.A person with direct knowledge of the Tesla board\u2019s thinking said some members of the board had been totally blindsided by Mr. Musk\u2019s decision to air his plan on Twitter.On Monday evening, Mr. Musk took to Twitter again. Signaling that he remained serious about pursuing the potential buyout, he cited two financial firms and two law firms that he said he was \u201cexcited to work with\u201d on the proposal. He named Silver Lake Partners and Goldman Sachs as financial advisers, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Munger, Tolles & Olson as legal advisers.The pursuit of a buyout has come at a crucial time for the company, as it struggles to turn out its first mass-market automobile, the Model 3. Tesla has taken on a mounting debt load and has yet to turn an annual profit. And while Mr. Musk has always been synonymous with the brand, he has never been under greater scrutiny.In the past few months, he has mocked industry analysts for asking \u201cbonehead\u201d questions, pursued online tirades against investors betting against the company\u2019s stock, clashed with a government agency investigating a fatal Tesla crash, and accused a disgruntled employee of sabotage.Then he suddenly announced the idea of taking the company private.In his blog post on Monday, Mr. Musk said he had notified the Tesla board on Aug. 2, five days before sending out the tweets, that \u201cin my personal capacity, I wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a per share.\u201dHe said that after the board\u2019s outside directors discussed the matter \u2014 without the participation of Mr. Musk or his brother, Kimbal Musk, also a board member \u2014 the full board agreed to have Mr. Musk discuss the matter with some of the company\u2019s largest shareholders.Since then, Mr. Musk said, he had stayed in contact with representatives of the Saudi fund, which recently bought a stake of almost 5 percent in Tesla, and had been in touch with other investors.A Tesla spokesman declined to comment beyond the blog post.Tesla shares declined on Monday morning, then recovered in the afternoon to end the day 0.3 percent higher at $356.41. It was a far cry from the volatility of last Tuesday, when trading was halted in the confusion that followed Mr. Musk\u2019s initial tweet, eventually closing 11 percent higher on the day.The Nasdaq exchange, like the rest of Wall Street, seemed to have been stunned by the news. Companies that list on Nasdaq are required to inform the exchange\u2019s market surveillance group at least 10 minutes before the release of news that could have a major effect on shares.After Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, however, frenzied trading went on for more than an hour before it was halted pending a fuller announcement from Tesla, which came a half-hour before the market closed.\u201cAs an officer of a public company that was a clearly a market-moving event and he knew or should have known that,\u201d said Laura Unger, a former S.E.C. commissioner, said of Mr. Musk\u2019s initial tweet. \u201cHe was at least reckless whether he meant to drive up the price or not. What it does point out is that executives and people in power should be thoughtful about what they tweet. The stakes are high.\u201dAside from the scrutiny of market regulators, the frantic Tesla trading after the \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet has also exposed Mr. Musk to shareholder lawsuits. At least two law firms initiated potential class-action lawsuits late last week, saying the Tesla chief had deliberately acted to move the company\u2019s share price without actually having funding in place. Such suits rarely go to trial; more often they are settled.John Reed Stark, a former longtime lawyer at the S.E.C. who specialized in investigating internet fraud cases, said that commenting online about the prospects of taking the company private was inadvisable at best. But he said that a case of market manipulation would come down to Mr. Musk\u2019s intent.\u201cThese are very difficult cases to prove,\u201d said Mr. Stark, who runs a cybersecurity consulting business.As it scrambles to ramp up production of the Model 3, Tesla continues to burn cash. Looming in the months ahead are two key bond payments \u2014 one in November for $230 million and another early next year for $920 million that analysts believe will be harder for Tesla to make.The recent rise in Tesla\u2019s stock could make a difference; the company can pay off the second convertible bond with stock rather than cash if its share price is above $360.Amid all the tension, Tesla has become a target of short sellers \u2014 investors who are betting the company\u2019s stock will fall. Mr. Musk has openly feuded with short sellers on Twitter, taunting them when Tesla shares rise and accusing them of spreading negative news to hurt the company.Shares of Tesla have one of the highest short-interest ratios in the United States stock market \u2014 that is, the most investor money betting against the stock, as a percentage of shares available for trading. So when shares rise, as they did after Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet last week, it can cost the skeptics dearly.Among those who have been betting big against Tesla is David Einhorn, founder of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital. A letter from the fund to investors at the end of July said that Mr. Musk \u201cappears erratic and desperate,\u201d recapitulating some of his provocative interactions with analysts, regulators and Twitter followers. It also lamented that \u201cthis bravado\u201d was a hit in the market, sending Tesla\u2019s shares up 29 percent in the second quarter and resulting in the fund\u2019s second biggest loss.One benefit of taking Tesla private, Mr. Musk has said, is that it would eliminate the influence of short sellers, as well as the demands of reporting quarterly earnings. Doing so, he said in the blog post, would \u201cenable Tesla to operate at its best.\u201dMatthew Goldstein, Tiffany Hsu and Matt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vanguard Warns of Worsening Odds for the Economy and Markets", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe chances of a recession by the end of 2020 are mounting. And the prospects for the American stock market in the next decade have worsened appreciably.Those are prognoses, not facts. But they\u2019re not just offhand projections, either. They are the sober assessments of Vanguard, the $5 trillion asset management firm. And they suggest that the current good times may amount to a reprieve: an opportunity to make sure that you are prepared for a storm.But in the Vanguard view, the odds have increased sharply that more challenging times are coming. It is likely, Vanguard says, that the long stretches of sizzling stock markets since 2009 \u2014 bouts that have made investing a winner\u2019s game for those lucky enough to afford a seat at the table \u2014 will become much rarer.Vanguard tracks data to predict the likelihood of a recession at certain points in the future. In recent years, the company has put the probability of a recession six months out at close to 10 percent. Now, Vanguard says the chances of one by late 2020 are between 30 and 40 percent. That\u2019s Vanguard\u2019s highest-ever estimate for that time frame, Mr. Davis said. (A six-month forecast reported a greater than 40 percent probability before the recession that started in December 2007.)If the facts change \u2014 with, say, the Federal Reserve delaying anticipated interest-rate hikes in response to a weaker economy \u2014 the recession forecast will change, too, Mr. Davis said. To be clear, Vanguard isn\u2019t predicting a recession; it is merely saying that the odds of one have risen.The forecast suggests opportunities, not just problems, Mr. Davis said. The 10-year outlook, for example, includes lower projected annualized returns, but still positive ones, for these two stock categories:\u25a0 United States stocks, an expected 10-year return of 3.9 percent, annualized, down from a projection of an 8 percent annualized return, made in March 2013;\u25a0 Stocks from markets outside the United States, 6.5 percent, annualized, down from 8.7 percent in 2013.Non-United States stocks are more attractive for equity investors, on a relative basis, than they were five years ago. (That is partly a reflection of the out-performance of domestic stocks, making them far pricier than they were before.) What\u2019s more, Vanguard projects improved 10-year annualized returns for these asset classes:\u25a0 A diversified portfolio of United States bonds, 3.3 percent, annualized, up from 1.7 percent in March 2013;\u25a0 Bonds from outside the United States, 2.9 percent, up from 1.8 percent;\u25a0 Commodities, 5.9 percent, up from 4.2 percent;\u25a0 United States Treasury bonds, 3 percent, up from 1.3 percent;\u25a0 And cash, held in United States money market funds, savings accounts or other instruments, 2.9 percent, up from 1.5 percent. Short-term cash is becoming more attractive \u2014 with greater liquidity and, often, lower risk \u2014 compared with holding bonds.Experienced investors who are \u201csophisticated enough to focus on these numbers and act on them themselves\u201d can benefit by making their own adjustments, Mr. Davis said. Tried-and true investments like balanced funds and target date funds (which become more conservative as a given date nears) can make basic adjustments for you. Advisers can do this as well.Tweaking investments can make it easier to live with them \u2014 and not panic \u2014 if markets fall, Mr. Kinniry said. At the moment, though, many Americans appear to be setting themselves up for trouble.By the start of this year, the stock portion of investment portfolios swelled to 63 percent, the highest level in decades, according to a Vanguard analysis. That reflects the rising value of stocks after one of the greatest bull markets in history.American portfolios had the same high proportion of stocks in September 2007. People bailed out as the market crashed a decade ago \u2014 taking huge losses after prices had already fallen \u2014 and reducing the equity proportion of their portfolios to only 38 percent in January 2009.Dividing a portfolio between stocks and bonds is a personal decision. If you can afford to ride out a major stock market decline, and truly don\u2019t need to touch your money for a decade or two, you might be fine with a broadly diversified portfolio that holds only stocks, Mr. Kinniry said.After all, he said, it took only 3 years for such a portfolio to recover all of its losses after the roughly 50 percent stock market decline of the last crash. But withstanding losses like those without selling any holdings took extreme fortitude. That\u2019s why it was easier to live with a broadly diversified portfolio, with 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds. Such a portfolio recovered all of its losses in just one year, not three, according to data provided by Mr. Kinniry.Doing a serious gut check and realistically assessing how you will behave if a major downturn occurs can prevent a lot of pain later. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to find out that you don\u2019t have enough car insurance or home insurance until after an accident happens,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cYou\u2019re better off if you do the inventory now.\u201dAnd if the markets do turn out to provide lower returns in the next decade than in the last one, it may be possible to compensate by taking measures that you can at least partly control, perhaps by working more, increasing savings or reducing spending.The odds have worsened. Surely it\u2019s better to be prepared.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Trade Truce Could Add Almost $2 Trillion to the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States stock market might be worth nearly $2 trillion more if not for the trade war.Consider that the cost that investors appear to be ascribing to President Trump\u2019s efforts to upend decades of trade relationships.Typically, it\u2019s hard to know why stocks are up or down over short periods. And the 5.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index this year might seem to be one of those inscrutable moves. But a closer look at the factors that usually drive the stock market suggests that the escalating trade tensions are holding stocks back.Two things happened at the start of the year that worried investors. First, soon after the S. & P. 500 hit an all-time high on Jan. 26, stocks plunged on fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more quickly than expected. Then, at the end of February, the Trump administration announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, the first clear shot in the trade war.Since then, neither the economy nor the Federal Reserve has sprung any nasty surprises. When investors dumped stocks in February, they were reacting to an unexpectedly strong number for wage growth. Since then, though, the economy has grown, adding on average 215,000 jobs per month, without an acceleration in wage growth, which investors track to gauge inflationary pressures. Friday\u2019s jobs report for July showed annual growth in wages of 2.7 percent, in line with the monthly average this year.And the Fed does not appear to be a threat right now to the stock market. Investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates twice more this year rather than once, which hardly constitutes a slamming of the brakes. In fact, the Fed said Wednesday that its monetary policy was still set to ensure that the economy remained buoyant.What is more, the bond market seems to agree that the economy can keep growing without a breakout in inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was expected to trade at 3 percent or higher in the second half of this year as the economy picked up, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Economic Forecasting Survey. But it has mostly traded below that threshold all year.On their own, a steadily growing economy and relatively supportive Fed policies would normally provide a springboard for stocks. But investors have had another reason to bid stocks higher: Corporate earnings have been coming in stronger than expected.So far, second-quarter earnings have exceeded Wall Street analysts\u2019 estimates for all 11 industry sectors of the S. & P. 500, according to researchers at BofA Merrill Lynch. Sales have surpassed estimates in nine sectors.So to what degree have Mr. Trump\u2019s trade battles tainted the bullish stock market conditions?One way to tell is to look at valuations, which reveal the underlying mood of investors. Right now, the S. & P. 500 is trading at 16.6 times what analysts expect its companies to make over the next 12 months, according to data from FactSet. But in the three months before the trade tensions really heated up at the end of February, the S. & P. 500 on average traded at 17.8 times earnings.Applying that higher multiple to stocks today would take the index over 3,000 points. Such a rise \u2014 7.5 percent from Friday\u2019s level \u2014 would add $1.8 trillion to the value of the stock market. The higher-than-expected corporate earnings would arguably support a higher valuation.What happens next? While Mr. Trump appeared willing to forge some sort of trade truce with the European Union, his metals tariffs are still in place and the actions against China are escalating. A big test for investors comes next month, when the Trump administration might impose $200 billion of extra tariffs on China. Given their size, the stock market may actually fall if those go ahead.If the Trump administration blinks and delays putting the tariffs into effect, it will signal a retreat from its plans to radically recast the United States\u2019 trade relations. But there could be a consolation prize: American investors may get to enjoy the nearly $2 trillion of gains that the trade war has apparently so far denied them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Elon Musk\u2019s Interview With The Times About Tesla", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla is not considering hiring a second in command, the electric carmaker\u2019s founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, said in wide-ranging comments to The New York Times.Mr. Musk\u2019s remarks came during an hourlong interview Thursday in which he described the extraordinary demands of running Tesla and the profound effect it has had on his personal life.\u201cIf you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job,\u201d he said from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cIs there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dHere are five takeaways from the interview.En route, he typed out the message that provoked the latest crisis over his leadership of Tesla.Mr. Musk said no one reviewed or saw the tweet before he sent it, but the post sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring. He then reached the airport and took a private jet to a Tesla battery plant in Nevada. Later that evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area and held meetings into the night.When Mr. Musk sent out the tweet, Tesla\u2019s share price rocketed upward, finally closing up 11 percent to finish the day just above $379. He said in the interview that he had sought to offer shareholders a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had recently been trading, and rounded up to $420 a share.Since then, however, Tesla\u2019s share price has nose-dived. On Friday, Tesla shares ended trading at $305.50, a fall of about 9 percent for the day \u2014 and about 24 percent lower from where the price closed on the day of the tweet.\u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Musk told The Times on Thursday, there was \u201cno active search right now.\u201d People familiar with the matter, however, said that executives were looking for a No. 2 executive, and one person said the hunt had intensified in recent weeks.A couple of years ago, Tesla approached Sheryl Sandberg, currently Facebook\u2019s second most senior executive, about the job, Mr. Musk said.\u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asked.Once Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about taking Tesla private was posted, speculation was rife that his target share price, $420, held an implicit message \u2014 the number has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.Mr. Musk was, however, definitive in his response. \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear,\u201d he said.\u201cWeed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dHe did note, though, that he sometimes takes Ambien to help him sleep when he is not working, a practice that has worried some of Tesla\u2019s board members.They worry that the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep, but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, a person familiar with the matter said. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has occasionally used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk outlined the toll that running Tesla had taken on his personal life, from spending the entirety of his birthday at work to nearly missing his brother\u2019s wedding, where he was to be best man.But while that effort appears to have helped Tesla gain a firmer footing, things could get worse for him personally, he said.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d\u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint,\u201d Mr. Musk added, \u201cthe worst is yet to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Inaccurately Claims California Is Wasting Water as Fires Burn", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState officials and firefighting experts dismissed the president\u2019s comments, which he posted on Twitter. \u201cWe have plenty of water to fight these wildfires, but let\u2019s be clear: It\u2019s our changing climate that is leading to more severe and destructive fires,\u201d said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire, the state\u2019s fire agency.He and others said that Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a perennial and unrelated water dispute in California between farmers and environmentalists. Farmers have long argued for more water to be allocated to irrigating crops, while environmentalists counter that the state\u2019s rivers would suffer and fish stocks would die.The remarks came hours after the White House declared the wildfires a \u201cmajor disaster\u201d and ordered that federal funding be made available to help recovery efforts.California does not lack water to fight the Carr Fire and others burning across the state, officials said.Mr. Berlant of Cal Fire declined to speculate on the meaning of Mr. Trump\u2019s statement that water was not being \u201cproperly utilized.\u201dAsked about that line and the president\u2019s claim that water was being diverted into the Pacific, a spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown, Evan Westrup, said in an email, \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201dThe White House did not respond to requests for clarification on Mr. Trump\u2019s statement.William Stewart, a forestry specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he believed Mr. Trump was referring to the battle over allocating water to irrigation versus providing river habitat for fish.That debate has no bearing on the availability of water for firefighting. Helicopters lower buckets into lakes and ponds to collect water that is then used to douse wildfires, and there is no shortage of water to do so, Cal Fire officials said.California water regulators are preparing to negotiate how much water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta should flow to California\u2019s farms and how much should flow down the river and to the ocean to ensure fish have enough fresh water to spawn and hatch. The issue has long pitted environmentalists against the state\u2019s farming communities.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump took on the farmers\u2019 grievances in language similar to his tweets this week.\u201cYou have a water problem that is so insane, it is so ridiculous, where they\u2019re taking the water and shoving it out to sea,\u201d he said during a May 2016 campaign rally in Fresno. \u201cThey have farms up here, and they don\u2019t get water.\u201dRecently, California Republicans encouraged the Trump administration to weigh in on the issue, inviting Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to the Central Valley to discuss water rights in the state\u2019s agricultural heartland.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big story, but it\u2019s got nothing to do with the fires,\u201d Mr. Stewart said.Mr. Trump raised another issue when he wrote that officials \u201cmust also tree clear to stop fire spreading.\u201d Scientists and forest experts said the president was referring to a valid and continuing debate.The timber industry has argued that \u201cthinning\u201d forests \u2014 removing certain trees to improve the health of the remaining ones and diminish the plants and underbrush that fuel fires \u2014 reduces the risk of wildfires. Republicans in Congress have sought to loosen environmental restrictions to allow more thinning. Democrats and environmentalists argue the practice will open the door to expanded commercial logging and threaten wildlife.California already has policies in place to address wildfire risk.LeRoy Westerling, a management professor at the University of California, Merced, who studies wildfires, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s statement about fire-control efforts hit on an important issue, but that he wrongly placed the blame on California. Professor Westerling noted that while federal funding for lowering wildfire risk has been tied up in budget negotiations, California has allocated $256 million this year.That money is coming from a source the Trump administration finds troublesome: revenues from California\u2019s program to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. Under its market-based approach for curbing carbon emissions, California sets a ceiling for the total amount of carbon that can be emitted. Companies are then required to obtain permits to release carbon into the atmosphere.The Trump administration opposes federal efforts to address climate change.California is \u201cspending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands,\u201d Professor Westerling said. \u201cAnd all that money is being raised because we\u2019re putting a price on carbon.\u201dScientists noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s statement didn\u2019t address the role climate change has played in creating a hotter and drier fire season. The president in the past has dismissed climate change as a hoax and his top cabinet officials have questioned the established science that rising global temperatures are caused by human activity.Michael F. Wehner, a senior staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it was not possible to quantify precisely the likelihood that climate change is having an impact on forest fires, as can now be done with other extreme-weather events such as heat waves.And, he said, it\u2019s not easy to weigh how much of the problem can be laid at the feet of forest-management practices. However, climate change is making summers longer and drier, which expands the wildfire season.\u201cTo dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,\u201d he said.California fire officials on Monday said the Carr Fire in Shasta County had ravaged more than 160,000 acres while the Mendocino Complex fires grew overnight and had charred more than 273,000 acres across Mendocino, Lake and Colusa counties.The White House\u2019s disaster declaration ordered federal funding be made available to help recovery efforts. \u201cAssistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property loses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\u201d a White House statement said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Elon Musk Reversed Course on Taking Tesla Private", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Elon Musk declared this month that he wanted to take Tesla private, his board was caught off guard. Barely three weeks later, the chief executive told the board he had changed his mind. Tesla would be staying public, after all.In that time, according to five people close to the events, Mr. Musk came to realize that his thinking had been overly simplistic. While going private might have removed some problems, it would have introduced new ones.Among his concerns were ceding too much control to private investors \u2014 including conventional car companies and Saudi Arabia, a symbol of big oil \u2014 and shutting out smaller investors who might be unable to retain a stake.Those were issues both symbolic and substantive for Tesla, which has staked its future on making electric vehicles the transportation of choice \u2014 a vision that has made it the nation\u2019s most highly valued car company. Even with its shares worth $55 billion, it faces concerns common to many young companies, including its vulnerability to the whims of public shareholders.For his part, Mr. Musk has come under new scrutiny as his impulsiveness has played out in real time in the stock market, with billions of dollars on the line.And even with the decision to stand pat, Mr. Musk and the company could remain in the sights of the Securities and Exchange Commission over the circumstances of the original announcement.\u201cTesla investors must realize that they have a panicky, erratic, possibly self-destructive C.E.O. at the helm,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cNo C.E.O. is ever this confused and confusing.\u201dFor years, Mr. Musk had romanticized the idea of Tesla going private. Doing so, he has mused publicly, would free him from the short-term pressures of the public markets, unburden him of the distractions of a volatile stock price and, more recently, get rid of the short sellers betting that Tesla would fail. Instead, Mr. Musk believed he could focus on Tesla\u2019s work of popularizing electric vehicles and reducing the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.In his note announcing that Tesla would remain public, Mr. Musk cited four main factors that changed his mind: existing shareholders believe Tesla is better off as a public company; not all existing investors would be able to own shares of a private company; it wasn\u2019t clear how individual investors would take part in a deal; and the process could distract the company from production of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, which is crucial to its financial health.By the account of people familiar with Mr. Musk\u2019s thinking, deepening ties with new private investors presented its own challenges. By taking money from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2014 something Mr. Musk said he believed was a sure thing \u2014 Tesla would have been teaming up with a country whose very foundation is fossil fuels, and one often criticized on human-rights grounds.That cognitive dissonance \u2014 an electric-car company backed by big oil \u2014 was pointed out to Mr. Musk several times, these people said.As Tesla representatives reached out to officials at the Saudi fund and other sovereign funds, it also became clear that they might want more than just Tesla equity in exchange for an investment. Some, said someone briefed on those talks, would expect Tesla to open manufacturing operations in their countries, for example.And while several big carmakers approached Tesla about funding a deal, people familiar with the discussions said, there were issues there, too. Some of those companies have their own reputational baggage. And Mr. Musk, proud that Tesla\u2019s cars are made in America, did not want to let foreign interests dictate his decisions about manufacturing.At the same time, it became clear that not all of Tesla\u2019s big institutional shareholders would have been able to take part in a buyout. Many big investors hold Tesla stock in funds that can only own publicly traded stocks.\u201cOn the whole, some of our clients will find it very difficult to follow,\u201d James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, which is Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder after Mr. Musk, said in an interview before Mr. Musk called off a deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation with Mr. Musk himself. He understands that there is an issue here.\u201dThose pleas were notable because many individual investors are not able to invest in private companies for regulatory reasons.On Thursday morning, Elon Musk and Tesla\u2019s board gathered for a meeting on the factory floor of the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif., people with knowledge of the events said. They were joined by representatives from the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Silver Lake, which were advising on a deal.After a Silver Lake representative made a presentation expressing confidence in their ability to manage the process of taking Tesla private \u2014 a transaction that could have required $24 billion or more \u2014 the Wall Street representatives left the room, and the floor was given to Mr. Musk.But instead of telling his board just how far he\u2019d come in securing new investors for a potential deal, Mr. Musk backtracked: He no longer believed going private was in the best interest of the company, and he would not be bringing forward a proposal to buy out the company.Doing so would be too distracting, big institutional investors could not all take part and there was no easy path for retail shareholders to be involved, he told the board.During the meeting, the board voted to dissolve the special committee established to evaluate a potential deal. And before lunchtime, the meeting \u2014 held in the same room where Mr. Musk sometimes sleeps during late nights at the factory \u2014 was over.Later that day, Mr. Musk drafted a statement announcing that Tesla would remain public, which the board approved Thursday night. On Friday, working from the office of SpaceX, his private rocket company, based near Los Angeles, Mr. Musk and his team refined the letter.Still, the S.E.C., which is investigating whether Mr. Musk\u2019s original tweet about a potential buyout violated securities law, may have more to say about the sequence of events \u2014 particularly the \u201cfunding secured\u201d declaration. The initial tweet sent Tesla\u2019s stock soaring and caused a halt in trading pending a fuller announcement. The stock tapered off in ensuing weeks and never came close to the $420 buyout price that Mr. Musk had said was in prospect, indicating investor skepticism.\u201cIn a sense it lessens the impact of the initial tweet,\u201d Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said of the reversal. \u201cBut the S.E.C. looks at what happens at the time of the disclosure. Walking it back later doesn\u2019t necessary mitigate the effect. And it was clearly incomplete.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t throw out information that moves the market and say, \u2018Never mind,\u2019\u201d Mr. Henning added. \u201cThis is the C.E.O. of the company. His statements are the company\u2019s statements. Will they make an example of him? Maybe.\u201dAnd while Mr. Musk may have appeased some constituencies, management experts were left shaking their heads at the chaotic process, which began with a tweet as Mr. Musk drove his Tesla Model S through Los Angeles just over two weeks ago.\u201cA major enterprise should not navigate its ownership path and market valuation through the frantic, public, volatile impulses of the C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cLet alone through the selective disclosures of elite shareholder referenda.\u201dKate Kelly and Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Reports Another Big Loss, but Sees Only Profit Ahead", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla recorded another huge loss last quarter and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash as it ramped up production of its first mass-market model.But the electric-car maker intends for that loss to be its last.Tesla is about to turn the corner, Elon Musk, the chief executive, told analysts and investors on Wednesday during a conference call after the company announced its quarterly results.\u201cOur goal is to be profitable and cash-flow positive for every quarter going forward,\u201d Mr. Musk said. Outside of a recession or major economic shock, the company is confident that it can reach that target, he said.Investors liked the promise. Tesla\u2019s stock rose about 9 percent in extended trading, after closing at $300.84.The quarter that ended June 30 was a crucial one for Tesla in its quest to build a successful future around the Model 3, the more affordable sedan it is offering alongside the flagship Model S sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle. To meet its Model 3 production goals, the company set up a tent at its factory in Fremont, Calif., to augment its assembly line, and Mr. Musk said he had taken to sleeping at the plant.Tesla used up more than $430 million of its remaining cash during the quarter, decreasing its cash supply to $2.2 billion. But analysts had braced for worse.\u201cI was expecting more cash burn,\u201d David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar.The output it anticipates in the third quarter \u2014 7,000 vehicles per week across its entire fleet, or 350,000 per year \u2014 \u201cshould enable Tesla to become sustainably profitable for the first time in our history,\u201d the company said in a note to investors.That would be a significant accomplishment for a company that has never reported an annual profit \u2014 its latest quarterly loss was $743 million on $4 billion in revenue \u2014 and some analysts remain skeptical. The goal is plausible but could easily be derailed by production glitches, delivery delays and softer-than-expected demand for the Model 3, said Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays.Tesla has set a base price of $35,000 for the vehicle, but it is currently taking orders only for versions that start at $49,000.\u201cWe still have fundamental concerns with the actual demand for the higher-priced variants,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Tesla\u2019s ambitions \u2014 its stated corporate mission is to \u201caccelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy\u201d \u2014 are expensive. Its dwindling financial safety net has prompted some analysts to predict that it will soon need to raise more money, but Mr. Musk strongly disputed that on Wednesday\u2019s call.\u201cWe will not be raising any equity, at any point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly could raise money, but I think we do not need to. I think it\u2019s better discipline not to.\u201dThe amount that Tesla owed its suppliers ballooned in the second quarter, which may have helped the company conserve cash. Its accounts payable, the balance-sheet item for yet-to-be-paid bills, totaled $3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of more than $425 million from the first quarter.That factory will be paid for with loans from Chinese banks and \u201clocal debt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday.\u201cThere\u2019s really no excuse for bad manners,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are reasons for it. I\u2019ve gotten no sleep and been working sort of 110-hour, 120-hour weeks. But nonetheless, there\u2019s still no excuse. \u201cMr. Musk also apologized for rambling at times on Wednesday\u2019s call.\u201cSorry if I sound a little tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working like crazy in the body shop lately.\u201dPeter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Imran Khan\u2019s First Test: Pakistan\u2019s Troubled Economy", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 The economic mess awaiting Pakistan\u2019s new leader could take the thrill out of his election victory.So what\u2019s a new prime minister to do?But the task will be made more difficult because Pakistan has sandwiched itself between two financial powers: China, from which it has borrowed heavily, and the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund, which might be its short-term savior.Pakistan has taken out billions in Chinese loans and run up a huge import tab bringing in bulldozers, train carriages and building materials as part of a Chinese-funded master plan to revamp its ports, roads and railways.Economists agree that for Pakistan\u2019s economy to develop beyond rice and textiles, its main exports, it needs new infrastructure \u2014 a lot of it.But in the meantime, the Chinese plan is pushing Pakistan\u2019s deficits to unsustainable levels. The country\u2019s debt is rising rapidly and it is running out of hard currency to pay its bills. Pakistani economists say that Mr. Khan\u2019s team will have no choice but to beg the monetary fund for a multibillion-dollar bailout, one of more than a dozen that Pakistan has received since the late 1980s.That prospect doesn\u2019t make the United States super happy.Mr. Pompeo objected to the idea of money from the fund being used by Pakistan to pay back Chinese loans.\u201cThere\u2019s no rationale for I.M.F. tax dollars \u2014 and associated with that American dollars that are part of the I.M.F. funding \u2014 for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,\u201d he said.Pakistan\u2019s economy, it seems, has become yet another battlefield between the United States and China.Despite its troubles, last year the Pakistani economy grew at more than 5 percent, faster than most Western economies.But things could change quickly if Mr. Khan\u2019s government doesn\u2019t get a rescue package soon, experts said. Among the concerns are soaring inflation, bank runs, capital flight and new import controls that would make it more difficult to buy items like computers and spare auto parts.But how he handles the cold, hard numbers of Pakistan\u2019s up-and-down economy, more than anything else, will determine his success.This past week, Mr. Khan has continued his quest to win over enough independent lawmakers and those from smaller parties to form a coalition government.That is going to be hard to deliver if Pakistan goes hat in hand to the monetary fund, as many expect. Considered the lender of last resort, it can be a stern taskmaster.In return for lending Pakistan upward of $10 billion, the fund would most likely require more fiscal discipline. That could mean Pakistan would have to reduce public spending and increase the amount of taxes it collects. Both could be a drag on growth and are not exactly the moves a populist prime minister would like to make during his first days in office.Pakistani economists say Mr. Khan faces a tightrope in trying to reconcile the fund\u2019s demands with the goals of China\u2019s infrastructure plans.\u201cThese are our two masters,\u201d said Turab Hussain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. \u201cHow do you serve both?\u201dThough China is a member of the monetary fund and one of its biggest contributors, it has a different philosophy when making its own loans. Getting paid back is not its only, or maybe even primary, goal.As it seeks new markets for its construction companies and new pathways to ship its goods, China is financing ambitious infrastructure projects across Central and South Asia. Beijing also views these projects as a way to project its power and secure allies.The goal of the monetary fund, by contrast, is to stabilize distressed economies and help countries avoid unsustainable financial imbalances. It structures loans with strict conditions to increase the chances the country will clean up its finances and be able to pay back its loans.While Chinese loans don\u2019t have the same strings attached, they still have strings. In Pakistan, much of the profit from new power plants and roads goes straight back to Chinese companies.\u201cPakistan is clearly falling to the China side,\u201d said Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist for Oxford Economics, a global research firm.Even with a bailout from the monetary fund, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing.\u201dMeher Ahmad contributed reporting from Karachi, Pakistan, and Peter Goodman from New York.Advertisement"}

And there is a strong, contrarian case that failing to appreciate the power of the current economy and markets will have serious implications that transcend finance and affect politics, too, generally helping Republicans and hurting Democrats.Consider, first, that after months of setbacks, the American stock market reached new highs repeatedly over the last few weeks. In fact, it was one of the best Augusts the stock market has had in years.That statistical snapshot depicts a stock market and an economy that are prospering. Barring an unexpected event, the simplest prediction is that we\u2019ll have more of the same. Why, then, are so many people worried that bad times are coming?In addition, the risk that the markets and economy will be derailed by a truly major political, constitutional, military or trade crisis during the Trump administration, while difficult to quantify, cannot be easily dismissed. There are many potential calamities to choose from. Any one of them could lead to an economic disaster.But timing is everything. Even if you are convinced that disaster is coming, deciding exactly when to take risk out of your portfolio matters tremendously.From a purely financial standpoint, staying on the sidelines in the current bull market has been excruciatingly costly. From the beginning of this year through Thursday, for example, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index returned 9.9 percent. If the market keeps powering ahead, and you avoid stocks entirely because you are afraid of a crash, you will fall further behind.There are political implications, too. There are already ample reasons to suspect that the current strength of the market and the economy is hurting Democrats in their efforts to regain control of Congress in the November midterm elections.Using only economic variables and data from elections over the last century, Professor Fair projects that the Democratic Party is likely to win 50.74 percent of the two-party popular vote for the House. \u201cIt is probably less than what the Democrats need to gain control of the House, although I do not have an equation that translates the vote share into House seats,\u201d he said on his website.In an interview, Professor Fair explained: \u201cI don\u2019t attempt to convert the popular vote into an actual forecast, state-by-state, with all the gerrymandering and other factors that are so important. I leave that to the political scientists.\u201dThe second quarter G.D.P. growth \u2014 a variable in his equation that captures the good feelings generated by the economy and the stock market \u2014 had the effect of subtracting about 1 critical percentage point from the Democratic share in his projection. Another strong showing in the current quarter, which he defines as an annual growth rate of at least 3.2 percent, would move the Republicans ahead in the popular vote in November, according to his algorithm.But he is the first to admit that his equations don\u2019t capture the inimical style of President Trump. For the last presidential election, for example, Professor Fair\u2019s algorithm indicated that economic as well as political factors strongly favored the Republican Party. His projections said Republicans would capture 56 percent of the popular vote, giving its presidential candidate a landslide victory. Professor Fair was off by 7.1 percentage points (though he did project a Trump victory, unlike most forecasters).\u201cHad the Republicans nominated a more mainstream candidate, they may have done much better \u2014 much closer to what the equation was predicting,\u201d he wrote. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d and combative approach to politics could reduce the Republican tally again in the midterm elections, according to Professor Fair, and swing the vote to the Democrats. \u201cI just have no way of capturing that,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s unconventional approach to the presidency is undoubtedly making it more difficult, as well, to accurately assess the trajectory of the markets and the economy themselves.Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst, made that point in a series of reports in August. Mr. Yardeni, who describes himself as \u201ca conservative-leaning fellow,\u201d said that on contentious issues, from tax cuts to trade disputes to deregulation, financial markets have been \u201cgiving quite a bit of weight to the possibility that this all will lead to less protectionism and greater global prosperity\u201d \u2014 and to a rising stock market.That\u2019s not my baseline assumption, but it could happen. What if the stock market keeps ascending, the economy continues to grow, and Mr. Trump and a flock of Republicans do their utmost to take credit for it?I\u2019m hedging my bets.An earlier version of this article misstated the return of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index from the beginning of the year through Aug. 30. It was 9.9 percent, not 15.5 percent.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

In the case of the parent company of Corona, the answer is to invest heavily in the marijuana industry.Constellation\u2019s investment in Canopy, the biggest known deal in the marijuana industry, shows just how far traditional alcoholic beverage companies are willing to go to find growth. As sales of beer fall in the United States, brewers have begun to bet that legalization of marijuana around the globe, especially the United States, will continue to build momentum and sales of cannabis products will take off.The research firm Euromonitor estimates that the American market for legal marijuana products will reach $20 billion by 2020, up from $5.4 billion in 2015.While a number of states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana in recent years, purchasing or possessing it remains a federal crime. Constellation said in November that it does not plan to sell cannabis products in the United States while it remains illegal on the federal level.But as cannabis becomes legal in more countries \u2014 in Canada, for example, recreational use will become legal on Oct. 17 \u2014 alcoholic beverage companies are trying to buy into the cannabis industry before they become disrupted by it.\u201cThe emergence of legal cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada may result in a shift of discretionary income away from our products or a change in consumer preferences away from beer.\u201dUnder the terms of Wednesday\u2019s deal, Constellation\u2019s stake in Canopy will increase to 38 percent and Constellation has the right to raise that to 50 percent.\u201cAs the leader in the total beverage alcohol space, we look forward to reaping the benefits of our cannabis investment, which we see as incremental to our core beer, wine and spirits portfolio,\u201d Robert Sands, Constellation\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a call on Wednesday.But such bold moves still face a number of hurdles. The Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions has toughened its stance on marijuana-related crimes, making the future of cannabis regulation uncertain.Then there is potential resistance from shareholders. While shares in Canopy were up nearly 30 percent as of Wednesday afternoon, at 41.68 Canadian dollars, those in Constellation were down 6 percent, at $208.15.Advertisement"}

And that figure could reach a record $1 trillion by the end of the year.The surge in buyback announcements is likely to stoke further debate about the $1.5 trillion tax cuts enacted late last year. The overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The White House and congressional Republicans said the tax bill would encourage companies to make long-term investments and would provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the American economy.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Pitch to Take Tesla Private Has Wall Street Salivating", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExecutives at banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are discussing ways a deal could be structured, angling to land the potentially prestigious assignment of taking the maker of electric cars off public markets, according to people familiar with the discussions. Bankers and lawyers on Wall Street said any deal is likely to be valued at $10 billion to $20 billion.Some of Tesla\u2019s big institutional investors \u2014 including Fidelity and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2014 also were blindsided by Mr. Musk\u2019s comments, according to people close to those companies.On Wednesday, officials from the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla officials to inquire about Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. The S.E.C. officials asked Tesla about the veracity of Mr. Musk\u2019s comments and why the company did not make an announcement via a regulatory filing. Tesla shares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday.The S.E.C. declined to comment on its inquiry. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the inquiry.A deal to take Tesla private could generate a gusher of fees for Wall Street, and bankers are scrambling to position themselves for an assignment. One way to do that is to come up with possible structures for a deal that they can pitch to Tesla and its advisers.The traditional way for a publicly traded company to go private is through a leveraged buyout, in which private equity firms or other investors purchase all of the outstanding public shares with money they have borrowed from banks or other sources.But investment bankers said on Wednesday that a leveraged buyout of Tesla \u2014 which in theory could cost as much as $70 billion if all of Tesla\u2019s shares were bought at the price of $420 a share that Mr. Musk floated \u2014 is likely a nonstarter. The company, which has never turned a profit, is burning through cash so quickly that it would be hard to find banks or bond investors willing to lend tens of billions of dollars to finance a private buyout.\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t work as it is,\u201d said Ronald A. Kahn, the head of the debt advisory and valuation practice at Chicago-based investment bank Lincoln International. \u201cWhy would anyone even give him a few billion more?\u201dThat does not mean, however, that a deal to take Tesla private is off the table.One structure being studied by banks and Tesla, according to people familiar with the matter, is a transaction that would reduce the number of shareholders to such a degree that Tesla\u2019s shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange and the company no longer would be required to make quarterly filings with the S.E.C.That would be expensive \u2014 it could cost $10 billion to $20 billion \u2014 but much less so than a full leveraged buyout, these people said.How might such a transaction work?One possibility is a maneuver called \u201cgoing dark.\u201d In this situation, Tesla could buy out many but not all of its shareholders to reduce the total number of investors who hold Tesla stock. One way to make that math work would be to persuade as many small shareholders as possible to sell their holdings.The largest shareholders of the company \u2014 including Mr. Musk, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, who collectively own about 45 percent of Tesla shares \u2014 would not need to sell their stakes under that arrangement.Tesla\u2019s shares would no longer be listed on the Nasdaq, but investors could buy or sell them on loosely regulated, over-the-counter markets that are typically the domain of small companies. Because shares on these exchanges are generally traded less heavily than those on larger public markets, it would likely be harder for investors to bet against, or short, Tesla\u2019s stock, which is one of the rationales Mr. Musk outlined on Tuesday for taking the company private.There are many potential problems with this approach. For example, institutional and individual investors are likely to object to holding Tesla shares that do not trade on mainstream national exchanges. In addition, index funds that own Tesla stock could probably not hold the shares if they were not part of benchmarks like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Going-dark transactions traditionally have been the province of tiny companies, said Gilbert J. Bradshaw, a New York lawyer who works with small companies and has written about companies going dark.\u201cI don\u2019t know of any large company that has done a voluntary deal like this,\u201d he said.Kate Kelly, Landon Thomas Jr., Matt Phillips, Emily Flitter and Neal E.

{"Headline": "As Chinese Investors Panic Over Dubious Products, Authorities Quash Protests", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn online chat groups, thousands of small investors who had put their savings into dubious digital products plotted a big protest in Beijing this week.Under pressure from local officials, one woman\u2019s family begged her not to go. After a visit from the local police, a man\u2019s boss threatened to break his contract if he participated. At airports, bus and train stations across China, scores of people making their way to Beijing were confronted by police officers who urged them \u2014 sometimes with force \u2014 to turn around.Those who did make it to the headquarters of the Chinese banking regulator in Beijing on Monday faced hundreds of police officers sent to quash it. Some were dragged off, while others were shoved into buses leaving the city.For Chinese officials, the financial is quickly becoming political.In recent years, millions of ordinary investors across China have plowed their savings into online financial products that promised big profits with little risk. But the sudden collapse of hundreds of these peer-to-peer lenders in recent months has prompted a panic, leaving many investors with little information and little way to get their money back.Frustrated investors are appealing to local and national authorities. As many see it, the government encouraged the growth of these online lenders, which were intended to connect mom-and-pop investors with borrowers. The state, these investors say, should make them whole.While the Communist Party always tries to tamp down protests to maintain social stability, the current discontent among investors belies a bigger problem for the Chinese authorities. A vast, unruly shadow banking system, where some companies have lured people with get-rich-quick schemes, has created hidden debt bombs that could leave the economy vulnerable. And it comes at a tricky time for the leadership, as China deals with signs of slowing growth, a wavering stock market and an escalating trade war with the United States.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the government,\u201d said Liu Yu, a 35-year-old shopkeeper who traveled 13 hours to Beijing on Monday to protest. He said he lost $9,000 on a lending platform called Catch the Money Cat, which notified investors on July 20 that it was having problems paying back investors and that the police in the city of Hangzhou were investigating. \u201cThere is no credibility,\u201d he added.When these digital products emerged in China a decade ago, they were pitched as an outlet for small-time borrowers, who were mostly ignored by the country\u2019s big state-run banks. For investors ponying up the money to lend, the gains were tantalizing, with some promoting returns as high as 40 or 50 percent.Lightly regulated, they attracted ordinary people \u2014 from students to grandparents \u2014 in droves through an advertising blitz on mobile apps, in movie theaters and even in residential elevators. Many products appeared to have the government\u2019s imprimatur, since they used state-owned banks to help facilitate payments and create the appearance of safer investments. Thousands of companies pulled in an estimated $194 billion from as many as four million individuals.Tang Zehui, 42, a factory worker who rode a 30-hour train to Beijing this week from southwestern Sichuan Province, said she had turned to these investments, as many others in China had, because the interest rate on regular savings accounts was too low.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good ways to manage our finances,\u201d said Ms. Tang, who said she lost about $22,000 to Leadercf.com, which is based in the southern city of Guangzhou. Ms. Tang said she trusted it because the state\u2019s support seemed to be implicit.The platforms were supposed to be matchmakers, providing a place for savers to meet borrowers who needed short-term loans. But with little regulation, many of these companies pooled together investors\u2019 money and then tried to find borrowers, creating a potential mismatch when it came time to pay out.In 2016, they were told to register with local financial regulators and comply with new rules or face being shut down. But the deadline was postponed to an unspecified date.\u201cMany people see these products as similar to saving,\u201d said Yu Baicheng, director of research at Wangdaizhijia, an independent provider of data on China\u2019s online lending industry. \u201cThey are not aware of the potential risks.\u201dA deeper worry started to set in this summer, after the government warned about the risk of losses.Almost immediately, the concerns prompted a run on the industry, as investors demanded their money back. A wave of defaults followed, with each collapse setting off the next, like a set of dominoes.Some executives shut down their businesses and fled with client money, while others suspended operations following a flood of demands from investors for repayment. Many are now under investigation.In early July, Money Pig, a company based in the southern city of Shenzhen, notified tens of thousands of investors that their accounts had been suspended. Trying to get their money back, investors gathered at a police station there a few weeks later. The group of office workers, students and businessmen wore face masks, sunglasses and white T-shirts that read, \u201cGive me my hard-earned money back!\u201d and \u201cGovernment, save our investors!\u201d\u201cI started to panic,\u201d said Chen Shuaipeng, 30, a salesman who flew to Shenzhen for the protest from the eastern city of Tianjin. He said he had $93,000 of savings in a Money Pig account before it was frozen.In Hangzhou, a group of investors who showed up to talk to officials was large enough to fill two sports stadiums, according to state news media reports. Others have gathered to protest in Nanjing and Shanghai, according to news reports and widely circulated videos online.\u201cThe entire industry is facing panic, and the speed of collapse is still accelerating,\u201d said Xue Hongyan, director of Suning Financial Research Institute, which studies the industry.Officials trying to control the situation are faced with a fast-moving crisis. In July alone, 168 lending platforms halted their operations, according to Wangdaizhijia.In recent weeks, large numbers of disgruntled investors have started to share their experiences online, updating one another about investigations. Soon, investors were talking about banding together for a big protest in Beijing on Monday.China\u2019s censors quickly took note, and soon one chat room after another was closed down. Investors switched between different chat apps to avoid censorship, using forums like QQ, WeChat, YeeCall, Qunduoduo and Telegram.Mr. Gao, who asked not to use his full name for fear that he might lose his job at a machine manufacturing company, first learned online about plans for the protest in Beijing. He had lost nearly $126,000 when the lending portal Tangxiaoseng collapsed.After Mr. Gao discussed his trip to Beijing in several WeChat groups, the local police went to his home. \u201cI said one word in our chat group, and they came to my door, asking me not to go petitioning.\u201dBut Mr. Gao said he felt emboldened to let the government know what had happened to him. Quoting China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, Mr. Gao said, \u201cif you can\u2019t see sunshine where you are, please come to Beijing.\u201dHe went to Beijing a few days before the planned protests only to discover that a dozen government officials had visited his company and urged his boss to ask him to return. When he got home on Monday, his company asked him to sign a letter promising not to engage in protests; otherwise he would be fired.\u201cI think I won\u2019t be able to keep my job,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Is Rattling China\u2019s Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn recent days, officials from the Commerce Ministry, the police and other agencies have summoned exporters to ask about plans to lay off workers or shift supply chains to other countries.State news outlets, by contrast, have sought to promote the official line, with the authorities restricting the use of the phrase \u201ctrade war.\u201dStill, policy disputes over how to bolster the economy have at times spilled into the open, with the state media sometimes coming under attack for boasting about China\u2019s economic strengths.If the trade war escalates \u2014 and Mr. Trump has shown no sign of backing down \u2014 some worry that the public\u2019s faith in the economy could be shaken, exposing the nation to much more serious problems than a drop in exports. New economic data on Tuesday showed slower growth in investment and consumer spending, and there are fears that the financial crisis in Turkey could spread.China\u2019s leaders have argued that they can outlast Mr. Trump in a trade standoff. Their authoritarian system can stifle dissent and quickly redirect resources, and they expect Washington to be gridlocked and come under pressure from voters feeling the pain of trade disruptions.But the Communist Party is vulnerable in its own way. It needs growth to justify its monopoly on power and is obsessed with preventing social instability. Mr. Xi\u2019s strongman grip may be hindering effective policymaking, as officials fail to pass on bad news, defer decisions to him and rigidly carry out his orders, for better or worse.Some inside the government have argued China should be more aggressive and put Mr. Trump on the defensive, while others have proposed concessions to address American complaints, said Chen Dingding, a professor of international relations at Jinan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.He said the debate was \u201ca healthy development\u201d because it would \u201cinform the public and make policymakers better.\u201d\u201cAll of this coming together suggests Xi\u2019s grip on authority has been loosened,\u201d said Willy Wo-lap Lam, a longtime observer of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cHe\u2019s unable to fill his function as the final arbiter who settles differences among his closest advisers.\u201dEven so, the government last month requested that dozens of research institutes and universities each submit analyses on how different regions and industrial sectors would be affected if the trade war worsened and what the impact would be on unemployment and the financial markets.China sold roughly $500 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, accounting for nearly a quarter of its total exports and about 4 percent of national economic production.If the United States imposes tariffs on all Chinese goods, even pessimistic Chinese economists contend the country might suffer only a 1 percent drop of output from lost exports. China so dominates some industries, such as smartphone manufacturing, that tariffs may not do much damage. In other industries, China might lose business to rivals like South Korea but find opportunities to export its goods to other markets.While factories that make price-sensitive electronics and other electrical products are already beginning to lose orders, China is so competitive across so many sectors that exports to the United States are actually still rising despite the relatively limited tariffs that have taken effect.The worst case for China, however, is that the trade war undermines economic confidence. The nation\u2019s housing market teeters on a mountain of debt, and low-interest loans from state banks have built overcapacity in many industries. The worry is that prolonged trade tensions could cause money to rush out of China despite currency controls and prompt much bigger financial and economic troubles.To the extent there has been finger-pointing in the establishment, the focus appears to be less on China\u2019s trade practices than on its propaganda message. Some analysts have argued that the trade war could have been avoided if Beijing had refrained from triumphalist rhetoric about China\u2019s rise as a global power. That rhetoric is closely associated with Mr. Xi himself.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of second-guessing about whether the great leader played his cards right,\u201d said Jerome Cohen, faculty director of the United States-Asia Law Institute at New York University.A group of alumni from Tsinghua, one of China\u2019s most prestigious universities, recently circulated a petition calling for the dismissal of a well-known economist on the faculty who is an ardent defender of Mr. Xi\u2019s policies. They accused the scholar, Hu Angang, of misleading the leadership by arguing last year that China had already surpassed the United States as an economic and technological power.\u201cA slowing economy and friction with the United States provides an opportunity for people to push back,\u201d said Trey McArver, a partner with Trivium China, a research consultancy in Beijing and London.As the trade dispute festers, Chinese business leaders have been circumspect, saying almost nothing about it publicly for fear of angering Beijing. It is clear, though, that they and government officials were caught off guard.\u201cOutside of government negotiators, few people took this possibility very seriously until July 6,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to the date when tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods took effect.Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the assumption that Beijing could avoid a trade war \u201csuffused every conversation\u201d he had with officials earlier this year.\u201cThey were wrong, and they are smarting over that, trying to find north and recalibrate,\u201d he said.Tensions inside the government flared into the open last month when Xu Zhong, the research director of China\u2019s central bank, published an essay rebuffing calls to bolster the economy by issuing more money. He castigated the Finance Ministry instead for a \u201cdearth of effective fiscal policies,\u201d referring to extra government spending and tax cuts.Soon afterward, the cabinet ordered more infrastructure spending to shore up growth. In the past week, the central bank has also pumped tens of billions of dollars into the economy and driven short-term interest rates down sharply.Presented with a choice of fiscal or monetary stimulus, the leadership in effect avoided making a decision by choosing both, despite the risk of exacerbating the nation\u2019s budget deficit and chronic debt problems.Mr. Xi is presumably at the center of such decision-making. He has surrounded himself with officials who built their careers in part on their ability to deal with the United States and who might be damaged politically if the trade war goes badly for China.The leadership can still divert criticism by blaming the United States. So far, it has not ratcheted up anti-American propaganda beyond the usual volume nor encouraged protests or boycotts of the sort directed at Japan in the past.Asked on a recent afternoon about the trade tensions, a worker making digital control panels at a factory in the southern city of Zhongshan paused before she replied. \u201cIf we are going to fight a trade war,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if my job may be affected, I will still support our country.\u201dAilin Tang contributed research from Shanghai, and Olivia Mitchell Ryan from Beijing.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has soared more than 320 percent since emerging from the rubble of the financial crisis in March 2009, creating more than $18 trillion in wealth.At 3,453 days, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has reached a milestone: It is the longest bull market on record if you count a 19.9 percent decline in 1990 as the start of its rival.

The duration counts all calendar days.\u00a0|\u00a0Sources: MacroTrends; Yardeni Research; Thomson Reuters\u00a0|\u00a0By Karl RussellBut the gains haven\u2019t been spread among the masses. Stock market wealth is heavily concentrated among the richest families.As the stock market surged, prices for homes \u2014 the most important source and store of wealth for the American middle class \u2014 recovered much more slowly from the Great Recession and housing bust. Incomes, too, have only recently surpassed pre-crisis levels, despite steady economic growth in recent years.\u201cThis is the decade in which wealth inequality has increased the most in U.S. history,\u201d said Moritz Schularick, a professor of economics at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics in Germany who has written about the distribution of wealth in the United States. \u201cThe driver has been the very unequal gains in the very sharp performance of the stock market relative to the sharp drop of the housing market.\u201dThere is some debate over whether this bull market technically deserves the award for the longest on record. Bull markets are defined as a stretch when the stock market rises without suffering a 20 percent drop.At issue is a market run from October 1990 to March 2000, a 3,452-day period that was preceded by a slump of 19.92 percent. Wednesday, despite the S. & P. 500\u2019s ticking down 0.04 percent, was the current upswing\u2019s 3,453rd day.Statistical sticklers, though, don\u2019t round up, in which case that earlier boom started in December 1987 \u2014 a 4,494-day stretch that would retain the crown.In terms of staying power, the current bull market has some advantages over past sprees, when a surging stock market fused financial speculation into the fabric of American life.In the 1920s, Americans dived into the market to snap up shares of a range of companies churning out the technological marvels of the day, like automobiles and radios. In the 1980s, as the country recovered from a deep recession, Wall Street enjoyed a broad boom grounded in Reagan-era deregulation and economic growth.In the 1990s, retail investors poured their money into high-flying, and in many cases profit-free, companies developing around the emerging technology known as the internet. And in the years before the financial crisis of 2008, the stock boom was coupled with the excesses of the housing market and Wall Street.\u201cYou were in some sort of a dreamy state, and it couldn\u2019t last,\u201d Allen Sinai, chief economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics and a former chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said of the dot-com era. \u201cThe taxi drivers, the elevator operators, everybody was into the stock market and buying. It was euphoria.\u201d\u201cToday the sentiment that\u2019s out there is actually more to the opposite,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s cautious. It\u2019s careful. \u2018Recession is coming tomorrow. How long can this go on?\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s a natural question to ask. Those euphoric periods ended in spectacular stock market crashes, in 1929, 1987 and the early 2000s and during the financial crisis.But the same frothiness doesn\u2019t exist now, suggesting there is little immediate risk that the market will do a 180.Price-to-earnings ratios, a proxy of investor enthusiasm, are nowhere near the peaks seen during the dot-com boom.The share of the American public that has any money in the stock market remains mired well below the level that prevailed before the financial crisis. It\u2019s concentrated among the wealthy, with the top 10 percent owning roughly 84 percent of the value of all shares owned by households, according to research by Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies the wealth structure of the American population. It was 81 percent in 2007.Even as the S. & P. 500 charges higher, retail investors continue to exit the equity markets. Between mid-March and late July, investors pulled some $40 billion out of American mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, while pumping some $80 billion into the safety of bond funds, according to Bespoke Investment Group, a stock market research firm.\u201cFor most of this bull market, the individual investor has largely sat out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, a co-founder of Bespoke. \u201cCompared to the 1990s, when individual investors were actively looking for stock ideas, today there\u2019s a lot less of that.\u201dAs many people sit on the sidelines, the divergence between the wealthy and the rest of the country has widened. In 2016, the last year with solid data, the wealth of the median American household \u2014 which is heavily concentrated in the home itself \u2014 was 34 percent below where it was just before the Great Recession, according to research from Mr. Wolff.That\u2019s not to say the average American is in an especially sour mood. Consumers in the United States are feeling good at the moment \u2014 and for good reason. At 3.9 percent, unemployment is near an 18-year low. The economy grew at an annual pace of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest clip since 2014.And that economic strength \u2014 along with the deep cuts in corporate tax rates that President Trump signed into law in late 2017 \u2014 has translated into gushers of profits for large American companies. Second-quarter profits for companies in the S. & P. 500 are up roughly 25 percent compared with a year earlier, after a similar rise in the first quarter.The boom in earnings has helped the markets fend off various economic and geopolitical concerns.After peaking in late January, stocks plummeted by more than 10 percent in the following weeks on worries that the Federal Reserve would begin to raise interest rates at a faster cadence than previously expected, choking off growth. Then in March, the eruption of the trade war sent shares sharply lower again.More recently, the nose-dive of the Turkish lira and signs of weakness in the Chinese economy raised the prospect that problems in emerging markets could hamper global growth.But for many seasoned stock market observers, the existence of continuing worries about whether the bull market can last is a strong piece of evidence that it can.According to this line of thinking, the moment to worry is when there is broad agreement that the market can only go higher. That would suggest there is little fresh money available to drive stocks to new heights.\u201cWhen the bears give up, that\u2019s when I would start to worry,\u201d said Laszlo Birinyi, who started analyzing the stock market for the storied New York investment firm Salomon Brothers in 1976, before founding his own stock market research firm, Birinyi Associates. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the length the current bull market. It is nearly 10 years, not 10 years. The article also referred imprecisely to the share of stocks owned by the wealthiest 10 percent of households in the United States. It is 84 percent of the value of shares owned by households, not 84 percent of all outstanding shares.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.&P. Closes at a Record, as Profits Defy Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the year, the stock market has been on the ropes. Trade wars have erupted, the Federal Reserve raised rates, emerging market currencies collapsed, and major technology firms faced regulatory scrutiny \u2014 and, in the case of Amazon, presidential broadsides via messages on Twitter. Investors quailed at times, sending stocks down by as much as 10 percent.But the nine-year-old bull market never completely crumbled. By April, stocks had started a fresh climb. And after a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at a record high of 2,874.69 points, reflecting investor faith in a single fundamental fact: Big American companies are making lots of money.\u201cWe\u2019ve had record earnings growth, we\u2019ve had record numbers of earnings and sales beats,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBasically the fundamentals couldn\u2019t look better.\u201dBecause owners of stock are entitled to a share of the money a company makes, corporate profits are a key ingredient of stock market rallies. And profits for companies in the S. &P. 500 were up roughly 25 percent in the second quarter, after a surge of 27 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.About 80 percent of companies reported results that were better than Wall Street analysts expected. (In a typical quarter, some 64 percent of companies outperform the analysts\u2019 predictions.) This year\u2019s crop of quarterly earnings has been the best since 2010, when the American economy was just emerging from the recession that ended the previous year, making big leaps in annual profit growth much easier.The current rosy profit picture shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The Trump administration\u2019s deep tax cuts that went into effect in January reduced corporate tax expenses sharply and raised profitability almost automatically. But other metrics \u2014 such as sales growing at an annual rate of more than 9 percent in the second quarter \u2014 suggest that corporate America is riding a robust American economy. The unemployment rate is near 18-year lows. Gross domestic product expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent-plus growth world, and that\u2019s because the fundamentals underlying consumer spending, underlying business spending, underlying our manufacturing sector are in superb shape,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm.Since the bulk of companies began reporting their quarterly results in July, that upward economic pressure has erupted in gushers of profits, especially at some of the giant technology-centered firms that have been hugely influential in determining how the stock markets move.Amazon reported a $2.53 billion quarterly profit, its largest ever. Microsoft notched $8.87 billion in earnings, beating estimates. Apple\u2019s quarterly profit jumped 32 percent to $11.52 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and pushing the company\u2019s market value above $1 trillion, a milestone that no American company had ever reached before.The earnings boom has also reached far beyond tech. Earnings at financial firms jumped more than 27 percent. Quarterly profits at industrial companies rose 20 percent.Even the retail sector, which has been squeezed by online competition and soft prices in recent years, is enjoying a respite. Home Depot raised earnings and sales targets for the year. Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, including a 40 percent rise in online sales in the United States. And Target said quarterly sales at stores it had previously opened rose at the fastest pace in 13 years, sending its stock to a record high.There could be more market gains to come. From the bargain hunter\u2019s perspective, the combination of blockbuster profits and a prolonged stock market soft patch for much of the year, means that stocks \u2014 compared to their earnings \u2014 are significantly cheaper than they were earlier this year.A key valuation measure, the price of the S. & P. 500 index compared with analyst estimates for corporate earnings over the next 12 months, has fallen this year. Some observers see that as a positive sign, indicating that the rising market over the last few months has been fueled by solid earnings growth, rather than wild optimism by stock market investors.On the other hand, the stock market is by no means dirt cheap, as it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And there are plenty of risks that could still derail the recent rally, from disorderly decline of some emerging markets, such as Turkey, to the continuing fallout from trade tensions between the United States and other large economies.\u201cThe big talk on the street is obviously trade and China,\u201d said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of United States equity strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities.On the other hand, Mr. Lakos-Bujas thinks that a resolution of the trade fight between the world\u2019s two largest economies, could generate a pop in the stock market, by removing a risky overhang clouding an otherwise bright picture. The American economy, he says, is in something of a sweet spot, with strong growth, low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits.\u201cIn this kind of environment, generally, risk assets such as equities, they tend to do well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Grew Even Faster in Truman\u2019s Presidency. So What?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewBased solely on a few headline numbers, the American economy looks good. But it would be a mistake to read too much into the data \u2014 or to give too much credit to President Trump.In fact, the most spectacular economic growth since World War II occurred nearly 70 years ago, when Harry Truman was president. But Truman didn\u2019t cause it, and it wasn\u2019t particularly good news.First, let\u2019s look at where we find ourselves now. Avid supporters of Mr. Trump attribute good economic tidings to him. His policies \u2014 tax cuts, curtailment of immigration, reduction in regulations \u2014 and confidence-building talk are seen as driving faster economic growth.But that is largely a misreading of the way modern economies work. They have a tendency to alternate between booms and recessions for reasons that are imperfectly understood but involve changing popular narratives, the contagion of ideas and emotions, and circumstances that are mostly outside a president\u2019s control.These numbers may look like evidence of a fundamental transformation, but that view overstates the significance of such statistics.The numbers are actually driven by changes in individual day-to-day economic decisions \u2014 many of them so small that people can\u2019t say why they made them. In the case of the stock market, shareholders are claimants on corporate income and fluctuations in sales can have an amplified effect on share prices.That 4.1 percent G.D.P. growth is hardly unusual: We have had 101 quarters of growth at least this great since quarterly G.D.P. enumeration started in 1947. These high-growth quarters were interspersed among sporadic quarters of negative growth, usually recessions.To understand subtle economic changes, it helps to look at the biggest ones. The fastest annual G.D.P. growth since quarterly numbers began occurred over the period ending in the fourth quarter of 1950, when Truman was president. It was 13.4 percent, more than three times bigger than the 4.1 percent of the last quarter.We ought to be able to understand what caused that colossal Truman boom. After all, there has been plenty of time to consider it.There are many explanations, but we don\u2019t really know the truth.We know for sure that a tax cut didn\u2019t spur growth back then: Personal income tax rates rose slightly in 1950. And government spending didn\u2019t do it: Total government expenditure in 1950 was still near a postwar low. Nor did new protective tariffs cause the surge. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which went into effect in 1948, was in the process of reducing tariffs, not raising them.In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that the fundamental cause of the 1950 boom was bad news, not good. Recall that on, Aug. 29, 1949, the Soviet Union detonated its first atom bomb, ending the brief nuclear monopoly of the United States.For several reasons, the United States in 1950 was at the peak of its biggest housing construction boom since 1929. It still counts as the peak, ranking even higher, as a fraction of G.D.P., than the boom just before the 2007 financial crisis.People feared re-imposition of wartime constraints on home building, too. Many consumers felt it might be now or never if you wanted a new home.So, yes, 1950 had spectacular growth, but it was not a good year.Now, in 2018, there are also some fearful narratives spreading through the country, though they seem less likely to motivate people to spend. The nuclear war scare of 2018 has not come close to the levels of 1950. And the mood of fear lingering from the experience of World War II is practically forgotten now.Yet it seems likely that people in many countries may be accelerating their purchases \u2014 of soybeans, steel and many other commodities \u2014 fearing future government intervention in the form of a trade war. Surely some consumers, fearing that if they don\u2019t buy a house or car now they may be faced with higher interest rates imposed by central banks, are making purchases earlier than they otherwise would have.On a more positive note, the impulse to buy a home or a new car today could be subtly strengthening because of the demonstration effect of Mr. Trump, who models ostentatious living. Most of us can\u2019t keep up with the Trumps, but he may be inducing some of us to be more focused on keeping up with the Joneses.We have to be careful not to give too much credence to interpretations of the economy\u2019s strength offered by the president, who focuses on his policies and ignores many other kinds of factors. Something \u2014 probably a variety of circumstances, narratives and emotions \u2014 has pushed consumption spending up a smidgen more than usual. That, from the long perspective of history, is really no big deal.In fact, there could soon be a reversal of this strong-economy story, a sudden recession. But, if so, it won\u2019t disprove Mr. Trump\u2019s claims any more than the high growth of the second quarter proved him right.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Tesla Investor Wants It to Stay Public", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has insisted that taking Tesla private would allow the company to achieve its potential.On Thursday, one Tesla investor took issue with Mr. Musk\u2019s argument.Ms. Wood \u2014 whose firm owned a roughly 0.26 percent stake in Tesla as of June 30, according to public filings \u2014 argued in her letter that the public markets would better support Tesla\u2019s growth over the long term.From her letter:\u201cIf you do not take Tesla private, you will be surprised and gratified at investor reaction once they realize and understand the scope and ramifications of your long-term vision and strategies. With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

On Tuesday, he may have outdone himself.In a terse and cryptic Twitter post, he declared that he was ready to take Tesla private. The stock market that made his company worth over $60 billion wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFunding secured.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock was already up sharply on a report that Saudi Arabia was taking a sizable stake in the company. But investors were left to puzzle out the implications of Mr. Musk\u2019s proposition, its relationship to the Saudi report, and even the authenticity of the tweet. And so, starting at 12:48 p.m., the market that Mr. Musk threatened to forsake went into a frenzy.At 2:08 p.m., with shares up more than 7 percent for the day, trading was halted pending news \u2014 news that finally came shortly before 3:30.\u201cI fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Musk said that no final decision had yet been made about taking the company private, and that any such proposal would have to be approved by shareholders.He outlined a plan under which shareholders could be bought out for $420 a share \u2014 a 20 percent premium over the stock price after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call last week \u2014 or they could remain as private shareholders.\u201cThis has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI own about 20 percent of the company now and don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is complete.\u201dTesla trading resumed 15 minutes before the end of the trading session, and the shares added to their gains, closing at $379.57, up 11 percent.Mr. Musk did not elaborate on any sources of financing to take Tesla private. The announcement followed a report that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had acquired a stake in the company.A person briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the Saudi fund had taken a stake of less than 5 percent.The Financial Times reported that the shares had been acquired for the fund in the secondary market with the help of JPMorgan Chase. The bank declined to comment.If the transaction got done at $420 per share, Tesla would be valued at just over $70 billion, making it the biggest deal in which a company is taken private.Although Tesla has become the most valuable American car company, it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. And its chief executive, a 47-year-old native of South Africa, has come under increasing pressure as he has scrambled to increase production of the Model 3, a midsize sedan that he is counting on to drive up revenue and enable the company to become profitable.Still, this is not the way multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts are typically announced. Companies would normally line up banks, private equity firms or other deep-pocketed investors to agree in advance to provide money to finance the purchase of shares.Officials representing a number of large banks and investment funds said on Tuesday that they had not talked with Tesla about financing a buyout, although it is possible the company had secured funding from other sources.Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Tuesday \u2014 mentioning the specific price of a possible buyout and declaring that Tesla had already arranged funding \u2014 were virtually guaranteed to send the shares flying. Still, while it was unusual for a chief executive to make a market-moving announcement on Twitter, there is nothing improper about it on its face.But the S.E.C. has also advised that intentional releases of market-moving information on social media platforms or websites must be accompanied by a simultaneous release to the broader public. The delay between Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet and Tesla\u2019s corporate announcement could be of interest to the S.E.C., said Michael Liftik, a former deputy chief of staff at the commission who is now a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\u201cSimultaneously really means simultaneously,\u201d he said. And he said a tweet would be held to the same standard of factuality as a news release.Others pointed out that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet could have opened his company up to legal exposure from investors with financial incentives to sue.\u201cWhat they have to show is there was a material misstatement, in these loose statements, by Mr. Musk,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance. Mr. Coffee said the statement \u201cfunding secured\u201d could be a legal gray area where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys see an opportunity to make a case.\u201cThat\u2019s a very broad statement about what is still an extraordinarily amorphous transaction,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.The S.E.C. had no comment, and Tesla would not comment beyond what was in Mr. Musk\u2019s statement to employees.Being a public company and reporting earnings every three months \u201cputs enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\u201d he said. Having its stock traded publicly also means that Tesla can attract short-sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla \u2014 whom he described as \u201cpeople who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dTesla has attracted more so-called short-sellers than any other publicly traded company, in part because many investors doubt the company can achieve the lofty targets that Mr. Musk has set.Tesla\u2019s short-sellers on Tuesday racked up about $1.5 billion in losses, according to S3 Analytics, a technology and research firm. That brings their losses so far this year to $3 billion.Going private \u201cwould definitely benefit Elon Musk and the way he\u2019d like to run the company,\u201d said Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t like the intrusion he gets as a public company.\u201dHe has also objected to analysts\u2019 conclusions that the company may have to raise additional capital from investors later this year as it continues to post losses and use up hundreds of millions of dollars in cash each quarter.Mr. Levy, the analyst, said that even if Tesla went private, it would probably still need to borrow to pursue its plans for new models and new factories. \u201cThe question is whether they will have the same investor support,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a private company with a lot of debt, the risk goes up.\u201dHe characterized Mr. Musk\u2019s management style as \u201cunique.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of unexpected surprises,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the ambitions of SpaceX, a company run by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.

So What\u2019s the Catch?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvesting just became even cheaper \u2014 free, actually.But when companies start to dangle free offers, one can\u2019t help but ask: What\u2019s the catch?It\u2019s simple, analysts said. If Fidelity can lure investors in with a promise of no fees, it is in a position to sell other products and services \u2014 a money-market account, say, or financial advice \u2014 that offer fatter profit margins. And given its size, the company can afford to sell no-fee funds below cost.\u201cThey\u2019re bait,\u201d Jeffrey Ptak, an analyst with Morningstar, said of the new funds.\u201cIt is not a rebate, it is not temporary, it is not a promotional offer,\u201d Kathy Murphy, president of Fidelity\u2019s personal investing business, said. \u201cIt is permanent.\u201dBeyond the free funds, Fidelity has introduced other changes that make it easier and cheaper to invest. It has eliminated its minimum investment requirements for opening brokerage accounts (previously $2,500), 529 college savings plans and the vast majority of its indexed mutual funds when bought through Fidelity.The company has also cut prices on nearly two dozen existing stock and bond index funds, so that all investors now have access to its lowest-priced class of fund shares. For people already invested in these funds, according to Fidelity, that translates to a reduction of roughly 35 percent, with some funds costing as little as 0.015 percent of assets, or a penny and a half for every $100 invested.The average index fund costs 0.52 percent of assets, compared with .87 percent of assets for actively managed mutual funds, according to a Morningstar analysis, which excluded funds that carry sales charges in addition to the underlying cost of the investment.The company crows on its website that its index funds are now cheaper than Vanguard\u2019s \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s no match for Fidelity in index investing \u2014 not even Vanguard.\u201d Vanguard, the indexing pioneer, has long been heralded as the lowest-cost provider, and Morningstar says that, over all, it still holds the crown when comparing its universe of actively managed and index funds with Fidelity\u2019s total collection of funds.But Fidelity\u2019s index funds are now a few pennies cheaper than Vanguard\u2019s when looking at only passive investments, according to a Morningstar analysis: Investors are paying 0.04 percent of assets on average at Fidelity versus 0.07 at Vanguard.Whether others will try to match Fidelity\u2019s no-fee funds is unclear. The company\u2019s move does not only put pressure on other index-fund providers, analysts said. It also has implications for actively managed funds, which may need to do even more to justify their much higher fees.A Schwab spokeswoman declined to say whether the firm would make further changes to its prices. \u201cAny time costs go down, investors win,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement. She said Schwab was \u201claser focused\u201d on straightforward, low-cost products that could be sold broadly to many investors \u201cso we can continue to pass the benefits of our scale\u201d to them.Vanguard, whose mutual fund shareholders effectively own the company, said it was structured to lower the cost and complexity of investing in all of its funds, indexed and actively managed, for all of its customers.\u201cThis is now a game of inches, with firms trying to gain supremacy one basis point at a time,\u201d Mr. Ptak of Morningstar said.The difference can be counted in pennies. Fidelity\u2019s free domestic fund, for example, competes with Schwab\u2019s Total Stock Market Index fund, which charges just 0.03 percent of assets, or 3 cents for every $100 invested; Vanguard\u2019s Total Stock Market Fund, which, depending on the amount invested, ranges from 0.02 percent of assets, or 2 cents per $100, to 0.14 percent of assets.\u201cIf you examine the recent history, we\u2019ve had Schwab, Vanguard and Fidelity all make moves to try to gain an edge by removing fees and barriers,\u201d Mr. Ptak added. \u201cWe\u2019re now at a point of diminishing returns, so these firms will have to find other ways to differentiate, but it\u2019s shaping up as a slugfest, with these firms trading blows.\u201dFor now, consumers appear to be winning that fight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3 Tax Breaks That May Be Better in the Long Run", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersTalk to a tax expert long enough and you\u2019re likely to hear some variant on this phrase: Don\u2019t let the tail wag the dog.It makes sense. Focus too much on the details, and you may lose sight of the big picture. When it comes to taxes \u2014 the tail in this case \u2014 a short-term tax benefit may not be the best investment or lifestyle decision.The tax overhaul that was rushed through the Republican-controlled Congress and enacted last year gave taxpayers little time to grasp its implications. As the new law now becomes understood, accountants and tax advisers say the tail is wagging like an excited Labrador hovering over a T-bone steak. And advisers say their job is to calm the dog before he does something he will regret.\u201cYou have to be careful making permanent decisions based on a temporary law,\u201d said Mitchell Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies at U.S. Trust. \u201cThis tax law is a temporary provision because most of the individual tax provisions sunset at the end of 2025.\u201dIn many cases, once these tax-driven decisions are made, they either cannot be undone or they will cost people more than they saved to undo them. And it is not limited to the very wealthy; middle- and upper-middle-class earners could fall into this trap.Short-term benefits may look desirable, but here are three tax breaks that may be better in the long run.For the very wealthy, a key question is whether to make substantial gifts to heirs now or to leave it to them later in a will. It has become a big issue because the estate and gift tax exemption is now $11 million per person or $22 million for a couple \u2014 more than double what it was last year.The advantage of giving it away now is that the gift can grow in an heir\u2019s estate, with only capital gains tax to worry about.But there is a downside. Gifts made through an estate receive what is called a step-up in basis, which values the securities on the date of the giver\u2019s death. When the giver is alive, however, gifts are transferred with what is called the original basis, or purchase price; when sold, the recipient will have to pay tax on the capital gains tax stretching back to whenever the investment was originally made.However, the math for making a large gift now is compelling, said Amanda DiChello, a partner at Cozen O\u2019Connor\u2019s private client services group, who ran a comparison for The New York Times.A person worth $25 million who made a $10 million gift today and lived another 10 years would save $4 million in taxes, assuming a 5 percent growth rate. If those assets were then sold, and capital gains were paid, the person would still save about $3 million. If that person lived another 20 years, the tax savings would only increase.But basing such a large choice on taxes alone is not always easy to stomach. After all, $10 million is a large gift for anyone.Adding to the uncertainty is the fear that such a high estate-tax exemption \u2014 which is indexed to inflation, so it will keep growing \u2014 will not be renewed in 2025, or will be repealed sooner by the next administration.\u201cClients with $20 million to $30 million are asking, \u2018What do we do? We can\u2019t afford to give it all away,\u2019\u201d Ms. DiChello said. \u201cBut there could be a backlash. Would a new administration come and take the exemption down?\u201dThat\u2019s the big unknown. And the cost could be millions of dollars that goes to pay taxes, not to heirs.Robert M. Finkel, a co-chairman of the tax practice group at the law firm Moritt Hock & Hamroff and a former senior trial lawyer at the Internal Revenue Service, said he had found himself increasingly popular at cocktail parties. People want to divine what he thinks is likely to happen with the tax law, but they also want to know how to handle situations with heirs when they no longer can hide behind a lower gift exemption.\u201cFor many years the low gift-tax exemption was the reason parents said they couldn\u2019t give any more,\u201d Mr. Finkel said. \u201cNow, the talk around the dinner table from children is, \u2018Geez, why don\u2019t you make the gift now?\u2019\u201dOne answer is for parents to have an in-depth conversation with their children. Another, though, is to structure a transfer that allows parents to retain control of the asset during their life but still secure the deduction.One way to achieve this is to put property worth $11 million, like a house, into a sophisticated arrangement called a qualified personal residence trust. Mr. Drossman said the parents could continue living in the home with provisions that the gift would be made to their heirs on their death.If structured properly, the donor is considered to have made the gift at the higher amount, even if the exemption drops back to $5 million.It\u2019s complicated, but it\u2019s also an example of uncertain tax policy driving people to make decisions they may not otherwise make.Politics aside, there is a practical implication to this. In the long term, indexing an investment\u2019s purchase price to inflation could also reduce the amount of a loss a taxpayer could claim as a deduction. Not all investments rise. And the ones that lose money can be carried forward on tax returns until future gains soak them up.In the short term, with the stock market continuing to rise, the idea of increasing that basis could be an inducement to not sell highly appreciated stock now.\u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned that the administration floated this idea to create a kind of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Finkel said. \u201cWe have a market at near-record level. Why not create uncertainty so people don\u2019t take profits off the table?\u201dSuch thinking is likely to apply to investors in stocks with outsize gains \u2014 like someone who bought Apple years ago. The standard recommendation from any financial adviser is to rebalance your portfolio, selling winners to maintain the weight in your financial plan.The increase in the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals has saved most American taxpayers from having to itemize their deductions.Swept up in this, though, are affluent taxpayers who are charitably inclined. A $5,000 contribution to charity may no longer count beyond the deduction that anyone gets, for being charitable or not.Alexander L. Reid, partner at the law firm Morgan Lewis, where he focuses on nonprofit organizations, said one strategy for the person who regularly gives $5,000 a year would be to front-load five years of donations into a donor-advised fund.There are two advantages to this. The $25,000 total donation would get the taxpayer over the $12,000 hurdle, allowing the person to claim a deduction while still parceling out the donations over five years.Additionally, if the person made the gift by transferring $25,000 of highly appreciated stock, there would be no tax on the capital gains. \u201cIt may be a good time to lock in the gains and bunch your charitable giving,\u201d Mr. Reid said.These tax changes seem to be affecting the most taxpayers, but confusion abounds throughout the new tax code. And the government is still trying to clear things up.\u201cThe fact is, no one knows what is going to happen,\u201d Mr. Finkel said. \u201cIn fact, no one thought this would happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Slashes Spending, and May Add to Its Troubles", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs questions swirl about whether Tesla will go private \u2014 and the well-being of its chief executive, Elon Musk \u2014 one crucial factor looms large over the fate of the electric car company: Tesla\u2019s own financial health.The company has undertaken drastic measures as it seeks profitability, cutting costs and even erecting a tent-covered third assembly line at its manufacturing plant. But many of those tactics may not be sustainable for long, and some could even hurt the company down the road.The state of Tesla\u2019s balance sheet, and particularly its near-term cash position, are important to the company\u2019s future, perhaps even more so since Mr. Musk\u2019s surprise declaration on Aug. 7 that he would explore taking the company private.\u201cTesla is going to be profitable and cash flow positive,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cFrom a Tesla standpoint, I think it is a good place.\u201dHis remarks echo what he said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, when he predicted the company would turn a profit in the next quarter.Mr. Musk is under intense pressure from Wall Street to make good on that promise, and Tesla has been plagued by manufacturing issues while ramping up production of its mass-market Model 3.Meanwhile, short-sellers continue to target the stock, injecting a destabilizing element to the company\u2019s share price. Good financial results would be bad news for the hedge funds betting Tesla will fail, and serve as vindication for Mr. Musk.And Tesla\u2019s financial position will have a significant impact on any potential effort to take Tesla private. Investors evaluating a potential take-private deal will be assessing not only Tesla\u2019s long-term prospects, but its current cash on hand and debts.To achieve that profitability, Tesla is scrambling to slash spending in almost all areas of it operations.In June, it announced it would lay off about 3,500 employees, about 9 percent of its work force, in a cost-cutting move. It has approached some suppliers about refunding some money Tesla has paid for projects that are still underway.Tesla has said it is working to reduce costs by delivering completed vehicles faster. At the end of second quarter, it held inventory valued at $579 million, a figure the company said was \u201ca substantial increase\u201d from previous quarters.And Tesla has even more drastic cost cutting plans in store. It has said it plans to cut capital expenditures by a fourth this year \u2014 to about $2.5 billion from $3.4 billion in 2017.\u201cThere are a lot of levers they are pulling to be cash-flow neutral or positive in the second half, but there\u2019s trade-offs,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein.Tesla declined to comment for this story.But while analysts say Tesla may very well achieve profitability soon, the spending cuts necessary to do so could be costly, delaying the introduction of new models that could help boost revenues.\u201cThose are not necessarily the best for the long-term growth of the company,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cCutting back on capex is not sustainable,\u201d he said, referring to capital expenditures. \u201cCutting inventories is not sustainable.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Tesla\u2019s push to conserve cash will soon be complicated by two bond payments that come due in the next several months.It is scheduled to pay off a $230 million convertible bond in November, and a payment of $920 million on a second convertible bond is due next February. Tesla could pay the second bond in stock instead of cash, if its share price is above $360. It has traded above that level in recent weeks, but on Friday it closed at $305.50.Tesla has slipped into financial difficulties, in part because of how much cash it has been using up \u2014 nearly $1 billion every three months. It ended the second quarter with $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the beginning of the year.The company\u2019s precarious cash position prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service to downgrade Tesla\u2019s debt in March, citing \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201dMr. Musk has said no such capital raise would be necessary, because Tesla will soon be profitable. But Bruce Clark of Moody\u2019s said he still expected the company may have to tap the capital markets.\u201cThe company has made some important progress with the Model 3 production and has reduced capital expenditures, but I still think they are going to need additional capital,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as tight as it had been, but they have to stay on the track they\u2019ve been on recently.\u201dMr. Musk has said that the production issues that bedeviled Tesla earlier this year are being resolved.Those gains have required round-the-clock production, however, which may not be possible for Tesla to sustain. Other automakers have found 24-hour production is untenable in the long run because workers become burned out and machinery tends to break down more frequently.To deal with the investigation, the Tesla board and the special committee of the board evaluating a potential buyout, have each retained law firms. Additionally, the special committee has retained a crisis communications firm, and other public relations firms are angling for assignments.Those legal fees will add up, and the threat of lengthy legal proceedings could also complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to raise more cash should it need to.Early Sunday morning, Mr. Musk took to Twitter and reminded his followers just how hard he is working as he struggles to make Tesla profitable.Responding to a post from Arianna Huffington, the Huffington Post founder and member of Uber\u2019s board of directors, who suggested he take a vacation and focus on his physical and mental health, Mr. Musk said: \u201cI just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Steps to Take if the Market Drop Has You Thinking of Unloading Stocks", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated: Oct. 24.It may be time for a gut check.A decade-long bull market in stocks is hitting a difficult patch. On Wednesday, just weeks after stocks hit a new high, the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index erased all its gains for 2018.For many investors, that raises a reasonable question: Should I be taking some money off the table?The answer is the same as it always has been: If you have a well-constructed financial strategy, and your personal circumstances have not really changed since you put it in place, there is probably no reason to do anything at all.If, however, you think you will be tempted to unload a chunk of your stocks now that the market has tumbled sharply, then a new plan or tweaks to the one you already have could make sense.During its last big downturn, in 2008 and 2009, the stock market plummeted roughly 50 percent. An investment portfolio evenly divided between stocks and bonds would have lost nearly 29 percent of its value in that time, but it would have taken only about a year to recover, according to an analysis by Vanguard. A portfolio that was 100 percent stocks \u2014 and lost about 55 percent \u2014 would have taken about three years to recoup its losses.A portfolio of 100 percent stocks would have recovered its value about three years after the market hit bottom in 2009. A portfolio that was half stocks and half bonds would have recovered after about only a year.Portfolio value indexed to 100 as of market peak250+129%+97%200Portfolio of:50% stocks50% bonds150PEAK10/09/07100100% stocks50BOTTOM3/9/090\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Portfolio value indexed to 100 as of market peak250+129%200+97%Portfolio of:50% stocks50% bonds150PEAK10/09/07100100% stocks50BOTTOM3/9/090\u201908\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918Note: 100% Stock represented by S.&P. 500 Index and 50% Stock/Bond represented by 50% S.&P. 500 and 50% Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. Data as of July 31, 2018.By The New York Times | Source: Vanguard Investment Strategy GroupStill, even the most rational investors among us \u2014 particularly those who need to tap into their portfolio within the next few years, for college tuition, buying a home or retirement \u2014 may feel a need to satisfy that itch to do something now that the market, after reaching such a lofty level, has begun to tumble.But what? Here are five ideas:Your tolerance for risky investments, including stocks, should be built into your overall approach from the start. But circumstances and needs can shift over time. So it is worth considering whether your tolerance has changed, not with respect to the perceived level of the market itself, but in terms of what sort of drop you could tolerate, regardless of current market conditions. How did you feel during the market plunge 10 years ago? How did you react?Responsible financial advisers have a mantra: Don\u2019t take on more risk than is necessary to reach your goals, whether it is the amount of money you think you need for retirement or for your child\u2019s tuition.That might mean slightly scaling back the slice of a portfolio allocated to stocks based on individual circumstances. The percentage will not be the same for everyone, and it is a delicate balance: You do not, for example, want to become invested too conservatively as you approach retirement; your portfolio might need to last three decades or more. That means you will need enough stocks to help your money grow and keep pace with inflation.If you have an imminent need for cash but your money is tied up in stocks, now might be a good time to shift into something conservative, particularly if the need is likely to arise in five years or less. If you expect to buy a home in that time, you will need all that money at once. If you are paying a tuition bill, you will probably only need a quarter of your savings a year over four years.\u201cThe more concentrated the outflow, the more important it is not to have your money at risk to satisfy near-term goals,\u201d Mr. Bellfy said.Retirees and people on the cusp of retirement have the most to lose if the markets come tumbling down. In such circumstances, keeping a year\u2019s worth of basic living expenses in cash may be helpful as a long-term strategy. It can keep retirees from locking in losses by having to sell investments when they are down.\u201cThis helps clients mentally as they know that their spending for the next six to nine months is safe in cash no matter what happens to the market,\u201d he said.If a financial professional or an automatic service is not already performing regular maintenance on your portfolio, now may be a good time to do it yourself. As markets rise and fall, the mix of investments you originally put into place can take a different shape. A portfolio that was supposed to be composed of 50 percent stocks may have risen to 55 percent over time.An earlier version of this article misstated the effect of the drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index on Wednesday. The decline erased the index\u2019s gains for 2018, not its losses.Advertisement"}

Powell left us hanging.The chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a much-anticipated speech on Friday, spent most of his time explaining the challenges facing the central bank as it conducts its monetary policy. Mr. Powell emphasized the difficulties of understanding America\u2019s changing economy and argued for a flexible approach.But in concentrating on why macroeconomic forecasting is hard, Mr. Powell may have passed up a high-profile opportunity to drill down on some of the forces that could have a real bearing on the economy in the coming months \u2014 and that have bedeviled Fed policymakers in the past. These include a stock market that hit an all-time high on Friday.Enticingly, Mr. Powell did refer in passing to the challenge posed by frothy financial markets. When inflation is low, it can make sense to keep monetary policy relatively loose, but doing so can drive stock and bond prices higher. \u201cWhatever the cause, in the run-up to the past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather than in inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell probably isn\u2019t worried about the markets.

While some asset prices are high by historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage.\u201dHis view may be correct, but Mr. Powell could explain how he arrived at that conclusion. And if stocks keep going up, and debt markets become more speculative, the Fed arguably owes it to the public to be more forthcoming.No one wants dogma from central bankers, but Hamlet-like equivocation is of limited use. Real-world specifics are always appreciated from those steering the economy. Mr. Powell still has plenty of time to provide fresh thoughts on the economy the public lives and works in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Elon Musk\u2019s World, Brakes Are for Cars, Not C.E.O.s", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was up early on Saturday. He departed Los Angeles, where he runs SpaceX, his private rocket venture, and flew north in his white Gulfstream jet. Stopping in Silicon Valley, he picked up two engineers from Tesla, his electric-car company. They flew on to Reno, Nev., where they spent the day at Tesla\u2019s battery plant, the Gigafactory.It might have been just another workday for Mr. Musk \u2014 a multistate jaunt to personally fix a drive-unit production line. But this was no ordinary morning. He was a brief night\u2019s sleep removed from one of his most consequential decisions: scrapping his plan to take Tesla private.\u201cThe reason Elon seems to attract drama is that he is so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him,\u201d said Kimbal Musk, Mr. Musk\u2019s younger brother and a Tesla board member. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to do it differently. It\u2019s just who he is.\u201dMr. Musk, a brilliant but erratic billionaire, is the animating force behind Tesla, responsible for everything from its push into renewable energy to the design of the air vents in its newest electric car. His singular role gives him extraordinary influence over the fate of Tesla, its more than 40,000 employees and its investors.Associates, including several people inside the company interviewed over the past week, portray him as a workaholic who zeroes in on the smallest details. His deep involvement suggests that the company can\u2019t do without him. Yet these days, it\u2019s not always clear that he knows what\u2019s best for Tesla.And at the office, he is hardly a typical chief executive. Racing to resolve critical production issues, he can often be found on the factory floor, working to fix robots. At night, he sometimes sleeps under his desk. All the while, he has been confronting an exodus of senior employees, preparing to be interviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was working with Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take Tesla private \u2014 until he wasn\u2019t.James Anderson, a partner at the asset management firm Baillie Gifford, Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder after Mr. Musk, said he still had faith in the 47-year-old chief executive, calling him a \u201cvisionary leader\u201d who had unmatched technical expertise and remained \u201cobsessive about the details.\u201dYet Mr. Anderson said he had grown increasingly worried about Mr. Musk, believing that his volatile personal life and intense work ethic were taking a steep toll. \u201cHe is so demanding, so driven by the imperative to do something good for the world,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cYou could always see something like this happening.\u201dAt 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 18, three robots in the paint shop at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., started malfunctioning. The incident forced a production halt on the Model 3, the key to the company\u2019s future.Made aware of the stoppage, Mr. Musk went to the factory and worked into the night. The problem was resolved, but Tesla reached a troubling conclusion: The robots had been infected with malware in an act of industrial sabotage. And though they could not prove it and did not level any specific allegations, executives suspected they knew the culprit: a rogue employee, working at the behest of short-sellers.Tesla is among the most shorted stocks, meaning that hedge funds are betting against it and quick to note a missed production goal or cash shortfall. David Einhorn, the billionaire founder of Greenlight Capital, is in that camp. In a letter to investors last month detailing his argument, Mr. Einhorn wrote, \u201cElon Musk appears erratic and desperate.\u201dKimbal Musk, reflecting on the battles with short-sellers, said, \u201cWe feel like we are at war.\u201dPlenty of other companies face the wrath of short-sellers. The issue at Tesla seems to be that for Mr. Musk \u2014 who talks earnestly about weaning the world off fossil fuels with Tesla, and colonizing the solar system with SpaceX \u2014 these attacks are not just the cost of doing business. They are malicious and misguided efforts to derail his efforts to help humanity.\u201cTesla is his baby,\u201d said Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cHe takes it extremely personally.\u201dBut with Tesla now staying public, Mr. Musk will have to continue to contend with those who doubt his vision and are rooting for Tesla to fail.The delays were a result of what Mr. Musk called \u201cmanufacturing hell,\u201d an inferno that has preoccupied him for much of the past year. \u201cThis has been the most difficult time for Tesla,\u201d said JB Straubel, the company\u2019s chief technical officer. \u201cWe knew this was going to be the case, but it\u2019s been even harder than any of us expected.\u201dSome of the wounds were self-inflicted.In preparing the assembly lines, Mr. Musk became convinced that the process should be close to fully automated, using robots rather than humans whenever possible. Doing so, he believed, could make cars move through the factory at one meter per second, 10 to 20 times the speed of existing lines.So Tesla built a factory with hundreds of robots, many programmed to perform tasks that humans could easily do. One robot, which Mr. Musk nicknamed the \u201cflufferbot,\u201d was designed to simply place a sound-dampening piece of fiberglass atop the battery pack.But the flufferbot never really worked. It would fail to pick up the fiberglass, or put it in the wrong place, frequently delaying production. It was eventually replaced by factory workers.As the challenges have mounted, Mr. Musk has thrown himself into his work, spending hours each week walking factory floors, trying to diagnose and fix various problems on the assembly line.\u201cHe demands personal accountability from the people that are closest to the machines,\u201d Mr. Straubel said. \u201cThis freaks people out. They are worried that he will come to their area and start asking questions.\u201dAmid the turnover, Mr. Musk has become even more hands-on. Recently, he and Mr. Straubel were at the Gigafactory, assessing a bottleneck in the manufacturing process. A machine that wound electrodes into formations known as jelly rolls was too slow, and employees could not figure out a remedy.Then Mr. Musk intervened, suggesting that the machine be reprogrammed to work more rapidly. By the end of the day, the machine was 10 percent faster.It was a small victory, and a reminder of Mr. Musk\u2019s technical acumen. But it was also a stark example of how he operates. Apparently unable or unwilling to delegate, the chief executive has embedded with the line workers.\u201cA C.E.O.\u2019s most important job is build a great team around you,\u201d said Bill George, the former chief executive of the medical device maker Medtronic and a Goldman Sachs board member. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the factory floor. I\u2019d rather have him sleeping at home.\u201dMr. Musk has increasingly complained about his lifestyle\u2019s physical toll. He has said he works 120 hours a week, sometimes not going outside for days at a time. At a meeting last week at SpaceX, he was lying on the floor in his cubicle, using a foam roller to relax his back muscles.\u201cHe is absolutely working incredibly hard, but Elon has always worked incredibly hard,\u201d said Mr. Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cHe\u2019s very tough, too. He can eat glass.\u201d\u201cI know that it has been a difficult year for him,\u201d said Gwynne Shotwell, the SpaceX president and chief operating officer. \u201cNot because he\u2019s frowning or throwing things, but because I can tell he\u2019s physically exhausted.\u201dIn the interview with The Times, Mr. Musk said his work had been so consuming that he nearly missed Kimbal\u2019s wedding in Spain this summer. \u201cI got there two hours before the ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cI left directly from the factory. And then I went straight back.\u201dBut while Mr. Musk is clearly working hard, his recounting paints an incomplete picture of his travels. He was away for five days during his trip to Spain, and on the way back, he stopped with his children in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to tour the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d set.Mr. Musk also told The Times that he had not taken a full week off since 2001, while recovering from malaria. But he has made time for memorable holidays over the past year.A few days before New Year\u2019s Eve, he boarded his jet with Kimbal, their families and another close friend, Bryn Mooser. The plan was to go to Antarctica. But on the way there, weather worsened, and they had to land in Santiago, Chile.\u201cHe cares deeply about the world and the people on it,\u201d Mr. Mooser said. \u201cHis fault is that he cares too much, sometimes.\u201dOn Thursday morning, Mr. Musk addressed his board at a hastily convened meeting in a conference room at the Tesla factory. His sleeping bag was still on the floor. When he announced that Tesla would be staying public, at least one director cheered out loud.Mr. Musk\u2019s stunning reversal came about after he realized that while going private would remove some headaches \u2014 such as short-sellers \u2014 it could introduce others, including entanglements with conventional auto companies or oil kingdoms that hardly symbolize an all-electric future.Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet was \u201cclearly incomplete disclosure,\u201d adding that if the S.E.C. decided to pursue a fraud case, the consequences could be severe.\u201cThe penalty that scares everyone is a director and officer bar,\u201d Mr. Henning said. \u201cIf you are found to have misled investors, the S.E.C. can seek to bar you from serving as an officer or director of a public company. That could remove Elon Musk from Tesla.\u201dMr. Musk also must contend with a shareholder lawsuit that challenges Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, his solar panel business. And he must try to replenish the executive ranks and stabilize Model 3 production, all while managing his volatile social life.As he juggles these disparate challenges, Tesla\u2019s fans and foes will be scrutinizing Mr. Musk\u2019s words, his actions and even his moods. Will he spar with short-sellers on Twitter? Will he erupt on the next analyst call?Whatever he is thinking, Mr. Musk seems likely to make it known. \u201cElon always speaks very frankly, sometimes to his detriment,\u201d Ms. Shotwell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way he knows how to communicate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Details \u2018Excruciating\u2019 Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was at home in Los Angeles, struggling to maintain his composure. \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dIn an hourlong interview with The New York Times, he choked up multiple times, noting that he nearly missed his brother\u2019s wedding this summer and spent his birthday holed up in Tesla\u2019s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.Asked if the exhaustion was taking a toll on his physical health, Mr. Musk answered: \u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually. I\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dFor two decades, Mr. Musk has been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most brash and ambitious entrepreneurs, helping to found several influential technology companies. He has often carried himself with bravado, dismissing critics and relishing the spotlight that has come with his success and fortune. But in the interview, he demonstrated an extraordinary level of self-reflection and vulnerability, acknowledging that his myriad executive responsibilities are taking a steep personal toll.In the interview, Mr. Musk provided a detailed timeline of the events leading up to the Twitter postings on Aug. 7 in which he said he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. He asserted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for such a deal \u2014 a transaction likely to be worth well over $10 billion.That morning, Mr. Musk woke up at home with his girlfriend, the musician known as Grimes, and had an early workout. Then he got in a Tesla Model S and drove himself to the airport. En route, Mr. Musk typed his fateful message.Mr. Musk has said he saw the tweet as an attempt at transparency. He acknowledged Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it.Tesla\u2019s shares soared. Investors, analysts and journalists puzzled over the tweet \u2014 published in the middle of the day\u2019s official market trading, an unusual time to release major news \u2014 including the price Mr. Musk cited. He said in the interview that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 \u2014 a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dMr. Musk reached the airport and flew on a private plane to Nevada, where he spent the day visiting a Tesla battery plant known as the Gigafactory, including time meeting with managers and working on an assembly line. That evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he held Tesla meetings late into the night.What Mr. Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured\u201d has become an important question. Those two words helped propel Tesla\u2019s shares higher.But that funding, it turned out, was far from secure.Mr. Musk has said he was referring to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government investment fund. Mr. Musk had extensive talks with representatives of the $250 billion fund about possibly financing a transaction to take Tesla private \u2014 maybe even in a manner that would have resulted in the Saudis\u2019 owning most of the company. One of those sessions took place on July 31 at the Tesla factory in the Bay Area, according to a person familiar with the meeting. But the Saudi fund had not committed to provide any cash, two people briefed on the discussions said.Another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX, Mr. Musk\u2019s rocket company, would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet kicked off a chain reaction.An hour and 20 minutes after the tweet, with Tesla\u2019s shares up 7 percent, the Nasdaq stock exchange halted trading, and Tesla published a letter to employees from Mr. Musk explaining the rationale for possibly taking the company private. When the shares resumed trading, they continued their climb, ending the day with an 11 percent gain.The next day, investigators in the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Tesla for explanations. Ordinarily, such material information about a public company\u2019s plans is laid out in detail after extensive internal preparation and issued through official channels. Board members, blindsided by the chief executive\u2019s market-moving statement, were angry that they had not been briefed, two people familiar with the matter said. They scrambled to cobble together a public statement trying to defuse a mounting uproar over the seemingly haphazard communication.Mr. Musk said in the interview that board members had not complained to him about his tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t recall getting any communications from the board at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely did not get calls from irate directors.\u201dBut shortly after the Times published its interview with Mr. Musk, he added through a Tesla spokeswoman that Antonio Gracias, Tesla\u2019s lead independent director, had indeed contacted him to discuss the Aug. 7 Twitter post, and that he had agreed not to tweet again about the possible privatization deal unless he had discussed it with the board.In the interview, Mr. Musk added that he did not regret his Twitter post \u2014 \u201cWhy would I?\u201d \u2014 and said he had no plans to stop using the social media platform. Some board members, however, have recently told Mr. Musk that he should lay off Twitter and focus on making cars and launching rockets, according to people familiar with the matter.The S.E.C. investigation appears to be intensifying rapidly. Just days after the agency\u2019s request for information, Tesla\u2019s board and Mr. Musk received S.E.C. subpoenas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Board members and Mr. Musk are preparing to meet with S.E.C. officials as soon as next week, the person said.In the interview on Thursday, Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears.He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently \u2014 echoing the reason he cited in a recent public apology to an analyst whom he had berated. In the interview, Mr. Musk said he had not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMr. Musk stopped talking, seemingly overcome by emotion.He turned 47 on June 28, and he said he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday at work. \u201cAll night \u2014 no friends, nothing,\u201d he said, struggling to get the words out.Two days later, he was scheduled to be the best man at the wedding of his brother, Kimbal, in Catalonia. Mr. Musk said he flew directly there from the factory, arriving just two hours before the ceremony. Immediately afterward, he got back on the plane and returned straight to Tesla headquarters, where work on the mass-market Model 3 has been all consuming.Mr. Musk paused again.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dHe blamed short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet that Tesla\u2019s shares will lose value \u2014 for much of his stress. He said he was bracing for \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dReferring to the short-sellers, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb guys, but they\u2019re not supersmart. They\u2019re O.K.

{"Headline": "Martin Shubik, Economist and Game Theory Pioneer, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartin Shubik, an economist whose prescient visions of a computerized world and pioneering applications of game theory to everyday life enlivened what has been described as the dismal science, died on Aug. 22 at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 92.The cause was complications of inclusion body myositis, an inflammatory muscle disease, his daughter, Claire Shubik-Richards, said.Professor Shubik, the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe, was born in New York, raised in England and evacuated to Canada before the Blitz in 1940.Although he considered himself a social scientist and a \u201cmicro-microeconomist,\u201d Professor Shubik, who taught at the Yale School of Management, disdained purely theoretical analysis and was nothing if not practical. (He applied to Princeton instead of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he said, mainly because the application was much shorter.)As early as the mid-1960s, he was predicting that \u201ccomputing machines\u201d would become standard in homes and schools by 1990 and that \u201csociety would fall to bits of its own weight\u201d without them.He warned, however, that the computers ultimately would be in human hands, and that the people responsible for them had better be not merely smart but also nice.Professor Shubik published hundreds of research papers, delving into subjects including terrorism, football, nuclear strategy, antitrust and the demographics of inclusion body myositis, the disease from which he suffered (in a paper he wrote with his son-in-law, Seth Richards-Shubik, also an economics professor).In the mid-1970s, he and Albert Madansky of the University of Chicago conducted a blind taste test to determine which of four Manhattan delicatessens produced the best sandwiches.When self-appointed deli mavens critiqued his methodology and stodgy economists chided his flippancy, Professor Shubik wrote that his research represented \u201ca modest attempt to preserve for the annals, before it became too late, a record of the Great American Vanishing Species known as the Pastrami and the Corned Beef Sannawiches.\u201d He also issued a warning: \u201cRun, my friend \u2014 do not walk, for time is short and the world is about to be buried in bran flakes.\u201d (In fact, all four of the delis the professors tested are now defunct.)At Princeton, they, John Nash and another mathematician were among the creators of an economic strategy game, \u201cSo Long Sucker,\u201d in which four players can make, and renege on, agreements with one another.Martin Shubik was born on March 24, 1926, in Manhattan to Joseph Shubik, who was born in Russia and was in New York working for a Scottish flax and linen company, and Sara (Soloveychik) Shubik.Two years after Martin was born, the family returned to England, where he was raised until the onslaught of German air raids, when he, his mother and his sister were sent to join relatives in Canada. He finished high school there.He did well in algebra but poorly in geometry. (\u201cI see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two,\u201d he said in an interview last year with the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.)He served in the Royal Canadian Navy as a lieutenant, graduated in 1947 from the University of Toronto with a bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics and earned a master\u2019s in political economy there after writing his thesis on the Incas\u2019 use of knotted strings for accounting and inventory.He stumbled into game theory as a specialty after he was required in college to review a book and randomly chose \u201cThe Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,\u201d by John von Neumann and Morgenstern.After earning his doctorate at Princeton, he worked as a consultant for General Electric and for IBM, whose thinking about research scientists he later described to The New York Times: \u201cWell, these are like giant pandas in a zoo. You don\u2019t really quite know what a giant panda is, but you sure as hell know (1) you paid a lot of money for it, and (2) other people want it; therefore it is valuable and therefore it\u2019s got to be well fed.\u201dIn 1963 he joined the faculty at Yale, where he became professor of mathematical institutional economics in the School of Management. He became an emeritus professor in 2007.In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Julie (Kahn) Shubik; two grandchildren; and his sister, Irene Shubik, a television producer. His brother, Philippe, a cancer researcher, died in 2004.While he was an expert on computer modeling and wrote or contributed to a dozen books, including \u201cThe Aggressive Conservative Investor\u201d (2008), Professor Shubik explained in 1981 that it was impossible to predict any relationship between the economy and the stock market. Still, he netted several million dollars by investing more than 90 percent of his assets in stocks.In so-called war games, too, he believed that variables and alternatives left the conclusions open to human analysis. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of comparative Rasputinology,\u201d he said in 1978, \u201ca question of which czar listens to which Rasputin.\u201dWhat Professor Shubik predicted confidently was that scientific knowledge would continue to expand exponentially, and while he was willing to cede questions like whether God exists to cosmology and theology, he said the answer might lie at a boundary within the reach of forthcoming technology.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the journey.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled the surname of a Nobel-winning economist with whom Professor Shubik collaborated. He was Lloyd S. Shapley, not Shapely.Advertisement"}

If demand for copper starts to fall off, pushing prices lower, the argument goes, then it\u2019s a good clue that industrial economies are slowing down.Concern about China, the single largest consumer of the metal, is the primary source of this weakness. The country\u2019s economic outlook has darkened since the trade war with the United States began, right around when copper prices were at their peak.\u201cThe sell-off started with the tariffs,\u201d said Natasha Kaneva, an analyst who follows copper at JPMorgan Chase in New York. \u201cAbsolutely you can say that that was the catalyst.\u201dIn the second quarter, nonperforming loans at Chinese banks notched their biggest rise in over a decade, according to research from Capital Economics. Corporate bond defaults are on the rise, and earlier this week, official reports showed Chinese investment growth, which has long been a driver of the economy, fell to its lowest level since the late 1990s.\u201cThere is a combination of things going on,\u201d said Simona Gambarini, a commodities economist at Capital Economics. \u201cA strong dollar, China slowing, concern about a trade war between China and the U.S., which doesn\u2019t bode well for China in particular but for the global economy as well.\u201dThe pressure on the Chinese economy is beginning to take its toll in other places, too. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has fallen more than 9 percent against the dollar in the last six months and China\u2019s CSI 300 index of blue chip stocks is off 19 percent this year.Such concerning signals emanating from a country that accounts for roughly 15 percent of the world economy might give some investors pause. But for now, investors in the United States seem to see China as someone else\u2019s problem.But if the slump in copper prices is a harbinger of a significant slowdown in global economic growth, American investors could eventually feel the pain.Large American companies rely on sales outside of the United States for substantial portions of their revenue. Last year, 44 percent of the revenues of companies in the S.&P. 500 came from foreign countries, with Asia being the single largest regional source of sales, according to data from S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.Investors seem broadly split over whether American markets can continue to separate themselves from worries about global growth.In early August, Bank of America Merrill Lynch surveyed 185 money managers with over $500 billion in assets. One question asked whether the American economy could continue outperform the rest of the world.Respondents were split, with 34 percent saying they thought the United States could continue to do better and 32 percent saying they expected growth in the United States to start to slow down.The majority of the fund managers, however, agreed about what could be the biggest risk to the market. About 57 percent answered that the top risk was \u201ctrade war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stock Buybacks Continue to Break Records", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple is handing cash back to its shareholders at an unprecedented rate.The iPhone maker repurchased $43.5 billion of its own stock during the first six months of this year. Not only is that up from more than $14 billion during the same period last year, but the company\u2019s repurchases in the past two quarters also rank as the biggest in history, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.& P. Dow Jones Indices.Among companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, each of the five largest quarterly stock buybacks on record was by Apple.Apple\u2019s increased spending on its own shares follows the $1.5 trillion tax cut signed into law late last year. The overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The aim was to encourage companies to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories to stimulate the American economy.Like most stock repurchase efforts, Apple\u2019s buyback program has helped bolster its share price in recent years. Apple shares are up 18 percent this year and nearly 150 percent since March 2012. By reducing the number of shares on the market, buybacks also lift a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 a key metric for investors. For instance, Apple\u2019s earning per share grew 40 percent last quarter compared with the same period last year, while its net income rose just 32 percent.Apple\u2019s buyback binge also affects the calculation of its stock market value, which is approaching $1 trillion. Based on its share count from its fiscal second-quarter filing, the company would have a market value of $984 billion Wednesday. But Apple reduced its share count by 5.5 percent during its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. That means Apple\u2019s market capitalization stands at roughly $970 billion, and its shares now need to hit $206.49 for the company to be valued at $1 trillion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Will Cause the Next Recession? A Look at the 3 Most Likely Possibilities", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe expansion is nine years old. An ill-timed end of fiscal stimulus, a corporate debt bubble and the trade war are the things that could most easily end it.But eventually something will kill it. The question is what, and when.While it\u2019s impossible to predict the details or timing of the next recession with any confidence, we can identify some emerging threats to the expansion \u2014 and with a bit of imagination, picture how the recession of 2020 (or 2022, or whatever year it ends up being) may unfold.To be clear, the economy is going gangbusters right now. The nation\u2019s G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the strongest quarter of growth since 2014. But when you speak with some of the people who fret and worry about economic risks for a living, a few factors come up repeatedly.Perhaps most worrisome, many of the culprits in ending the expansion wouldn\u2019t necessarily arise in isolation. Rather, each one could make the others worse, meaning the next recession might have multiple causes. So, with a bit of creative license, here are the three most plausible scenarios for the good times to end.The Federal Reserve has had a relatively easy time over the last year or two. Both inflation and employment have been gradually moving toward healthy levels as the Fed has gradually raised interest rates.The job facing the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, is on the verge of getting trickier. The risk that the Fed will miscalibrate interest rate policy and cause a slowdown or a recession is rising, in part because of the timing of the tax cuts and spending increases enacted this year.Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, has a term for their likely dilemma: the \u201ctrain wreck 2020\u201d scenario.The United States economy is either at or near full employment, and inflation is already near 2 percent. With growth still strong, Mr. Guha says, the Fed may soon find itself needing to raise interest rates more aggressively to keep inflation in check.But at the same time, mainstream macroeconomic models have the economic lift from tax cuts fading sometime between 2020 and 2022. That means the Fed could be raising interest rates to slow the economy just as tax policy is also working to slow the economy.Both affect the economy with unpredictable lags, so it could prove hard for the Fed to set policies that can prevent both overheating in 2019 and 2020 and a downturn in 2021 and 2022.\u201cThere is probably some kind of perfect path where the Fed could thread the needle on this,\u201d raising rates just enough to prevent overheating but not enough to leave rates so high as to risk a recession once the impact of tax cuts fades, Mr. Guha said. \u201cBut what\u2019s the likelihood that you\u2019ll thread that needle? It\u2019s not one you\u2019d want to be betting the farm on.\u201dThe last two recessions started with the popping of an asset bubble. In 2001 it was dot-com stocks; in 2007 it was houses and the mortgage securities backed by them. So it makes sense to look to various markets that might be getting bubbly in dangerous ways. And that search leads quickly to debt markets, both in the United States and overseas.The rise in debt loads overseas, especially in emerging markets, is even greater, according to McKinsey\u2019s data \u2014 as is a shift toward more debt being owed by riskier borrowers.Essentially, businesses have been in a sweet spot for years, in which profits have gradually risen while interest rates have stayed low by historical measures. If either of those trends were to change, many companies with higher debt burdens might struggle to pay their bills and be at risk of bankruptcy.The 2020 train wreck narrative could intersect with the corporate debt boom. If inflation were to get out of control and the Fed raised interest rates sharply, companies that can handle their debt payments at today\u2019s low interest rates might become more strained. Moreover, with federal deficits on track to rise in the years ahead, the federal government\u2019s borrowing needs could crowd out private borrowing, which would result in higher interest rates and even more challenges for indebted companies.Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey, does not see the rise in debt as likely to cause some macroeconomic crisis, but said it could cause distress for individual companies.\u201cI think there will be a rise in defaults, but I\u2019m not alarmed,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see systemic interlinkages.\u201dThe 2007 housing downturn became a 2008 global financial crisis because mortgage-backed securities were stuffed throughout a highly leveraged global financial system. The 2000 dot-com crash became a 2001 recession because it triggered a broader pullback in corporate investment. The question is whether the potential challenges for corporate borrowers in the years ahead can remain more isolated than in those precedents. Many words have been devoted to the economic risks of the trade war with China and other trading partners.\u201cTrade just isn\u2019t that big,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. \u201cI have a very hard time coming up with numbers that would be big enough to cause a recession based on the trade math alone.\u201dFor the trade war to trigger a recession, then, it would need to escalate to a much larger scale than the limited tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar cells, washing machines and $34 billion in Chinese products currently covered.Even if it were to expand to encompass hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports, as President Trump has threatened, in order to cause a recession it would need to prompt a broader crisis of confidence.Perhaps the economic damage will be higher in other countries that are more reliant on trade than the United States, causing a slowdown in the global economy that reduces demand for American products over and beyond what tariffs might cause.A global slowdown could also cause huge losses in American stock and bond markets, as American companies\u2019 revenues abroad could plummet. That means a hit to Americans\u2019 wealth and more expensive capital for businesses. It could be the thing that triggers a popping of the corporate debt bubble.For the trade war to cause a recession, it would probably need to do major damage to business confidence, and lead companies to hold back from capital investments because of uncertainty over the future of trade policy.So a trade war alone might not directly cause a recession in the United States. But a trade war that causes a global economic slowdown, a market sell-off and an evaporation of business confidence certainly could.What are the odds of that? In a recent report, Moody\u2019s Analytics puts what it calls the \u201ctrade conflagration\u201d scenario, which includes a late 2019 recession, at 10 percent likelihood.More likely, the report argued, trade brinkmanship will continue until global financial markets weaken, leading to a deal that results in some of the most severe risks being taken off the table.Each week seems to bring alternating signals of the risks of a trade war. In mid-July, President Trump floated threats to apply tariffs to all Chinese imports, which would drastically escalate the trade war. By late July, he was making more conciliatory gestures toward the European Union about striking a deal to lower tariffs across the board.Regardless of the true odds of the three scenarios, this much we know: The seeds of the next downturn have almost certainly already been planted. The question is which of them will grow into a problem big enough to matter. Advertisement"}

Shares of Whirlpool, Alcoa and General Motors tumbled after the companies warned of the financial hit from the higher costs related in part to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.So far, the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have had little impact on Sonos, the company said. But as trade tensions ramp up, Sonos looks particularly vulnerable.In its filing with the S.E.C. ahead of its I.P.O., Sonos warned that tariffs were a potential risk to anyone buying its shares:If the tariff list remains unaltered, all of our inbound products to the United States would be subject to a 10 percent tariff assessed on the cost of goods as imported. If these duties are imposed on our products, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations.Of course, the trade worries only add to the list of more traditional investor concerns. The company, which started life as a multiroom speaker maker, has more recently ridden the wave of smart speakers. That has put the company in the position of both teaming up and competing with heavyweights like Amazon, Google and Apple.Sonos\u2019s growth is slower than some recent I.P.O.s as well. The company\u2019s revenue rose just 10 percent in its last fiscal year. For comparison, Spotify grew 37 percent and Dropbox 31 percent in the year before they went public.And a red flag for those looking to buy into the I.P.O.: Sonos\u2019s existing shareholders accounted for 8.3 million of the shares sold in the offering.Advertisement"}

Except This Analyst.", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the past seven years, Tim Lee has been warning that a financial crisis in Turkey would set off a wider calamity in global markets.Just about nobody listened \u2014 until now.There are signs of the rout spreading beyond Turkey. The stock prices of European banks, which have been big lenders to their Turkish counterparts, dropped sharply on Friday, with investors worried that a wave of corporate bankruptcies in Turkey would lead to a banking bust in the country. The currencies of China, Brazil and Mexico also weakened. And in the United States, major stock-market indexes fell more than 1 percent before recovering slightly.Suddenly, Mr. Lee\u2019s largely ignored prophecy \u2014 that a decade of Turkish companies and real estate developers gorging on cheap foreign debt would end badly, not just for Turkey but for the world \u2014 does not seem so outlandish.\u201cTurkey is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Mr. Lee said on Friday. \u201cWe are going have another crash that will be worse than 2008 in certain ways.\u201dThis is not a widely held view. Despite Friday\u2019s weakness, United States stock markets remain near their highs. Anxiety about trade wars with China and Europe has been largely cast aside. Even financial markets in developing countries, which tend to swoon in unison when one of their peers implodes, recently have been doing well.Mr. Lee, 58, made his initial call \u2014 that Turkey was in deep financial trouble \u2014 in 2011.He writes the newsletter, called piEconomics, from a Greenwich, Conn., office where he now works alone. The publication is simple: 10 pages of dense text supplemented with the occasional chart. His subscribers are a small cluster of European investment funds.Toward the end of 2011, Mr. Lee published an installment of the newsletter in which he predicted that Turkey would need a $100 billion bailout.At the time, central banks all over the world were pumping money into their economies, which were struggling to recuperate from the financial crisis.Mr. Lee noticed that Turkish banks were borrowing in dollars to make other loans to fast-growing Turkish companies. He also saw that, over all, Turkey\u2019s economy was growing more reliant on financing from foreign investors. It struck him as similar to what had happened to Thailand in the years before the Asian financial crisis in 1997.In his monthly notes to investors, he kept returning to the topic of Turkey and the risks there.At the time, the Turkish economy was humming. The odds of a blowup looked remote. The idea of the lira ever trading at 7.2 seemed ludicrous. It was easy for people to ignore Mr. Lee\u2019s fantastical-sounding warning.But Mr. Lee was on to something, even if his prediction was a half-decade premature. Over the next five years, the economic situation in Turkey deteriorated, as he had anticipated.One side effect of having trillions of dollars of new money sloshing around courtesy of central banks was that it became much easier for governments and companies in hot economies like Turkey\u2019s to borrow money in dollars \u2014 as opposed to their own currencies \u2014 to finance their investments or other growth plans.Today, according to the Institute of International Finance, a banking trade group, corporate debt in foreign currencies is $5.5 trillion, the most ever.The threat is that as the lira loses value, it becomes more expensive for Turkish companies to repay their dollar-denominated loans. Indeed, a growing number of companies in Turkey already have said they cannot repay these loans.\u201cCompanies there just ignored all the risks and kept borrowing in dollars,\u201d Mr. Lee said.And that has the potential to spread far and wide. American investors, for example, own nearly 25 percent of outstanding Turkish bonds and more than half of publicly traded Turkish stocks, according to the I.I.F.Mr. Lee these days is far from the only one warning about the Turkish economy and financial system. The thing that really worries him and other bearish investors is that Turkey could be a signal for what lies ahead for assets and economies that were inflated by cheap debt.If Mr. Lee\u2019s 2011 call now looks prescient, it hasn\u2019t won him much new business.Lately, just as Turkey began its crackup, a number of his clients have left him.Yes, he might have been right on Turkey. But his persistent gloom was wearing thin, especially as the markets continued to soar.\u201cIt has been some hard sledding,\u201d Mr. Lee admitted. \u201cI have lost a lot of clients because I have been too bearish.\u201dYet he is doubling down on his doomsday message: The river of global cash will dry up, the dollar will spike and there will be a series of financial seizures. Investors, he thinks, will flee developing economies, then Europe and eventually the American stock and bond markets.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a banking crisis this time around \u2014 it will be a financial market crisis,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cAnd I am very confident that it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Shrinking. That\u2019s a Problem for Everyone.", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe American stock market has been shrinking. It\u2019s been happening in slow motion \u2014 so slow you may not even have noticed. But by now the change is unmistakable: The market is half the size of its mid-1990s peak, and 25 percent smaller than it was in 1976.When I say \u201cshrinking,\u201d I\u2019m using a specific definition: the reduction in the number of publicly traded companies on exchanges in the United States. In the mid-1990s, there were more than 8,000 of them. By 2016, there were only 3,627, according to data from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Because the population of the United States has grown nearly 50 percent since 1976, the drop is even starker on a per-capita basis: There were 23 publicly listed companies for every million people in 1975, but only 11 in 2016, according to Professor Stulz.This puts the United States \u201cin bad company in terms of the percentage decrease in listings \u2014 just ahead of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the size of the United States, its economic development, financial development and its respect for shareholder rights,\u201d he added, one might expect that tally to be climbing, not falling.In his new paper, \u201cThe Shrinking Universe of Public Firms: Facts, Causes, and Consequences,\u201d Professor Stulz surveyed the body of academic research on the topic. In an interview, he said that the casual observer may not entirely grasp the implications of the changes that have taken place.\u201cThe headline is that the number of public firms is shrinking, but it\u2019s not just that,\u201d he said. Profits in the overall market are now divided among fewer winners. And as capital-intensive companies have been supplanted by those whose value is largely found in their intellectual property, the marketplace is less transparent \u2014 with troubling consequences.Consider these big shifts:\u25a0 The companies on the market today are, on average, much larger than the public corporations of decades ago. Fast-rising upstarts are harder to find.In 1975, 61.5 percent of publicly traded firms had assets worth less than $100 million, using inflation-adjusted 2015 dollars. But by 2015, that proportion had dropped to only 22.6 percent.Because of this, Professor Stulz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for the general public to invest in a diversified portfolio of really small, publicly traded companies in the way they could a few decades ago.\u201dIn theory, as a shareholder, you are entitled to a piece of a company\u2019s future earnings. That\u2019s one of the main arguments for buying stock in the first place. But the reality is that you often are buying a piece of a money-losing proposition. Aside from the top 200 companies, the rest of the market, as a whole, is burning, not earning, money.\u25a0 A quirk of accounting is at the root of some of that profit deficit, especially for smaller and younger companies. Increasingly, value resides in intellectual property \u2014 \u201cintangibles\u201d like software and data and biological design \u2014 rather than in the production of physical objects like cars.But under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which American companies must follow, research and development must be deducted from corporate income \u2014 and those charges can reduce or eliminate profits. (Capital expenditures \u2014 in physical things like factories \u2014 appear on corporate balance sheets, not income statements, and don\u2019t reduce profits.)Without deep knowledge of a company\u2019s critical research \u2014 which businesses may be reluctant to share, for competitive reasons \u2014 it\u2019s difficult for outsiders to evaluate a start-up\u2019s worth. That makes it harder to obtain funding, and it may be partly responsible for certain trends: why there are fewer initial public offerings these days, why smaller companies are being swallowed by the giants, and why so many companies remain private for longer.That creates opportunities for private equity firms, which have insider access to innovative start-ups that may never go directly to the public markets. Meanwhile, Main Street investors are consigned to a less diverse universe than they may realize.There\u2019s a broader problem. Our visibility into the inner workings of public companies isn\u2019t great, but we know far more about them than we do private companies, which aren\u2019t required to disclose nearly as much information.And these changing dynamics mean we know far less about many of the creators of American profits and jobs than would otherwise be the case.In a democracy in which corporations already have enormous clout, that is worth worrying about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big, Dangerous Bubble in Corporate Debt", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.The $30 trillion domestic stock market seems to get all the attention. When the stock market sets new highs, we instinctively feel things are good and getting better. When it tanks, as happened in the initial months of the 2008 financial crisis, we think things are going to hell.Unlike buying a stock, which is a calculated gamble, buying a bond or a loan is a contractual obligation: A borrower must repay a lender the borrowed amount, plus interest as compensation. The upside in a bond is limited to the contractual interest payments, but the downside is theoretically protected. Bondholders expect to get their money back, as long as the borrower doesn\u2019t default or go bankrupt.But for much of the last decade, risk has been mispriced to a staggering degree. In other words, the prices of bonds (and corporate loans) have not accurately reflected the riskiness of the underlying borrower\u2019s credit. A company that is a poor credit risk, because it has too much debt or is struggling, should have to pay higher rates of interest. And investors would expect a higher yield \u2014 roughly the interest rate divided by the price paid for the bond or loan \u2014 for taking on that risk. Since the financial crisis, that simple calculus has been upended. Until recently, investors have been paying higher prices for the debt of riskier companies and not getting properly compensated for that risk.For now, the bond market, like the stock market, looks robust. It has been a long bull run for both stocks and bonds, and borrower defaults have been at historically low levels for years. As has the \u201cspread\u201d\u2014 the difference between the yields \u2014 of Treasury-backed securities and riskier bonds. But as interest rates continue to rise, and some companies and other borrowers fail to meet their debt obligations, defaults will inevitably increase along with the spreads.When they do, trillions of dollars in invested capital could be lost. If that happens, as it did after September 2008, access to credit for most borrowers could dry up, setting off yet another potentially devastating economic crisis. To be sure, the growing concern about the mispricing of risk doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re on the verge of a recession. But the corporate debt bubble inevitably will play a role in causing it.Here\u2019s the crux of the problem: After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Board under Ben Bernanke decided to lower short-term and long-term interest rates. Fed officials hoped that by flooding the zone with inexpensive credit, borrowers would have access to money to build new factories, buy new equipment, hire more employees and pay them higher wages. Mr. Bernanke\u2019s idea was that the Fed could engineer an economic recovery by making sure that most businesses that wanted capital could get it at an attractive price. It largely worked. His strategy was so successful that it was envied and then copied by central banks around the world.To lower interest rates, the Fed employed two tactics. One was to cut the so-called Fed Funds rate \u2014 what the Fed charges the nation\u2019s biggest banks to borrow money on a short-term basis \u2014 to nearly zero, and keep it there for seven years. Lowering long-term rates required more creativity. Mr. Bernanke had a clever plan, what he called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d: The Fed would buy trillions of dollars of toxic securities that had marred the balance sheets of the Wall Street banks.By creating artificial demand for these securities, where there had been virtually none, the Fed helped big banks cleanse their balance sheets, reassuring investors and creditors. But like anything else, bond prices are subject to the vagaries of supply and demand; the Fed\u2019s gorging drove up not only the price of these particular bonds but also bond prices generally, lowering their yields. (When bond prices increase, yields decrease.)The plan worked, perhaps too well. Both short- and long-term interest rates were reduced to levels rarely seen in our lifetimes. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet expanded to about $4.5 trillion, from less than $900 billion before the crisis, thanks to the purchase of squirrelly assets from Wall Street. The world was awash with cheap capital. (Of course, that didn\u2019t mean it was any easier for home buyers to get a mortgage or for small businesses to get loans.)An unintended consequence of keeping interest rates artificially low for so long is the mispricing of risk. The Fed\u2019s artificial demand has kept bond prices higher than they otherwise would have been, and their yields lower. But investors have an insatiable demand for higher yields, a collective hunger that Wall Street has been only too happy to feed.Examples of mispriced risk are strewn across the financial landscape. In June, Asurion, an insurer of cellphones, closed on a $3.75 billion loan package from Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks, with minimal covenants \u2014 agreements to protect creditors by notifying them when certain red flags, like a higher than agreed-upon debt-to-cash flow ratio, are waving.The proceeds of Asurion\u2019s \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d or \u201ccov-lite\u201d loan were used to pay dividends to the three private-equity firms that own the company. Its debt load has increased to $11.3 billion, seven times its cash flow. For additional irresistible fees, Wall Street then repackaged the Asurion loans into securities and sold them to investors, who now own the debt of a highly leveraged company with far fewer protections.When junk bond yields return to more normal levels, as interest rates rise and investors\u2019 yield-fever breaks, the price of the bonds bought during the feeding frenzy will fall and billions of dollars stand to be lost \u2014 by endowments, pension funds and high-yield funds, among others \u2014 as bonds across the board are repriced by the market.When that happens, the entire credit market could start to contract, as it did after the 2008 crisis. When the pendulum swings away from fast-and-loose credit standards for corporations, lenders become more cautious. That means ordinary people will pay much higher rates for mortgages, car loans and small-business loans \u2014 if they can get them at all.It may not be too late for a course correction. Banks could tighten their underwriting standards \u2014 ratchet down the leverage, demand more covenants, nix loans that are used to pay big dividends \u2014 and investors could be more discerning about the prices they are willing to pay for high-yielding bonds. Regulators could be more vigilant about allowing such loans and bonds to be issued in the first place. Wall Street could also redesign its compensation system to reward bankers to be more cautious with their underwriting and to take fewer risks with other people\u2019s money.In the meantime, we must inure ourselves to the inevitable. It may take yet another major financial crisis for things to change, or maybe things will never change. Either way, it\u2019s a lesson we never seem to learn until it\u2019s too late.William D.

{"Headline": "What Does It Mean to Be Human? Don\u2019t Ask ", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE BIG IDEASWe don\u2019t see the problem with our self-importance because our narcissism is so complete. Over time, the idea of \u201cbeing human\u201d has surely meant \u2014 and will continue to mean \u2014 many things. There is and has never been just one answer. But surely one thing it ought to involve today is the ability to recognize that the question itself is a problem. We humans are very self-focused. We tend to think that being human is somehow very special and important, so we ask about that, instead of asking what it means to be an elephant, or a pig, or a bird. This failure of curiosity is part of a large ethical problem. The question, \u201cWhat is it to be human?\u201d is not just narcissistic, it involves a culpable obtuseness. It is rather like asking, \u201cWhat is it to be white?\u201d It connotes unearned privileges that have been used to dominate and exploit. But we usually don\u2019t recognize this because our narcissism is so complete. We share a planet with billions of other sentient beings, and they all have their own complex ways of being whatever they are. All of our fellow animal creatures, as Aristotle observed long ago, try to stay alive and reproduce more of their kind. All of them perceive. All of them desire. And most move from place to place to get what they want and need. Aristotle proposed that we should strive for a common explanation of how animals, including human animals, perceive, desire and move. We know Aristotle as a philosopher, but he also was a great biologist who studied shellfish and other creatures large and small. He encouraged his students not to turn away from studying animals that don\u2019t seem glamorous, since there is something wonderful in all of them, not least the sheer fact that they all strive for continued life. This sense of wonder, which should lead us to a fuller ethical concern, is a deep part of our humanity. But wonder is on the wane, and we humans now so dominate the globe that we rarely feel as if we need to live with other animals on reciprocal terms. New issues arise constantly. The world needs an ethical revolution, a consciousness-raising movement of truly international proportions. But this revolution is impeded by the navel-gazing that is typically involved in asking, \u201cWhat is it to be human?\u201d We now know that animals need many things that don\u2019t always cause suffering when they are absent: the chance to associate with others of their kind in normal groupings; the chance to sing or trumpet in their characteristic ways; the chance to breed; the chance to move freely through unobstructed space; the chance to pursue curiosity and make new discoveries. So we also need, I believe, an approach that focuses on a plurality of distinct \u201ccapabilities,\u201d or freedoms, that each species requires to live a flourishing life. So let\u2019s put aside the narcissism involved in asking only about ourselves. Let\u2019s strive for an era in which being human means being concerned with the other species that try to inhabit this world. Martha C.

{"Headline": "End Stock Buybacks, Save the Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lazonick, an economist, and Mr. Jacobson, a journalist, write about industrial policy and economics.Since the 1980s, corporate boards in the United States have embraced as dogma the position that companies should be run primarily for the benefit of their shareholders. The stranglehold of this doctrine of \u201cshareholder-value maximization\u201d over corporate decision making has been a leading cause of inequitable incomes, unstable employment, and sagging productivity.The principal tool for extracting value from companies and handing it to shareholders is the stock buyback, which usually boosts a company\u2019s stock price. Buybacks are favored by top executives, who are paid primarily in stock options and stock awards, and encouraged by ever-more-powerful hedge-fund activists. From 2008 to 2017, 466 S.&P. 500 companies distributed $4 trillion to shareholders as buybacks, equal to 53 percent of profits, along with $3.1 trillion as dividends.The growing use of stock buybacks since the mid-1980s has warped the economy, worsening inequality, distorting corporate decision making and diverting resources from investment in employees and hard assets. Congress is taking notice: the Reward Work Act introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin in March would ban stock buybacks done as open market repurchases. (It would still allow buybacks done through tender offers, which are used for different purposes.)The Securities and Exchange Commission, whose mandate includes stock market regulation, opened the floodgates to stock buybacks in 1982, when it adopted Rule 10b-18. Promulgated without public comment, the rule gives a company a \u201csafe harbor\u201d in repurchasing its own stock on the open market if it meets certain conditions, among them, restricting its buybacks on any single trading day to no more than 25 percent of the stock\u2019s average daily trading volume over the previous four weeks. If it stays within the safe harbor, a company can repurchase its stock in massive amounts without fear of being charged with manipulating the stock\u2019s price.Before the adoption of this rule, buybacks were not illegal, but companies refrained from doing them on a large scale because of the risk that the S.E.C. might bring manipulation charges. With this fear banished, buybacks began on a large scale in 1984.Corporations already had a way to provide a yield to shareholders: dividends. But by 1997, stock buybacks had surpassed dividends as a mode of distribution to shareholders.To understand the magnitude of this shift, we analyzed financial data from 232 companies in the S.&P. 500 Index that were publicly listed in 1981, before the rule, and were still public through 2016. We found that from 1981 to 1983, these companies spent 4.3 percent of profits on buybacks. In comparison, from 2014 to 2016, these same companies spent 59 percent of their profits buying back their own stock. Dividends absorbed just under half of profits in both periods.The Rule 10b-18 daily limit on stock buybacks isn\u2019t much of a limit at all. Apple, for example, could buy back $1.4 billion worth of its stock in a single day without exceeding it. And as long as Apple\u2019s board adopts a buyback program to permit it, senior executives can keep buying back similar amounts of stock, trading day after trading day.Defenders of buybacks contend that they do no harm because the funds are reallocated through financial markets and used elsewhere in the economy. A company\u2019s profits are, however, the financial foundation for investments in productive capabilities, first and foremost in employees. Investment in training and retaining employees is the key to productivity growth and innovation, for individual companies and for the economy. According to our research, when trillions of dollars of corporate cash are extracted from companies through buybacks, on top of dividends, the result is a dramatic concentration of income among the richest American households and the destruction of middle-class employment opportunities.In 2003, the S.E.C. revealed that it was aware of the use of buybacks to manipulate the stock market. The agency acknowledged, in amending Rule 10b-18 to include block trades, that \u201cduring the late 1990s, it was reported that many companies were spending more than half their net income on massive buyback programs that were intended to boost share prices \u2014 often supporting their share price at levels far above where they would otherwise trade.\u201d But its 2003 amendment was hardly a solution.From 2003 to 2007, the value of buybacks by companies in the S.&P. 500 Index quadrupled, reaching almost $600 billion in 2007. With their cash reserves depleted by this orgy of buyback activity, these companies were more vulnerable when the downturn came. Having wasted billions on buybacks, many of them incurred huge losses and required mass layoffs to avoid bankruptcy.After plummeting in 2008 and 2009, buybacks have again soared: A record $800 billion in buybacks by S.&P. 500 companies is predicted for this year.Democrats have argued that the Republican tax cuts have funded increased buybacks. While this is true, the damage done by corporate stock buybacks over the past decades has been systemic.Short of a Congressional ban on buybacks, as Ms. Baldwin proposes, the S.E.C. should immediately rescind Rule 10b-18, and confront the reality of stock market manipulation that open market repurchases entail. If Congress and regulators do not take action to rein in buybacks, the rampant economic inequality that already afflicts the United States will only get worse.William Lazonick, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, is president of the Academic-Industry Research Network.

{"Headline": "Trump Asks S.E.C. to Study Quarterly Earnings Requirements for Public Firms", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider eliminating requirements that publicly traded companies post quarterly earnings reports, a move that could do away with a cornerstone of American capital markets.In speaking with some of the world\u2019s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. \u201cStop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,\u201d said one. That would allow greater flexibility & save money. I have asked the SEC to study!The directive does not mean the imminent demise of quarterly earnings reports, which keep investors informed on the financial health of publicly traded companies. The disclosures are required under federal securities law. The commission is independent of the executive branch, although the White House nominates the chairman of the S.E.C. and the other four commissioners, who all serve staggered, five-year terms.\u201cThe president has highlighted a key consideration for American companies and, importantly, American investors and their families \u2014 encouraging long-term investment in our country,\u201d the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement. \u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s division of corporation finance continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s suggestion is not unheard-of. In 2013, the European regulators abolished requirements that publicly listed companies file quarterly reports. On the other hand, Japan has moved closer to current American rules, requiring quarterly reporting starting in 2008.Still, any move away from the system of quarterly reporting would be a significant shift for investors, who have come to rely on the regular financial disclosures on the performance of publicly held companies.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, investors are used to getting updates four times a year on the status of companies\u2019 financials, and changing that would require a change in behavior,\u201d said Ed Clissold, the chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research. \u201cOn the positive side, getting frequent updates holds companies accountable. They lay out plans to grow their business, and quarterly updates are a chance for investors to see the progress toward those objectives. The downside is that companies have occasionally managed their businesses to meet those quarterly objectives.\u201dThe paper also found that once companies go public, their appetite for capital spending tends to diminish. That finding is consistent with the idea that being a public company can promote short-term thinking, perhaps because of the scrutiny of disclosures such as quarterly earnings reports. But the authors of the paper also emphasized that other explanations could also be responsible for the shift.Investors, on the other hand, are less likely to support the idea floated by Mr. Trump, which would cut down on the information available about how the companies were performing.\u201cInvestors and other stakeholders benefit when regulations ensure that important information is promptly and transparently provided to the marketplace,\u201d said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group representing large investors such as pension funds and endowments. \u201cInvestors need timely, accurate financial information to make informed investment decisions.\u201dJames Chanos, a well-known investor who specializes in shorting stocks, or betting on their decline, agreed.\u201cI\u2019m in the camp of more disclosure is better than less,\u201d Mr. Chanos said. \u201cAnd the U.S. financial disclosure is the best in the world.\u201dHe added, however, that some elements of the quarterly reporting process should be re-examined, including the \u201crampant\u201d release of quarterly numbers that do not conform to the standard set of accounting rules used in the United States, a practice that often makes a company\u2019s financial results look better.Others argue that longer stretches without corporations providing public information could lead to to abuse by those with inside information.\u201cQuarterly disclosures are very important. A lot can happen in six months, and it\u2019s just not appropriate to reduce disclosures,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, the policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of foundations, unions and public interest groups that pushes for stronger financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to advantage insiders further.\u201dEven those who criticize quarterly earnings may not want to abolish them altogether. In an essay published in The Wall Street Journal this summer, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett said that they favored eliminating quarter-earnings guidance, which are the targets companies hope to hit, but not the quarterly earnings results themselves.\u201cTransparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe support being open with shareholders about actual financial and operational metrics.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $70 Billion Deal for Tesla? Elon Musk Faces 2 Huge Questions", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk is plotting the biggest ever attempt to take a company private, but it\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll pay for it \u2014 or if it\u2019s really worth it.Investors were not too bothered by this lack of clarity: Tesla\u2019s shares jumped 11 percent. They should be.Tesla may find it difficult to line up banks and investors to lend it large sums. Typically, companies taken private have somewhat steady cash flows. Tesla does not. In the second quarter, it recorded another huge loss and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash.Companies that are taken private usually have low valuations and are unloved by investors. Tesla does not fit that description, either, which could prove partly useful.In theory, Mr. Musk could pull off the transaction without taking on massive amounts of debt. He could persuade as many current investors as possible to exchange their public shares for new ones in the private company. The more that agree, the less debt needed.Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, holding 20 percent of its stock. The next four largest hold nearly 30 percent combined. He might not get all of those to buy into his plan. (One, Fidelity, also has a stake in SpaceX, a private company led by Mr. Musk.)He could also turn to his individual investors, who own nearly 13 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. Many of those are incredibly bullish about the company.To increase the chances of success with all of his investors, Mr. Musk has to convince them that their shares in a private Tesla will one day be worth more than the $420 that the transaction offers them.Doing so will require convincing them that Tesla will perform better out of the spotlight. Shareholders would also have to be willing to potentially get less information about the company\u2019s performance and have less opportunity to sell their shares if it is no longer publicly traded.\u201cBeing public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dArguably, though, the public markets have been very good to Tesla. The company has successfully tapped them for capital, and, even when it has racked up losses and consumed cash, its market value has marched higher and higher. Its stock market value currently exceeds that of General Motors.Investors are, in effect, giving Tesla much the same leeway as it would get if it were private. Big institutional shareholders have remained patient as the company strives to achieve long-term objectives, and have stood by the company even when Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior was unorthodox. They have even tolerated a board that has been criticized for its oversight.Investors must now weigh whether giving even more freedom to Mr. Musk, and the extra debt the deal may incur, is worth it. It very well may not be.Advertisement"}

Investors have enjoyed 11 bull markets \u2014 defined as a period without a pullback of 20 percent or more \u2014 since the end of World War II.

Falling interest rates, a strong economy, and a flurry of corporate mergers and public offerings fueled a bull market and the excesses of 1980s Wall Street. Even so, there were mounting concerns heading into fall 1987: The rally had pushed valuations to high levels, and the Fed, again worried about inflation, had begun to raise interest rates. Geopolitical events centered in the Persian Gulf and concerns about the trade deficit only added to investors\u2019 jitters.Then, on Oct. 19, 1987, a day that became known as Black Monday, stocks tumbled more than 20 percent. When the selling began, it was exacerbated by computerized trading, then still in its infancy, without the so-called circuit breakers that would now halt trading during such a plunge. It remains the worst one-day crash in history by percentage.As dark a moment as it was, the United States economy continued to grow for nearly three more years.October 1990 to March 2000GAIN: 417%Few thought in 1990 that stocks were about to embark on one of the most remarkable rallies ever. The economy was sluggish, banks were saddled with bad loans and Iraq had recently invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States and its allies to send forces to the Middle East. On the day the stock market began its recovery, The New York Times quoted an analyst saying that the bear market had not run its course and that any recovery in the next couple of months would be \u201ca temporary respite in a major downtrend.\u201d Within months, though, Iraq had been expelled from Kuwait, and the economy had entered a period of strong and stable growth. Corporate profits ballooned, and retail investors rushed into the market. Finally, toward the end of the decade, investors\u2019 optimism morphed into the sort of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman at the time, had described a few years earlier. The Fed, hoping to slow inflation, and perhaps to cool the stock market, began raising interest rates. But a series of increases were slow to quell investor enthusiasm, and the tech bubble continued to inflate \u2014 until, eventually, it burst. October 2002 to October 2007GAIN: 102%After the dot-com crash in 2000, the Fed slashed interest rates and borrowing took off \u2014 including among home buyers with subprime credit. Complex financial products \u2014 like the collateralized debt obligations into which those mortgages were packaged \u2014 soared. The balance sheets, profits and share prices of the banks that created and traded these products swelled. By 2006, the financial sector was the largest in the S.&P. 500. But as the economy took off, the Fed began to raise the historically low interest rates. Now the borrowed money was more expensive to pay back, and defaults climbed. By the time stocks peaked in October 2007, the era of easy lending was over and banks were taking huge losses. By December, the economy had fallen into recession, and the next summer stocks entered a bear market. By October 2008, some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest financial institutions had collapsed and the federal government had begun the bailout that helped set off the current bull market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stealth Drivers of the Record Bull Market", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy has the upswing in the United States stock market lasted for so long?The simple answer: The economy and corporate profits have been growing for most of the current bull market.Still, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is up by 324 percent over nearly nine and a half years. Some things clearly went right. Here are three factors that didn\u2019t get the attention they perhaps deserve.America\u2019s financial firms often acted as engines of instability during past bull markets. Banks unleashed lending binges that fueled economic growth and increased stock prices. But when borrowers defaulted, banks pulled back sharply, making economic slowdowns and stock market crashes all the more severe. The financial excesses of the five-year bull-run that ended in 2007 illustrate the central role banks can play in creating conditions for a bust.After 2008, the Federal Reserve and Congress required changes \u2014 like safer balance sheets and lending practices \u2014 that largely stopped banks from acting in such a destabilizing manner. In the years since the financial crisis, banks have continued to lend to individuals and companies as well as raise money in the markets for their clients. And they have remained profitable. In the first quarter of this year, banks\u2019 profits were equivalent to 1.28 percent of their assets, which is significantly higher than the 1.03 percent median return since the mid-1980s, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Many investors feared that stock prices were being artificially supported by the Fed\u2019s extraordinary post-crisis monetary policies, like its enormous bond-buying programs. There were two main concerns: First, the policies might cause inflation to take off; second, once the Fed withdrew support, it could set off chain reactions that would cause the economy to slow and the stock market to fall. Neither has come to pass, at least so far.The Fed\u2019s policies may not have been as loose as they appeared. On a nominal basis, interest rates were indeed cut to historical lows. But what mattered is whether they were low after adjusting for inflation. It appears corporate borrowers did not get a huge break from the Fed: During the latest bull market, the yield on corporate bonds rated BAA by Moody\u2019s (a good and historical proxy for average corporate borrowers) was 3.7 percent on average, after adjusting for inflation. That compares with an average of 4 percent since 1950.When the United States became the epicenter of the financial crisis in 2008, it seemed unlikely that it would become a beacon for investors in the next decade. Yet, for the most part, that\u2019s what happened. Europe\u2019s economy took much longer to recover than America\u2019s, mostly because of the region\u2019s sovereign debt crises and a faltering approach to overhauling its banks. In emerging markets, a six-year slowdown that ended in 2017 deterred foreign investors.Almost by default the United States stock market became the most attractive place to invest. It only became more enticing as large American technology companies kept delivering impressive results. In 2008, United States stocks accounted for 36 percent of the total value of the world\u2019s stock markets, compared with 41 percent in 2017, according to data from the World Bank.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Betting Against Tesla Made $1 Billion on Friday", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe investors betting against Tesla just got a gift from the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.The day after the interview, the stock of the electric-car maker tumbled 9 percent to $306.Mr. Musk had long sparred with investors who make money when the company\u2019s stock falls. And he is bracing for the fight to get worse. Mr. Musk told The New York Times that he was expecting \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dTesla is among the most shorted stocks in the United States. More than a quarter of its stock valued at more than $11 billion is being shorted, according to S3 Partners.In March, a driver was killed after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot, Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, was in use.That same month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company was burning through cash.It has made for a bumpy ride for Tesla investors \u2014 on either side of the trade.Through it all, Mr. Musk\u2019s public attacks on shorts have only intensified.In May, he took to Twitter and warned of the \u201cshort burn of the century comin soon.\u201d A month later, he predicted that those wagering on the stock\u2019s decline \u201chad three weeks before their short position explodes.\u201d He even taunted David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund has performed poorly this year in part because of its short bet on Tesla.Mr. Musk has pointed to short-sellers as a reason he is considering taking Tesla private. In a message to employees explaining his thinking, he wrote: \u201cAs the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dHe isn\u2019t exactly right on his history of short-sellers. At various points in the past 10 years, the value of bets against Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson exceeded Tesla\u2019s high of roughly $13 billion, according to IHS Markit.The value of short bets against Alibaba currently stands at $25 billion.Even by the percentage of shares being shorted, it is not the highest. It's not even the biggest of 2018. So far this year, 26 companies have had a higher percentage of their stock shorted than Tesla did at its peak of 33 percent in May.But he does have a point about the persistence of short-sellers trying to profit on Tesla\u2019s troubles. The short position in Tesla\u2019s shares has remained above $10 billion for nearly five months. In the past decade, short-sellers have not held a position valued at more than $10 billion in any other American company for more than three months, according to IHS Markit.Betting against Tesla has been expensive. Since 2016, short-sellers collectively have lost $5 billion, as the company\u2019s shares rose 27 percent.Even this year, amid all of Tesla\u2019s woes, betting on a decline in the company\u2019s share price has not been a winner. Its short-sellers remain down $650 million this year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Civil Must America Be?", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans care about being nice. How do we disagree with our neighbors about guns?The shop\u2019s name stems from a term of derision for the teetotaling, lecture-friendly Congregationalists who settled the town in the 1850s. Those days are long over. Grinnellians now tend to keep any impulse to hector one of their neighbors under wraps.Pete Brownell, a well-known and well-liked local philanthropist, sometimes stops by Saints Rest for coffee on his way to work. He and his wife, Helen Redmond, have supported many projects in town, including a public library renovation and a residency program run by a local artists\u2019 collective. He is also the third-generation C.E.O. of Brownells, a major firearms company whose headquarters are here, which calls itself the country\u2019s \u201cleading supplier of firearm accessories, gun parts, and gunsmithing tools.\u201d Brownells sells and manufactures guns and ammunition. For much of the last year, Mr. Brownell also served as chairman of the board of the National Rifle Association.Grinnell is both progressive bastion and gun town, a place urbane and rural. It is home to an influential liberal arts college with an endowment of more than $1 billion, and also a Monsanto plant. Usually, these juxtapositions are a point of pride, if they are noteworthy at all.The first thing most everyone says is that the Brownells are good, generous people. Their children all go to school together. Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond care very much about making Grinnell a good place to live for everyone. The second thing people say is that they want to protect the family\u2019s privacy. Mr. Brownell\u2019s family did not choose his occupation, people point out. Besides, Ms. Redmond, who is president of the board of the Grinnell-Newburg Community School District, votes Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. She has donated to the progressive state-level political action committee her neighbors created last year. Everyone is clear that Pete Brownell\u2019s politics are his own.And while Ms. Abrahamson quietly resigned from the board of a community arts center when she realized that the group has accepted money from the Brownells, she did not say so at the time. Then, in 2016, Brownells opened a massive new warehouse, office and retail complex on the outskirts of town. It looms over Interstate 80. In May 2017, Mr. Brownell became the president of the N.R.A.\u2019s board. \u201cEach of these things were pushing people toward discomfort,\u201d Mr. Dobe said. \u201cLas Vegas broke it open.\u201dThis disquiet eventually bubbled up online. \u201cIt was clear that people had been holding back their feelings,\u201d said Eliza Willis, a professor of political science at Grinnell. A local Facebook group gave them the space to express their feelings. \u201cAll these people came out of the community making comments and expressing unhappiness about the facility and about his election to the presidency of the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Willis said.Others expressed their disagreement and their concern for the Brownell family\u2019s privacy. \u201cIt got quite active and a little heated,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a unified feeling about this.\u201dThe fracas also underscored the fact that no one seemed to have talked to Mr. Brownell about any of it directly. A day or two after the Las Vegas shooting, Ms. Abrahamson said, she phoned his office to invite him to meet with her and another pastor, Cameron Barr, to discuss ways they might \u201cwork together to increase gun safety.\u201d She said that her overture, which she repeated in a Facebook message, received no response.A week later, other members of the Grinnellians for Change Facebook group sent a letter asking for Mr. Brownell\u2019s attention. It was signed by 170 people and published in the Grinnell Herald-Register. The group wrote: \u201cNowhere are mutuality and reciprocity more important than in a small town such as ours.\u201d Mr. Dobe characterized their message this way: \u201cNow that you\u2019re the president of the N.R.A., we think you kind of owe us a conversation.\u201dAgain, Mr. Brownell did not answer. \u201cPete Brownell did not respond as a neighbor,\u201d said Kesho Scott, an associate professor of sociology and American studies at Grinnell. Ms. Scott\u2019s and Mr. Brownell\u2019s daughters are friends and sleep over at each other\u2019s houses. The parents see each other at the bank. \u201cAll of a sudden he wasn\u2019t responding to his neighbors,\u201d Ms. Scott said. Friends of the Brownells, including the Grinnell city manager, Russ Behrens, say that neighborliness is a two-way street. Members of his family had seen the Facebook group\u2019s angry, frustrated posts and comments, a couple of which suggested confronting Mr. Brownell with a vigil at his home. \u201cThere were people that could have sat in a room and had a conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. He and other friends have talked privately in the past with Mr. Brownell about his views on gun safety. He felt things got out of hand online. \u201cBy that time Pete almost had to go to his corner because they had already kind of set the message in and made their attacks. Nothing good was going to happen from that point on.\u201d \u201cIt really prevented any type of conversation,\u201d Mr. Behrens said.Mr. Brownell did meet with George Drake, a former president of the college who has been working with Ms. Abrahamson and others, on the condition that Mr. Drake keep the conversation confidential. Mr. Brownell\u2019s neighbors say they want to build on whatever common ground they share with him on gun politics. First, they have to know what that might be. (He also declined to speak with me.)His public remarks have been unsurprising in the national conversation, but also strike some as unneighborly. He echoes the N.R.A.\u2019s talking points on the Second Amendment, repeating that people he characterizes as \u201canti-American\u201d are trying to take away guns, which are our national heritage. He has a familiar mix of gun politic signifiers about ecological preservation, wildlife restoration, respect for military veterans, police and emergency medical workers. He has also said that he wants the N.R.A. to be an inclusive organization that supports L.G.B.T.Q. gun owners and other marginalized groups.Mr. Brownell\u2019s tone never fully matched the most aggressive rhetoric stemming from the N.R.A., like that of Dana Loesch, of its spokeswomen. Ms. Abrahamson and others said that they had hoped Mr. Brownell was going to use his role to modulate the N.R.A.\u2019s tone over what was supposed to be a two-year term. Nothing he has said in public suggests that he did. His neighbors may want to believe that his so-called real views, the ones he would share in private, are different from what he has said publicly. They also suspect it may not really matter. Like it or not \u2014 and many do like it \u2014 gun money does a lot for Grinnell.They have also supported a robotics team at Grinnell-Newburg High School. They have contributed to the Grinnell Area Arts Council and the Poweshiek County Community Fund.Brownells Inc., the gun company, has become an integral part of the economic health of the city. Alongside the college, Grinnell Mutual Insurance Company and the Grinnell Regional Medical Center, it is among Poweshiek County\u2019s largest employers. Founded in nearby Montezuma in 1939, where its headquarters were until 2016, Brownells was a relatively small and specialized business for its first 60 years. Since Mr. Brownell joined the company as an executive vice president in 1997, Brownells has acquired three other firearms companies, become a military defense contractor, secured a patent for its online ordering system, opened a retail store and undergone two expansions, the first of which the company almost immediately outgrew upon its completion in 2011. Reversing the trend, Mr. Behrens said, was the city\u2019s primary consideration in courting the relocation. The Brownells expansion was expected to create at least 162 new jobs in Grinnell and stimulate the city\u2019s housing market. There was almost no public opposition to the Brownells project. Records say that no one appeared for the scheduled public comment session held immediately before the City Council signed an initial development agreement in November 2012. With the exception of one letter to the editor of the Grinnell Herald-Register, Mr. Behrens said, \u201cThere was no pushback from the community at all,\u201d in part because there was great value in keeping a three-generation family business \u2014 \u201chopefully soon to be fourth,\u201d he added \u2014 in Poweshiek County. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we went out and recruited some random gun manufacturer,\u201d Mr. Behrens said. \u201cThis was about the expansion of an existing industry. We today have no reservations about doing it, and we would do it again.\u201dThis, says Kirsten Klepfer, the pastor of Grinnell\u2019s First Presbyterian Church, \u201cwoke me up.\u201d A week after the shooting, she preached an uncomfortable sermon at the Sunday morning service. \u201cIf we think there\u2019s no connection between Orlando and Brownells, we\u2019re probably not thinking hard enough,\u201d she said. Ms. Klepfer told her congregation that, the day before the store opened, she had approached Brownells seeking financial support for a new behavioral health program that was having a cash flow crisis. She subsequently withdrew the request. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed,\u201d she told her congregants. It had become clear to her that \u201cwe like them when they pump our community full of money, we turn our eyes when they pump our communities full of guns.\u201d She has since told another mental health organization she works with that she believes they should not take donations from Brownells.Ms. Klepfer, the church\u2019s leader for over a decade, may be the person with the strongest principled objection to what she sees as the community\u2019s complicity in the firearms industry. She may also be the person who struggles least with the moral complexity and social risk of raising such objections. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019re not a big church,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s mostly me.\u201d The Pulse shooting also moved Janet Carl, the recently retired director of the college\u2019s writing center, to action. Ms. Carl, who represented Grinnell in the Iowa Assembly for six years in the 1980s, said that the shooting prompted her to submit a letter to the Grinnell Herald-Register, the first she had ever written. After it ran, she was contacted by three other people who wanted to become more active on gun safety, colleagues who had had no idea that they shared her concerns. This was the origin of an ad hoc organizing group, which grew after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The group planned several weeks of protests and educational events to coincide with the five-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, including a silent walk to the Brownells facility. The \u201cNewtown\u201d screening took place on the college campus but was not a school-sponsored event, and the college has largely stayed out of local politics. Every faculty or staff member I spoke to was careful to say their efforts do not represent their employer. And the students, whatever their reputation for rabble-rousing, have not participated much in this off-campus effort. It was Grinnell alumni who brought the debate to campus. Shortly after Mr. Brownell became president of the N.R.A., Alana K. Smart, a 1968 Grinnell graduate, raised the question of whether the school, founded by an abolitionist, ought to accept money from the family. Ms. Smart, a chairwoman of Colorado Faith Communities United to End Gun Violence, discovered that the Brownells had made a named gift in to the college in 2014. Their gift helped create the Ignite Program, a community engagement effort that brings local elementary and high school students to campus. Ms. Smart and her classmates formed a group called Concerned Alumni of Grinnell College and set about expressing their concerns to the school. In October, members of the campus community learned about the alumni reaction through reporting in the student newspaper. This caught the attention of some faculty members. In June 2018, representatives of the Concerned Alumni group, on campus for their 50th reunion, delivered a petition to the college on behalf of 500 signatories. They asked the college to reject further gifts from Mr. Brownell, because he represents the N.R.A.\u2019s \u201cdeleterious impacts on the quality of American life.\u201d At the meeting, Raynard S. Kington, the president of Grinnell College, declined this prospect of vetting individual donors\u2019 affiliations before accepting gifts, calling it logistically onerous and ethically murky. Mr. Kington, appointed in 2011, has previously suggested that the disagreement over the donation is part of the college\u2019s educational commitment to facilitating civil debate over conflicting viewpoints. (\u201cGrinnellians,\u201d campus marketing copy reads, \u201cask hard questions and question easy answers.\u201d) She was chastised by members of the administration during a break in the meeting, she said, for her reporting. She was approached by Angela Voos, the vice president for strategic planning and Mr. Kington\u2019s chief of staff. \u201c\u2018Really? Again?\u2019\u201d Ms. Herman said Ms. Voos said, as she waved a copy of the newspaper. Ms. Voos complained that the story\u2019s characterization of Mr. Brownell as \u201c\u2018a major benefactor of college and community programs and organizations\u2019\u201d was \u201c\u2018misleading.\u2019\u201d Mr. Kington, Ms. Herman said, joined the conversation to agree. Ms. Voos told The New York Times that her memory of the episode is different, but that \u201cthe basis of the interaction is correct.\u201d Ms. Herman, she said, \u201cchose to combine a donor\u2019s philanthropy to the college with his philanthropy to the local community and then to conclude that he is a \u2018major benefactor\u2019 of the college.\u201d (Ms. Voos added that the Ignite program also had other internal funding sources.)In any event, the college says it cannot legally disclose the details of individual contributions without permission from the donor. It is possible that Mr. Brownell and Ms. Redmond have made or will make additional gifts under different disclosure conditions.Ms. Willis argued that accepting Brownell\u2019s money is effectively an endorsement of the N.R.A. \u201cThe college confers legitimacy by taking that donation,\u201d she said, contravening the institution\u2019s professed commitment to social justice. (Mr. Rebelsky and many other faculty members said they disagreed.) Ms. Willis also noted that the college, committed to improved town-gown relations, had much to gain by accepting a donation to start a program \u201caiming to educate kids in this community that aren\u2019t the children of college professors.\u201dThe college, Ms. Voos said, is proud of the program: \u201cWe see it as an extension of our mission to our local public schools.\u201d She notes that about a third of local elementary and high school students live in households that are eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and few have had much exposure to \u201cthe college experience,\u201d even in this college town. The program has just finished its fourth year. In other ways, the college and Brownells Inc. share similar goals as stewards of the local economy. City administrators have pinned their hopes for a revitalized downtown on both. In 2014, the city and the Brownells company jointly applied for funds from the Iowa Economic Development Authority. They were unsuccessful, but the city and the college received joint funding the following year, which was partly to support what the school calls its \u201cZone of Confluence\u201d project. A two-lane highway that divides the campus and the downtown area has long been a physical manifestation of the town-gown divide. The college and city government hope that investing in this area will connect the campus to the community and bring more money downtown. Here, it seems, everyone agrees.While he has not accepted \u2014 or rejected \u2014 invitations to speak with his neighbors, Mr. Brownell has, in his public role, spoken about them. Many of his remarks to N.R.A. members have traded on stereotypes about liberals. To the considerable anger of these neighbors, he positioned himself as the bemused and indulgent teacher of big-city professor types. In a 2010 profile that appeared on an N.R.A. website, Mr. Brownell took credit for creating what he called \u201ca gun culture\u201d at the college and for educating Grinnell students and faculty members about firearms. \u201cPrevious anti-gun sentiment at the college has been offset by an open-mindedness that never would have existed without a little push from Pete,\u201d the story said. In a 2011 interview posted on the N.R.A. YouTube channel, Mr. Brownell said that the students \u201chave never really broken through those things that somebody told them at a young age, and they\u2019ve never really experimented with changing their thoughts about just a larger picture.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, he had turned \u201ca couple of New York City professors\u201d into gun enthusiasts who visit shooting ranges when they travel. \u201cThese trips are \u2018Let\u2019s go to the Metropolitan Opera and on the way let\u2019s take our pistols.\u2019\u201d Few people had even seen these remarks until Ms. Smart unearthed them last year. Mr. Kington, the college president, agreed in June to denounce Mr. Brownell\u2019s statements about taking giddy Grinnell faculty members to the shooting range.No one I spoke to had any idea who he might have been talking about, nor did they remember Mr. Brownell ever coming to campus to discuss these issues. But they would not necessarily object if he did. Lecturing about \u201csomething he has expertise on,\u201d like the Second Amendment, Ms. Willis said, \u201cwould be completely keeping within an academic institution, the idea of critical thinking, all of that.\u201d All paths actually don\u2019t cross at Saints Rest. Anyone in Grinnell will tell you that there are three kinds of people in town: the college students, the \u201cCollege people\u201d \u2014 faculty, staff and the white-collar professionals in that orbit, which even includes clergy like Ms. Klepfer and Ms. Abrahamson \u2014 and \u201ceveryone else.\u201d There\u2019s another early-morning kaffeeklatsch at the Hardees across Highway 146, just outside of downtown. At lunchtime, farm-to-table Prairie Canary is a popular Main Street lunch spot, but lots of people head to the West Side Family Restaurant a mile away.\u201cCollege people\u201d have been the most involved in these debates. They recognize that they need to bring \u201ceveryone else\u201d into the conversation \u2014 Grinnell natives, farmers, blue-collar workers, Brownells employees, hospital staff \u2014 but have so far struggled to connect. \u201cThere are certainly people on both extremes that want to make an issue out of this,\u201d said Mr. Behrens, the city manager. But \u201cmost people in Grinnell go about their daily business. They\u2019re glad Brownells is here, they\u2019re glad the college is here.\u201d Whatever political conflict there might be \u201cnever really surfaces.\u201dSome people do cut cross all the cultures. Molly Miller\u2019s maternal grandparents owned both a farm in Poweshiek County and a diner downtown. She grew up in Iowa City, but she and her sister attended Grinnell College, and she lives and works in town. Ms. Miller, too, likes the Brownells. She also says their family\u2019s comfort comes at the expense of her family\u2019s own. In November 1991, her mother, Ann Rhodes, was a vice president at the University of Iowa when a physics graduate student shot and killed three department faculty members and a postdoctoral researcher and injured two administrators in another building, before killing himself. Ms. Rhodes, who was also the university\u2019s spokeswoman and tasked with handling the aftermath, was among the first to come upon a wounded colleague, who died the following day. Ms. Miller was just an infant at the time. She grew up knowing that the shooting had a lasting effect on her mother\u2019s physical and mental health, and on her family. \u201cI\u2019m going to inherit my family\u2019s farm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if my family\u2019s farm was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people every year, I think I would find a different livelihood.\u201d At the Fraternal Order of the Eagles club, I settled in for a beer ($1.75 a pint, frosted mug!) next to Steve Hardeman and his friends Teresa Coon and Roger Van Donselaar. Dr. Coon is a family physician, and engaged to Mr. Van Donselaar, a Grinnell native who has owned a farm for over 30 years. Mr. Hardeman, too, is a native who works in farming. Mr. Hardeman and Mr. Van Donselaar both grew up around firearms. Dr. Coon only recently relocated to Grinnell after more than two decades in the Quad Cities region of northwest Illinois and southeastern Iowa, a metropolitan area of nearly 400,000 people, where she ran a women\u2019s health medical practice for 25 years. Mr. Van Donselaar was pleasantly surprised when she managed to get him to have dinner at Prairie Canary. Ms. Coon does not share their views on firearms, which she cheerfully contested while jabbing Mr. Hardeman on the arm for emphasis. He was quite patient with this, up to a point.No one at the bar made fun of me when I timidly mentioned bump-fire stocks. (These accessories modify a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the firing rate of an automatic.) Shortly after the Las Vegas shooting, where a dozen bump stocks were found in the gunman\u2019s hotel room, retailers like Walmart and Cabela\u2019s stopped carrying them. Pages cached by the internet Archive and Google show that Brownells also removed the products from their online inventory sometime after Sept. 29, 2017; a company representative did not respond to a request to confirm the products\u2019 removal.For gun control advocates, this seems like a victory, and it may be \u2014 or it may not. State and local bump stock bans face legal challenges, and local ordinances banning the devices in Ohio have been overturned. More to the point, Mr. Hardeman said that he or most anyone at the bar could rig a semiautomatic firearm to simulate an automatic fire rate in 15 minutes, no bump stock needed. Brownells continues to carry parts and accessories that achieve similar results, including binary trigger modification parts, which ship to 44 states.Mr. Hardeman told me a familiar story. He is proud that he was able to contribute to his impoverished household in his boyhood by hunting small game. When he hears that gun owners are irresponsible, he tells me, he\u2019s affronted. To him, his neighbors are lumping him and his friends in with a group to which they don\u2019t belong. He said it seems impossible to talk with them. \u201cLiberals want to take my guns,\u201d he said. Virtually everyone in Grinnell has taken great care to say that they do not want to take anyone\u2019s guns. This includes Ms. Abrahamson and Ms. Scott, who says that the distinction between gun control and gun safety matters. \u201cMany of us are gun owners,\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to challenge the Second Amendment. We just want to know if there\u2019s safety where there are guns. This is not an anti-movement.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s what I hear all the time,\u201d Mr. Hardeman said, throwing up his hands. Before I could ask, the bartender set another frosted mug in front of me. \u201cNo, someone else got it for you,\u201d she said when I tried to pay.After all this not talking, few people seem to have thought about what they might actually say to Pete Brownell. \u201cPeople keep telling me they want to have a conversation,\u201d said Don A. Smith, an emeritus professor of history, emphasizing the last three words. \u201cWhen I ask them what they wish to have a conversation about, they say they don\u2019t know!\u201dMany people I spoke to brought up the concept of \u201cIowa nice\u201d in our conversations. During my visit, I ferried four hardy senior ladies back downtown after a protest across the highway from Brownells. I asked them whether there\u2019s any difference between Iowa, Midwestern and Minnesota nice. Everyone laughed, and someone piped up from the back seat, \u201cNo, but ours is better!\u201d \u201cIowa nice\u201d could be the solution or the problem. The social contracts of small-town life seem rather less sturdy these days. No amount of moral clarity or urgency has made it possible to overcome the hurdle of getting people \u201con all sides\u201d to talk to one another, even as they talk to one another about dozens of other things every day. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d Ms. Abrahamson said. \u201cI don\u2019t want his family hurt \u2014 and I mean in their spirit. I don\u2019t even know if we have that kind of effect on them or not. But I just think in a small town you just have to be more careful with each other.\u201dThe person who circulates among and across all these local tribes with the most ease is Mr. Brownell \u2014 certainly because of his wealth, if not also because of his fluency in the cultures that collide or coexist here. Our cultural ideas about civility and respect incline his neighbors to accept his silence. While many debate their right to carry big guns or their complicity in the gun epidemic, Mr. Brownell is, it seems, the only one who does not need to answer.Ms. Willis, a fifth-generation Iowan, calls the phenomenon \u201cIowa polite.\u201d And she said it had been tested. \u201cThat\u2019s actually kind of hard to maintain, because there\u2019s a sense of frustration that he won\u2019t talk to us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have maintained it.\u201d Surely it can\u2019t last. In May, Mr. Brownell declined to serve a second year as N.R.A. president and was replaced by Oliver North. He remains a member of the organization\u2019s board of directors. His work is not over. Last month, a group of Senate Democrats asked Mr. Brownell and six other N.R.A. leaders for details about a 2015 trip to Moscow. There, the delegation met Maria Butina, who was charged last month with being a covert Russian agent in an investigation unrelated to the probe by Robert S. Mueller, the special counsel.After the Parkland, Fla., shooting in February, stickers with the Brownells logo and the text \u201cBrownells, where school shootings are good for business\u201d appeared on walls and fixtures across downtown Grinnell. No one would say who was responsible for them. It was a strong breach of the oppressive contract of niceness. But it wasn\u2019t the only speech taking place in the public sphere. On my way out of town, I heard a radio spot advertising the can\u2019t-miss Brownells Second Amendment Sale that weekend.Advertisement"}
