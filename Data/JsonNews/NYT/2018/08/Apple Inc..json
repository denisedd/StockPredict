{"Headline": "With Alex Jones, Facebook\u2019s Worst Demons Abroad Begin to Come Home", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterWhen does speech become unsafe? When can it be limited? Should those decisions be up to a private company at all? And if a company shies away from acting, as Facebook did with Mr. Jones until Apple moved first, where does that leave the rest of us?But to activists and officials in much of the developing world, both the problem and Facebook\u2019s muddled solutions will be old news.Before there was Alex Jones, the American conspiracy theorist, there was Amith Weerasinghe, the Sri Lankan extremist who used Facebook as his personal broadcast station.And so on.\u201cFacebook doesn\u2019t seem to get that they\u2019re the largest news agency in the world,\u201d Harindra Dissanayake, a Sri Lankan official, said a few days after Mr. Weerasinghe\u2019s arrest.The problem, he said, goes beyond a few underregulated extremists. It also involves the algorithm-driven newsfeed that is core to the company\u2019s business model. \u201cThey are blind to seeing the real repercussions,\u201d Mr. Dissanayake said of Facebook\u2019s leaders.Developing countries\u2019 experiences with Facebook suggest that the company, however noble its intent, has set in motion a series of problems we are only beginning to understand and that the company has proved unable or unwilling to fully address:\u2014 Reality-distorting misinformation that can run rampant on the newsfeed, which promotes content that will reliably engage users.\u2014 Extremism and hate speech that tap into users\u2019 darkest impulses, and polarize politics.\u2014 Malicious actors granted near-limitless reach on one of the most sophisticated communications platforms in history, relatively unchecked by social norms or traditional gatekeepers.\u2014 And a private company uneager to wade into contentious debates, much less pick winners and losers.But chillingly similar Facebook-linked problems are becoming increasingly visible in wealthy, developed countries like the United States. So is the difficulty of solving those problems \u2014 and the consequences of Facebook\u2019s preference for action that can be incremental, reactive and agonizingly slow.Though Facebook officials often portray the violence associated with it as new or impossible to predict, the incidents date to at least 2012. So does the pressure to more actively regulate speech on the platform.\u201cI think in the back deep-deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen,\u201d Chamath Palihapitiya, a senior executive who left Facebook in 2011, said at a policy conference last year. \u201cWe have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.\u201dThere were other warnings, typically from activists or civil society leaders in the developing countries where Facebook\u2019s expansion was fastest and most obviously disruptive. But they were little heeded.\u201cFacebook is the platform that we could not meet with for years,\u201d Damar Juniarto, who leads an Indonesian organization that tracks online hate groups, told me in March.Facebook representatives eventually met with Mr. Juniarto, and the company has shut most pages associated with the Muslim Cyber Army.In the developing countries where such incidents seem most common, or at least most explicitly violent, Facebook simply faces little pressure to act.In Sri Lanka, government officials spoke of the company as if it were a superpower to be feared and appeased.Even officials in India, a major power, struggled to get the company to listen. Indian pressure on Facebook, however, has dropped since the arrival of new government leaders who rose, in part, on a Hindu nationalist wave still prevalent on social media.American officials have far greater leverage over Facebook, as members of Congress proved when lawmakers summoned Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive officer, to testify in April. But the Americans seem unsure what they want Facebook to do, or how to compel it to act. So they, too, are not very effective at changing the company\u2019s behavior.More broadly, Americans seem unsure precisely how far Facebook should go in regulating speech on the platform, or what it should do about the data suggesting that misinformation is more common on the political right.All of which comes through in Facebook\u2019s hesitation about shutting down Mr. Jones\u2019 page, despite his long record of demonstrable falsehoods that have real-world consequences.American commitment to free speech is unusually tied into the country\u2019s sense of itself. Still, the dilemma here is not so different from those government officials and Facebook itself face in places like Indonesia or Sri Lanka.So while few are comfortable \u2014 perhaps Facebook least of all \u2014 with a private company acting as a vastly powerful regulator of public speech, even fewer seem willing to step in and take on the task themselves.There are growing indications Facebook\u2019s problems in rich countries may go beyond misinformation to do the kind of harm developing countries have experienced.\u201cI think it does something to their sense of security,\u201d she said. \u201cThese things, if they reach thousands of people, you cannot get it back.\u201dThe platform has grown so powerful, so quickly, that we are still struggling to understand its influence. Social scientists regularly discover new ways that Facebook alters the societies where it operates: a link to hate crimes, a rise in extremism, a distortion of social norms.After all, Mr. Jones, for all his demagogic skills, was tapping into misinformation and paranoia already on the platform.In Germany, Gerhard Pauli, a state prosecutor based in Hagen, told me last month about a local firefighter trainee who had grown so fearful of refugees that he attempted to burn down a local refugee group house. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure that social media made it worse,\u201d he said.Mr. Pauli said that his office spent more and more time tracking rumors and hate speech on Facebook, and that it seemed to rise in advance of violence, as when the mayor of nearby Altena was stabbed last year.Though Germany is a major economy with some of the world\u2019s strictest social media regulations, Mr. Pauli had only somewhat more success with Facebook than his peers in the developing world.\u201cIn the beginning, they did nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would say, \u2018You have no jurisdiction over us.\u2019 In the last few years, they are more helpful, especially in cases of child abuse.\u201dBut, in other matters, the company remains skittish, Mr. Pauli said. \u201cThey do have a lot of information, but they don\u2019t want to lose users,\u201d he said.The prosecutor has grown especially concerned, he said, about social media rumors \u2014 say, a stranger near a school \u2014 that could spin ordinarily self-contained Germans into violence. Not so unlike in Sri Lanka or India.\u201cWe have lots of situations where somebody saw somebody outside the kindergarten,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin five minutes it\u2019s spreading, and from post to post, it gets worse. It takes two hours and then you have some lynch mob on the street.\u201dAmanda Taub contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google: Which Can Carry on a Conversation Best?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Advertisement\nDigital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can carry on a good conversation.We explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments \u2014 even in the moments when the assistants screwed up \u2014 showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.Because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how.Right away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called \u201cthese things\u201d to a shopping list.If your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said \u201cguacamole, chips, tortillas,\u201d he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn\u2019t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it.Alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren\u2019t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.A digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.When you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you\u2019ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.Engineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time \u2014 a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.In some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.Even if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with.When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.When you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.After recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.Engineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It\u2019s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.All of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don\u2019t change anything.Machine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\u201cIf you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,\u201d said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. \u201cThe technology operates by different rules than people do.\u201dIn the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don\u2019t use a pronoun?The devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That\u2019s likely because each device is using a different \u201cknowledge graph,\u201d a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp.Amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was \u201csluggish.\u201dA neural network also drives Google\u2019s new \u201cconversational mode.\u201dIn the past, you couldn\u2019t talk to the device without saying \u201cHey, Google.\u201d Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command \u2014 and when you\u2019re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with the interactions other people have had with their devices. Basically, Google\u2019s customers are helping Google build a smarter product.Don\u2019t expect these devices to tell you what they think \u2014 or even what other people think. It\u2019s easier to build technology that sticks to the facts. After asking these devices to identify the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which they all did correctly, we asked for their opinion of his work. None of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question, and Google eventually lost the context altogether.Engineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do, but conversation is such a complex task, even machine learning approaches will need years \u2014 or perhaps decades \u2014 to completely solve the problem.These devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self-reflection or complex analysis.This is an incredibly difficult question for a computer to answer, unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it. Many times, these devices will just reply with canned responses, as Google did with the Muffin Man bit.For now, you will have to make do with the Muffin Man.Note: The devices tested were the Apple HomePod, the Amazon Echo Plus and the Google Home. They were each tested separately. The phrases used to trigger the devices \u2014 \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey, Google,\u201d respectively \u2014 were used before each interaction, and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity.Audio production by Brad FisherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gatekeepers or Censors? How Tech Manages Online Speech", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple, Google and Facebook this week erased from their services many \u2014 but not all \u2014 videos, podcasts and posts from the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars site. And Twitter left Mr. Jones\u2019s posts untouched.The differing approaches to Mr. Jones exposed how unevenly tech companies enforce their rules on hate speech and offensive content. There are only a few cases in which the companies appear to consistently apply their policies, such as their ban on child pornography and instances in which the law required them to remove content, like Nazi imagery in Germany.When left to make their own decisions, the tech companies often struggle with their roles as the arbiters of speech and leave false information, upset users and confusing decisions in their wake. Here is a look at what the companies, which control the world\u2019s most popular public forums, allow and ban.Of all the tech companies, Facebook has faced the biggest public outcry over what it allows on its platform.Whenever the social media company has been pressed to explain its decision-making, it has referred to its community standards, a public document that outlines Facebook\u2019s rules for users. The company has outright bans against violent content, nudity and terrorist recruitment propaganda. The rules on other types of content, including hate speech and false news, are more ambiguous.Now, less than a month later, Facebook has banned Mr. Jones and removed four pages belonging to him \u2014 including one with nearly 1.7 million followers \u2014 for violating its policies. The ban means that while Mr. Jones still has an account and can view content on Facebook, he is suspended from posting anything to the platform, including to his personal page or any pages on which he is an administrator.The company has refused to say how many strikes is too many, however. It has also not answered questions on how long Mr. Jones will be banned or whether Facebook will be reviewing similar content posted by other right-wing conspiracy theorists.It\u2019s unclear whether the actions Facebook has taken against Mr. Jones signal a new approach by the company against hate speech or whether they are, once again, responding to an isolated case because of public pressure.\u2014 Sheera FrenkelUsers can flag videos that they believe violate those guidelines, which include bans on videos with nudity or sexual content or incite violence. YouTube will then review those flagged videos for potential violations. In addition, YouTube\u2019s computer systems also comb the site for videos that violate its rules.But many videos operate in a gray area. Even in YouTube\u2019s own explanation of \u201chateful content,\u201d the company calls it is a \u201cdelicate balancing act\u201d between free expression and protecting YouTube users.YouTube still hosts videos of Ahmad Musa Jibril, an Islamic cleric from Dearborn, Mich., whose sermons were viewed by one of the knife-wielding attackers in the terror attack on London Bridge last year. His sermons posed a quandary for the video service because the cleric does not directly call for violent jihad and is, therefore, not in clear violation of community guidelines. YouTube now presents Mr. Jibril\u2019s sermons behind a warning that the video has been deemed \u201cinappropriate or offensive\u201d by part of the YouTube community.Mr. Jones incurred two content violations from YouTube over the last year. In February, YouTube said he had violated its policies regarding harassment and bullying when a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a \u201ccrisis actor.\u201dIn Mr. Jones\u2019s most recent violation last month, YouTube took down four of his videos that included hate speech against Muslim and transgender people as well as footage of a child being shoved to the ground. YouTube said the videos had violated its policies pertaining to hate speech, harassment and child endangerment.\u2014 Daisuke WakabayashiTwitter\u2019s approach has provoked plenty of criticism, particularly around its lax handling of harassment. Celebrities like the actress Leslie Jones have been temporarily driven off the platform by swarms of abusers.Although the parents of several Sandy Hook shooting victims are suing Mr. Jones for defamation, a Twitter spokesman said that neither Mr. Jones\u2019s personal account nor his Infowars account are currently in violation of Twitter\u2019s policies. Tweets questioning the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., remain live on both accounts.The simultaneous takedowns across YouTube, Spotify and Facebook are troubling, said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. The number of bans in quick succession from multiple companies raised the specter that this could have been influenced by outside political pressure rather than a straightforward application of company policies, he said.Twitter\u2019s decision to allow Mr. Jones and Infowars to stay on its platform may reflect a commitment to consistent policy enforcement, Mr. Bankston said.\u201cA Twitter that\u2019s not accountable to its own rules is not accountable to anybody,\u201d he said.In a series of tweets late Tuesday, Mr. Dorsey suggested that other tech companies had caved to political pressure in their decision to remove Mr. Jones from their platforms and argued that journalists \u2014 not Twitter \u2014 were better suited to fact-checking Mr. Jones\u2019 claims.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t violated our rules,\u201d Mr. Dorsey wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories.\u201d\u2014 Kate CongerWithout a social-media platform, Apple typically avoids the content controversies that ensnare its peers. Yet the iPhone maker still makes many decisions about what apps, podcasts, songs and videos it will make available on its popular services.Apple\u2019s decision to ban the Infowars podcasts was surprising partly because an app that Infowars introduced last month was gaining steam on Apple\u2019s App Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 33rd most popular news app on the app store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones\u2019s bans spread, the Infowars app was Apple\u2019s fourth most popular news app, outranking every mainstream news organization.How Apple decides which apps violate those policies is more vague, however. Apple said in its policy: \u201cWe will reject apps for any content or behavior that we believe is over the line. What line, you ask? Well, as a Supreme Court Justice once said, \u2018I\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u2019 And we think that you will also know it when you cross it.\u201d\u2014 Jack NicasAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft Drivers Rush to Register Cars Ahead of City\u2019s New Cap", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the pouring rain, hundreds of people lined up outside a building in Queens on Monday, clutching umbrellas and paperwork. The frenzy was not driven by a buzzy new restaurant or a new Apple store. Instead the line led to an Uber office and was prompted by the City Council\u2019s recent decision to limit ride-hail apps by imposing a cap on new vehicle licenses.For hours, drivers waited outside the building in Long Island City for Uber workers to let them in and to register their cars as for-hire vehicles before the legislation goes into effect. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he is planning to sign the bill into law on Tuesday.Mohammed Kabir, 47, a driver from Queens, said he spent four hours before emerging from Uber\u2019s office with his paperwork in order. He said he had arrived at 7 a.m., hoping to beat the crowd, and despite the long wait he said he was content that he now had what he needed to beat the deadline.Since the Council\u2019s vote on the new regulations, which includes establishing a minimum pay rate, Uber had been encouraging existing drivers and others who wanted to become drivers for the tech giant to make sure they applied for the special license plates needed to register private cars as ride-hail vehicles. Once the legislation becomes law, no new licenses, with the exception of wheelchair accessible vehicles, will be granted for a year while the city studies the impact of the ride-hail industry.Some drivers waited for almost two hours before being shepherded inside. Red Ferhani, 32, said he had been driving for Uber for almost three years by renting cars from other Uber drivers. Tired of losing part of his profit to rental fees, Mr. Ferhani said he wanted to register his own vehicle while he still could.\u201cI guess everybody\u2019s doing this last minute,\u201d said Mr. Ferhani as he approached the front of the line. Despite the hassle, Mr. Ferhani said he supported the cap.\u201cI think there\u2019s enough Uber cars out there, it\u2019s already enough,\u201d he said.Some drivers at Uber\u2019s offices said they had not had enough time to get their documents and licensing fees in order. To register a car as a for-hire vehicle, owners must complete an online application with the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission, have commercial insurance for their car and pay a $550 to $625 fee, depending on their car\u2019s mileage.Deniz Osor, 37, was in line only because his friend had warned him days before that the window to apply was closing. Mr. Osor scrambled to get his paperwork in order.\u201cThey should\u2019ve actually extended the time for at least another two weeks,\u201d Mr. Osor said.Alix Anfang, a spokeswoman for Uber, said the City Council and Mr. de Blasio had rushed the cap through \u201cwithout stopping to think about the consequences for hard-working drivers who have been saving up to get out of a rental and into a car they own.\u201dJose Reyes, an Uber driver from Brooklyn, said he knew people who bought cars in order to register them before the cap was passed.Uber had prepared for the surge of drivers to its New York offices by shifting employees from New Jersey and Connecticut and opening their doors an hour early. Despite the extra hands, applicants said they were expecting the process to take two to three hours. The usual wait time in the Queens office, according to an Uber worker, is usually 20 minutes.Frustrated with how slow the line was on Sunday, Syed Hassan, an Uber driver, left after an hour.The line, he said, went around the building. \u201cThere were more than 1,000\u201d drivers waiting, he estimated. Still, he returned on Monday with a friend to keep him company.The crowd on Monday was smaller, but that did not make it any less hectic. Uber workers admonished drivers to stay in an orderly line. Once inside, drivers were directed to the second floor where they were given instructions, depending on the stage of their applications.Some drivers, after seeing the long list of requirements, decided to wait until the cap is lifted before registering their car. Diakanke Bah, 28, was on her way out after being told that she would probably not meet the deadline since she still had to get a for-hire driver\u2019s license.\u201cIf I do get my license, I will have to probably rent out someone who has already registered with the T.L.C., but it won\u2019t be with my car,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Apple Is the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School.Those interpretations obscure Apple\u2019s other accomplishment \u2014 pioneering a financial model that is the envy of corporate America. Sure, Apple produces innovative phones and laptops, but look inside its sleek exterior and you\u2019ll find an elegant financial machine that has become the ideal for corporate America. Without investing significantly in hard assets, Apple spins cash and returns it to shareholders at a stunning rate. It\u2019s difficult not to admire.But the model that has been perfected at Apple is risky and imitated poorly by many American corporations. The next decade will reveal whether these imitations were a series of brilliant moves or large-scale financial engineering.Apple has $115 billion of debt outstanding, and it has distributed $288 billion to its shareholders in the past six years, most of it through share buybacks. In the most recent nine months alone, Apple bought back $54 billion worth of shares.This transformation is representative of trends in corporate America. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have issued on net over $1.3 trillion of debt and retired over $1.9 trillion of equity over the past four years. American companies are borrowing money to buy their own shares in what is tantamount to a huge, slow-motion leveraged buyout.Apple has conducted its buybacks responsibly: It bought shares when they were relatively cheap, rewarding the patient shareholder. Other companies have not been so prudent, taking on debt to make ill-timed purchases of expensive shares rather than investing in growth opportunities. In some cases, they have done so simply to push up share prices so that management can meet goals for quarterly earnings or metrics that trigger compensation.Second, Apple\u2019s financial model emphasizes cash flow over profits. Apple is not simply immensely profitable; in 2017, it generated $16 billion more in operating cash flow than profits. It does that in part by running its day-to-day operations in a distinctive way. Typically, a company has to use external funds to fund the process of stocking goods and collecting revenue from customers.Apple\u2019s model turns this upside down. Its retail stores collect cash from customers quickly, it is ruthless on keeping inventory low, and it takes forever to pay suppliers. In the process, Apple\u2019s operations are extremely effective cash generators. This is no coincidence. It is the result of the canny supply chain that Tim Cook built. In effect, Apple has largely been financed on the backs of its suppliers, who are willing to hold their inventory and wait more than 100 days to get paid, just for the pleasure of doing business with Apple.This restructuring of operations to minimize inventory, move to subscription models (which generate predictable streams of cash) and keep suppliers waiting has become the dominant pattern in large corporations. Amazon, for example, generates relatively small profits but mountains of cash through this process. But this emphasis on cash also means that executives can become wary of making capital expenditures, such as new factories or server farms. This kind of spending can increase profits in the long run but bites into cash flow in the short run. That is a recipe for sluggish corporate investment, just as we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the financial crisis.Finally, Apple is the epitome of an \u201casset light\u201d company: It owns very few hard assets and therefore needs almost zero outside capital to run its business. As of mid-2018, Apple has $105 billion of operating assets and $120 billion of operating liabilities. What does that mean? Miraculously, its operations rely on no capital from outside financiers.How does one achieve this apotheosis of the asset-light strategy? First, create a supply chain in Asia run by companies willing to invest in low-return projects that create your products. Second, hold those suppliers under your thumb. Idolizing asset-light strategies, however, can also lead to underinvestment, an excessive reliance on outsourcing and the artificial division of companies to avoid hard assets.The accomplishments of Apple\u2019s model are substantial. But the financial strategy that has worked so well for Apple is a risky one for less capable companies with weaker strategic positions. For them, aping Apple can just as easily result in too much debt on their balance sheets, precarious supply chains and deferred opportunities for investments.The financial archetype defined by Apple \u2014 asset-light strategy, leveraged share buybacks and cash flow above all \u2014 is a high-wire act. Boards should guard against the temptation to follow Apple\u2019s path blindly. Big investors, especially mutual funds and pension funds that represent so many individuals, should question the management of any company that does. Many of Apple\u2019s imitators are more likely to mortgage the future than create it.Mihir A.

Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital.

To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Apple\u2019s March Toward $1 Trillion Could Cause It to Stumble", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple\u2019s flirtation with $1 trillion may be distracting investors from a big challenge: Can customers stomach continued price increases for its iPhone?Investors were impressed when Apple reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter, or the three months through June, on Tuesday. The company\u2019s stock jumped nearly 6 percent on Wednesday and pushed its market value to nearly $973 billion.Apple sold only 1 percent more iPhones, by far its main source of revenue, than a year earlier. But revenue from iPhones surged 20 percent from a year earlier because their average selling price rose 20 percent.The positive spin was that Apple was able to keep its sales price up. Customers, it seems, are willing to pay $1,000 or more for the iPhone X, released at the end of 2017.The average iPhone price usually drops as the selling cycle progresses. That is happening this year, but the decline has not been as steep. The $724 average price in Apple\u2019s third quarter was 9 percent below the $796 average in the company\u2019s first quarter (the fourth quarter of 2017). That was less than the 13 percent decline after the iPhone release at the end of 2016.And the company\u2019s revenue forecast suggests that the iPhone\u2019s financial performance is not about to disappoint in the current quarter.What\u2019s not to like about this situation? Apple may not be able to get away with such a large price increase when it releases its new phones at the end of this fiscal year. When the current batch of iPhones was released, Apple hoisted its average iPhone price by 29 percent, by far the highest increase of the past five releases. In other words, there may not be much headroom left for further hikes, especially since the new iPhones are not expected to be substantially different from the current models.Jeffrey Kvaal, an analyst at Nomura, forecasts that the average iPhone price will rise only 3 percent in Apple\u2019s 2019 fiscal year, compared with 15 percent for all of its 2018 fiscal year.Of course, if Apple does try to charge a lot more, it may sell fewer iPhones, denting revenue as a result. And iPhone sales in China, a huge and growing market for Apple, will be at risk if a full-blown trade war with the United States breaks out and Chinese consumers pull back as a result.Apple makes so much money that it can ride out underwhelming iPhone cycles. Investors, however, have in the past soured on Apple\u2019s stock when its iPhones fail to excite and revenue fails to match investors\u2019 high expectations. So far, selling expensive iPhones has kept Apple\u2019s profits surging and pushed its valuation within spitting distance of $1 trillion. But the strategy may not have staying power, and Apple could just as easily stumble after it has passed that milestone.Advertisement"}

Two Decades Ago, It Was Almost Bankrupt.", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple\u2019s ascent from the brink of bankruptcy to the world\u2019s most valuable public company has been a business tour de force, marked by rapid innovation, a series of smash-hit products and the creation of a sophisticated, globe-spanning supply chain that keeps costs down while producing enormous volumes of cutting-edge devices.A look at how Apple\u2019s trillion-dollar value stacks up against other companies and entire industries.\u201cCould anyone really imagine this back then?\u201d said Apple\u2019s former software chief Avie Tevanian, who joined Apple in 1997. \u201cWe hoped to make the company very successful and very valuable. But to think it would get to where it was today? Of course not. And Steve wouldn\u2019t have thought that, either.\u201dApple was founded in 1976 with the mission of making computers \u2014 then bulky, complicated industrial machines \u2014 cheap, small and simple so they could become a mass-market product. By the 1980s, the company was one of the world\u2019s best-known brands.But in 1985, Mr. Jobs was ousted in a boardroom coup. In the following years, the company was increasingly outgunned and outmaneuvered in the personal-computer market it helped invent.Apple, hamstrung by a lack of new ideas, failed products and leadership turmoil, had lost its way.Fred Anderson, Apple\u2019s former chief financial officer, said that shortly after he joined in 1996, he initiated a $661 million bond offering to keep the company afloat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how bad it was until I started digging in,\u201d he said.By the end of that year, Apple had lost $867 million and the total value of its shares was less than $3 billion.The ailing company decided to take a gamble. It bought Next, a tech firm run by Mr. Jobs, for $400 million. Mr. Jobs, still synonymous with the Apple brand, would return to the company he had founded.Mr. Jobs slashed 70 percent of Apple\u2019s product plans, commissioned the company\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d ad campaign and reimagined how it put its products together.The focus on simplicity became a hallmark of Apple, from the way Mr. Jobs dressed \u2014 jeans and black mock turtlenecks became his uniform of sorts \u2014 to the way his products operated to the eventual look of his company\u2019s retail stores.In 1998, Apple introduced the iMac G3, a round, colorful, all-in-one desktop computer. It became a hit. Apple had its swagger back.The company\u2019s revitalization was confirmed with the iPod, the portable music player that almost immediately changed consumers\u2019 relationship with music. The iPod, which debuted in 2001 and went on to sell more than 400 million units, showed that Apple wasn\u2019t just a computer company. The device was paired with iTunes, the company\u2019s music store, which would help upend the recording industry. And it portended a bigger product to come.\u201cThe iPod was a step \u2014 a really important one,\u201d said Ken Kocienda, a longtime Apple software engineer who will soon release a book about Apple called \u201cCreative Selection.\u201d \u201cBut the iPhone was really the definitive answer to the question: What comes next after personal computers?\u201dThe iPhone transformed the way society interacts with technology, and quickly became one of the best-selling products ever: More than 1.4 billion have been sold since it was introduced in 2007.No product or decision was remotely as instrumental to Apple\u2019s rise to $1 trillion as the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs first announced the iPhone, Apple was worth $73.4 billion.Former employees and analysts said that while Mr. Jobs deserved credit for overseeing the reinvention of the company\u2019s vision and its innovation, his successor, Timothy D. Cook, had also played a crucial role in the turnaround by overhauling the way Apple built its products.Mr. Cook, as chief operating officer under Mr. Jobs, remade Apple\u2019s distribution pipeline to heavily rely on contract manufacturers in China, which gave it the flexibility, cost savings and scale to build such a big business.As chief executive, Mr. Cook has also overseen most of the rise in Apple\u2019s value. (The total value of the company\u2019s shares was $346 billion when he took the helm in August 2011.) Mr. Cook has been a steady, if unflashy, hand as chief executive, building the iPhone into a huge business, including sales of accessories and services off it.Now, with Apple reaching the $1 trillion milestone and the iPhone turning 11 years old, pressure is likely to increase for the company to develop a hit new product.There have been other popular devices, like the iPad, the Apple Watch and routinely updated versions of Apple\u2019s personal computers. But none have come close to the impact of the iPhone.The company also has been linked to self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses, but Apple would face major technical and even social hurdles with either product.\u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most miraculous corporate turnarounds in business history,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a technology analyst and consultant who has tracked the company for nearly 40 years. \u201cThe question going forward is: Can Apple continue to innovate?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The tax plan, congressional leaders said, would turbocharge the American economy and provide a much-needed helping hand to working-class families.So, more than six months since President Trump signed the tax cut into law, is it delivering on the promises Mr. Ryan and other leaders made?By spending a big chunk of their tax windfall on buying back shares, businesses are boosting demand for and, thus, the price of their stock.

{"Headline": "Facebook Banned Infowars. Now What?", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftLate on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Mark Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.For weeks, the Facebook chief executive and his colleagues had debated what to do about Infowars, the notorious far-right news site, and Alex Jones, Infowars\u2019 choleric founder, who became famous for his spittle-flecked rants and far-fetched conspiracies, including the idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax promoted by gun-control supporters.Mr. Jones is just one Facebook user out of 2.2 billion, but he had become symbolic of tech platforms\u2019 inconsistency and reluctance to engage in a misinformation war.These posts clearly violated Facebook\u2019s hate speech rules. And in a normal situation, a low-level content moderator might have reviewed them, found that they qualified, and taken them down.The situation was volatile enough that Mr. Zuckerberg got personally engaged, according to two people involved in Facebook\u2019s handling of the accounts. He discussed Infowars at length with other executives, and mused privately about whether Mr. Jones \u2014 who once called Mr. Zuckerberg a \u201cgenetic-engineered psychopath\u201d in a video \u2014 was purposefully trying to get kicked off the platform to gain attention, they said.Mr. Zuckerberg, an engineer by training and temperament, has always preferred narrow process decisions to broad, subjective judgments. His evaluation of Infowars took the form of a series of technical policy questions. They included whether the mass-reporting of Infowars posts constituted coordinated \u201cbrigading,\u201d a tactic common in online harassment campaigns. Executives also debated whether Mr. Jones should receive a \u201cstrike\u201d for each post containing hate speech (which would lead to removing his pages as well as the individual posts) or a single, collective strike (which would remove the posts, but leave his pages up).\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,\u201d he said.Slippery-slope fears about mass censorship by social media platforms are probably overblown. For starters, Infowars presented an unusual case because of its size, the extreme nature of its content and the ferocity of Mr. Jones\u2019s critics. Mr. Zuckerberg does not have time to adjudicate every dispute over hate speech on Facebook, nor does he want to.One lesson Mr. Zuckerberg has taken from the Infowars saga, said the people involved in the handling of Mr. Jones\u2019s Facebook accounts, is that the social network\u2019s policies are overly complex and need to be simplified. Privately, company officials have also downplayed the Infowars bans, saying they don\u2019t represent a watershed moment in the online free speech debate, but are rather a matter of how to enforce Facebook\u2019s existing policies.This is a convenient narrative, of course, from a company that would rather haggle over terms of service than discuss the power and governance of its platform.There are legitimate questions, still unanswered, about what to do about the huge, unaccountable corporations that control large pieces of our modern communications infrastructure. Both fans and critics of Infowars can probably agree that a system in which one executive can decide to shut off a news organization\u2019s access to a large portion of its audience is hardly ideal.There are also valid questions about why Infowars got so popular in the first place, and whether attention-maximizing platforms like Facebook and YouTube are designed in ways so that people like Mr. Jones are incentivized to push the boundaries of acceptable speech.After all, these platforms didn\u2019t just host Infowars content for those who were seeking it \u2014 they actively promoted it to millions of people for years, through algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines that decide which videos to show you next. Could these platforms be redesigned so that the next Alex Jones never gets that kind of boost, and remains on the ideological fringes?These questions will have to wait. For now, tech leaders seem satisfied to have dealt with their Infowars problems, at least temporarily. They will return to their defensive crouch, hiding their power behind policies, making small changes under pressure, and hoping that nobody notices the size of their footprints.Advertisement"}

While YouTube says fake views represent just a tiny fraction of the total, they still have a significant effect by misleading consumers and advertisers. Drawing on dozens of interviews, sales records, and trial purchases of fraudulent views, The New York Times examined how the marketplace worked and tested YouTube\u2019s ability to detect manipulation.Inflating views violates YouTube\u2019s terms of service. But Google searches for buying views turn up hundreds of sites offering \u201cfast\u201d and \u201ceasy\u201d ways to increase a video\u2019s count by 500, 5,000 or even five million. The sites, offering views for just pennies each, also appear in Google search ads.By Michael H.

Other buyers were a filmmaker working for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, and the head of video at The New York Post. (Al Jazeera and The Post said the workers were not authorized to make such purchases and were no longer employed there.)Multiple musicians bought views to appear more popular: YouTube views factor into metrics from the ratings company Nielsen and song charts including Billboard\u2019s Hot 100.Some companies bought views for clients with the promise of social media promotion that would result in real people watching their videos.Dr. Judith Oppenheimer, 78, paid a company $5,000 to promote a book she had self-published in hopes of securing a mainstream deal. Her video soon had over 58,000 views, delivered through Devumi.\u201cThere was no increase in sales and no book deal,\u201d she said. \u201cSoon after I signed the contract I thought, \u2018I\u2019ll have no proof of what they do or don\u2019t do.\u2019 Now it begins to make sense. They can do it in a day.\u201dPurveyors depend on constantly evolving tactics to deliver views, including automated or \u201cbot\u201d traffic and pop-under videos on unsuspecting users\u2019 computers, but YouTube says it has effective processes to defend against these approaches.\u201cThis has been a problem we have been working on for many, many years,\u201d said Jennifer Flannery O\u2019Connor, YouTube\u2019s director of product management. The company\u2019s systems continuously monitor a video\u2019s activity, and the anti-fraud team often buys views to understand better how these sites operate, she said. \u201cOur anomaly detection systems are really good.\u201dStill, the challenges are significant. At one point in 2013, YouTube had as much traffic from bots masquerading as people as it did from real human visitors, according to the company. Some employees feared this would cause the fraud detection system to flip, classifying fake traffic as real and vice versa \u2014 a prospect engineers called \u201cthe Inversion.\u201d\u201cThe problem itself was extraordinary,\u201d said Blake Livingston, a member of YouTube\u2019s fraud and abuse team at the time who has since left the company.But fixes were made that relieved the fake-traffic surge, which YouTube said resulted from an attack against the website.\u201cView count manipulation will be a problem as long as views and the popularity they signal are the currency of YouTube,\u201d Mr. Livingston said.It took Mr. Vassilev about 18 months to go from being on welfare and living with his father in Canada to buying a white BMW 328i and a house of his own.By late 2014, his website was on the first page of Google search results for buying YouTube views, fulfilling 150 to 200 orders a day and bringing in more than $30,000 a month, he said. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t believe you could make that much money online,\u201d he said. The Times reporter\u2019s order on his site, for 25,000 views, was fulfilled one day later.A spokeswoman for Google, which is owned by the same company as YouTube, said that sites selling views appeared in search results because they were relevant, but that there was \u201croom for improvement\u201d in warning users.Mr. Vassilev declined to name his clients but said that many orders came from public relations or marketing firms.Today, he fills most orders through SMMKings.com, a wholesale supplier run by Sean Tamir, 29. Mr. Tamir charges him about a dollar for a thousand views, which Mr. Vassilev resells for $13.99, throwing in 100 free likes.One purveyor, Carlton E. Bynum II, 24, uses advertising to attract customers. He collected more than $191,000 in revenue this year but spent over $109,000 in ads that appeared at the top of Google, according to financial records. His site, GetLikes.click, run from a home office in Houston, sells YouTube views as well as Instagram and Twitter followers, Facebook likes and SoundCloud plays.Google does not allow ads with terms like \u201cbuy YouTube views.\u201d But Mr. Bynum said one workaround was to misspell the words and submit an ad multiple times if it was denied at first. When asked about advertising for paid YouTube views, Google removed some of the ads, including Mr. Bynum\u2019s, but similar ones returned after two weeks.Before Mr. Bynum sold views, he was buying them for himself. After he was discharged from the Marine Corps last year, he began posting product reviews on YouTube and taking a cut when visitors made purchases using his links. The views he bought would often cause his videos to rank higher than his competitors\u2019 in search, he said. The effect would snowball: His videos would gain traffic through search, and he would make more money. (A YouTube spokeswoman said views were just one factor among many that affected search rankings.)\u201cIt worked great,\u201d he said. \u201cI can get views within a day. I can get likes within hours.\u201dMr. Bynum said he believed real people were watching his videos. \u201cBut let\u2019s say there\u2019s a small chance I\u2019m wrong and it is bots,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir videos are still getting ranked.\u201dMr. Vassilev, who also said he used fake views to increase the search ranking of videos promoting his website, makes no pretense that what he is selling is authentic viewership. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said.The salesman on the phone said it would be simple: Elizabeth Clayton, a retired English and psychology professor, could pay Hancock Press $4,200 to publicize her self-published works of poetry. The company said online promotion, including 40,000 guaranteed YouTube views, would translate into sales, emails show.Ms. Clayton, 77, was optimistic. She had been publishing for seven years but had not sold much. One royalty check came to $1.47, another to $0.75. She signed up for Hancock to promote two videos, costing her $8,400, records show.\u201cThey told me if I got a certain number of hits I would sell a certain amount,\u201d she said.Instead of traditional marketing, Hancock paid $270 for 55,000 views from Devumi for each video, the records show. The views eventually reached about 60,000, where they remain. But there was no increase in sales. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t tell me anything about the people that were watching the video,\u201d Ms. Clayton said. \u201cI suspected something, but I couldn\u2019t get any information.\u201dWayne Hancock, the 92-year-old chief executive of the Arkansas-based company, said he believed real people were watching the videos. That\u2019s how Devumi marketed its views. Mr. Hancock\u2019s daughter, K. C. Shay, who helps run the business, dismissed Ms. Clayton\u2019s documents and the Devumi receipts as fakes.But Devumi records show that Hancock Press spent about $26,000 over three years, obtaining more than five million views for 75 or so authors. Interviews with six other Hancock clients are consistent with Ms. Clayton\u2019s experience.Many Devumi clients came from the music industry, where buying views is common and often seen as necessary. \u201cYouTube is one of the premier sources of music consumption and an important indicator of musical trends and popularity,\u201d said Silvio Pietroluongo, a vice president at Billboard.As a new artist, Aleem Khalid hired Crowd Surf, a promotion company, in 2014. Without his knowledge, he said, the firm bought 10,000 views each on three of his videos. They now have between 11,000 and 42,000 views. \u201cThe beautiful thing about these social media platforms is when they came out it was genuine. But now I feel it\u2019s all fake,\u201d said Mr. Khalid, 25. (Cassie Petrey, a co-founder of Crowd Surf, said she thought Devumi was producing real views, based on statements on its website.)Others who relied on Devumi said they were similarly surprised at the company\u2019s tactics. Ami Horowitz, the conservative filmmaker, bought 10,000 views for a video he appeared in \u2014 \u201cWhat We Learned at the People\u2019s Climate March\u201d \u2014 on the YouTube channel for Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers\u2019 political influence group. Mr. Horowitz, who is often a guest on Fox News, also bought views for a video about the protests in Ferguson, Mo.In a statement, he said he had believed Devumi worked like traditional web advertising. But \u201cit wasn\u2019t what we expected,\u201d he said, adding that he never used Devumi or similar services again. A spokeswoman for Americans for Prosperity called the behavior unethical and said the group would \u201cnot knowingly engage\u201d in it.YouTube\u2019s engineers, statisticians and data scientists are constantly improving in their ability to fight what Ms. O\u2019Connor calls a \u201cvery hard problem,\u201d but the attacks have \u201ccontinually gotten stronger and more sophisticated,\u201d she said.After the Times reporter presented YouTube with the videos for which he had bought views, the company said sellers had exploited two vulnerabilities that had already been fixed. Later that day, the reporter bought more views from six of the same vendors. The view count rose again, though more slowly. A week later, all but two of the vendors had delivered the full amount.By Michael H. Keller | Source: New York TimesEven when it looks closely, YouTube can miss videos with fake views. A 2017 Google public report on disinformation during the 2016 election looked at RT\u2019s YouTube channels, concluding that there was \u201cno evidence of manipulation of our platform or policy violations.\u201d Yet The Times recently found that an RT employee bought fake views for videos in 2016, which YouTube acknowledged it did not detect.James Brown, a correspondent for RT, had purchased 30,000 views and 300 likes across three videos that focused on problems involving homelessness and immigration in Europe. Mr. Brown said he took Devumi at its word that the views would be real people. An RT spokeswoman said the company was unaware of the purchases and was conducting an internal review.\u201cIt concerns me that while Twitter and Facebook appear to have made some credible progress in this area, YouTube still struggles to identify inauthentic and coordinated activity on its platform,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.\u201cThe only way YouTube could eliminate this is if they removed the view counter altogether,\u201d said Mr. Vassilev, the fake-view seller. \u201cBut that would defeat the purpose of YouTube.\u201dTo test the effectiveness of websites selling fake YouTube views, a New York Times reporter created 13 videos using clips from presidential speeches. The reporter uploaded the videos onto a new channel under his first name and last initial and did not share or post them.Views were bought through nine vendors, sometimes with varying specifications. On one site, for example, the reporter purchased United States-targeted views, so-called high-retention views and generic ones. Aug. 6, 2018July 11, 2018April 23, 2018Jan. 27, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Wednesday, Infowars was the No. 1 overall \u201ctrending\u201d app on the Google Play store, a metric that reflects its sudden momentum. Among news apps, Infowars was No. 3 on Apple and No. 5 on Google, above all mainstream news organizations. And the app stood at No. 66 overall on Google, excluding game apps, while on Apple it reached No. 49, above popular apps like LinkedIn, Google Docs and eBay.The Infowars app, which includes news articles and the shows of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, had likely been downloaded a few hundred to a few thousand times a day on average after its introduction last month, said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, which tracks app data. Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.The surge suggests the tech industry\u2019s recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles.\u201cThis is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,\u201d said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s gone from being niche to being mainstream.\u201dApple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed.The Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, \u201cThe Alex Jones Show,\u201d \u201cWar Room with Owen Shroyer,\u201d and \u201cReal News with David Knight.\u201d Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News.An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store.\u201cWe strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines.\u201dGoogle said it deleted Mr. Jones\u2019s channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment \u2014 not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones\u2019s podcast and his Infowars app.Google said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, \u201cIf an app violates our policies, we take action.\u201dFrom July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app\u2019s rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days.Researchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula.The Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a \u201cyou\u201d tab for saved articles.)On the tab that led to the outlet\u2019s news articles, a sampling of the app\u2019s stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (\u201cDemocrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!\u201d) to sensationalist (\u201cShock: FDA Acquiring \u2018Fresh\u2019 Aborted Baby Parts to Make \u2018Humanized Mice\u2019\u201d) to humdrum (\u201cCalorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years \u2014 Study\u201d).Many of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley\u2019s removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category \u201cInfowars Exclusives\u201d on the app included no stories.The merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills.One ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with \u201ccensored\u201d tape over his mouth and said: \u201cFight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special. Shop now!\u201dThe app has earned a nearly perfect rating on Apple after 5,500 reviews. \u201cGood to have IW on the go, able to keep up with what the Democrat globalist Luciferian communist are up to at all times,\u201d one recent review said.Advertisement"}

Libel and slander are not.Mr. French is a First Amendment litigator and senior writer for National Review.Right now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it and undoubtedly there\u2019s a cover-up, there\u2019s actors, they\u2019re manipulating, they\u2019ve been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\u201dWould that it were that simple. Rather than applying objective standards that resonate with American law and American traditions of respect for free speech and the marketplace of ideas, the companies applied subjective standards that are subject to considerable abuse. Apple said it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Facebook accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d or using \u201cdehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d YouTube accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201chate speech and harassment.\u201d Exhibit A of how wrong the center has been: In June, it paid Maajid Nawaz $3.375 million for labeling him an \u201canti-Muslim extremist.\u201d This is rich, considered Mr. Nawaz is a former Islamist turned Muslim reformer.One doesn\u2019t even have to look to Big Tech to see the almost infinite malleability of the \u201chate speech\u201d label. In the name of stopping hate speech, university mobs have turned their ire not just against alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer, but also against the most mainstream of conservative voices, like Ben Shapiro and Heather Mac Donald.Dissenting progressives aren\u2019t spared, either. Just ask Evergreen State College\u2019s Bret Weinstein, who was hounded out of a job after refusing to participate in a \u201cday of absence\u201d protest in which white students and faculty members were supposed to leave campus for the day to give students and faculty members of color exclusive access to the college. The good news is that tech companies don\u2019t have to rely on vague, malleable and hotly contested definitions of hate speech to deal with conspiracy theorists like Mr. Jones. The far better option would be to prohibit libel or slander on their platforms. To be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike \u201chate speech,\u201d libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. It\u2019s properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims. It\u2019s a high bar. But it\u2019s a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever-shifting norms in language and culture and provides protection for aggrieved parties. Nor do tech companies have to wait for sometimes yearslong legal processes to work themselves out. They can use their greater degree of freedom to conduct their own investigations. Those investigations would rightly be based on concrete legal standards, not wholly subjective measures of offensiveness. Private corporations can ban whoever they like. But if companies like Facebook are eager to navigate speech controversies in good faith, they would do well to learn from the centuries of legal developments in American law. When creating a true marketplace of ideas, why not let the First Amendment be your guide? Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Plans for a China Comeback Go Beyond Google Search", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world\u2019s largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

The overhaul reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The White House and congressional Republicans said the tax bill would encourage companies to make long-term investments and would provide \u201crocket fuel\u201d for the American economy. Democrats argued the legislation would lead to an increase in share buybacks and wouldn\u2019t stimulate corporate investments.At a time when other stock investors \u2014 households, mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 are selling shares, buybacks could be a source of demand in the coming months, Goldman said. That could be particularly the case for the shares of technology companies. The sector has accounted for 40 percent of the buybacks authorizations this year, but only 21 percent of the actual stock purchases.Still, Goldman does not expect buybacks to lift the S. & P. 500 much this year.

Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When It Comes to a Trade War, China Takes the Long View", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyYe Fangsu, a retired Shanghai schoolteacher, doesn\u2019t need any lessons about the dangers of trade wars. For nearly 60 years, she has lived in the former French Concession, a leafy part of Shanghai whose name itself carries the humiliation of China\u2019s biggest trade war. The \u201cconcession\u201d was one of many slices of territory, including Hong Kong and parts of other port cities, that China was forced to hand over to foreign powers after its defeat in the mid-19th-century Opium Wars. \u201cChina was so weak and backward then,\u201d Ye said, shaking her head as she offered me slices of apple and pear on a hot July afternoon. \u201cWe had to give in.\u201dThe first salvos of today\u2019s trade war have barely been felt yet in China. But for many Chinese, there\u2019s a sense of history repeating itself. The Opium Wars, as every Chinese schoolchild is reminded, began as a British attempt to pry open the Chinese market. Much as it does today, China in the 17th and 18th centuries ran a huge trade surplus with the West, exporting large quantities of tea, porcelain and silk but importing little in return. (It balanced its current-account surplus by buying up loads of Latin American silver; these days, Beijing has piled up $1.2 trillion in United States government securities.) By hooking China on opium, British and American merchants redressed the trade imbalance even as they weakened the country\u2019s social fabric. The Chinese revolted, but they were no match for Western gunboats \u2014 leading to the unequal treaties that have fueled China\u2019s sense of historical grievance and patriotic ambitions ever since.Ye Fangsu was a teenager in 1949 when Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist troops marched into Shanghai, the vanguard of a revolution that vowed to end China\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation.\u201d Now 84 and widowed, Ye says she was \u201cangry\u201d when she learned from state-run media about the United States\u2019 punitive trade tariffs on Chinese products. \u201cIt just seems like the foreigners are bullying us again,\u201d she told me. But this time will be different, she said, pointing out that rather than panic or surrender, China\u2019s leaders announced a reciprocal \u201ccounterattack\u201d aimed at products, like soybeans and pork, meant to hit the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s rural base. \u201cWe\u2019ve become strong now, and our leaders are more tenacious. They won\u2019t back down.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to understand why Trump and his advisers believed China might blink first. The country exports nearly four times more taxable goods to the United States than it imports ($505 billion compared with $130 billion in 2017), so it could never keep up with Washington in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Moreover, the Chinese economy is slowing, weighed down by debt and unemployment and dependent on the American market. Still, in targeting China\u2019s high-tech industry, Washington seemed to forget that Beijing has more than a trillion dollars in reserves to cushion the blow and that 21st-century supply chains are truly global. The Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that 87 percent of the high-tech Chinese products hit by United States tariffs get some of their parts or financing from companies based outside China. American tariffs, in other words, could inflict even greater pain on allies like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan \u2014 and on the United States itself. As the Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng put it, \u201cThe U.S. is opening fire on the world and on itself, too.\u201dChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have been less scattershot. By taking aim at soybeans and pork, Beijing struck at Trump country in the Midwest, while going after a smaller export like Kentucky bourbon hit the district of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cChina targets Trump\u2019s interest groups with surgical precision,\u201d a former government official in Shanghai told me. \u201cThat\u2019s China\u2019s institutional advantage. It understands America, but the United States doesn\u2019t really understand how China operates politically.\u201d So far, the United States is feeling the brunt of the trade war: Soy and pork exports to China have collapsed, and China has scuppered one major tech deal: Qualcomm\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover of the Dutch chip maker NXP Semiconductors. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, residents seem almost oblivious to the trade war, as if it were a storm on a distant horizon. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d says a waitress at a local dumpling shop. \u201cBut the price of soy sauce hasn\u2019t gone up yet.\u201dThe United States would be wise not to underestimate China\u2019s resolve. President Xi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, has staked his legitimacy on restoring China\u2019s greatness. Backing down is not an option for him; he can\u2019t afford to look weak in a face-off with China\u2019s biggest rival. Xi may hope the trade war eases up after the midterm elections, but he seems ready to dig in. \u201cIf it comes down to a war of attrition, China will win,\u201d says James L. McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cAt the end of day, we may end up making China great again.\u201dChinese leaders have so far been careful not to rouse much nationalist fervor, however. In disputes with other countries \u2014 France, Japan and, most recently, South Korea \u2014 Beijing ramped up the hostility, orchestrated street protests and even encouraged consumer boycotts. The trade war has evoked a more measured response. Some Chinese-language articles online have highlighted China\u2019s historical grievances \u2014 \u201cNever Forget the Eight Lessons of the Opium War,\u201d one reads \u2014 but the official tack has been to calm public opinion. \u201cDon\u2019t attack Trump\u2019s vulgarity,\u201d a government guidance memo instructed media outlets earlier this summer, according to the website China Digital Times. \u201cDon\u2019t make this a war of insults.\u201dIf the trade war persists, China could make life even more difficult for American companies by adding to the web of nontariff barriers (red tape, for example) or by supporting a consumer boycott. American-owned subsidiaries in China sold $280 billion worth of goods and services there in 2017, more than double the amount of United States imports, and famous brands like Apple and Starbucks make about 20 percent of their revenue in China. As vulnerable as those companies might be, China has no interest, yet, in alienating its biggest market. \u201cAt some point, Chinese leaders may want to get nationalistic and stir up anger against U.S. companies, but that\u2019s a dangerous road,\u201d McGregor says. \u201cRight now, Chinese leaders are just studying the battlefield. They are not running around with shock and awe.\u201dAs the trade war escalates, in fact, China is seeking to shift the blame and portray itself suddenly as a champion of openness. In the past month, Beijing has approved two major deals \u2014 with Tesla and the German chemical giant BASF \u2014 that give those companies what the foreign business community has long desired: full ownership without the need for a local joint-venture partner. Xi Jinping also held a rare meeting with American and European business executives, though his words on the trade war were defiant. In the West, he reportedly told them, \u201cyou turn the other cheek. In our culture, we punch back.\u201dBack in Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession, Ye Fangsu walked me to the gate of her lane. Across the street stands an old factory that has been transformed into a cluster of hip new restaurants and marketplaces, selling everything from Japanese tapas to French pastries. Two young Chinese men with fancy fade haircuts parked their BMW and wandered in. \u201cChina is rich now,\u201d Ye said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are better.\u201d Her neighborhood, once a symbol of China\u2019s weakness, is now evidence of its economic vitality. By her street-level calculus, that means China may have the strength, this time, to stand up to the West.Advertisement"}

The exuberant undergraduate wearing a Nike cap and giving out samples is as common on American campuses as football fans tailgating at homecoming.But now, like so much in the advertising world, the big action is online. As students return to campuses, they\u2019re constantly checking their Instagram, Snapchat and other social media accounts \u2014 so companies are turning to many of them to promote products right alongside photos of family, friends and the new puppy.For busy students, it is an easy, low-pressure way to make extra money or get free products. For marketers, it is a simple way to reach young people \u2014 a supplement to their other social media efforts, including hiring full-time promoters.Though there are no comprehensive data for how many college students promote brands online, interviews with university officials, marketing consultants, brand representatives and students make it clear that the social media platform is big business on campus. Many of the deals are for Instagram posts, but some brands also have students posting on other services, like Twitter and Facebook.At Virginia Tech, as many as 1,000 of the 30,000 undergrads are being paid to promote products as varied as mascara and storage bins, according to an estimate by Donna Wertalik, director of marketing for the university\u2019s Pamplin College of Business.\u201cWe see so many brands that have it,\u201d Ms. Wertalik said. \u201cA lot of start-up brands will do it. They\u2019ll look for students with credibility and influence to give them credibility and influence.\u201dCompanies outline expectations for what the sponsored posts should include, such as specific hashtags or promotions for particular items. Many also ask students to hold or attend events on campus.Isabel Senior, a student at Duke University, worked for LaCroix, the sparkling water company. Each week for six weeks, she had to post one Instagram photo, one Instagram story and one post on a platform like Facebook or Snapchat. She also gave out cans of LaCroix at campus events like five-kilometer races and university-sponsored concerts.Every Sunday, Ms. Senior had to send in a form with three photos from her weekly sampling event, along with screenshots of her posts. The company paid her in money and LaCroix products, and if she didn\u2019t complete a task, she said, it docked some of the pay.The job isn\u2019t always as simple as it may sound.\u201cI think the time commitment was what I expected,\u201d said Annabelle Schmitt, a senior at Pennsylvania State University this fall, \u201cbut how hard it was I did not expect.\u201dMs. Schmitt also hosted events like a swimsuit promotion that helped women find the best suit for their bodies, and a screening of a documentary about the singer Demi Lovato followed by a discussion about self-love.Creating the images took Ms. Schmitt at least two hours each week. She was paid with money and company products.\u201cBecause I take my branding seriously for my personal blog,\u201d she said, \u201cI try to work with photographers to get really high quality.\u201dThe payments to the so-called campus influencers appear to vary widely, from cash to merchandise, and brands say little about them.Riddle & Bloom\u2019s website says it pays out a total of $2 million to its campus representatives, but during an interview its president, Darren Ross, would not go into detail or confirm the website\u2019s numbers.She and 12 other women from colleges like the University of Alabama and Ohio State University \u2014 \u201cbig state schools with football programs,\u201d she said \u2014 spent three days at Alex and Ani headquarters there. They toured the work space and received instructions on curating their Instagram feeds.Companies use numerous methods to select campus influencers. Sometimes the students apply directly to the marketing agencies; sometimes the marketers identify the students.Students can go to the Riddle & Bloom website and apply for one of the 2,000 \u201cinternships,\u201d which last for a semester.Some students land the job through old-fashioned networking. Ms. Senior, the student at Duke, heard about Riddle & Bloom through a sorority sister, who had posted a link to the online application in their sorority group chat.And sometimes, students have no idea how they were selected.Advertisers hire Riddle & Bloom for access to its database of student applicants. The company says it has a close working relationship with university officials through the National Association for Campus Activities, a trade association, noting that they even share an office in Columbia, S.C.Representatives from the association say that they do not give out either personal or contact information about students without permission, but that they do steer campus leaders toward Riddle & Bloom.Ms. Gabriel said she hadn\u2019t considered being a brand ambassador until, out of the blue, AT&T reached out to her via direct message on Instagram.

But \u201cthe concern is, what else could that data be used for?\u201dAnd even though the program is run by the Department of Homeland Security, federal officials say they have placed no limits on how participating companies \u2014 mostly airlines but also cruise lines \u2014 can use that data or store it, opening up travelers\u2019 most personal information to potential misuse and abuse such as being sold or used to track passengers\u2019 whereabouts.The data the airlines collect is used to verify the identity of passengers leaving the country, an attempt by the department to better track foreigners who overstay their visas. After passengers\u2019 faces are scanned at the gate, the scan is sent to Customs and Border Protection and linked with other personally identifying data, such as date of birth and passport and flight information.For its part, Customs and Border Protection has said it will retain facial scans of American citizens for no longer than 14 days. But the agency has said it cannot control how the companies use the data because they \u201care not collecting photographs on C.B.P.\u2019s behalf.\u201dJohn Wagner, the deputy executive assistant commissioner for the agency\u2019s Office of Field Operations, said he believed that commercial carriers had \u201cno interest in keeping or retaining\u201d the biometric data they collect, and the airlines have said they are not doing so. But if they did, he said, \u201cthat would really be up to them.\u201dBut, Mr. Wagner added, \u201cthere are still some discussions to be had,\u201d and federal officials are considering whether they should write in protections.Privacy advocates have criticized the agency for allowing airlines to act as unregulated arbiters of the data.\u201cC.B.P. is a federal agency. It has a responsibility to protect Americans\u2019 data, and by encouraging airlines to collect this data, instead they are essentially abdicating their own responsibility,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.\u201cAre there privacy protections in the contracts that D.H.S. has reached with the airlines?\u201d Mr. Rudolph said in an interview. \u201cDo they require the disposal of any data collected? Do they require audits? Are there use limitations to ensure that travelers\u2019 photos aren\u2019t used in ways they don\u2019t expect? Without any enforceable rules, it\u2019s too easy for D.H.S. to break those promises.\u201dMr. Wagner, however, defended the program and said it \u201cbuilds upon the processes that have taken place for many years.\u201d\u201cAirlines are already collecting a lot of information from a traveler and providing that to C.B.P.: the reservation data, the manifest,\u201d he said.But biometric data, including scans of passengers\u2019 faces and fingerprints, is among the most sensitive, according to privacy experts, because unlike other means of identification such as a Social Security number, it cannot be changed.The face is a particularly sensitive identifier because \u201cif someone has a camera, they can identify you by your face,\u201d Mr. Frankle said. \u201cYou can be recognized even if you have no idea you\u2019re being recognized.\u201dThe program, which currently operates through four major airlines in international airports in Los Angeles, Detroit, Orlando and Atlanta, is not mandatory for passengers. But the airlines \u2014 Delta, Lufthansa, British Airways and JetBlue \u2014 have reported that a majority of passengers participate.It comes as facial recognition technology has become both more widespread and more closely scrutinized.Companies such as Apple and Citibank have leveraged the technology, and still more \u2014 including casinos, music festival organizers and retailers like Walmart \u2014 have used it to track customers and shoplifters.Amazon has recently drawn condemnation for providing facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies, whose use of the technology has caused privacy and civil liberties groups to voice concerns about overzealous surveillance.Questions about the technology\u2019s accuracy have also arisen. According to the Georgetown report, federal data shows that the system used by Customs and Border Protection incorrectly rejects as many as one in 25 travelers using valid credentials. It also cited studies that showed that facial recognition algorithms fail more frequently in correctly identifying women and people of color. The department said it does not track how many people using forged credentials manage to get through the system.A privacy report by Customs and Border Protection published in June 2017 when the program began said federal officials would conduct a privacy evaluation within one year to ensure that airlines were complying with \u201crequired privacy protections.\u201d An agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Gabris, said last month that the evaluation had not been completed because the program had not achieved \u201cinterim operating capability.\u201dMs. Gabris did not respond to inquiries asking what privacy protections are required of participating companies; representatives for participating airlines also declined to respond to similar inquiries.The companies have since been left to come up with their own policies that contain varying degrees of privacy assurances. In statements, the airlines stressed that the program was being tested in limited trials.But while they provide passengers with generalized privacy policies, only one, JetBlue, specifically outlines how it will protect customers\u2019 biometric data, an update made after inquiries from The New York Times.Further complicating the situation is the fact that the companies share passengers\u2019 data with the technology vendors they have contracted to create the infrastructure that collects the information and sends it to federal officials. Those vendors \u2014 Vision-Box, SITA and NEC Corporation \u2014 each have their own privacy policies with differing levels of accessibility.\u201cThis is not something that is hard to get right if your hands are clean, which only invites suspicion if you don\u2019t get it right,\u201d Mr. Frankle said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a place where you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty. We should be skeptical until they assure us they\u2019re not going to use this data for anything other than convenience in ways that are legally binding.\u201dDespite the privacy concerns, the Traveler Verification Service shows signs of expanding.The airlines say they hope to introduce the program within the next year to at least another half-dozen airports, and federal officials updated privacy documents last month to allow for cruise lines to participate in the program.Two senators, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, have urged the Department of Homeland Security to stop the expansion of the larger effort until their privacy concerns are addressed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Tesla Investor Wants It to Stay Public", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has insisted that taking Tesla private would allow the company to achieve its potential.On Thursday, one Tesla investor took issue with Mr. Musk\u2019s argument.Ms. Wood \u2014 whose firm owned a roughly 0.26 percent stake in Tesla as of June 30, according to public filings \u2014 argued in her letter that the public markets would better support Tesla\u2019s growth over the long term.From her letter:\u201cIf you do not take Tesla private, you will be surprised and gratified at investor reaction once they realize and understand the scope and ramifications of your long-term vision and strategies. With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

In June, AT&T completed its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, which includes HBO, Warner Bros. and the Turner cable networks.\u201cThey look at Otter as strategically key to several things they are trying to do, including serving customers with every type of content delivered through every possible distribution channel,\u201d Mr. Chernin said of AT&T, which has been a minority investor in Otter since its founding in April 2014.Tony Goncalves, Otter\u2019s chief executive, declined to say whether Otter was profitable. But he did give a hint about what AT&T has planned.\u201cYou\u2019ll see a good amount of cross pollination, where some of that really wonderful Warner intellectual property and content will find its way into the businesses that are part of the Otter portfolio today,\u201d said Mr. Goncalves, who was previously a senior AT&T executive overseeing digital initiatives, including the introduction of DirecTV Now, a streaming offering.AT&T, with its vast data on cellphone and broadband subscribers, plans to tailor ads on the Turner networks, which include CNN and TNT, based on who is watching. Otter will give AT&T more digital advertising inventory to sell the same way.But the Chernin Group had a theory. \u201cWith every new wave of technology, great new brands emerge, and we wanted to own those brands,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cThey certainly weren\u2019t going to be incubated inside the large media companies,\u201d where they would have to compete for resources.Mr. Chernin declined to comment on the speculation. He said, however, \u201cI think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands.\u201dAbout six years remain on that deal, Mr. Chernin said. Asked what would happen when Disney completes its $71.3 billion acquisition of the studio, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a proud member of the Disney family.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Chernin Group\u2019s interest in Headspace, a company that sells meditation via an app. Chernin owns a minority stake in Headspace, not full control.Advertisement"}

One tidbit: He bumped up the price tag, which he\u2019d calculated at $419 a share, to $420 because it was more auspicious. (He added, \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear.\u201d But his use of Ambien and, occasionally, recreational drugs worries his board.)For his part, Mr. Musk has no regrets: \u201cWhy would I?\u201dGoogle\u2019s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, said at a staff meeting yesterday that the company isn\u2019t close to unveiling that search product.

{"Headline": "Top C.E.O.s Denounce Trump Immigration Policy as Threat to U.S. Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDozens of American business leaders are challenging the Trump administration over changes to immigration policy that they say threaten the livelihoods of thousands of their skilled foreign workers, and the nation\u2019s economic growth and competitiveness as well.Some of the most prominent chief executives in the United States signed the letter, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Laurence Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Indra Nooyi, the departing head of PepsiCo.Business leaders have praised President Trump\u2019s tax cuts and rolling back of many regulations. But they have deplored some of his statements and some of his administration\u2019s actions, including on immigration.With their letter on Wednesday, the group\u2019s members took issue with a series of immigration enforcement guidelines that they said were \u201carbitrary and inconsistent\u201d and created new and unnecessary hurdles for skilled foreigners working in the United States.The changes, the letter stated, were \u201ccausing considerable anxiety for many thousands of our employees while threatening to disrupt company operations.\u201dThe business group\u2019s complaint focused on new guidelines and practices by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security that vets visa applications and administers immigration policy.The letter\u2019s main focus was the treatment of applications for, and renewals of, H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The visas are used by companies to hire computer engineers and other professionals.As a result of the changes, there has been a sharp increase in the number of denials and requests for more information. A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan policy research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions had increased 41 percent in the government\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, compared with the third quarter.Government examiners\u2019 requests for additional information on H-1B visa applications tripled in the same period. The government\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter began in July 2017, a few months after Mr. Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order.The Trump administration, experts said, was using the government\u2019s regulatory apparatus, which it has so often scorned, to serve its policy goal of clamping down on the flow of foreign workers into America.\u201cStep up investigations, slow things down, and you can accomplish your policy goals without legislation,\u201d said Hal Salzman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University.In response to the business leaders\u2019 letter, the immigration service said in a statement on Thursday that the administration had been \u201crelentlessly pursuing necessary immigration reforms that move towards a merit-based system.\u201d It added that it handles all applications and petitions \u201cfairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis.\u201dThe H-1B program was created to provide a pathway for talented foreigners whose special skills were expected to strengthen the American economy. Today, the nation\u2019s technology hubs are filled with H-1B alumni who have become entrepreneurs, executives, venture capitalists and, quite often, United States citizens.In recent years, however, the visa program has been criticized because corporations, especially Indian technology outsourcing companies, have exploited legal loopholes in the H-1B regime to replace American workers and shift jobs out of the United States. The immigration service has said its increased scrutiny and enforcement actions were intended to strengthen \u201cprotections to combat H-1B abuses.\u201dBut to the business leaders, the policies are vague and capricious, creating uncertainty for their workers and in company operations. For example, the group\u2019s letter stated, \u201ccompanies now do not know whether a work visa petition that was approved last month will be approved when the company submits the identical application to extend the employee\u2019s status.\u201dA particular concern, the business leaders said, was that the immigration service was expected to revoke work eligibility for spouses of H-1B visa holders. The spouses, they said, are often highly skilled workers who have built careers in America.\u201cRevoking their U.S. work authorization,\u201d the letter said, \u201cwill likely cause high-skilled immigrants to take their skills to competitors outside the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Says Tesla May Go Private, and Its Stock Soars", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has become one of the world\u2019s most prominent chief executives, and a billionaire several times over, by boldly making big bets on ideas that few others thought possible.Through it all, he has shown a maverick \u2014 some would say arrogant \u2014 management style. On Tuesday, he may have outdone himself.In a terse and cryptic Twitter post, he declared that he was ready to take Tesla private. The stock market that made his company worth over $60 billion wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFunding secured.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock was already up sharply on a report that Saudi Arabia was taking a sizable stake in the company. But investors were left to puzzle out the implications of Mr. Musk\u2019s proposition, its relationship to the Saudi report, and even the authenticity of the tweet. And so, starting at 12:48 p.m., the market that Mr. Musk threatened to forsake went into a frenzy.At 2:08 p.m., with shares up more than 7 percent for the day, trading was halted pending news \u2014 news that finally came shortly before 3:30.\u201cI fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Musk said that no final decision had yet been made about taking the company private, and that any such proposal would have to be approved by shareholders.He outlined a plan under which shareholders could be bought out for $420 a share \u2014 a 20 percent premium over the stock price after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call last week \u2014 or they could remain as private shareholders.\u201cThis has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI own about 20 percent of the company now and don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is complete.\u201dTesla trading resumed 15 minutes before the end of the trading session, and the shares added to their gains, closing at $379.57, up 11 percent.Mr. Musk did not elaborate on any sources of financing to take Tesla private. The announcement followed a report that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had acquired a stake in the company.A person briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the Saudi fund had taken a stake of less than 5 percent.The Financial Times reported that the shares had been acquired for the fund in the secondary market with the help of JPMorgan Chase. The bank declined to comment.If the transaction got done at $420 per share, Tesla would be valued at just over $70 billion, making it the biggest deal in which a company is taken private.Although Tesla has become the most valuable American car company, it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. And its chief executive, a 47-year-old native of South Africa, has come under increasing pressure as he has scrambled to increase production of the Model 3, a midsize sedan that he is counting on to drive up revenue and enable the company to become profitable.Still, this is not the way multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts are typically announced. Companies would normally line up banks, private equity firms or other deep-pocketed investors to agree in advance to provide money to finance the purchase of shares.Officials representing a number of large banks and investment funds said on Tuesday that they had not talked with Tesla about financing a buyout, although it is possible the company had secured funding from other sources.Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Tuesday \u2014 mentioning the specific price of a possible buyout and declaring that Tesla had already arranged funding \u2014 were virtually guaranteed to send the shares flying. Still, while it was unusual for a chief executive to make a market-moving announcement on Twitter, there is nothing improper about it on its face.But the S.E.C. has also advised that intentional releases of market-moving information on social media platforms or websites must be accompanied by a simultaneous release to the broader public. The delay between Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet and Tesla\u2019s corporate announcement could be of interest to the S.E.C., said Michael Liftik, a former deputy chief of staff at the commission who is now a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\u201cSimultaneously really means simultaneously,\u201d he said. And he said a tweet would be held to the same standard of factuality as a news release.Others pointed out that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet could have opened his company up to legal exposure from investors with financial incentives to sue.\u201cWhat they have to show is there was a material misstatement, in these loose statements, by Mr. Musk,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance. Mr. Coffee said the statement \u201cfunding secured\u201d could be a legal gray area where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys see an opportunity to make a case.\u201cThat\u2019s a very broad statement about what is still an extraordinarily amorphous transaction,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.The S.E.C. had no comment, and Tesla would not comment beyond what was in Mr. Musk\u2019s statement to employees.Being a public company and reporting earnings every three months \u201cputs enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\u201d he said. Having its stock traded publicly also means that Tesla can attract short-sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla \u2014 whom he described as \u201cpeople who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dTesla has attracted more so-called short-sellers than any other publicly traded company, in part because many investors doubt the company can achieve the lofty targets that Mr. Musk has set.Tesla\u2019s short-sellers on Tuesday racked up about $1.5 billion in losses, according to S3 Analytics, a technology and research firm. That brings their losses so far this year to $3 billion.Going private \u201cwould definitely benefit Elon Musk and the way he\u2019d like to run the company,\u201d said Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t like the intrusion he gets as a public company.\u201dHe has also objected to analysts\u2019 conclusions that the company may have to raise additional capital from investors later this year as it continues to post losses and use up hundreds of millions of dollars in cash each quarter.Mr. Levy, the analyst, said that even if Tesla went private, it would probably still need to borrow to pursue its plans for new models and new factories. \u201cThe question is whether they will have the same investor support,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a private company with a lot of debt, the risk goes up.\u201dHe characterized Mr. Musk\u2019s management style as \u201cunique.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of unexpected surprises,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the ambitions of SpaceX, a company run by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. It plans to send astronauts into space next year; it has not yet done so.Michael J. de la Merced, Peter Eavis and Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Accuses Google of Burying Conservative News in Search Results", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration.Mr. Trump added that \u201cthey are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\u201dLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201dIn a statement, Google said that its search service was \u201cnot used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d and be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201dInterfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.\u201cThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. \u201cThat being said, I think it\u2019d be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.\u201dWhat sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a \u201cneutral platform,\u201d they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people. \u201cWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word \u201cTrump\u201d were articles from \u201cleft-leaning sites.\u201dThe piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm \u2014 including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page \u2014 and that formula is constantly being updated.\u201cEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users\u2019 queries,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201dEven longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.\u201cThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.\u201dLong before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAlthough it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls \u201cmore authoritative\u201d news sources.The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jones\u2019s account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher.Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet.\u201cSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as today\u2019s town squares,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. \u201cBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.\u201dJeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peloton\u2019s New Infusion Made It a $4 Billion Company in 6 Years", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Peloton\u2019s first two years in business, venture capital investors didn\u2019t get it. The company\u2019s founders struggled to convince them that blending stationary bikes and streaming live video classes would work. It had to cobble together money from a network of more than 200 angel investors to get off the ground.But six years and a quarter of a million bikes later, the company is the toast of Silicon Valley. On Friday, Peloton announced it had raised $550 million in financing from prominent investors led by TCV, a firm known for investing in Facebook, Netflix and LinkedIn. Peloton has now raised $1 billion and is valued at $4 billion.The combination of hardware and software that initially turned off investors is now viewed as an advantage. After Peloton sells customers a bike for $1,995, the company charges a $39 monthly subscription for the live video classes. Jay Hoag, general partner of TCV, compared the business model to Apple\u2019s iPhone and App Store. And he said Peloton\u2019s repeat revenue from subscriptions reminded him of Netflix, where he\u2019s a board director, and of Spotify, a TCV portfolio company.\u201cThey have a similar-sized opportunity to reshape fitness,\u201d he said.Peloton is on track to bring in $700 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in February, said Jessica Kleiman, vice president of global communications for Peloton. It plans to go public in 2019.Peloton\u2019s slug of capital comes during an influx of so-called mega-rounds of funding of $100 million or more. In July, 55 companies raised mega-rounds, the highest amount in the last decade, according to data site Crunchbase.Peloton\u2019s new influx of money will partly be used to fend off new competitors. Investors, seeing Peloton\u2019s fast rise, are fearful of missing out again on an exercise start-up.Flywheel, NordicTrack and a brand called Echelon all offer stationary bikes with video classes. A start-up called FightCamp is pitching itself as \u201cthe Peloton of boxing.\u201d And Mirror, a company making home fitness devices that stream yoga and Pilates fitness routines, has raised $13 million even though its product has not yet gone on sale.The money going to Peloton will also be used to expand Peloton\u2019s offerings. Fitness is a faddish industry, as anyone who owns a dusty set of Tae Bo tapes can attest, and indoor cycling is not immune. In May SoulCycle, a boutique indoor cycling company, withdrew its plans to go public, citing \u201cmarket conditions.\u201dThe company has plans to expand outside the United States as well, including in Canada and Britain, starting in the fall.The company has not yet shipped bikes overseas because it hasn\u2019t had music licenses in other countries. That hasn\u2019t stopped some enthusiasts from getting their hands on them. Last year, according to Mr. Lynch, a duchess in Sweden sent the company a photo of a bike being delivered to a countryside chateau.\u201cWe had this tsunami of demand from Europe and Canada from consumers asking if they could get the bike,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Stock Buybacks Continue to Break Records", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple is handing cash back to its shareholders at an unprecedented rate.The iPhone maker repurchased $43.5 billion of its own stock during the first six months of this year. Not only is that up from more than $14 billion during the same period last year, but the company\u2019s repurchases in the past two quarters also rank as the biggest in history, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.& P. Dow Jones Indices.Among companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, each of the five largest quarterly stock buybacks on record was by Apple.Apple\u2019s increased spending on its own shares follows the $1.5 trillion tax cut signed into law late last year. The overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent and provided a permanent break on overseas profits. The aim was to encourage companies to make long-term investments in things like new workers and factories to stimulate the American economy.Like most stock repurchase efforts, Apple\u2019s buyback program has helped bolster its share price in recent years. Apple shares are up 18 percent this year and nearly 150 percent since March 2012. By reducing the number of shares on the market, buybacks also lift a company\u2019s earnings per share \u2014 a key metric for investors. For instance, Apple\u2019s earning per share grew 40 percent last quarter compared with the same period last year, while its net income rose just 32 percent.Apple\u2019s buyback binge also affects the calculation of its stock market value, which is approaching $1 trillion. Based on its share count from its fiscal second-quarter filing, the company would have a market value of $984 billion Wednesday. But Apple reduced its share count by 5.5 percent during its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. That means Apple\u2019s market capitalization stands at roughly $970 billion, and its shares now need to hit $206.49 for the company to be valued at $1 trillion.Advertisement"}

Disney has given hints but no specifics. The name, rollout strategy, precise menu of movies and television shows \u2014 all still a mystery.But one aspect is becoming clear: The service\u2019s initial success or failure will depend a great deal on an ascendant Disney executive named Ricky Strauss, who was recently given \u2014 to the surprise of many in Hollywood \u2014 creative oversight of the service\u2019s programming. He has the power to \u201cgreenlight\u201d new episodic series and movies and will develop, according to Disney, the service\u2019s \u201cstrategic content vision.\u201dBut standout success on the production side of the film business has been more elusive for Mr. Strauss.In his new job as president of content and marketing for Disney\u2019s streaming service, Mr. Strauss will be responsible for steering hundreds of millions of dollars in production. As he put it in a brief phone interview, \u201cQuality is going to be critical.\u201dMr. Strauss will need to court other top filmmakers, writers and stars to make content for the service \u2014 at a time when Apple, Amazon and Netflix are going after talent with wheelbarrows full of money.\u201cThere\u2019s a big, big opportunity for storytellers inside and outside of Disney to help us,\u201d Mr. Strauss said when asked what he wanted to communicate to Hollywood\u2019s creative community.\u201cI do believe that this is the future, which is one reason I wanted the job,\u201d he added.\u201cThis as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the Disney-branded streaming service last year.The urgency has only grown.The number of cord-cutters \u2014 adults who have canceled cable or satellite hookups and continue without it \u2014 will hit 33 million this year, a 32.8 percent increase from 2017, according to a new report by the research firm eMarketer. The annual increase in cord-cutters had been projected at 22 percent. Most of those people are subscribing to streaming services instead.Programming from National Geographic, which is part of the Fox acquisition, will probably be offered on the service. Disney has not decided whether family films from the Fox library (\u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cIce Age\u201d) will be included. Fox\u2019s rowdy animated shows, including \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d are expected to remain on Hulu.Mr. Strauss declined to discuss original movies and series beyond the handful that have already been announced. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re playing with launch dates,\u201d he said.But two agents and two producers working with Disney, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect ties to the company, provided some details about what the company has planned.At least nine movies are in production or advanced development, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $60 million. Disney is remaking two musicals from its animation library as live-action films: \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d (1955) and \u201cThe Sword in the Stone\u201d (1963). Other films headed to the service include \u201cTogo,\u201d a period adventure about a sled dog, and \u201cNoelle,\u201d starring Anna Kendrick as Santa\u2019s daughter.Most series will cost $25 million to $35 million. Already in the works are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchises like \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d and \u201cMonsters Inc.\u201d The Muppets will probably be getting a new series. There will be Marvel-themed shows. And Disney recently announced that a new season of the animated series \u201cStar Wars: The Clone Wars\u201d would head to the service.Mr. Strauss, who grew up in Harrison, N.Y., and graduated from the University of Vermont, plans to hire an array of lieutenants. Already in place when he arrived was Agnes Chu, a senior vice president who joined Disney in 2008 to manage video for ABC.com and recently served as Mr. Iger\u2019s de facto chief of staff.But he also defended his own content credentials.\u201cTo be successful in making content, you need to have a marketing lens on everything you do \u2014 who are the people you are driving toward?\u201d Mr. Strauss said. \u201cAt the same time, I love great stories. I\u2019m very intellectually curious.\u201dHe pointed out that, while at Participant, he had pushed forward \u201cThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\u201d a film about retirees that ended up becoming a major hit for Fox Searchlight.\u201cI read the script, and I thought it was fantastic, and not a lot of other people in town were interested,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtEver since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies to stay out of the world\u2019s largest internet market, especially when many of Google\u2019s American rivals happily operate under that government\u2019s intrusive rules. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.But wasn\u2019t standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Google\u2019s Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in \u2014 a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of life\u2019s information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.Activists for online freedoms worry that Google\u2019s return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown \u2014 the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.\u201cIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey should just say so \u2014 that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think it\u2019s fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.\u201dIn a statement, a Google spokesman said that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201d But the company\u2019s leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last week\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.Mr. Pichai underlined this argument \u2014 that providing some access to the outside world is better than none \u2014 by citing his experience growing up in India.\u201cMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,\u201d he told Google\u2019s staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it weren\u2019t for that.\u201dThere are other factors behind Google\u2019s potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the company\u2019s executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, na\u00efve and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.\u201cI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said. \u201cAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where the internet is going\u2019 and \u2018If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u2019 \u2014 well, that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201dIf Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Google\u2019s shift.\u201cIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,\u201d said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldn\u2019t be telling Chinese people, \u2018Here\u2019s what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201dSure, it\u2019s early, and Google\u2019s plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy China\u2019s censors without losing its soul.But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cities\u2019 Offers for Amazon Base Are Secrets Even to Many City Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Evans, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of Amazon.He does, however, have one small question: What financial incentives did his city dangle in front of Amazon?\u201cWhat have I been told?\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201dAcross the country, the search for HQ2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can\u2019t find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to Amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it.\u201cThe only time the public may become aware if the city has promised Amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed,\u201d Mr. Evans said.A primary reason for the information blackout is that, in many cases, the bids were handled by local private Chamber of Commerce affiliates or economic development groups that aren\u2019t required to make their negotiations public. Many of the groups are also not covered by Freedom of Information Act or state open-records requests.But another reason is gamesmanship. Some cities say they want their Amazon proposals to remain confidential to avoid showing their hand to rivals. And Amazon required the finalists to sign nondisclosure agreements that forbid the local groups to release proprietary information about the company.\u201cI don\u2019t know what we offered Amazon in terms of financial incentives, but I believe Amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them,\u201d said Leslie Pool, a member of the Austin City Council. The city, also a finalist, submitted a bid put together by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, which had no consultations with the City Council.But that kind of transparency is the exception.\u201cWe are not releasing documents related to Amazon HQ2. We are not subject to F.O.I.A.,\u201d Michael Finney, the president and chief executive of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, a public-private partnership that handled the Amazon bid, said in an email. Similar requests to Austin, Atlanta and Indianapolis met with similar responses.And when officials in Montgomery County, Md., did respond to a request for information on their bid, they delivered, among other items, a 10-page document of incentives \u2014 with every single line of text redacted.Companies are often stealthy when searching for a location for a critical factory or relocating a headquarters, as General Electric or Bechtel have done in recent years. And it has been reported that Apple has been holding behind-closed-doors meetings with government leaders as it shops for a new corporate campus.In the case of Amazon, it is the size and scope of its search that some officials find shocking \u2014 and galling.\u201cTypically, you see companies bid a couple of places against each other as they try to land a corporate deal,\u201d said Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council who has not seen the city\u2019s proposal to Amazon. (New York is a finalist.) \u201cThis process is highly unusual. It creates a real race-to-the-bottom aspect with the potential of companies bidding multiple cities against one another.\u201dIt is unclear how much promised tax credits and financial incentives will weigh into Amazon\u2019s decision. Three of the first four questions Amazon asked cities to answer in their proposals were centered on incentives. But the e-commerce giant also sought information on possible building sites, the local labor force, transit options, computer science programs in local schools and cost-of-living data.The cities see more at stake than just the jobs and investment that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters would bring. Amazon says its presence and investment in Seattle have created an additional 53,000 jobs beyond its own direct hires and added $38 billion to Seattle\u2019s economy from 2010 to 2016.But there have also been serious downsides for the city. In a be-careful-of-what-you-ask-for address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said that housing prices in her city average $824,000, that rents have soared 57 percent in the last five years and that there are 4,000 homeless people on the streets every night.Those are the types of concerns raised by Ms. Pool, the Austin councilwoman. Ms. Pool said she thought her city lacked the infrastructure and housing to accommodate 50,000 high-paying jobs and that such fast growth would alter the city\u2019s socioeconomic makeup and quality of life.\u201cThis is a city where you want to put down roots,\u201d Ms. Pool said. \u201cThe people here are the friendliest. The parks are beautiful. But if someone like Amazon comes in, a big con is the massive amount of dislocation it causes. You put out the small businesses and longtime property owners, the very businesses and people that give the city its flavor and, I would argue, its brand.\u201dStill, the project is too good to pass up, even for some of the nation\u2019s mayors who are most focused on housing and affordability, such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.\u201cThey are about ending inequality and creating more inclusive cities,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the School of Cities and the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. \u201cNow they\u2019re in a game competing with one another to throw money at one of the most powerful companies in the world run by one of the world\u2019s richest men.\u201dMr. Florida was on the board of directors for Toronto Global, whose bid is one of the 20 finalists, but he said he resigned this year so that he could raise concerns about the general lack of transparency in the bidding.\u201cI think the lack of transparency of this whole process is galling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be all out in the public. This is taxpayer money.\u201dEventually, the taxpayers whose area wins will have to be told how much money Amazon was promised. And when they discover how much they will have to hand over, Mr. Florida said, \u201cthere is going to be hell to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shares of Whirlpool, Alcoa and General Motors tumbled after the companies warned of the financial hit from the higher costs related in part to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.So far, the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have had little impact on Sonos, the company said. But as trade tensions ramp up, Sonos looks particularly vulnerable.In its filing with the S.E.C. ahead of its I.P.O., Sonos warned that tariffs were a potential risk to anyone buying its shares:If the tariff list remains unaltered, all of our inbound products to the United States would be subject to a 10 percent tariff assessed on the cost of goods as imported. If these duties are imposed on our products, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations.Of course, the trade worries only add to the list of more traditional investor concerns. The company, which started life as a multiroom speaker maker, has more recently ridden the wave of smart speakers. That has put the company in the position of both teaming up and competing with heavyweights like Amazon, Google and Apple.Sonos\u2019s growth is slower than some recent I.P.O.s as well. The company\u2019s revenue rose just 10 percent in its last fiscal year. For comparison, Spotify grew 37 percent and Dropbox 31 percent in the year before they went public.And a red flag for those looking to buy into the I.P.O.: Sonos\u2019s existing shareholders accounted for 8.3 million of the shares sold in the offering.Advertisement"}

Mr. Jones and Infowars have used social media for years to spread dark and bizarre theories, such as that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Apple made its move on Sunday and the others followed on Monday.The actions, one of the tech companies\u2019 most aggressive efforts against misinformation, highlighted a difficult dilemma for their businesses. They have long desired to combat misinformation online, but they have also been reluctant to be arbiters of truth.But since a rise of misinformation online around elections, such as the 2016 presidential vote, the tech companies have faced increasing calls from lawmakers and the news media to address their role in that spread of false information and a related increase in partisan divisions. The tech companies have recently stepped up enforcement \u2014 but that has led to accusations of political bias, largely from conservatives.Apple on Sunday removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app. Commenting on the move, a spokeswoman said, \u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech.\u201dFacebook, Spotify and Google\u2019s YouTube site, which removed some Infowars content last week, followed with stronger measures on Monday. Facebook removed four pages belonging to Mr. Jones, including one with nearly 1.7 million followers as of last month, for violating its policies by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d and \u201cusing dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d Facebook said the violations did not relate to \u201cfalse news.\u201dYouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel, which had more than 2.4 million subscribers and billions of views on its videos, for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.Mr. Jones and Infowars are leaders in using the internet to spread right-wing conspiracy theories, an effort that was aided after Donald J. Trump appeared on Mr. Jones\u2019s show during the 2016 presidential campaign and praised Mr. Jones\u2019s reputation as \u201camazing.\u201d Mr. Jones has repeatedly claimed that the government staged the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and numerous other mass shootings and tragedies.\u201cTo many, Jones is a bad joke,\u201d said the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \u201cBut the sad reality is that he has millions of followers who listen to his radio show, watch his \u2018documentaries\u2019 and read his websites, and some of them, like Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, resort to deadly violence.\u201dMr. Jones and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment.The big tech firms that control, via their websites and apps, how much of the world\u2019s media content is distributed have faced criticism in recent weeks for enabling Mr. Jones and Infowars.A Google spokesman said on Monday that YouTube terminated Mr. Jones\u2019s channel outright because he continued to flout policies he had already been penalized for violating.Mr. Jones and Infowars still have other ways to reach listeners and readers. They have increasingly been directing viewers to visit the Infowars website, which would limit their reliance on the tech companies, presumably foreseeing the bans. Twitter has not restricted the accounts of Mr. Jones or Infowars. A Twitter spokesman said the accounts were not in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules.Other tech companies\u2019 approach has been uneven; they have left up Infowars content on some of their services despite removing it from others.Infowars introduced a new smartphone app last month that is finding users on Apple\u2019s App store and Google\u2019s Play Store. From July 12 through Monday, the Infowars app was, on average, the 23rd most popular news app on the Google Play store and the 33rd most popular news app on Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, an app analytics firm. On Monday, the Infowars app ranked ahead of apps like BuzzFeed and The Wall Street Journal on Google, and ahead of apps like MSNBC and Bloomberg on Apple.Apple decided to allow the Infowars app on its store after reviewing it, according to a person close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Google Play Store has different policies than YouTube, a Google spokesman said.\u201cThe timing is very puzzling because he\u2019s been saying this stuff for years and they haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Mr. Rivitz said.Conservatives warned that more sites would be cut off soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Internet Trolls Have Won. Sorry, There\u2019s Not Much You Can Do.", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bytech fixWhen it comes to online comments and discourse and what you can do to limit their toxicity, you only have a certain amount of power. The real leverage lies with the tech companies. This column is going to be a bit unusual. Typically, I write about a broad tech problem and offer some solutions. But this week, I\u2019ve stumbled into a topic that many agree has no easy fix: online comments.What does that show us? That you as an internet user have little power over content you find offensive or harmful online. It\u2019s the tech companies that hold the cards.Given the way things are going, our faith in the internet may erode until we distrust it as much as we do TV news, said Zizi Papacharissi, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois-Chicago who teaches social media courses. Why are internet comments so hopelessly bad, and how do we protect ourselves? Even though there is no simple fix, there are some measures we can aim to take. Here\u2019s what you need to know about how we got here and what you can try.There are many theories about why the internet seems to bring out the worst in people. I gathered a sampling of some noteworthy findings.Ms. Papacharissi said that in her 20 years of researching and interviewing people about online behavior, one conclusion has remained consistent: people use the internet to get more of what they do not get enough of in everyday life. So while people have been socialized to resist being impulsive in the real world, on the internet they cave to their temptations to lash out.\u201cThe internet becomes an easy outlet for us to shout something and feel for a moment fulfilled even though we\u2019re really just shouting out into the air,\u201d she said.This is nothing new, of course. Before the internet, people took their frustrations to TV and radio talk shows. The internet was simply a more accessible, less moderated space.Daniel Ha, a founder of Disqus, a popular internet comment tool used by many websites, said the quality of comments vary widely depending on the pieces of content being discussed and the audiences they attract. For example, there are videos about niche topics, like home improvement, that invite constructive commentary from enthusiasts. But there are others, such as a music video from a popular artist or a general news article, which ask people from all around the world to comment. That\u2019s when things can get especially unruly.\u201cYou have an airport of people from all walks of life coming together, and they\u2019re speaking different languages with different attitudes and they\u2019re just saying stuff,\u201d Mr. Ha said. Comments can be terrible simply because many people are flawed. It\u2019s up to the content providers and tech platforms to vet their communities and set rules and standards for civilized discussion. That is an area where many resource-strained news publications fall short: They often leave their comments sections unmoderated, so they become cesspools of toxic behavior. It is also an area where tech companies like Facebook and Twitter struggle, because they have long portrayed themselves as neutral platforms that do not that do not wish to take on the editorial roles of traditional publishers.Tech companies have long employed various methods to detect fake comments from bots and spammers. So-called Captcha tests, for Completely Automated Procedures for Telling Computers and Humans Apart, ask you to type a word or select photos of a specific item to verify you are human and not a bot. Other methods, like detecting a device type or location of a commenter, can be used to pin down bots. Yet security researchers have shown there are workarounds to all these methods. Some hackers are now getting extremely clever about their methodologies. When the Federal Communications Commission was preparing to repeal net neutrality last year, there were 22 million comments posted on its site between April 2017 and October 2017, many of which expressed support for the move. \u201cIt was like Mad Libs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read through different comments one by one, it\u2019s hard to tell that some are from the same template. But if you use these machine learning algorithms, you can pick out some of these clusters.\u201dFor the issue of spoofed comments, there is a fairly simple solution: You can report them to the site\u2019s owner, which will likely analyze and remove the fakes. Other than that, don\u2019t take web comments at face value. Mr. Kao said the lesson he learned was to always try to view comments in a wider context. Look at a commenter\u2019s history of past posts, or fact-check any dubious claims or endorsements elsewhere on the web, he said.Yet once you report an offensive comment, it is typically up to tech companies to decide whether it threatens your safety or violates a law \u2014 and often harassers know exactly how offensive they can be without clearly breaking rules. Historically, tech companies have been conservative and fickle about removing inappropriate comments, largely to maintain their positions as neutral platforms where people can freely express themselves.In the case of Infowars, Apple, Google and Facebook were the ones that banned some content from the conspiracy site after determining it violated their policies. Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said on Tuesday that the company did not suspend the accounts belonging to Infowars because its owner, Alex Jones, did not violate any rules. \u201cIf we succumb and simply react to outside pressure, rather than straightforward principles we enforce (and evolve) impartially regardless of political viewpoints, we become a service that\u2019s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction,\u201d he said in a tweet. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment elaborating on the decision.Beyond reporting comments individually, you could also use an online petition tool like Change.org to demand that tech companies remove offensive content. (But note that supporters of Infowars are already on that site petitioning for the site's content to be restored on YouTube.)When publishers and tech companies fail to address inappropriate comments, Ms. Papacharissi recommended an exercise in self-discipline. \u201cThink before you read,\u201d she said. \u201cThink before you speak. And you don\u2019t always have to respond. A lot of things do not deserve a response. Sometimes not responding is more effective than lashing out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Small Fry,\u2019 Steve Jobs Comes Across as a Jerk. His Daughter Forgives Him. Should We?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "ProfileLisa Brennan-Jobs has written a memoir about her famous father. The details are damning, but she doesn\u2019t want them to be.Supported byWhen Steve Jobs told his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs that the Apple Lisa computer was not named after her, it was not a cruel lie to a little girl, she insists \u2014 he was teaching her \u201cnot to ride on his coattails.\u201dWhen Mr. Jobs refused to install heat in her bedroom, he was not being callous, she says \u2014 he was instilling in her a \u201cvalue system.\u201dWhen a dying Mr. Jobs told Ms. Brennan-Jobs that she smelled \u201clike a toilet,\u201d it was not a hateful snipe, she maintains \u2014 he was merely showing her \u201chonesty.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange thing to write a devastating memoir with damning details but demand that these things are not, in fact, damning at all. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Ms. Brennan-Jobs has done in a new memoir, \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d and in a series of interviews conducted over the last few weeks.Thanks to a dozen other biographies and films, Apple obsessives already know the broad outlines of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s early life: Mr. Jobs fathered her at 23, then denied paternity despite a DNA match, and gave little in financial or emotional support even as he became a god of the early computing era. \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d which goes on sale Sept. 4, is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort to reclaim her story for herself.The backdrop to her raw depictions of life with and without Mr. Jobs is 1980s Silicon Valley, where artists and hippies mixed with technologists, ideas of how to build the future flourished, and a cascade of trillions of dollars was just beginning to crash onto the landscape. Ms. Brennan-Jobs navigated a childhood on welfare with her mother, the artist Chrisann Brennan, and an adolescence ensconced in her father\u2019s wealth.In passage after passage of \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs is vicious to his daughter and those around her. Now, in the days before the book is released, Ms. Brennan-Jobs is fearful that it will be received as a tell-all expos\u00e9, and not the more nuanced portrait of a family she intended. She worries that the reaction will be about a famous man\u2019s legacy rather than a young woman\u2019s story \u2014 that she will be erased again, this time in her own memoir.On the eve of publication, what Ms. Brennan-Jobs wants readers to know is this: Steve Jobs rejected his daughter for years, but that daughter has absolved him. Triumphantly, she loves him, and she wants the book\u2019s scenes of their roller skating and laughing together to be as viral as the scenes of him telling her she will inherit nothing.Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s forgiveness is one thing. What\u2019s tricky is that she wants the reader to forgive Mr. Jobs, too. And she knows that could be a problem.\u201cHave I failed?\u201d she asked, in one of our conversations. \u201cHave I failed in fully representing the dearness and the pleasure? The dearness of my father, and the outrageous pleasure of being with him when he was in good form?\u201dAfter college, Ms. Brennan-Jobs left the United States to work in finance in London and Italy; she later shifted into design, and then freelance writing for magazines and literary journals. Now 40, she has long avoided publicity. She has never been profiled, and she has carefully eluded most of her father\u2019s chroniclers. (One exception: Aaron Sorkin, who called her \u201cthe heroine\u201d of his 2015 Steve Jobs biopic.) Ms. Brennan-Jobs said she did not trust Walter Isaacson, who wrote the definitive, megaselling biography of her father in 2011.\u201cI never spoke with Walter, and I never read the book, but I know I came off as cold to my father and not caring whether he felt bad,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said in late July, sitting in Cantine, a small, vegan-friendly cafe in Brooklyn\u2019s Carroll Gardens neighborhood. \u201cI was devastated by it.\u201d\u201cI felt ashamed to be the bad part of a great story,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I felt unresolved.\u201dAnd so in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she seeks to resolve some of that shame by describing how her childhood unfolded, who key characters were, why it all happened. Ms. Brennan-Jobs went back to Silicon Valley and interviewed her family, her friends, her mother\u2019s ex-boyfriends, and her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In her childhood, the region had been green with eucalyptus and full of garage hackers. Now it is the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of the world, and Mr. Jobs remains its towering hero.Ms. Brennan-Jobs began work on what would become \u201cSmall Fry\u201d not long after her father\u2019s 2011 death. Years into writing, she felt rushed by her publisher, Penguin Press, and feared being \u201ctarted up\u201d and made to take advantage of her father\u2019s legacy. She wanted to be with a smaller publisher who would work with her and give her more time, and switched to Grove, taking what she says was a 90 percent cut in her advance. (A spokesperson for Penguin declined to comment.)One result of the delay is that \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is entering the public conversation at a time when, across industries, formerly disempowered or ignored women are having their say about powerful men. A memoir by Steve Jobs\u2019s firstborn was always going to be a publishing sensation, but Ms. Brennan-Jobs has inadvertently timed hers to land when the public is even more attuned to marginalized voices \u2014 and when many are having darker thoughts about the world Mr. Jobs created with his attention-devouring devices.None of that, of course, was imaginable when Ms. Brennan-Jobs was born on May 17, 1978, on a commune farm in Oregon. Her parents, who had met in high school in Cupertino, Calif., were both 23. Mr. Jobs arrived days after the birth and helped name her, but refused to acknowledge that he was the father. To support her family, Ms. Brennan cleaned houses and used government assistance. Only after the government sued Mr. Jobs did he agree to pay child support.\u201cSmall Fry\u201d describes how Mr. Jobs slowly took a greater interest in his daughter, taking her skating and coming over to her house for visits. Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with him for a time during high school, when her mother was struggling with money and her temper, but Mr. Jobs was cold and had extreme demands for what being a member of the family entailed. The neighbors next door worried about the teenage Lisa, and one night, when Mr. Jobs was out, they moved her from his house and into theirs. Against Mr. Jobs\u2019s wishes, the neighbors paid for her to finish college. (He later paid them back.)In an interview, Ms. Brennan-Jobs spoke of \u201cnot wanting to alienate people\u201d she loves, but acknowledged that her memoir might do just that. Aside from Mr. Jobs, all the central characters are very much alive. \u201cI hope Thanksgiving\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said.Her mother, Ms. Brennan, is portrayed as a free spirit who nurtured her daughter\u2019s creativity \u2014 but could be mercurial, hot-tempered and sometimes neglectful. \u201cIt was horrendous for me to read,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in an interview. \u201cIt was very, very hard. But she got it right.\u201dMr. Jobs\u2019s infamous venom is on frequent display in \u201cSmall Fry.\u201d Out one night at dinner, Mr. Jobs turns to his daughter\u2019s cousin, Sarah, who has just unknowingly offended him by ordering meat. \u201c\u2018Have you ever thought about how awful your voice is?\u201d Mr. Jobs asks Sarah. \u201cPlease stop talking in that awful voice,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cYou should really consider what\u2019s wrong with yourself and try to fix it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs describes her father\u2019s frequent use of money to confuse or frighten her. \u201cSometimes he decided not to pay for things at the very last minute,\u201d she writes, \u201cwalking out of restaurants without paying the bill.\u201d When her mother found a beautiful house and asked Mr. Jobs to buy it for her and Lisa, he agreed it was nice \u2014 but bought it for himself and moved in with his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.Ms. Brennan said that her daughter has, if anything, underplayed the chaos of her childhood. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that,\u201d she said.But \u201cSmall Fry\u201d also contains moments of joy that capture Mr. Jobs\u2019s spontaneity and unparalleled mind. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs goes on a school trip to Japan, he arrives unannounced and pulls her out of the program for a day. Father and daughter sit, talking about God and how he sees consciousness. \u201cI was afraid of him and, at the same time, I felt a quaking, electric love,\u201d she writes.\u201cWhen I started writing,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so interesting on the page, and I was almost frustrated that he pulled so much gravity.\u201dAfter Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with Mr. Jobs as a teenager, he forbade her from seeing her mother for six months, as a way to cement her connection to his new family. At the same time, Mr. Jobs shifted from neglectful to controlling. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs was getting increasingly involved at her high school, starting an opera club and running for freshman-class president, he got upset. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out. You\u2019re not succeeding as a member of this family,\u201d Mr. Jobs says in the memoir. \u201cYou\u2019re never around. If you want to be a part of this family, you need to put in the time.\u201dTo appease her father, Ms. Brennan-Jobs transferred to another school that was closer to her father\u2019s house. She persisted in becoming editor in chief of the school newspaper. Her mentor there, a journalism teacher named Esther Wojcicki, says \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is a faithful account.\u201cThe dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cThe book is a gift to all of us.\u201dEarly copies of the memoir have circulated among family and friends. Ms. Powell Jobs, her children and Mr. Jobs\u2019s sister, Mona Simpson, gave this statement to The Times: \u201cLisa is part of our family, so it was with sadness that we read her book, which differs dramatically from our memories of those times. The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew. Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood. It was a great comfort to Steve to have Lisa home with all of us during the last days of his life, and we are all grateful for the years we spent together as a family.\u201dOn a hot August day in Brooklyn, Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I walked to her studio, a small apartment with brick walls she painted white and a bamboo floor she painted black. While writing \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she told me, she covered the mirrors around her work space with paper. \u201cI don\u2019t like catching myself in the mirror,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, self.\u2019\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she was nervous about how she would be described physically in a profile, and so I asked her to use her own words. \u201cMy face is uneven,\u201d she said. \u201cI have small eyes. I wish I had dimples, but I don\u2019t. I think right now I look jowly.\u201dI interjected to say she had delicate features, and freckles, and was about 5 foot 2, with slightly reddish brown hair.\u201cMy nose,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs replied, \u201cis not particularly delicate.\u201dShe is deeply self-deprecating, saying she was horrified to be doing \u201ca celebrity memoir.\u201d She said she was sure The New Yorker would not review the book, and that years ago, her first meeting at Grove only occurred because Elisabeth Schmitz, the editorial director, was doing a favor for a mutual friend.\u201cMy first thought on being pitched the book was, \u2018I don\u2019t do this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to publish a celebrity memoir,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Schmitz, who has acquired literary memoirs like the naturalist Helen Macdonald\u2019s \u201cH is for Hawk.\u201d But something about Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s writing made her reconsider. \u201cFrom the first page,\u201d she said, \u201cher language is fresh, surprising, unpredictable.\u201dI\u2019ve read it, and her writing really is compelling. Ms. Brennan-Jobs takes the same linguistic knife to herself as she does to others. She writes with disgust about using anecdotes from her childhood to elicit sympathy from others, and she is ashamed to have dropped her father\u2019s name during an interview to get into Harvard.On Aug. 1, Vanity Fair published an excerpt from \u201cSmall Fry\u201d under the digital headline \u201cI Have a Secret. My Father Is Steve Jobs.\u201d A few nights later, Ms. Brennan-Jobs called me, worried. She hated the title, and on social media, readers were feasting on the more savage details of her account \u2014 especially the \u201ctoilet\u201d comment.\u201cHe was telling me the truth,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, adding that the rosewater perfume she wore had turned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. Sometimes it\u2019s nice of someone to tell you what you smell like.\u201dIt was another uncomfortable reminder that even though \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s story \u2014 one written in a precise, literary style \u2014 her father\u2019s myth looms so large that she cannot control how her words are received. When choosing a narrator for the audio version, she nixed the ones who spoke his lines too harshly or without humor.So much of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort with the memoir seems to be to show how brutal Steve Jobs could be \u2014 and, in doing so, to reclaim that brutality for herself. And how she wants to reclaim it is to love it.\u201cYou get your inheritance, delivered in a lump of coal or whatever in a sort of awful package,\u201d she told me at one point. \u201cAnd you have to take a lot of time to turn the awful package on its head, and it reveals something kind of glorious, and then you\u2019re set free.\u201dIf Ms. Brennan-Jobs was alarmed by the reaction to the toilet-water excerpt, she may be unprepared for what happens when readers encounter more disturbing material. Several times in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs engages in what seems like inappropriate affection in front of his daughter.Ms. Brennan-Jobs describes him embracing Ms. Powell Jobs one day, \u201cpulling her in to a kiss, moving his hand closer to her breasts,\u201d and up her thigh, \u201cmoaning theatrically.\u201dWhen Ms. Brennan-Jobs tries to leave, her father stops her: \u201c\u2018Hey Lis,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stay here. We\u2019re having a family moment. It\u2019s important that you try to be part of this family.\u2019 I sat still, looking away as he moaned and undulated.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs emphasized in an interview that she never felt threatened by her father, and that to her, these scenes show he was \u201cjust awkward.\u201dThis kind of display was not an isolated incident, said Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019 mother, who described an upsetting, sexualized conversation between Mr. Jobs and their daughter in her 2013 memoir, \u201cA Bite in the Apple.\u201d One evening, Ms. Brennan writes, she let Mr. Jobs babysit 9-year-old Lisa. When Ms. Brennan came home early, she found Mr. Jobs with the girl, \u201cteasing her nonstop about her sexual aspirations,\u201d \u201cridiculing her with sexual innuendos,\u201d and \u201cjoking about bedroom antics between Lisa and this or that guy.\u201dMs. Brennan, in her memoir, describes feeling scared for her daughter that night, and wanting to place her body between them and get out of there. \u201cI will be clear,\u201d Ms. Brennan writes. \u201cSteve was not a sexual predator of children. There was something else going on.\u201d Still, after that night, Ms. Brennan tried to make sure there was \u201ca chaperone\u201d when Mr. Jobs was with his young daughter for long hours, she told me recently.\u201cHe was so inappropriate because he didn\u2019t know how to do better,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. In her book, she characterizes Mr. Jobs as \u201con a slide whistle between human and inhuman.\u201dOne afternoon in August, as Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I talked in her kitchen, she made a juice of dandelion greens, pineapple, turmeric and ginger roots. She eats an extremely healthy diet and knows it mirrors her father\u2019s, which veered into esoteric California wellness trends, even as pancreatic cancer took over more of his body.Ms. Brennan-Jobs has a husband, Bill, a longtime Microsoft employee now launching a software start-up. He has two daughters, aged 10 and 12, and he and Ms. Brennan-Jobs have a 4-month-old son. As she drinks her juice, Bill is nearby with the children, and there\u2019s an easygoing energy in the house.\u201cI see my husband and the way he is with his daughters \u2014 responsive and alive and sensitive in ways my father would have liked to be,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. \u201cMy father would have loved to be a man like that, and he surrounded himself with men like that, but he couldn\u2019t be.\u201dDecades after his child-support lawsuit, Mr. Jobs erased his paternity again. \u201cSmall Fry\u201d notes that on his corporate bio on the Apple website, the detail-obsessed chief executive was listed as having three children. But of course he had four.The most public torchbearer for Mr. Jobs\u2019s character and legacy is Ms. Powell Jobs. With an inherited fortune of some $21 billion, she has engaged in philanthropy and launched the Emerson Collective, an organization that pursues liberal political activism and for-profit investments, and owns a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine.Ms. Powell Jobs plays a somewhat \u201ctonic note\u201d in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. Her stepmother brings her into family photos, for example, but many of the descriptions of Ms. Powell Jobs are biting.Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me that she gave Ms. Powell Jobs \u201cthe best line\u201d in the book. It appears in a scene where Ms. Powell Jobs and Mr. Jobs go to a therapy session with a teenage Lisa. Ms. Brennan-Jobs cries and says she feels lonely and has wanted her parents to say good night to her.Ms. Powell Jobs responds to the therapist: \u201cWe\u2019re just cold people.\u201dToward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life, he finally apologized to his daughter. Ms. Brennan-Jobs calls it her \u201cmovie ending.\u201d In the book, she writes that Mr. Jobs said he was sorry he had not spent more time with her, and for disappearing during her adulthood, forgetting birthdays and not returning notes or calls.In reply, Ms. Brennan-Jobs says she knows he was busy. Mr. Jobs answers that he acted the way he did because she had offended him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was busy. It was because I was mad you didn\u2019t invite me to the Harvard weekend,\u201d he says in the book, referring to a matriculation event.He also cries and tells her over and over again, \u201cI owe you one\u201d \u2014 a famously articulate communicator unable to summon the basic language of contrition.Ms. Brennan-Jobs may be experiencing a kind of author\u2019s remorse as her book makes its way toward store shelves. But details as lethal as these \u2014 they sink into Mr. Jobs\u2019s legend like daggers to the hilt \u2014 are more proof than any DNA test that she is her father\u2019s daughter.Ultimately, Mr. Jobs left his daughter an inheritance in the millions \u2014 the same amount as his other children \u2014 and she is not involved in the allocation of his financial legacy. If she was in charge of his billions, she says, she would give it away to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 a curious twist given her father\u2019s epic rivalry with Apple\u2019s archnemesis.\u201cWould it be too perverse?\u201d she asked. \u201cI feel like the Gates Foundation is really doing good stuff, and I think I would just hot potato it away.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she wrote \u201cSmall Fry\u201d in part to figure out why he withheld money from her even as his wealth ballooned, and as he spent it more freely on the children he had with Ms. Powell Jobs. She said she now sees it was about teaching her that money can corrupt.The ethos \u201cfelt true and kind of beautiful and kind of enlightened for somebody like that,\u201d she said. Still, the question was \u201cwhy he would have taken that value system and applied it so severely to me.\u201d\u201cYou can have a value system and be unable to totally live it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can imagine being that rich and famous and how amazing it is if you can hold on to some of your value system. He didn\u2019t do it right. He didn\u2019t apply it evenly. But I feel grateful for it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs told me she likes toying with the strange power of being a memoirist writing about trauma because the reader knows she made it out O.K. She is here in the privileged position of writing this book, after all. And as a memoirist, even a reluctant one, she gets the final word.One night toward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life \u2014 and the end of the book \u2014 he is watching \u201cLaw and Order\u201d in bed.\u201c\u2018Are you going to write about me?\u2019\u201d he asks her.She tells him no.\u201c\u2018Good,\u2019 he says, and turns back to the television.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described an Emerson Collective investment.

{"Headline": "Free Speech Scholars to Alex Jones: You\u2019re Not Protected", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSocial media goes Gestapo!\u201d wrote Bill Mitchell, a conservative Twitter personality with 366,000 followers, on Monday evening.\u201cThe great censorship purge has truly begun,\u201d warned Paul Joseph Watson, a contributor to Mr. Jones\u2019s website, Infowars.And in his own message on Twitter, one platform that hasn\u2019t removed his content, Mr. Jones asked: \u201cNow, who will stand against Tyranny and who will stand for free speech?\u201dThe removal of Mr. Jones and Infowars came after months of mounting pressure on technology companies to tackle the spread of misinformation online. Mr. Jones and Infowars have for years used social media to push unfounded conspiracy theories. On Sunday, Apple removed five of the six Infowars podcasts on its popular Podcasts app and by Monday Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube had followed with similar measures.But this isn\u2019t the only effort to stop Mr. Jones from spreading his theories. He also faces multiple defamation claims, and well before Monday\u2019s moves, several scholars of free speech had already concluded that many of the things he has said online were not in fact protected by the First Amendment.In a recent court filing, four law professors who specialize in free-speech issues said that Mr. Jones\u2019s oeuvre was riddled with \u201cabsurd conspiracy theories\u201d and urged a federal judge considering a lawsuit against him not to let him hide behind the First Amendment while publishing his rhetoric.\u201cFalse speech does not serve the public interest the way that true speech does,\u201d the scholars wrote. \u201cAnd indeed, there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.\u201dIn a breathless moment (\u201cI mean, it\u2019s like, whoa, whoa \u2014 C.I.A.?\u201d), Mr. Jones went on to suggest that Mr. Gilmore may have been involved in the attack on Ms. Heyer to bring about what he described as \u201cthe downfall of Trump.\u201dIn March, Mr. Gilmore sued Mr. Jones for defamation, arguing that he had suffered threats and harassment because of the report.In defending himself, Mr. Jones has claimed in court papers that his allegations concerning Mr. Gilmore were \u201copinion, not statements of fact\u201d and that Infowars is a \u201cfreewheeling\u201d website, \u201cin which hyperbole and diatribe reign as the preferred tools of discourse.\u201d His viewers, Mr. Jones maintained, \u201cexpect an interview or monologue to be more free-flowing and opinionated and less precise in its use of language than an article or a book.\u201dWhile they acknowledged that the protection of speech is \u201ca priority of the first order,\u201d the First Amendment scholars, from institutions like Rutgers University and the University of Chicago Law School, noted that since the Middle Ages defamation law has created \u201csocial boundaries about what speech is and is not acceptable.\u201d It has also, they wrote, long sought to balance the freedom of expression with the safeguarding of people\u2019s reputations.To do this, the scholars said, defamation statutes have always restricted some speech \u2014 especially for private figures like Mr. Gilmore, who have less of an ability than those like Mr. Jones with media platforms to \u201cdisseminate their own side of the story.\u201dThe scholars were particularly scathing when it came to Mr. Jones\u2019s contention that his videos on Infowars reflected nothing more than his beliefs. It would set a dangerous precedent, they said, if Judge Moon ruled on his behalf.\u201cIt would allow unscrupulous news organizations to couch their language as \u2018opinion\u2019 and to mask their meaning with implication and insinuation,\u201d the scholars wrote. That, they added, would leave \u201creaders clear as to the message but avoiding all liability for defamatory remarks. This should not be allowed and, in fact, is not allowed.\u201dThe law professors who signed the amicus brief were Lyrissa B. Lidsky, dean of the University of Missouri School of Law, Tamara R. Piety at the University of Tulsa College of Law, David A. Strauss from the University of Chicago Law School, and Carlos A. Ball of Rutgers.The brief was also signed by Michael B. Hissam, a lawyer at the firm of Bailey & Glasser in Charleston, W.Va., who is amicus counsel for Mr. Gilmore, and Katharine M. Mapes and Katherine O\u2019Konski, lawyers at the firm of Spiegel & McDiarmid in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Infowars and China\u2019s Great Firewall", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello, readers! Greetings from Hong Kong. I\u2019m Li Yuan, Asia tech columnist, and it\u2019s my turn to write the newsletter. This week, the tech world on both sides of the Pacific got embroiled in the topic I\u2019m most passionate about: censorship. Allow me to indulge a bit.But as exhausting and exasperating as the debate about tech companies\u2019 role in policing content may be for many Americans, I often watch it with envy and wish we could have similarly vigorous discussions about free speech and due process in China.As many of you may know, China has the world\u2019s most sophisticated and brutal internet censorship system called the Great Firewall. Over the past decade, the Chinese government blocked Google, Facebook and Twitter, along with thousands of other foreign websites. In their places rose the homegrown search engine giant Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter called Weibo, and the Facebook-like app called WeChat. The government also carried out many crackdowns on tools that help circumvent the Great Firewall.I was surprised by the reactions (good and bad) to the column. Some readers were sarcastic. Not having access to Google, Facebook or Twitter? \u201cLucky them!\u201d wrote one Facebook user. \u201cThey have not missed anything important!\u201d said another.The point of the column wasn\u2019t about access to those websites, which, as flawed as they are, constitute much of the internet in many countries. It was about access to information and what happens when a government controls the flow of information.I\u2019m especially surprised that the column went viral on the Chinese internet. Censorship is a tired topic to many Chinese, who live it everyday. Since both The Times and its Chinese website are blocked in China, people made screenshots or PDF versions of the column, then posted it on social media timelines or shared it in chat groups. I posted the links on my Weibo account but the tweet got blocked quickly.\u201cAfter reading your article, I\u2019m very worried about China\u2019s future,\u201d a lawyer in Beijing messaged me. Her family has been using tools to bypass the Great Firewall for years. She said her son was considered \u201cweird\u201d by his high school classmates because he shared information he learned from some blocked foreign websites. Now he\u2019s studying at a college in the United States.\u201cHe had to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was too different.\u201dThere were some discussions about how representative the young people in my column were. Some readers, especially expats, said they know plenty of Chinese who scale the Great Firewall. Some of my closest Chinese friends also said they will have to send themselves into exile if the government blocks all censorship-bypassing tools. It will be the last straw for them.But outside of these circles, it\u2019s often a different picture. Some people \u2014 even those who have many ways to get out of the Great Firewall \u2014 decide to stay in and defend it.So my column wasn\u2019t just about the young generation of Chinese. It was about all Chinese who grew up without access to uncensored information. Once inside the wall, it\u2019s hard to escape because often you don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know.In other news this week:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo C.E.O. Who Pushed for Healthier Products, to Step Down", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn her 12 years as chief executive of PepsiCo, Indra K. Nooyi has been part of an elite club: She is one of only a small number of women leading large corporations. It is a position that has often meant her every move received greater scrutiny than the actions of her male peers.That was true again on Monday, when Ms. Nooyi, 62, announced she was giving it all up and handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year veteran of the company, in October.The number of women in top jobs has, in fact, fallen sharply.\u201cI hate seeing her step down this particular year because we\u2019ve had a 25 percent drop in women C.E.O.s at major firms, and this is a big loss,\u201d Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, the senior associate dean of leadership programs at the Yale School of Management, said of Ms. Nooyi.In some cases, the women at the top have been pushed out by activist investors seeking a shake-up in the executive suite. \u201cA lot of women have been easy targets when their performance weakens,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cMaybe unconsciously, institutional investors get weak-kneed and don\u2019t back them up and boards of directors collapse like lawn furniture.\u201dOthers tie the lack of women at the top not only to the choices of individual executives, but to a wider culture that is biased against women in the workplace, some experts argue. Women struggle as they adapt their careers to the demands of child-rearing while they are often viewed differently because they do not fit the mold of the leaders, overwhelmingly men, who preceded them.Ms. Nooyi\u2019s impact on PepsiCo cannot be overstated. Over the past decade, she has transformed the company dramatically, expanding its presence in international markets, and also shifting its products increasingly into healthier beverage and snack choices.Today, half of the company\u2019s revenues come from healthier drink and snack products, up from 38 percent in 2006.Still, Ms. Nooyi spent much of her tenure at the top defending her strategy to critics, who included activist investors. When PepsiCo lost market share on its namesake product a few years ago, critics claimed Ms. Nooyi was too focused on the \u201chealthy\u201d strategy. Others, including the billionaire activist Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management, wanted the company split into two, a beverage giant and a snack king.Ms. Nooyi held firm. Since she took over, revenue has grown to $63.5 billion from $35 billion in 2006, while the company\u2019s share price has nearly doubled in that time.In an interview, Ms. Nooyi said she was stepping down now, in part, because she wanted to spend more time with her 86-year-old mother. \u201cYou reach a point where you get tired,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said. \u201cPhysically tired. And your family starts to demand more time of you. I\u2019ve reached that point.\u201dInside PepsiCo, Ms. Nooyi was known for working incredibly long hours \u2014 as many as 20 hours a day, often seven days a week. When asked Monday whether she felt that made her a good role model for other women, Ms. Nooyi said, \u201cprobably not.\u201d\u201cBut you have to remember when I started working in this corporate world, there were hardly any women in the jobs I was in. At that time, 30 or 40 years ago, expectations for women were unreasonable. We had to produce a better product and do everything much better than the men in order to move ahead,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said.Ms. Nooyi\u2019s departure comes as the outlook for consumer packaged goods companies remains murky. It is difficult for big brands to raise prices as they increasingly face competition on shelves from private-label store brands. There has also been an extreme fragmentation of the food industry as big brands like PepsiCo face competition from start-up snack companies.Born in Chennai, in southern India, Ms. Nooyi joined PepsiCo in 1994 and held a series of strategy roles before becoming its chief financial officer in 2000, and in 2006, its chief executive.She said she believed the workplace, in general, had improved for women in the past decade. \u201cWomen are not held to unreasonably high standards these days,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a blanket statement. There are still places where it is a boys\u2019 club, but I do think we\u2019re moving to a place where we\u2019re letting the best candidates move ahead.\u201dWhile Ms. Nooyi was often held up as an example of a woman in a very powerful position, she was a rare chief who did not claim to have it all worked out. A wife, mother and chief executive of a global conglomerate, Ms. Nooyi played down the notion of perfect balance.\u201cI don\u2019t think women can have it all,\u201d she said at the Aspen Ideas Festival in 2014. \u201cWe pretend we have it all.\u201dShe told a story about getting a call when she was at work late one night from the chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo that she was going to be named president of the company and put on the board of directors.She left work to tell her family, but when she arrived home, she was met by her mother, who told her to go back out and buy milk for the morning.She did, banging the milk on the counter and telling her mother that she had just been named president and placed on the board of a large company, and all her mother wanted her to do was to go out and get the milk.As she recalled, her mother said she might be the president of PepsiCo. She might be on the board of directors. \u201cBut when you enter this house, you\u2019re the wife, you\u2019re the daughter, you\u2019re the daughter-in-law, you\u2019re the mother. You\u2019re all of that,\u201d Ms. Nooyi told the conference. \u201cSo leave that damned crown in the garage.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m beginning to use certain words a little bit more freely, and I am screaming a bit more, pounding the table,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said at the conference, noting that was not really her style. \u201cBut it is effective. It shows the passion that I have for what I\u2019m doing.\u201dPrashant Rao and Amie Tsang in London contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u2018Respect\u2019 Became a Battle Cry for Musicians Seeking Royalties", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was Aretha Franklin\u2019s first No. 1 hit, the cry of empowerment that has defined her for generations: \u201cRespect.\u201dBut for the roughly seven million times the song has been played on American radio stations, she was paid nothing.Under an aspect of copyright law that has long irked the record business, American radio stations pay only the writers and publishers of a song, not the artists who perform them. \u201cRespect\u201d was written by Otis Redding, who sang it as a man\u2019s demand for recognition from his wife. Ms. Franklin turned the song upside down \u2014 or right-side up \u2014 and took it to heights Mr. Redding never dreamed of.But every time the song is played on the radio, Mr. Redding\u2019s estate \u2014 he died in a 1967 plane crash \u2014 has been paid. Ms. Franklin never was.Efforts to change the law go back decades, with \u201cRespect\u201d often held up by the music industry as Exhibit A for why it was unfair. But broadcasters, a powerful lobbying group, have successfully argued that performers already benefit from the promotion they receive from radio play.\u201cSome recordings more clearly highlight the inequity of the laws, and \u2018Respect\u2019 is one of the best examples,\u201d said Mitch Glazier, the president of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group representing the major labels.In recent years, \u201cRespect\u201d has also become a battle song in a fight over digital rights. Laws passed in the 1990s let performing artists collect royalties from internet and satellite radio, but songs were exempt if they were recorded before a change in federal copyright law took effect in 1972.But as the bill has encountered opposition in the Senate, Ms. Franklin has again become a face for musicians\u2019 anger.\u201cBest way to pay RESPECT?\u201d he wrote. \u201cPay her!\u201dThe satellite service Sirius XM agreed in a settlement three years ago to pay record labels more than $200 million for its use of songs created before 1972, and to enter into new licensing deals, which would benefit performers like Ms. Franklin. But it has opposed the bill because it exempts terrestrial radio from the payments.\u201dRespect\u201d entered Ms. Franklin\u2019s repertoire at a pivotal moment in her career, as she was leaving Columbia Records for Atlantic, where she became a national star. Mr. Redding\u2019s \u201cRespect\u201d had reached No. 4 on the R&B chart in late 1965.According to David Ritz\u2019s biography \u201cRespect: The Life of Aretha Franklin,\u201d the song was already part of her live show by 1966. In the book, the producer Jerry Wexler recounts a conversation with Ted White, Ms. Franklin\u2019s husband and manager at the time. Mr. Wexler was looking for songs for Ms. Franklin, and was fine with \u201cRespect\u201d as long as she \u201cchanges it up from the original.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta worry about that, Wex,\u201d Mr. White replied, according to the book. \u201cShe changes it up all right.\u201dMs. Franklin made small but crucial adjustments to the lyrics. Where Mr. Redding sang, \u201cDo me wrong, honey, if you wanna / You can do me wrong, honey, while I\u2019m gone,\u201d for example, Ms. Franklin sang: \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna do you wrong while you\u2019re gone / Ain\u2019t gonna do you wrong \u2018cause I don\u2019t wanna.\u201dShe also added what became the song\u2019s signature line: \u201cR-E-S-P-E-C-T / Find out what it means to me.\u201dMs. Franklin\u2019s reinvention of Mr. Redding\u2019s song has continued to fascinate critics. Peter Guralnick, the author of books like \u201cSweet Soul Music: Rhythm and Blues and the Southern Dream of Freedom,\u201d noted that she transformed the original meaning \u201cnot so much by changing the lyrics, as by the feeling that she imparted on the song \u2014 so that \u2018Respect\u2019 became a proclamation of freedom, a proclamation of feminism, a proclamation of an independent spirit.\u201dWhile the song has been used as a P.R. weapon in the industry\u2019s policy wars, Ms. Franklin usually remained uninvolved. The song was lucrative for her in other ways, including record sales and concerts. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Ritz said he was not aware of any opinion that she had about royalties for \u201cRespect,\u201d but said that \u201cshe felt exploited\u201d by the industry in general.The Universal Music Publishing Group, which controls Mr. Redding\u2019s songwriting copyright, declined to say how much the song has earned. But the licensing agency BMI said that \u201cRespect\u201d had been played 7.4 million times on commercial radio stations in the United States since it was released.Barry Massarsky, an economist who specializes in valuing music catalogs, estimated that over the last five years alone, \u201cRespect\u201d has earned about $500,000, about 40 percent of that from commercial radio and the rest from television and streaming services.For streaming services like Spotify, their use of songs, old or new, is covered by licensing deals that do generally benefit performers like Ms. Franklin. Those services have seen a surge in interest in her music since her death: \u201cRespect\u201d was streamed on Apple Music more than half a million times worldwide on Thursday, the service said.A spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters, which represents radio stations, declined to comment. But the organization has long opposed proposals to create a royalty for performing artists. A document on the organization\u2019s website says that such new royalties \u201ccould reduce the variety of music radio stations play, and all but eliminate the possibility of new artists breaking onto the scene.\u201dMr. Redding\u2019s heirs may profit from the song, but his estate \u2014 including his daughter, Karla Redding-Andrews \u2014 has supported changing the law covering pre-1972 songs.Jeff Jampol, who manages the estate, said that for artists like Ms. Franklin and Mr. Redding, unfair financial treatment was built into the fabric of their early careers, and the music industry has not fully made amends.\u201cThe record business has a long history of treating artists like chattel slavery,\u201d Mr. Jampol said. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown out of those dark ages a bit, but when it comes to actually paying them fairly, that is the last needle to move.\u201dMatthew Haag contributed reporting and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

It is worth lingering on that for a moment. If some female executives feel reticent to promote women for fear that their actions will be questioned, then the entire approach to creating more gender equality needs to be rethought.The move thrusts Big Tech into a debate it fears. Despite intense scrutiny for their role in the distribution of misinformation, such companies don\u2019t want the cost, responsibility or moral stigma of regulating speech.Until now, they\u2019ve tried to draw the line at content likely to provoke violence.
