{"Headline": "Alibaba Had a Bright Quarter, Despite Clouds Over China\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byServing the nation\u2019s middle-class shoppers, however, still seems to be rollicking good business.The Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan, reported a rise in sales of more than 60 percent in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier.Profits for April to June fell by more than 40 percent, however, reflecting the effect of a large increase in the valuation of Ant Financial, an Alibaba sister company. Because Alibaba has given some employees awards based on Ant shares, the group\u2019s compensation expenses grew sizably.Had that not been the case, the company said, profits would have grown by more than a third.Alibaba is already among the world\u2019s largest and most influential forces in digital retail. But it is setting its sights on providing technology to enable all commerce, whether online or off, along with logistics and marketing. Thursday\u2019s strong results suggest that the company\u2019s empire building has not harmed the current core of its business: selling ads to the merchants on its shopping platforms.\u201cThis model is kind of unique,\u201d said Jialong Shi, an analyst in Hong Kong with the investment bank Nomura. \u201cIf the macro slowdown is to take a toll on the overall retail business, Alibaba should, on the back of this unique marketplace model, fare relatively better.\u201dJD.com, the Chinese e-retailer and Alibaba rival, has had a similarly rough year. Investor skepticism also has not spared a swath of smaller Chinese names, in businesses from e-books to gadgets.The more different realms of consumer life in which Alibaba has a hand, the more data it can amass on how consumers spend, and on what they want. That makes Alibaba\u2019s platforms more useful to vendors, which in turn helps the company sell more ads and services to those merchants.But all that spending for the future has eaten somewhat into Alibaba\u2019s profits in the present. And the uncertainty confronting China\u2019s economy could still mean that the company\u2019s sales growth hits stumbles.A far greater value of merchandise is still sold on Alibaba\u2019s Taobao platform than on Pinduoduo, and Taobao still has many more merchants. But Steven Zhu, an analyst with the research firm Pacific Epoch, said surveys of merchants and conversations with industry insiders had led him to believe that many of Pinduoduo\u2019s more than one million merchants were also on Taobao.That suggests that these vendors might shift their energies this year to selling wares on the newer, hotter platform.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, I think Pinduoduo still has issues,\u201d Mr. Zhu said. But for Alibaba, he said, Pinduoduo\u2019s size \u201cis something that you cannot ignore at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Li Keli cut down on travel and takes her son to a public playground instead. Wang Jiazhi stopped dating.Welcome to China\u2019s \u201cconsumption downgrade\u201d culture, a potentially worrisome development for Beijing and the world.For years, the conversation in China was about \u201cconsumption upgrades.\u201d As the economy took off, China\u2019s middle class \u2014 now more than 400 million strong and still growing \u2014 decided to spend those bigger paychecks. It traded up from local brands to Nikes, from cheap phones to iPhones, from tea to $5 Starbucks lattes.Today, China\u2019s economy is slowing, and shopping has slowed with it. The stock market is slumping. China\u2019s currency has lost some of its value. The trade war with President Trump has left many Chinese feeling pessimistic.China\u2019s consumer culture has by no means ground to a halt. But in the streets and on the Chinese internet, the talk is about cutting back in ways big and small.A post headlined \u201cThis Generation of Young Chinese, Brace for the Bitter Days Ahead,\u201d by Ming Na, a blogger, received more than 300,000 views on the social media platform WeChat last weekend. She advised young people to stop going to shopping malls and nightclubs.\u201cThe age of the consumption downgrade,\u201d Ms. Na wrote, \u201chas arrived with a big crashing sound.\u201dChen Siqi hears the message. A 30-year-old accountant in Beijing, she recently bought a garbage bin on Pinduoduo, a Chinese app focused on cheap, sometimes iffy goods that initially enjoyed appeal only in rural areas. She makes about $1,400 a month after taxes, but nearly half of it goes to the rent on her one-bedroom apartment.Ms. Chen said she had reached the age when she wanted to live in her own apartment instead of sharing with others. To save money, she now cooks at home a few times a week and buys clothes mostly from cheap online vendors and the Japanese basics brand Uniqlo.\u201cI would like to have a nicer lifestyle but don\u2019t know how I can afford it,\u201d she said.A Chinese consumption downgrade could be felt around the world. Chinese spenders have been a key driver of their country\u2019s economic growth in recent years. China, in turn, has played a major role in global growth. Chinese consumers help global companies like Apple, General Motors, Volkswagen and many others. A consumption downgrade could also embolden Mr. Trump in his trade fight with China, as he gambles that Beijing can\u2019t take much more economic damage.Long-term factors are driving down spending among young people in particular. The cost of education is going up. Housing in rich cities like Beijing has become unaffordable for many.Housing is so expensive that Wang Jiazhi moved out of his own home. A 34-year-old semiconductor engineer in the southern city of Shenzhen, he bought a one-bedroom apartment in 2016. In addition to a mortgage of more than $700 a month, he needs to pay his relatives back for the money he borrowed for the down payment. So he rents his apartment and shares a four-bedroom apartment with nine other men. This way, Mr. Wang \u2014 who makes about $2,000 a month after taxes \u2014 saves $160 a month.Like many Chinese men, Mr. Wang believes he needs an apartment in order to find a wife. But he is under so much pressure with his mortgage and debt, and with supporting his aging parents in the countryside, that he has had to postpone his plan for marriage. His prospects weren\u2019t good anyway: To save money, he has stopped dating.\u201cI work long hours every day,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me feel occupied.\u201dSo the consumption downgrade is in. Even as China\u2019s stock market has sputtered, shares in companies that make affordable staples like erguotou, a cheap hard liquor, and pickled vegetables have bucked the trend.\u201cDrink erguotou with pickled vegetables,\u201d said Ms. Na, the blogger, quoting popular Chinese internet memes. \u201cTake a ride with Mobike,\u201d she added, naming a bike-share company that offers two-wheeled rides for pennies.Even the only children of middle-class families, a group that is largely financially secure, can feel anxious about their future.Wu Xiaoqiong, 28, is the only child of a civil servant and a doctor in the eastern province of Anhui. She works at a big internet company in Beijing with monthly pay of $1,500 after taxes.When she got married last year, her parents and her husband\u2019s parents each put in half of the down payment for a one-bedroom apartment \u2014 a typical arrangement for many Chinese middle-class families. Nearly two-thirds of the couple\u2019s monthly income goes to the mortgage and toward the rent of a small apartment in Shanghai, where her husband works at a state-owned bank.Her consumption downgrade plan is to remain childless.\u201cWe have almost no savings and no retirement plans,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents have been supporting me financially. How can I afford a child?\u201dOthers are saying no to bigger households \u2014 a problem for a Chinese government worried about the country\u2019s aging population.When asked whether she would consider having a second child, Li Keli, an accountant at an electronics maker in the southern city of Huizhou, said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Her factory laid off two-thirds of its workers in June when the United States-China trade war escalated. Her monthly pay of $500 was cut by 10 percent. She used to take her son, 7, to visit nearby cities on weekends. Now she takes him to the playgrounds of big residential complexes because they\u2019re free.Many high earners feel anxious as well. Chen Ying, 33, an architect in Shanghai, said her consumption downgrade plan involved not shopping in department stores.Ms. Chen said she did not expect her pay to rise too much. Her younger colleagues do not make as much as when she first started four years ago, and her pay now is lower than that of older colleagues with similar experience four years ago.She used to get pay raises of 15 percent to 20 percent a year \u2014 rates that weren\u2019t uncommon at fast-growing industries in China in the past decade. Now she expects the raises to be 5 percent, if she gets them at all. She has started to think about retirement, but doesn\u2019t know where to begin.\u201cIn the past we had many inflated expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we don\u2019t expect so much.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the province Wu Xiaoqiong is from.

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Plans for a China Comeback Go Beyond Google Search", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world\u2019s largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Starbucks Teams Up With Alibaba on Coffee Delivery, as It Tries to Keep Its Throne in China", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For years, Starbucks was the undisputed king of coffee in China.It single-handedly created a market of coffee drinkers in a nation of tea lovers, cashing in on a wave of affluent Chinese who looked to Starbucks as an aspirational brand. The country quickly became the coffee chain\u2019s second-largest market after the United States.But Starbucks\u2019s dominance in China is increasingly under attack, as growth begins to slow and competitors aggressively target coffee drinkers. Starbucks executives have come under scrutiny for being slow to adapt to technological shifts and retail trends in the country, namely delivery.On Thursday, in a bid to revitalize its China operation, the company announced what it called a strategic \u201cnew retail\u201d partnership with the Chinese tech giant Alibaba.The partnership will allow Starbucks to pilot delivery services next month with an Alibaba subsidiary, Ele.me, and establish what it called delivery kitchens in Alibaba\u2019s Hema supermarkets.Starbucks will also integrate across Alibaba\u2019s platforms to create a virtual Starbucks store so Chinese customers can have more personalized experiences, the two companies said.\u201cThis is rocket fuel for our digital flywheel strategy in China,\u201d Kevin Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, said Thursday at a news briefing in Shanghai.China is one of Starbucks\u2019s most important markets, especially as the company\u2019s domestic one cools. It has raised prices to offset decreasing foot traffic into United States stores. And last week, Starbucks lowered its growth projections for the year.For Starbucks, analysts say the \u201cnew retail\u201d is partly an attempt to fend off competition from Luckin Coffee, a Chinese start-up. The company, which was started in Beijing in January with two stores, has since opened more than 800 branches in 13 cities around the country. Its co-founder Guo Jinyi has been vocal about the company\u2019s ambitions to surpass Starbucks.Starbucks has long been criticized as slow to adapt to digital trends in China; it came to mobile payments later than other brands and is starting delivery only now. \u201cAt Starbucks, we feel that we need to earn our right to do delivery right,\u201d said Belinda Wong, the chief executive of Starbucks\u2019s China operation.Perhaps no phenomenon has created as much buzz for transforming the consumer experience in China than \u201cnew retail.\u201d From Alibaba to JD.com, e-commerce companies are encouraging consumers to merge their offline and online shopping experiences by visiting brick-and-mortar stores but placing their orders online and finding out more information about their products through their smartphones.Jeffrey Towson, a private-equity investor and a professor of investment at Peking University who has been vocal about Starbucks\u2019s failure to be nimble in adopting digital strategies, said Thursday\u2019s announcement could help Starbucks move beyond its traditional reliance on brick-and-mortar transactions.He added, \u201cThis is really bad news for Luckin Coffee.\u201dLuckin is positioning itself as a mass-market alternative to Starbucks so it can win over customers willing to pay $3.50 for a latte \u2014 20 percent below what Starbucks charges. It offers customers discounts if they order more and is giving them half off food orders for the next five months. Customers can also choose whether they want to pick up their coffees at a store or have them delivered in 30 minutes.It is still too soon to say whether Luckin will succeed in a country rife with start-ups that burn through cash and go bankrupt overnight. And it can be hard to compete in the long run against the scale of a brand like Starbucks.Mr. Guo, Luckin\u2019s co-founder, pointed out that Starbucks is not dominant in countries like Canada, where there is Tim Hortons, and Britain, which is dominated by Costa Coffee.\u201cEach place has its own local brand, and these local brands are now the leaders,\u201d Mr. Guo said. \u201cI believe that in China, anything can happen in a place that is so conducive for innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201dIn May, Luckin sued Starbucks, arguing that the American chain had signed exclusive contracts with commercial property owners that barred other coffee shops from entering the space if a Starbucks was already there.It\u2019s not going to be easy to oust Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in more than 140 cities in China and plans to nearly double that by 2022.Ben Cavender, senior analyst of China Market Research, a consultancy based in Shanghai, estimates that Starbucks has a 70 percent share of the market, blazing past coffee chains like McDonald\u2019s McCafe and Costa Coffee. But the company must prove it can stay on the cutting edge.\u201cThe challenge is that consumers are much pickier about the experience they get now; they have other good options that have standardized quality and potentially a more interesting environment,\u201d Mr. Cavender said. \u201cSo Starbucks has to do a better job. It\u2019s not a clear win anymore.\u201dMr. Johnson said that Starbucks began discussing teaming up with Alibaba about a year ago.When asked about the competition posed by Luckin, Mr. Johnson said, \u201cI think certainly as people look at the market opportunity in China as it relates to coffee, we expect there will continue to be more competition.\u201dWhat Starbucks has going for it is a large following, especially in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. On Tuesday, as the summer sun bore down on the trendy Sanlitun neighborhood of Beijing, customers lined up for coffees. Wang Qi, 25, who works in media, said she preferred Starbucks to Luckin because of the environment.\u201cYou can sit down and have a proper cup of coffee,\u201d Ms. Wang said.Zhao Ting, who is also 25 and works in media, said, \u201cEveryone trusts this brand.\u201dBut not everyone has remained loyal. Wang Shanshan, a 35-year-old who drinks coffee once or twice a week, said she had switched to Luckin because she thought its coffee tasted better than Starbucks\u2019. Plus, there are the discounts.\u201cThey are giving one free if you buy two, five free if you buy five,\u201d Ms. Wang said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty good.\u201dElsie Chen and Mengxue Ou contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tencent, the Chinese Internet Giant, Stumbles. Beijing Gets the Blame", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Its chat app has inspired Silicon Valley. It owns some of the biggest video game franchises in the world. And after years of growth it has become one of the largest internet companies in the world.Yet on Wednesday, Tencent stumbled, missing earnings targets and posting a drop in profit growth for the first time in more than a decade.As surprising as the slip up was the reason behind it: China\u2019s government.Bureaucratic reshuffling at the top levels of China\u2019s government made it difficult for the company to get the licensing required to make money on new games, Tencent\u2019s president, Martin Lau, explained on an earnings call. In a separate case, Chinese regulators pulled another game \u2014 Monster Hunter: World \u2014 because its content was deemed too gory.\u201cA lot of games have not been approved,\u201d said Mr. Lau, adding that the government was aware \u201cthe restructuring is now affecting the industry as a whole.\u201dThe admission was a rare acknowledgment of the outsize role China\u2019s government can play in the fortunes, and misfortunes, of its most important private companies.Excessive bureaucracy, heavy-handed censorship and overreach into day-to-day management all come as downsides to a company having Beijing in its corner. For China\u2019s largest companies, though, there is no choice. In a famed quote, the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, warned executives to strike a balance. Love the government, he advised, but don\u2019t marry it.An emblem of China\u2019s growing innovative prowess, Tencent, which owns the messaging and payments app WeChat, has nonetheless been a beneficiary of Beijing\u2019s policies. Government internet blocks have kept out would-be rivals like Facebook. Other plans that will bolster the company include a government initiative to turn WeChat into a form of digital national identification.But China has been a double-edged sword.Tencent\u2019s results helped push shares of some American tech companies, many of which look to China as a potential key growth market, lower on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index fell about 1.2 percent.\u201cOne of the prevailing assumptions, particularly around tech and tech hardware, is China equals growth,\u201d said Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management. \u201cSo when one of the leading names, the names you look for to take the pulse, comes up sick, that can shake you up a little bit.\u201dOn Thursday, Tencent\u2019s shares fell by 3 percent in Hong Kong trading. Over the past five days, they have lost more than one-tenth of their value as investors grew increasingly concerned about regulatory hurdles and rising competition. Since the middle of last week, Tencent\u2019s market value has fallen by more than $50 billion.Holding up earnings this past quarter has been Tencent\u2019s inability to make money in China off PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battleground, or PUBG, a popular game that pits players against one another in a battle to the death on an island covered with weapons, vehicles and sniper nests. Tencent said it was working closely with regulators to get the license, which would allow it to make money on the game by, for instance, selling virtual items within the app.Mr. Lau said that the company was working diligently to get the approvals. Ultimately the problem is a matter of the timing of the signoffs, not whether they will be acceptable, Mr. Lau added. Some have objected to the violence in PUBG, which is often played by devotees on smartphones, volume up on their phone speakers, in public places like trains and parks. The game, Monster Hunter: World, was pulled entirely for its content, though Mr. Lau said the company was working to \u201cadjust the content\u201d so it could gain approval.\u201cThe regulatory headwind is definitely having a toll\u201d on Tencent\u2019s gaming revenue, said John Choi, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, noting that the company has not been able to monetize a key title like PUBG.WeChat has also faced new competition from several smaller companies that make apps that allow users to share short videos.Concerns about the competition and the increased regulatory oversight have weighed on the company\u2019s share price for months. Its stock price has fallen almost 30 percent from peaks in January.The company\u2019s second quarter net profit fell 2 percent from the same period a year earlier to $2.7 billion. Its revenue in the period rose 30 percent, to $11.1 billion.Matt Phillips contributed reporting from New YorkAdvertisement"}

SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund is larger than the total amount invested by all venture funds in the United States in 2017. The deals are so large, start-ups can now can ask themselves: I.P.O. or SoftBank?That firepower is why SoftBank\u2019s name tends to strike fear, envy and longing into the hearts of investors and start-up chief executives. Some investors accuse the Vision Fund of distorting the funding market by inflating start-up valuations. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s C.E.O., has been called a \u201cone-man bubble maker.\u201d Some founders are desperate to get access to the company\u2019s Scrooge McDuck pool of money. But others charge that the fund, which invests a minimum of $100 million per deal, is pushing companies to take on capital they may not want or need out of fear. (Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s C.E.O., once said he did a deal with the firm because he\u2019d rather have SoftBank\u2019s \u201ccapital cannon\u201d behind him, rather than pointed at him.)This week SoftBank positioned its capital cannon behind Brandless, sending $240 million to the e-commerce start-up, which sells a variety of organic and \u201cclean\u201d household consumables for $3 each. Brandless started selling products just one year ago, and is notable because it is taking on Amazon and Whole Foods, among others.But SoftBank and Brandless will be using Amazon\u2019s own playbook against it. Like Amazon, SoftBank is known for pushing executives to think bigger and bolder, trading profits for market dominance. Tina Sharkey, chief executive of Brandless, described an ambitious plan to \u201creimagine the entire stack of consumption,\u201d including \u201cwhat it means to be a brand.\u201dSoftBank knows a few things about e-commerce \u2014 its investment in Chinese internet giant Alibaba is regarded as one of the greatest deals in the history of venture investing.

{"Headline": "$100 Million Was Once Big Money for a Start-Up. Now, It\u2019s Common.", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "Known as a mega-round in Silicon Valley, large-scale fund raising is producing a frenzy around tech companies with enough reach and momentum to absorb a large check.Supported byIn late April, when Mike Massaro set out to get $40 million to $75 million in funding for his payments start-up, Flywire, he contacted a small group of investors he already knew. But word quickly got around, and other investors flooded his inbox with $200 million of investment offers, half of which he turned down.Gusto, a payroll and benefits software company, raised $140 million in July, but could have done five times that, according to Joshua Reeves, its chief executive and founder.Convene, a real estate services start-up, recently obtained $152 million and turned away more than $100 million of additional investment. Soon after, another wave of hopeful investors called, asking if the company would be looking for more financing, according to Ryan Simonetti, Convene\u2019s chief executive.Start-ups raising $100 million or more from investors \u2014 known as a mega-round in Silicon Valley \u2014 used to be a rarity. But now, they are practically routine, producing a frenzy around tech companies with enough scale and momentum to absorb a large check.The jump in oversize investments is led by relatively new investors, including the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, Chinese companies and sovereign wealth funds. They see a chance to capitalize on tech\u2019s incursion into just about every industry, and want to put their money down before the young companies go public.By entering the tech market, they have all but eliminated talk in Silicon Valley about an investment bubble \u2014 a leading concern a couple of years ago \u2014 because the money now seems almost limitless.For the start-ups, the pots of money are changing the normal way of building a tech company. They must move even faster, expand their ambitions and collect more investment money than ever \u2014 even if they might not be ready. They risk becoming too reliant on funding and never finding a path to profit.\u201cIf your competitor is going to raise $150 million and you want to be conservative and only raise $20 million, you\u2019re going to get run over,\u201d said Bill Gurley, a managing partner at Benchmark Capital.Investors participated in a record 273 mega-rounds last year, according to the data provider Crunchbase. This year is on pace to easily eclipse that, with 268 completed in the first seven months of the year. In July, start-ups reached more than 50 financing deals worth a combined $15 billion, a new monthly high.In the last 10 days, Letgo, an online classifieds ads company, raised $500 million. Actifio, a data storage company, took in $100 million. MyDreamPlus, a co-working space start-up, secured $120 million. And Klook, a travel activity booking site, got $200 million.These mega-rounds have become so common that CB Insights, which tracks start-up investments, has even debated lifting its definition of a mega-round to $200 million or more, according to Anand Sanwal, the firm\u2019s chief executive.Many of the new investors, including SoftBank\u2019s $93 billion Vision Fund, manage funds so large they dwarf the entire traditional venture capital market in the United States. These giant funds are looking for start-ups that can take large sums of money with one shot. Writing lots of small checks is too time-consuming, and the returns from small bets will not make a difference for a such a big fund. So investors are competing to back any start-up that shows promise and the ability to put $100 million or more to use.\u201cAs soon as they feel like they have a winner, they will really put a lot of resources behind it,\u201d said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.SoftBank\u2019s deal-making has affected every part of the venture capital market. The arrival of its Vision Fund, which has a minimum investment size of $100 million, has prompted a number of traditional venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, to build larger pools of money to compete. Funds from seven different firms are raising capital, according to the data provider Pitchbook.But the Vision Fund is not even the most active mega-round investor. In the first seven months of 2018, Tencent Holdings participated in 31 rounds of funding of $100 million or more, compared with 18 for SoftBank, according to CB Insights. GIC and Temasek Holdings, investment funds associated with the government of Singapore, as well as Alibaba and Sequoia Capital China, have also been among the most active mega-round investors this year.As a result, early investors must make sure their portfolio companies are friendly with the large funds, laying groundwork for a potential investment in the future.\u201cIt feels like there is a bit of a beauty pageant that early-stage investors put on for the mega-funds,\u201d said Patricia Nakache, a general partner at Trinity Ventures.The hot funding market is pushing high-growth start-ups to change their plans. Flywire was not going to pursue more investment money until next year. It still had $15 million in the bank from a previous funding round. But the company saw \u201cinvestment heat\u201d in the payments industry and Mr. Massaro thought more money would help Flywire grow even faster.Funding rounds can take as long as six months to put together, but Flywire\u2019s round wrapped up in just over two. As a result of the capital, the company will complete some of its hiring plans in half the time it previously planned and expand into a new geographic market two years early.Moving aggressively is not a choice. Well-funded start-ups, called \u201csuper-haves\u201d by some investors, can afford to pay their employees more and lower their prices, losing money in the short term to win more customers.Convene, the real estate start-up, competes tangentially with WeWork, an office rental company that has raised more than $8 billion in funding from SoftBank and other investors. Convene was not planning to chase more capital until later this year, but the company\u2019s investors encouraged it to move sooner. Business deals move faster today than they did five years ago, said Mr. Simonetti, the company\u2019s chief executive, and having extra capital on hand helps with speed.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a little bit of this, \u2018Let\u2019s overcapitalize the company a little bit so we can move quicker and faster,\u2019 \u201d he said.The large investors also demand big ideas from the start-ups. Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund team pushed Tina Sharkey, chief executive of e-commerce start-up Brandless, to share the most grandiose, ambitious version of her business road map.\u201cThey were like, \u2018Come on, show us your real plan,\u2019 \u201d she said. Brandless had barely been operating for a year before Ms. Sharkey outlined an expansive vision to use machine learning, data, curation, and community-building to create efficiencies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the gumption to say that to anyone else,\u201d she said. In July, SoftBank invested $224 million into her company.\u201cIn today\u2019s hyper-connected world, companies need to hire, scale and enter new markets faster than ever before or risk being surpassed by others,\u201d said Jeff Housenbold, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers.Few venture investors foresee a slowdown in the pace of mega-rounds. Those who once cautioned of a tech bubble and subsequent crash have given up on their warnings. In 2015, Mr. Gurley of Benchmark predicted \u201cdead unicorns,\u201d referring to start-ups valued at $1 billion or more. But since 2015, the number of start-ups worth $1 billion or more has ballooned to 258 from 80, according to CB Insights. Excess funding is tied to inflated valuations, which may create problems when overvalued companies eventually try to go public.Mr. Gurley said he was done trying to sound the alarm. \u201cYou have to adjust to the reality and play the game on the field,\u201d he said.Annie Lamont, a managing partner at the venture fund Oak HC/FT, expected a drop-off in start-up valuations and funding three years ago, but it never happened. Now, she expects more of the same, partly because most the companies can easily get more money and few are worried about a downturn.\u201cThe fear of a correction is not occurring,\u201d she said. If any start-ups do \u201cvaporize,\u201d she said, \u201cI think people are going to ignore them and roll right on to the next one.\u201dMitchell Green, a managing partner at Lead Edge Capital, does not imagine a slowdown unless interest rates increase significantly, a change that could prompt investors to move money into tax-free bonds. \u201cIt ain\u2019t going to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much money.\u201dMr. Reeves, of software start-up Gusto, acknowledged that founders who obtain outsize sums of capital can get caught up in a \u201cgrowth at any cost\u201d mentality. That is why he chose not to maximize his funding round despite the intense interest. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the founder to realize that\u2019s a distraction,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess is not having more money or a bigger team, but having more customers or revenue.\u201dMr. Reeves is staying cautious, even when few others seem worried about a bubble. \u201cThe most likely time to have some type of correction, or change, or realization of the cycle turning, is when you\u2019re not talking about it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies.

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Customers Died. Will That Be a Wake-Up Call for China\u2019s Tech Scene?", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHuang Jieli, who ran a Chinese ride-sharing business called Hitch, was invited to a wedding in March. One of her drivers was getting married to a woman who had once been his passenger. Thanks, the invitation said, for getting them hitched.Didi Chuxing, Hitch\u2019s corporate parent and one of the world\u2019s most successful and valuable start-ups, once cheered these stories of young love. Like so many other Chinese internet companies, Didi explored all kinds of ways to bring in new users, including social networking.So through suggestive ads hinting at hookups through driving, Didi pushed Hitch\u2019s romantic possibilities. In a 2015 interview with the Chinese online portal NetEase, Ms. Huang compared Hitch cars to cafes and bars.\u201cIt\u2019s a very futuristic and very sexy scenario,\u201d she told NetEase.It\u2019s a rare moment of self-reflection in China\u2019s internet industry, which has grown to rival Silicon Valley in both size and influence. Two Chinese companies, Tencent and Alibaba, rank among the top 10 publicly listed companies in the world in valuation. Four of the 10 most valuable start-ups are from China, according to CBInsights. One of them is Didi, which ranks second only to Uber.But the potential for abuse in China is severe. Corporations are subject to little scrutiny from state-controlled media until problems spin out of control. Spotty enforcement and slow lawmaking leave the public less protected from exploitation. Chinese people are fixated on their phones, spending four more hours on average a week online than Americans. The industry\u2019s extreme growth \u2014 the number of internet users has doubled, to 800 million, in eight short years \u2014 has created a culture in which companies prize money over users\u2019 well-being.Didi itself admitted this week that it had lost its way. In a statement on Tuesday, it said it would stop using scale and growth to measure its success.\u201cIn the past few years we forged ahead wildly, riding on aggressive business strategies and the power of capital,\u201d the company said in the statement from Cheng Wei, its chief executive, and Jean Liu, its president. In the face of lost lives, the statement said, \u201cthe whole company started to question whether we have the right value system.\u201d\u201cTruly disgusting, despicable marketing for Didi Hitch that\u2019s all sexual innuendo and all about \u2018picking up\u2019 girls,\u201d said Rui Ma, a technology investor who works in both Silicon Valley and China, on Twitter. She added, \u201cDidi are you running a service for sexual predators or a ride hailing app?!\u201dWhile it wasn\u2019t obvious to female passengers that their drivers might want to hook up, the drivers knew. Until Didi deactivated Hitch, the car-pooling service allowed drivers to share comments with other drivers on the looks of their passengers, leading some male drivers to seek out the ones others had declared attractive.The problem goes well beyond Didi. China has grown so fast that many facets of life \u2014 shopping, online banking, transportation \u2014 lack the sort of established incumbents common in the West. Tech companies can swoop in and become dominant in those areas. That makes Chinese companies appealing to investors. It also makes them potentially dangerous.My conversations with Chinese tech companies and their investors, including some from the United States, revolve around user growth and the amount of time they can keep users glued to apps. On occasion I asked why they lent their technology to the government for surveillance, or what they thought the social impact might be from the videos, games and endless feeds of mind-numbing information they send to the public. They either gave me blank stares or said their technologies were merely neutral tools.\u201cNo matter how we complain or criticize, bad companies, be it Didi or Baidu, simply won\u2019t change,\u201d Ye Ying, editor of The Art Newspaper China, wrote on her WeChat timeline. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped using Baidu long time ago. Should I delete the Didi app as well?\u201dEven with women in top jobs, the industry can\u2019t seem to shake the attitude. Ms. Liu is probably China\u2019s most prominent female technology executive.Hitch\u2019s suggestive strategy was overseen by Ms. Huang. In one corporate video the company compared her to Hua Mulan, the female warrior of ancient China, and promoted her as a skilled executor of the company\u2019s vision. The video\u2019s English title is \u201cLean In, Jelly,\u201d using her English name.The question now is whether Didi, and executives in the rest of the industry, can root out those attitudes to protect users.\u201cWithout the interference of a value system, the vast majority of them will choose their job performances over users\u2019 safety,\u201d wrote Feng Dahui, a former Alibaba executive and industry critic, in a WeChat post. \u201cThis is the ethical dilemma of most internet elites.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a survey of 271 neighbors that he organized recently, he said, 90 percent disliked the name.The Detroit neighborhood now regularly called Fishkorn (pronounced FISH-korn), but previously known as Fiskhorn (pronounced FISK-horn)? That was because of Google Maps. Midtown South Central in Manhattan? That was also given life by Google Maps.Yet how Google arrives at its names in maps is often mysterious. The company declined to detail how some place names came about, though some appear to have resulted from mistakes by researchers, rebrandings by real estate agents \u2014 or just outright fiction.Before the internet era, neighborhood names developed via word of mouth, newspaper articles and physical maps that were released periodically. But Google Maps, which debuted in 2005, is updated continuously and delivered to more than one billion people on their devices. Google also feeds map data to thousands of websites and apps, magnifying its influence.In May, more than 63 percent of people who accessed a map on a smartphone or tablet used Google Maps, versus 19.4 percent for the Chinese internet giant Alibaba\u2019s maps and 5.5 percent for Apple Maps, according to comScore, which tracks web traffic.Google said it created its maps from third-party data, public sources, satellites and, often most important, users. People can submit changes, which are reviewed by Google employees. A Google spokeswoman declined further comment.The service has also disseminated place names that are just plain puzzling. In New York, Vinegar Hill Heights, Midtown South Central (now NoMad), BoCoCa (for the area between Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens), and Rambo (Right Around the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) have appeared on and off in Google Maps.A former Detroit city planner, Arthur Mullen, said he created the 2002 map as a side project and was surprised his typos were now distributed widely. He said he used old books and his local knowledge to make the map, approximating boundaries at times and inserting names with tenuous connections to neighborhoods, hoping to draw feedback.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be making a mistake and 20 years later people are having to live with it,\u201d Mr. Mullen said.\u201cIt rolls off the tongue,\u201d he said.In San Francisco, the East Cut name originated from a neighborhood nonprofit group that residents voted to create in 2015 to clean and secure the area. The nonprofit paid $68,000 to a \u201cbrand experience design company\u201d to rebrand the district.Andrew Robinson, executive director of the nonprofit, now called the East Cut Community Benefit District (and previously the Greater Rincon Hill Community Benefit District), said the group\u2019s board rejected names like Grand Narrows and Central Hub. Instead they chose the East Cut, partly because it referenced an 1869 construction project to cut through nearby Rincon Hill. The nonprofit then paid for streetlight banners and outfitted street cleaners with East Cut apparel.But it wasn\u2019t until Google Maps adopted the name this spring that it got attention \u2014 and mockery.\u201cThe East Cut sounds like a 17 dollar sandwich,\u201d Menotti Minutillo, an Uber engineer who works on the neighborhood\u2019s border, said on Twitter in May.Mr. Robinson said his team asked Google to add the East Cut to its maps. A Google spokeswoman said employees manually inserted the name after verifying it through public sources. The company\u2019s San Francisco offices are in the neighborhood (as is The New York Times bureau), and one of the East Cut nonprofit\u2019s board members is a Google employee.\u201cDon\u2019t believe us?\u201d its website asks. \u201cWell, we\u2019re on the internet; so we must be real.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeffrey Katzenberg Raises $1 Billion for Short-Form Video Venture", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffrey Katzenberg has a billion to play with for his new short-form video platform.His holding company, WndrCo, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $1 billion in its initial investment round, including funds from 10 American media companies and the Chinese technology giant Alibaba.Mr. Katzenberg, a onetime chairman of Walt Disney Studios and a founder of DreamWorks, hired Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and eBay, to run the show.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like this, but I keep saying we\u2019re two old dogs who have a new trick,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg, 67, said in a phone interview, as Ms. Whitman laughed in the background.Because of Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s track record, which also included a stint as the head of production at Paramount Pictures, any move he makes is regarded seriously.But Hollywood has remained skeptical in the year since he announced his venture. Several executives have argued that there is little evidence to support the notion that viewers are craving short programming. And beyond the initial hype, Mr. Katzenberg has been short on specifics.But now the project is coming into focus. Mr. Katzenberg announced on Tuesday that 10 major studios had signed on as backers: the Walt Disney Company, Entertainment One, 21st Century Fox, ITV, Lionsgate, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Viacom and Warner Media.Strategic partners include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Global. Ms. Whitman said the biggest investor was Madrone Capital Partners, which has connections to the Walton family of Walmart fame (the retail giant is not itself an investor).And perhaps most intriguing: Mr. Katzenberg has managed to land an investment from Alibaba, although China has remained off limits for many media companies, including Netflix.The $1 billion from investors allows NewTV to begin licensing original programs, particularly from the media companies that have come aboard. Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s company will not own the content it streams for on-the-go viewing.NewTV has also rented out a few floors at a co-working space in West Hollywood, Calif. There are seven people on staff, and Ms. Whitman said she expected that number to move past 200 by 2020. Neither Ms Whitman nor Mr. Katzenberg revealed a date for when NewTV will go live.Mr. Katzenberg insisted that his service, which will be available by subscription, is playing in a different arena. Rather than competing with Netflix or HBO, it will target viewers looking for quick-hit fare to help them pass the time when they are, for example, on the subway or waiting in line at Starbucks.Higher production values will distinguish NewTV\u2019s programming from the majority of video shorts that gain traction on YouTube, Mr. Katzenberg said. And he trusts that viewers will appreciate the difference.Writers, producers and directors have been able to please their audiences, he added, but not so much in the area of shorter content.\u201cWe keep coming up with new ways to exceed the expectation of our customers,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg said, referring to the rise of cable, DVDs and streaming. \u201cExcept now, for the first time in history, we have a whole generation of customers that have a new consumption habit, with this thing called short-form content. And the professional enterprise of storytellers in Hollywood is nowhere near it.\u201cCustomers are ahead of them for the first time,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to chase and catch up with them. They\u2019re doing something and we\u2019re not a part of it. That\u2019s a missed opportunity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Investors Betting Against Tesla Made $1 Billion on Friday", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe investors betting against Tesla just got a gift from the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.The day after the interview, the stock of the electric-car maker tumbled 9 percent to $306.Mr. Musk had long sparred with investors who make money when the company\u2019s stock falls. And he is bracing for the fight to get worse. Mr. Musk told The New York Times that he was expecting \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dTesla is among the most shorted stocks in the United States. More than a quarter of its stock valued at more than $11 billion is being shorted, according to S3 Partners.In March, a driver was killed after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot, Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, was in use.That same month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company was burning through cash.It has made for a bumpy ride for Tesla investors \u2014 on either side of the trade.Through it all, Mr. Musk\u2019s public attacks on shorts have only intensified.In May, he took to Twitter and warned of the \u201cshort burn of the century comin soon.\u201d A month later, he predicted that those wagering on the stock\u2019s decline \u201chad three weeks before their short position explodes.\u201d He even taunted David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund has performed poorly this year in part because of its short bet on Tesla.Mr. Musk has pointed to short-sellers as a reason he is considering taking Tesla private. In a message to employees explaining his thinking, he wrote: \u201cAs the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dHe isn\u2019t exactly right on his history of short-sellers. At various points in the past 10 years, the value of bets against Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson exceeded Tesla\u2019s high of roughly $13 billion, according to IHS Markit.The value of short bets against Alibaba currently stands at $25 billion.Even by the percentage of shares being shorted, it is not the highest. It's not even the biggest of 2018. So far this year, 26 companies have had a higher percentage of their stock shorted than Tesla did at its peak of 33 percent in May.But he does have a point about the persistence of short-sellers trying to profit on Tesla\u2019s troubles. The short position in Tesla\u2019s shares has remained above $10 billion for nearly five months. In the past decade, short-sellers have not held a position valued at more than $10 billion in any other American company for more than three months, according to IHS Markit.Betting against Tesla has been expensive. Since 2016, short-sellers collectively have lost $5 billion, as the company\u2019s shares rose 27 percent.Even this year, amid all of Tesla\u2019s woes, betting on a decline in the company\u2019s share price has not been a winner. Its short-sellers remain down $650 million this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Challenge Is America\u2019s Opportunity", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDr. Reif is president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.American tensions with China over international trade spring partly from concerns that China gives tax breaks to its companies to boost their exports, restricts access to its markets, forces foreign companies to transfer their technology to Chinese companies, steals intellectual property and pursues industrial espionage.Expert, decisive action is needed to stop these practices in defense of fair international competition and America\u2019s strategic and commercial interests. But it would be a mistake to think that an aggressive defense alone will somehow prevent China\u2019s technological success \u2014 or ensure America\u2019s own.China is not an innovation also-ran that prospers mainly by copying other people\u2019s ideas and producing them quickly at low cost. The country is advancing aggressively to assert technological supremacy in critical fields of science and technology.In short, stopping intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices \u2014 even if fully effective \u2014 would not allow the United States to relax back into a position of unquestioned innovation leadership. Unless America responds urgently and deliberately to the scale and intensity of this challenge, we should expect that, in fields from personal communications to business, health and security, China is likely to become the world\u2019s most advanced technological nation and the source of the most cutting-edge technological products in not much more than a decade.But China\u2019s technological dominance is not inevitable. The United States has tremendous assets, including the immense global strength of our technology sector. This partly depends on a unique formula no other country has been able to copy: the large number of first-rate American universities pursuing advanced research with long-term federal support. This relationship is rooted in a national culture of opportunity and entrepreneurship, inspired by an atmosphere of intellectual freedom, supported by the rule of law and, crucially, pushed to new creative heights by uniting brilliant talent from every sector of our society and every corner of the world. For decades, these factors have helped make our nation the most powerful scientific and technological engine on Earth.Every American can take pride in this distinctive system. But there is nothing automatic about its excellence.We also need to take a fresh look at industry-university-government partnerships as mechanisms for strategic co-investment in early-stage research. In the 1980s, such efforts, though far from perfect, helped the American semiconductor industry survive and thrive. Stressing what worked and discarding what didn\u2019t, we need to collaborate actively across those three sectors in the same spirit now to make our entire innovation system faster and more effective, so ideas generated in the United States get to market in the United States first.At the same time, government, industry, schools and universities should boldly develop our homegrown talent, of every age and in communities across the country. An enduring benefit of the G.I. Bill and America\u2019s response to Sputnik was that Americans became, for some decades, the best educated people on Earth, and we can do it again.Finally, we should make sure we have an immigration system that welcomes the best talent from anywhere in the world, so that people hungry for opportunity continue to see America as the best place for their education and the best place to spend their lives and careers, enabling the United States to reap the benefit of their creativity and drive.Cultivating these assets will also provide a position of strength as the United States negotiates to stop unfair business and market practices.As a nation, the United States needs to change its focus from merely reacting to China\u2019s actions to building a farsighted national strategy for sustaining American leadership in science and innovation. If all we do in response to China\u2019s ambition is to try to double-lock all our doors, I believe we will lock ourselves into mediocrity. But if we in the United States respect China as a rising competitor with many strengths we can learn from, that view will inspire America to be its incomparable best.Advertisement"}
