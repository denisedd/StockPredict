It looked more like the state of Texas, Mr. Iacono observed.\u201cIs that good?\u201d Mr. Winkler said. Mr. Iacono paused. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. He paused again. \u201cAs long as you have fun doing it.\u201dMr. Winkler, 72, was having fun. A lot of it. So much that one of his pies burned while he was basking in the moment. That was fun, too. \u201cJust for the record, I like burnt crust,\u201d he said.He also likes his late-career resurgence. Mr. Winkler always knew he wanted to be an actor. \u201cI lived it, I ate it, I dreamt it,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to sleep some nights \u2014 just imagining it.\u201d\u201cIt took me this long to be close to the actor I knew I wanted to be,\u201d Mr. Winkler said.He returned with a mammoth black-and-white cookie (\u201cMy favorite cookie in all of America,\u201d he said) and a loaf of lard bread that he tore into with his teeth. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said, mumbling through crumbs.He\u2019s a lifelong fan of Di Fara, Lucali\u2019s affectionate rival. But Lucali is the favorite spot of his son, Max Winkler, a director. So when Mr. Winkler found himself in New York for a few days (he was raised on the Upper West Side, but he and Ms. Winkler live in Los Angeles) he\u2019d blocked out time to try it. As Mr. Iacono set out canisters of dough and hacked into a hemisphere of Parmesan, Mr. Winkler removed his tan jacket and tied on a milk white apron over his tattersall shirt, his ruff of silver hair tickling the collar. Class was in session.He watched as Mr. Iacono rolled out a blob of dough, then covered it with a perfect nautilus of sauce, shaving strips of low-moisture mozzarella over the top and dotting it with hunks of hand-torn bufala.Then it was Mr. Winkler\u2019s turn. \u201cWork from the center out,\u201d Mr. Iacono said. \u201cJust keep going, going, going.\u201d Mr. Winkler kept at it, while Mr. Iacono gathered some logs to stoke the oven. \u201cAre you sweating?\u201d Mr. Iacono asked.\u201cMe?\u201d Mr. Winkler said. \u201cNo. I\u2019m enjoying.\u201d That Fonzie cool is lasting. \u201cWait till I open the oven,\u201d Mr. Iacono said.He showed Mr. Winkler how to stretch his dough further, resting it on Mr. Winkler\u2019s upstretched thumbs. \u201cYou\u2019ve got those famous thumbs,\u201d Mr. Iacono said. Ayyy! With the dough properly rolled, Mr. Winkler ladled on some sauce. He piled cheese on top, and then some more. He grated a small mound for himself, too. \u201cI\u2019m just going to test this,\u201d he said. Then he tested it again. Mr. Iacono helped him put his pizza in the oven, jiggling it off a wooden paddle. \u201cNice and easy,\u201d he said.When the pie emerged about three minutes later, still bubbling, Mr. Iacono snipped fresh basil onto it, then sprinkled on Parmesan. Ms. Winkler took a slice and fed her husband a few bites as he worked on the next one. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he said. Ms. Winkler, who knows him well, asked if he\u2019d added extra cheese.\u201cI really did,\u201d he said.On \u201cBarry,\u201d Mr. Winkler\u2019s character is a wonky amalgam of nearly every drama teacher Mr. Winkler has ever had, the imperious Stella Adler included, along with a few others he just heard about. What does Mr. Winkler think makes a good teacher? \u201cThe will to watch growth.\u201dUnder Mr. Iacono\u2019s tutelage, Mr. Winkler\u2019s pizzas grew progressively rounder (and progressively cheesier). He patiently imparted some of his newfound wisdom to his wife as she struggled with a ball of dough. \u201cPut your palm here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Now push out.\u201d The will to watch growth. After a lunch of pizza and Mr. Iacono\u2019s meatballs, Mr. Winkler slipped into the back garden for a decaf espresso. Mr. Iacono brought out a pile of grapes, so purple they were nearly black, and a small plate of watermelon that Mr. Winkler ate as juice soaked his chin. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gaza and Google Translate: Covering the Conflict When You Don\u2019t Speak the Language", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David M. Halbfinger, bureau chief for The Times in Jerusalem, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.My electronic gear is fairly simple. I carry two iPhones, each with an Apple case that doubles the phone\u2019s battery life (I\u2019m not that happy with these because they disintegrate after about a year, but I haven\u2019t shopped around); a MacBook Pro; battery backups; Bluetooth headsets, keyboard and mouse; and a small bag jammed full of cables, plugs and cigarette-lighter adapters.I sometimes also carry an Iridium satellite phone, and I always travel with a power strip in case there aren\u2019t enough outlets where I am. I try to keep my backpack light in Gaza. Other items \u2014 armor-plated flak jacket, Kevlar helmet, gas mask and spare filters, and a trauma kit \u2014 add lots of weight to my load.Probably the most vital tech tool I carry is the lightest: a paper clip to switch SIM cards. I\u2019ve been here less than a year and finally got a local number from the Palestinian provider Jawwal, which has good coverage across Gaza and can be quickly replenished at countless retail shops. For months I was managing with Israeli cell service near the border and a New York number that had decent coverage in Gaza City over the Wataniya network. But now I juggle the Gaza and New York phones depending on which has the stronger signal.What tech tools do you use to navigate the language barrier in Hebrew and Arabic?My wife and I feel like captives of Google Translate in making sense of Hebrew-language messages on local WhatsApp groups, bank statements, utility bills and so on, but it is adequate, and it continues to improve \u2014 in particular through its camera interface. As iPhone, not Android, users, we look forward to the day when WhatsApp will let us translate within the app, rather than copying and pasting into the Translate app.In part because of the confusion of the language barrier, but also because of the complexity of the beat, I record more phone calls in this job than I have in other assignments. TapeACall Pro makes that as simple as making a three-way call, and produces a recording seconds after I hang up. I also use TurboScan to send documents from my phone, and CamCard to scan the business cards of new contacts.What about just plain navigating?To get around in Gaza, I work with an experienced driver, but in Israel and the West Bank I drive myself using a combination of Waze and Google Maps.Waze is excellent in Israel, where it was invented. Almost everyone uses it, vastly enhancing the quality of real-time traffic information. But it is pretty much useless in Palestinian territory: If you plug in a location in Ramallah, it will warn you that your destination \u201cis in a high risk area or is prohibited to Israelis by law,\u201d and then take you to the point on the map where you cross into Palestinian-controlled territory, but no farther. Google Maps at least will navigate you all the way to your destination, but its routes often don\u2019t account for one-way streets going the wrong way.A bigger problem in getting around in Gaza and the West Bank is the dearth of Western-style street addresses. Many streets have no names, let alone house numbers. The most reliable way to get somewhere is to have someone at that location share the map coordinates and then get there with Google Maps, allowing extra time for wrong turns. Maps.me, a crowdsourced app that allows you to download maps and use them without cell service, also looks promising.Waze is great at flagging radar traps, speed cameras and traffic jams, and my kids took over the voice prompts, so I hear them giving me turn-by-turn directions. What none of these apps has yet mastered, though, is the ability to pinpoint the location of the creeping student drivers who seem to clog traffic on every block of my neighborhood in Jerusalem. There needs to be an app for that.What steps do you take to secure your communications given the often sensitive nature of your reporting?How do Israelis use tech differently than people in the United States?Americans don\u2019t have to worry about rockets being fired from Canada or Mexico. But Israelis who live near Gaza or in the Golan Heights need to know the instant that the military detects incoming rockets; as a rule, civilians have about 15 seconds to get to a bomb shelter. Several apps, including one in English \u2014 called, simply, Red Alert \u2014 instantly convey alerts about incoming fire to users based on their locations. I get alerted to all of them.More innocuously, I\u2019ve used parking meter apps in the United States, but none of them was as easy to use as Pango \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something, since it only works in Hebrew and I have to translate the alerts it sends me. It bills me once a month, it doesn\u2019t charge me when it shouldn\u2019t, and it usually knows when I have driven away from my parking spot but forgotten to turn off the meter.What tech do you use a lot in your personal life or that your family uses a lot at home that you don\u2019t at work?Israel doesn\u2019t have Yelp, sadly, but it does have TripAdvisor, which is a decent substitute for restaurants and hotels. My family uses Moovit to get around town by city bus.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Never Cook at Home", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrust me, I know it\u2019s a drag. Ms. Perelman runs the cooking blog Smitten Kitchen.First of all, those tomatoes are often staggeringly expensive, as they should be. Farming is brutally hard work. And the results are highly unpredictable, I\u2019ve found in my few failed stints as a Gentlewoman Balcony Farmer. In a city where rents have never been higher, groceries also cost huge chunks of money. As long you can buy five dumplings in Chinatown for $1.25 \u2014 forever, I hope \u2014 it\u2019s never going to be purely economical to cook at home.And what kind of monster wants to turn on an oven in August, anyway? That wheezing window air-conditioner can only do so much. Did your landlord find your grill on the fire escape and confiscate it, your only way to cook without melting in your apartment?Do you know what doesn\u2019t overheat an apartment in August? A Popsicle for dinner.It\u2019s also hard to cook dinner if work never ends. The extinction of a 9-to-5 workday has largely decimated whatever cushion of time one might use to prepare a meal. And when we get home, we\u2019re more exhausted than ever. Netflix, not a sink full of dishes, beckons.Restaurant delivery is a glorious thing. Everything goes in the trash chute and you have zero dishes to wash. (Unless you\u2019re the kind of civilized person who transfers takeout to plates, in which case, warmly, I believe you\u2019ve brought these problems on yourself.)Even good recipes lie. The yields are often bananas. The cooking times are always dubious, too. A \u201c20-minute recipe\u201d seems to take me, on average, about 75 minutes. But everyone knows that cooking is really the least of the hurdles. Creating a meal alone \u2014 schlepping groceries, doing all the prep, all the dishes, and being stuck with days of leftovers \u2014 can feel like an education in why you should definitely not do that again anytime soon.Obstacles to cooking can come from inside the house, too. Any of the spouses, partners or roommates we have invited into our lives can come home any day and tell us that he or she has adopted a new diet and can no longer eat whatever you just unpacked from the grocery store or love the most.Let\u2019s say you and this spouse or partner have worked out your mixed-dietary relationship and decide to build a mixed-dietary family? Adding more humans to your life means you will have to prepare food with more urgency, thus eliminating the joy it brings you. Maybe you have one of those types of kids who willingly eats kale. Enjoy your good luck, but keep this to yourself. You\u2019ve beaten the odds and it\u2019s impolite to brag. Most parents are mired in a daily battle against young people with untenable demands for a steady diet of macaroni and cheese and halved grapes.We\u2019re in a time when there is such fandom, such fervor over cooking. But those high-speed hands-and-pans videos only remind me of what a slow, inefficient cook I am. Instagram pictures of flawlessly styled plates of food make even my most successful attempts at home look flat. Professional chefs show off elaborate recipes in cookbooks. Sometimes the most sensible act of rebellion tastes like a bowl of popcorn.I am supposed to say: You should cook anyway. Because it\u2019s the right thing to do, we\u2019ve been told ad infinitum. But I don\u2019t want to. There are enough people lining up, eager to lecture or cast a side-eye at your bowl of popcorn. Here\u2019s why I cook:I like the way that closely following a recipe can alleviate pressure after a long day of having to make all the decisions.I love how a dish that worked, or a meal that everyone liked, has the power to change my day.I like that pulling off a good meal when you least expect it is the fastest way to feel victorious, even when real life does not. I like the way that, even when I\u2019m standing over the stove, cursing the recipe writer who suggested that onions might caramelize in 10 minutes, I\u2019m totally absorbed. I\u2019m not on group texts. I\u2019m not following the outrage of the moment on Twitter. I\u2019m getting a brief, needed respite and refuel from fretting over our democracy or forcibly separated families or any of the other horrible things humans do to one another. This thing \u2014 focus, concentration, a goal and the reward of something delicious I get to devour \u2014 is so rare in my day-to-day life, I\u2019ll take it when I can. And if someone wants to do the dishes or schlep the groceries, or can give me their word that the recipe contains no surprises, I might do it again tomorrow.Advertisement"}

But What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cO.K., I need to stop this craziness,\u201d Mr. Lin recalled thinking.A new cap on the service goes into effect on Wednesday. It will change the number of movies allowed to three per month from one per day, at a flat rate of $9.95 per month. The limit may put a dent in the habits of many pass subscribers \u2014 and, almost certainly, the population of highly devoted users who have structured their social lives around MoviePass.Elaborate social networks have popped up around the pass online (over 70 Facebook groups exist, with membership ranging from two to more than 9,000 members), and many consist of tight-knit meetup groups or family members \u2014 like Cristina Crowley of Alexandria, Va., a teacher who bought her 13-year-old a pass. The two scheduled weekly gatherings and recently saw \u201cEighth Grade\u201d together.Afterward, the group \u2014 a mix of entrepreneurs, bloggers and real estate investors, some new, some regulars \u2014 trickled over to the Bleecker Street Bar, where, speaking loudly over Jay-Z\u2019s music, they answered questions prepared by the founder of Mewvee Club, Kean Gardner, 31, of Brooklyn. Questions included: \u201cWhat would your artist name be?\u201d \u201cWhat is your quick take on the movie?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s a fact that intrigued you about the documentary?\u201dThe group has had 25 meetings like this, usually with five to 15 members participating in person, since January.Noemy Jorge, 31, who is dating Mr. Gardner, said they also hold movie screenings on a projector in their apartment, which she said they will probably start doing more now that MoviePass has set limits. \u201cOur entire dating life has revolved around going to the movies,\u201d Ms. Jorge said. \u201cBefore MoviePass, we would go early in the morning to get matinee passes.\u201dOne MoviePass user in California, Cea Marcel Lee, 52, a substitute teacher from Irvine, created a network of 70 people who use the pass to attend movies a few times per month. The largest attendance they had for a gathering was 25, for \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d Ms. Lee said.After the movie, people in that network usually go out together for dessert and a discussion.Jose Roldan, 46, of Zephyrhills, Fla., said he had only seen about one or two movies in a theater per year before MoviePass. Now, Mr. Roldan, a facility-services coordinator, sometimes drives 45 miles round-trip to see films twice a week. He started the largest group on Facebook, MoviePass Chatter, in September 2017, while trying to troubleshoot issues with his pass.Most of his dedication to the service occurs online \u2014 he spends about three hours a day moderating the chatter and trying to \u201cstimulate the conversation.\u201d There, people discuss the service\u2019s problems and post takeaways from new films. If the conversation gets too heated, Mr. Roldan said, he steps in to \u201ckeep it from getting out of hand.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want any politics or religion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about MoviePass and your love for movies.\u201dSome MoviePass users say they will stay loyal until the end, while many have started to reconsider their habits, or think about adding or switching subscription services.Even with the new three-movie-per-month rule, Damon Packard, a Los Angeles-based filmmaker who used MoviePass every day at one point, said he is keeping it because he thinks the other services \u2014 like AMC Stubs A-List and Sinemia \u2014 are too pricey.\u201cI\u2019ll stick with them because they\u2019re constantly changing things and they\u2019re trying to dig themselves out of this hole that they\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Packard said.He hopes that they will reinstate the one-movie-per-day plan.Mr. Roldan said he wants to stay with MoviePass, too, because the AMC theater is even farther out of his way.Ken Lin, a movie buff, tracked his moviegoing.Mr. Lin, who also has Sinemia, is part of the administrating team of MoviePass Fanatics on Facebook, where users sometimes compare spreadsheets of how many movies they have seen and share service updates. (Mr. Lin, for example, has tracked via spreadsheet the money he would have spent without using MoviePass: $2,012.97.)

{"Headline": "Disney Reports Earnings, but Focus Is on Its Streaming Service", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney\u2019s coming Netflix-style streaming service most definitely has Wall Street\u2019s attention.The still-unnamed service, which Disney plans to introduce late next year, represents a make-or-break plan to address threats to its vast television business. The TV division reported operating income in the third quarter of $1.82 billion, a 1 percent decline from a year earlier. Ad sales are under pressure, programming costs are rising and the number of traditional cable subscribers for Disney channels \u2014 ESPN among them \u2014 is declining.Analysts had a lot of questions: How much is Disney planning to invest in original content for the service? Won\u2019t people be confused about what Disney-branded content is where? What is the broader strategy?Mr. Iger gave few specific answers, promising that more details would come at a future investor conference. He assured analysts that the successful introduction of the streaming service would be Disney\u2019s \u201cbiggest priority\u201d in 2019, which will also bring the integration of 21st Century Fox assets.Mr. Iger indicated that he would seek subscription sales for the service from every corner of the Disney empire: theme park pass holders, holders of Disney-branded credit cards, the masses who own Disney time-share properties. He also confirmed that content from National Geographic, which Disney is buying from Fox, would appear on the service. He mentioned that Disney also sees promise for National Geographic in Disney\u2019s vacation business as an \u201ceco-tourism\u201d offshoot.But do not expect a high volume of new original series and movies on the Disney-branded service, at least initially. Mr. Iger said that he did not see Disney\u2019s service as needing \u201canything close to the volume that Netflix has,\u201d largely because Disney has strong brands like Pixar, Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d at its disposal.For the quarter, Disney\u2019s major businesses largely performed as they had over the last year. Weakness continued at the cable division and in the consumer products unit, where the decline in shopping malls has hurt the Disney Store chain. But theme parks remained a reliable engine and Walt Disney Studios continued to deliver growth.Walt Disney Studios had operating income of $708 million, an 11 percent increase from the same quarter a year earlier. \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and \u201cIncredibles 2,\u201d both runaway hits, were largely the reason. The studio would have had even better results had it not taken a $100 million write-down related to animated films in its pipeline that will no longer proceed, including a third \u201cPlanes\u201d movie.Operating income at Disney\u2019s theme park division increased 15 percent, to $1.3 billion, because of higher ticket prices and hotel room rates at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.Over all, Disney had a profit totaling $2.92 billion, or $1.95 a share, compared with $2.37 billion, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier. Disney had revenue of $15.24 billion in the quarter, a 7 percent increase.Advertisement"}

Sutton Foster sang a song from \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d earlier this season in a moment that was charming but contrived, like the show itself. This week, it\u2019s Miriam Shor\u2019s turn, and she duets with the guest star Martha Plimpton. Next week is the season finale, so savor this episode like the last day of summer vacation. Maybe Hilary Duff will get her big musical number in Season 6.Every episode of the family drama \u201cQueen Sugar\u201d has a big catharsis, and this is a 90-minute season finale, so prepare for rage and weeping. This season has been an interesting step forward for the show, as the cloud of grief around the Bordelon siblings has lifted. That\u2019s meant more of their problems have been about confronting their futures \u2014 especially for Charley, who has uprooted her life and taken on a new career \u2014 than just revisiting their previous conflicts. It\u2019s made for more interesting but sometimes less revealing storylines.This documentary tells the story of Kristen Ries and Maggie Snyder, a doctor and a physician assistant who treated HIV and AIDS patients in Salt Lake City, Utah, starting in the early 1980s. Their enduring compassion and determination make the film more hopeful than tragic, even as it captures the catastrophic losses and devastating bigotry that defined the early years of the epidemic.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How to Fight Them.", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech fixVideos that start without your consent are prominent across the web. Our tech columnist explains how the industry got here and what we can do.The web is in a dark place, as I plan to examine in the next several columns. If you need proof, look no further than autoplay videos, the first example.You\u2019re probably familiar with this horrendous experience: You are perusing a website, and suddenly an annoying voice or unfamiliar music blasts through your speakers. You wonder, where is this coming from? You scroll up and down the webpage only to realize that a video is playing without your consent. And the noise polluting your ears is coming from an ad preceding a video you had never clicked to watch.Autoplay videos are all over the web and inside apps. They are prominent in your Facebook and Instagram feeds. Some major news sites embed them into features and news articles. Nobody seems to likes autoplay videos \u2014 not even people I\u2019ve talked to in the ad industry. The indiscreet videos demand your attention while burning through your mobile data plan and sucking up your batteries. Yet they have become a necessary evil for many media publishers trying to survive in the digital age.\u201cI think we\u2019ve ended up in a really crappy user experience right now with video advertising,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted television ads. \u201cVideo has been pushed into every user experience whether or not it fits, because it\u2019s a way to make more money.\u201d\u201cSight, sound and motion can make people laugh, make people cry, make them hug somebody,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cIt can make them love a brand. It can make them whistle a brand\u2019s theme song when they\u2019re walking a dog.\u201dYet publishers faced technical hurdles, like slow internet connections, that made video ads untenable. Instead, publishers served ads that were static images, which eventually evolved to become graphics with some animations and sound. Over the last decade, fast wired and wireless connections spread, as did computers and smartphones. Consumers also became acclimated to streaming video services like Netflix and YouTube. Serving an online video became easy. So advertising firms like BrightRoll and Tremor Video, along with tech companies like Facebook, began testing video ads.As annoying as they may be, autoplay videos are here to stay \u2014 largely because the ads generate so much money. But they are thankfully becoming less obnoxious.\u201cAutoplay with sound on is just going to go extinct,\u201d Mr. Wiegert said. \u201cIt\u2019s been deemed as a poor quality experience for users. Even I\u2019ve gotten annoyed when I\u2019ve been on a webpage and all of a sudden I hear sound coming through my speakers.\u201dYet Mr. Morgan of Simulmedia believes video ads will be forced to change more radically to give people fuller control over what they see. That\u2019s because autoplay videos still satisfy publishers, not the consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re putting those ads in those places because we can \u2014 not because it is the best for the user,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

A spinoff series starring the character is also being developed.The character of Batwoman was introduced to DC Comics in 1956 as part of a parade of additions to Batman\u2019s supporting cast, including Ace the Bat-Hound (1955), Bat-Mite (1959) and Bat-Girl (1961). Part of the original impetus for the creation of Batwoman and Bat-Girl was to give Batman and Robin love interests.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "War of the Past, War of the Future: Netflix Tries Both", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingTwo new Netflix Originals are war movies, but very different ones, marked by their temporal settings. \u201cExtinction\u201d depicts a war in the future, while \u201cThe Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u201d uses a little-known aspect of World War II as its hook.Directed by Ben Young, from a script by Spenser Cohen and Brad Kane, \u201cExtinction\u201d stars Michael Pe\u00f1a as Peter, an average family man haunted by vivid nightmares of his wife, Alice (Lizzy Caplan), and their two daughters fatally wounded among urban carnage.His visions cause him trouble at work, he even misses a family night he\u2019s gone to special pains to plan, even clearing everyone else\u2019s schedules for it. This exacerbates the resentment his teenage daughter, Hannah (Amelia Crouch), holds for him. Seeking help, he finds himself at the creepy \u201cWhole Life Wellness Center.\u201d But before any cure can be prescribed, Peter\u2019s dreams begin coming true in the form of what seems to be an alien invasion. However, his family\u2019s panic \u2014 and that of those people around him \u2014 doesn\u2019t exactly match up with his visions.There\u2019s a reason for that, one which I won\u2019t reveal. Before the film gives up the goods \u2014 which are reasonably, if not earth-shatteringly, clever \u2014 it shifts into action-and-scare mode as Peter and Alice attempt to get the family out of their high-rise apartment and to safety.There are a lot of dark corridors, and the characters do quite a bit of ducking and crouching. Mr. Young handles it reasonably well, but I was struck by an unavoidable truth: These scenes of suspense and scare excel on a large screen, in a reasonably crowded theater. Watching this section of \u201cExtinction\u201d I flashed way back to 1986, sitting in a Times Square movie house watching \u201cDemons 2,\u201d a horror picture in which the main characters had to escape an apartment building besieged by zombies. One character was trying to crawl through an air vent and someone in the crowd shouted \u201cIt\u2019s right behind you!\u201d The whole thing was simultaneously pulse-racing and hilarious. Sitting by myself in front of a 50-inch LCD display, my general feeling was, \u201cOh well, hope they make it out, I guess.\u201d (Ms. Caplan provides the movie\u2019s most clever performance with respect to communicating her character\u2019s state.) I\u2019m willing to allow that this holds true for just me, but I still recommend that for maximum impact, you watch \u201cExtinction\u201d with a group of friends.It opens in 1941 on the English Channel island of Guernsey, one of the few British territories occupied by the German army during World War II. A group of natives violating curfew are stopped by a couple of soldiers, and on the spot, the crew creates the title organization as an excuse for being out late. The movie then moves to postwar Britain, where the young author Juliet Ashton (Lily James) is pondering her next work after a successful career writing pseudonymous comedic books during the war.Juliet\u2019s sense of humor is something of a front: During the blitz, she lost a home and her parents. The British soldier who rescued her, Sidney Stark (Matthew Goode) is now her publisher. Juliet also has a handsome Yank boyfriend (Glen Powell, recently seen in the Netflix hit \u201cSet It Up\u201d) and a considerable amount of money in the bank.But something\u2019s missing in her life. Contemplating some letters she received during the war from a Guernsey man named Dawsey Adams (Michiel Huisman) who read one of her books, she impulsively takes a boat to the island. The Yank boyfriend proposes to her on the dock with a baseball-size ring that Juliet promptly ties up in a handkerchief and puts in her purse.As soon as Juliet and Dawsey exchange glances, we know the fianc\u00e9 is toast. Which doesn\u2019t make the story any less effective in its telling, as it turns out. Juliet learns the occupation of Guernsey was not entirely sat out in the form of whimsical literary societies. (Once the group was formed, it began holding meetings and reading in earnest.) A missing founder of the club, a young child and a couple of reluctant and hostile island residents are components of a mystery that the young writer becomes determined to solve. In doing so, she uncovers genuine tragedy \u2014 recounted in the voices and flashbacks of the residents whose trust she wins \u2014 and finds a community with whom she shares an affinity of loss.Mr. Newell directs with sensitivity and the occasional invention; the movie has an almost tactile appreciation of period detail, as when Juliet sets to writing, the camera lingers on her onionskin typing paper. The cast is impeccable. Ms. James is both charming and convincing; her \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d colleague, Penelope Wilton, is moving as Amelia, whose desire to protect the secrets of her loved ones makes her turn an initial cold shoulder to Juliet. Tom Courtenay, as a village elder, is very much Tom Courtenay, which is always a great thing.Whatever. I have no doubt it\u2019ll be an interesting picture, as Mr. Chazelle is an interesting and energetic filmmaker (although his work isn\u2019t always entirely compatible with my taste). FilmStruck\u2019s Criterion Channel is now showing a chat with Mr. Chazelle, conducted at the University of Wisconsin, as part of its \u201cMasterclass\u201d series of film supplements. The movie he lauds therein is \u201cChronicle of a Summer,\u201d the 1961 French documentary directed by Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin. The choice speaks well of Mr. Chazelle\u2019s taste, and he\u2019s a perceptive viewer.\u201cChronicle\u201d is a single example, Mr. Chazelle asserts, of a genre in progress: what \u201ccin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d looked like \u201cbefore it codified.\u201d He discusses how an emerging aesthetic \u2014 one that gave rise to elements of the French New Wave \u2014 was enabled by new technology, in this case 16-millimeter cameras that were lightweight enough for on-the-fly shooting in a variety of locations. It\u2019s a smart talk that\u2019s an apt introduction to a groundbreaking and still engaging film.Advertisement"}

I don\u2019t know about that. A vulgar turn of phrase concerning Owen\u2019s not-entirely-noble intentions toward Jeff\u2019s sister is repeated too often and with too much relish.For all of that, the movie is relentlessly fluffy. Mr. Edelman was the creator of the short-lived HBO series \u201cHow to Make It in America,\u201d which was notable for a not wholly inaccurate but largely toothless depiction of downtown New York mores; \u201cThe After Party\u201d makes \u201cHow to Make It\u201d look like \u201cLast Exit to Brooklyn\u201d by comparison.These Telugu-language films have, if not quite everything, then almost.

The saga begins with a woman carrying a baby through rough river waters; she is forced to abandon it, and the infant is later found, floating, by villagers, and adopted. Every now and then the action stops so a character can make an impassioned speech about vengeance or justice. Or to allow the two romantic leads, Prabhas and Tamannaah \u2014 and later, others \u2014 to do a musical number, for which their everyday clothing is swapped for colorful, scanty costumes. Both movies are entertaining in that discursive way Bollywood movies are, and I was particularly intrigued by the appeal of Tamannaah, who\u2019s formidably sexy and strong. I\u2019m curious as to whether an episodic television series will replicate the rambling immersiveness of the movies.One of the most diverting original supplements on the Criterion Channel of the FilmStruck site is \u201cAdventures in Moviegoing,\u201d a series of interviews, each about 20 minutes long, in which a prominent figure in the arts talks movies.

(But as it\u2019s a mystery with women as its central characters, it\u2019s in keeping with Mr. Feig\u2019s raucous comedies, among them the 2011 film \u201cBridesmaids.\u201d)Advertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.She\u2019s in a much more vulnerable place. She\u2019s really struggling and having an identity crisis because of her dad. With Season 2, I think you have a much deeper understanding why she behaves like she does. People always go, \u201cOh Ruth is such a badass character \u2014 how does it feel to play her?\u201d And it\u2019s much deeper than that. It\u2019s more that she has no choice.In many ways she\u2019s torn between two fathers.Yeah, and she hates the fact that her dad doesn\u2019t respect her and Marty does, even though she really loves that Marty acknowledges her and listens to her.Even though Marty has her running a strip club and laundering money. He hasn\u2019t been a model mentor.Are the strip club scenes awkward to shoot?No, I\u2019m so used to it already. Everyone is just doing their jobs.Why do you think crime shows almost always include a strip bar, besides presumably for cheap titillation? It\u2019s a trope that refuses to die.Because it\u2019s uneasy. You feel like anything might happen at any moment. Isn\u2019t that a weird thing? People are intrigued but also scared about things that are uneasy.Have you been to the actual Ozarks?Is there a trick to playing a Southerner without resorting to the redneck stereotype?I have a journal, and every character that I play, I write as the character, how I feel about things and how I\u2019m going to play it. So I will write, \u201cDear Diary, today I had a bad day because Russ and Boyd and my dad\u201d and this and that. She\u2019s a young girl and she wants the same things that any other young girl would want. She also has hope for a better life that she\u2019ll do anything to get. That\u2019s what makes it so sad, and also makes it human.I don\u2019t know if you remember, but I had that handbag. And I know it\u2019s a prop, but it\u2019s important because that\u2019s Ruth \u2014 she wears something really ugly, but she\u2019ll have the pink handbag she probably got at Walmart because she secretly wants a real leather pink bag. She wants nice things, and you realize this girl is a child.What did you relate to about the role? Nothing, to be honest. It was so hard to play her because I completely had to detach myself to get involved. But I am a very hopeful person, so I get that.Earlier this year you appeared as a Branch Davidian in \u201cWaco.\u201d You seem to spend a lot of time in cults.A journalist once described me as, \u201cgo-to cult girl Julia Garner,\u201d and I thought that was really funny. Those are the interesting parts! Everyone is interested in cults. But I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a go-to cult girl. I did \u201cWaco\u201d right after I did Season 1 of \u201cOzark,\u201d and the story was really interesting and I also thought it was very different from Ruth. She was a sister-wife, and she was stuck in a scenario and she wasn\u2019t this rebellious girl, unlike Ruth. Everything has to be different from the last thing I\u2019ve done. Even if it\u2019s another cult.Your characters are often tough on the outside with vulnerability showing through the cracks. Is that something you do consciously, or does it happen naturally? Maybe a little bit of both. People don\u2019t have just one color. They have multiple things on their mind \u2014 even when they\u2019re listening to another person, they\u2019re thinking of something else. So you have to show multiple layers. And I think naturally, I\u2019m a very sensitive person so sometimes I have to even tone it down. So I don\u2019t know \u2014 it\u2019s a combination of both, it\u2019s weird.\u201cOzark\u201d got some Emmy nominations, but you did not. Was that disappointing?Without giving anything away, Ruth is involved in some very intense scenes this season. What\u2019s the toughest thing you\u2019ve had to shoot?You\u2019re going to laugh: It was the scene when I held the mouse in Season 1. I have the worst fear of rodents. I can\u2019t stand them. They had to use a hand double \u2014 I couldn\u2019t breathe and I nearly got a panic attack. I\u2019m like the least badass person on the planet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tech Billionaires Hack Their Taxes With a Philanthropic Loophole", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate in 2014, Nicholas Woodman, the founder and chief executive of GoPro, announced what appeared to be an extraordinary act of generosity.Mr. Woodman, then 39, had just taken his camera company public, and was suddenly worth about $3 billion. Now he was giving away much of that wealth \u2014 some $500 million worth of GoPro stock \u2014 to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, an organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that would house the assets of the newly formed Jill and Nicholas Woodman Foundation.The executive basked in prestige and gratitude. The Chronicle of Philanthropy named Mr. Woodman one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s most generous donors\u201d that year, placing him alongside established philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg.But four years on, there is almost no trace of the Woodman Foundation, or that $500 million. The foundation has no website and has not listed its areas of focus, and it is not known what \u2014 if any \u2014 significant grants it has made to nonprofits. An extensive search of public records turned up just one beneficiary: the Bonny Doon Art, Wine and Brew Festival, a benefit for an elementary school in California.Instead, the Woodman Foundation essentially exists as an account within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is not required to disclose details about how, if at all, individual donors spend their charitable dollars. Mr. Woodman, GoPro and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation all declined to discuss the Woodman Foundation.If the benefit to the needy is difficult to see, the benefit to Mr. Woodman is clear. After GoPro\u2019s initial public offering, he faced an enormous tax bill in 2014. But by donating via the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, he eased his tax burden in two ways. First, Mr. Woodman avoided paying capital gains taxes on that $500 million worth of stock, a figure that most likely would have been in the tens of millions of dollars. He was also able to claim a charitable deduction that most likely saved millions of dollars more, and probably reduced his personal tax bill for years to come.Mr. Woodman achieved this enticing combination of tax efficiency and secrecy by using a donor-advised fund \u2014 a sort of charitable checking account with serious tax benefits and little or no accountability.Donor-advised funds, or D.A.F.s, allow wealthy individuals like Mr. Woodman to give assets \u2014 usually cash and stock, but also real estate, art and cryptocurrencies \u2014 to a sponsoring organization like the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Fidelity Charitable or Vanguard Charitable. But while donors part ways with their money, they don\u2019t give up control. The sponsoring organizations make grants to hospitals, schools and the like only at a donor\u2019s request. So while donors enjoy immediate tax benefits, charities can wait for funds indefinitely, and maybe forever.For these reasons and more, D.A.F.s have become one of the most controversial issues in the charitable world.Proponents say D.A.F.s have democratized giving, because they are simple to create and the individuals who use them are more generous than those who establish family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d said Greg Avis, interim president of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \u201cThe donor has a tax benefit, and the beneficiaries are the nonprofits.\u201dBut to critics, D.A.F.s represent the worst of philanthropy today \u2014 a system of guaranteed perks for the rich and uncertainty for the rest.Unlike family foundations, which are required to distribute 5 percent of their assets each year and have historically been the way wealthy donors disbursed their philanthropic firepower, D.A.F.s have no distribution requirements, meaning that billions of dollars earmarked for charity can sit idle for decades. And because organizations that manage D.A.F.s are not required to report which funds give money to which causes, it is impossible to know how much money individual donors are giving away to nonprofit organizations.That D.A.F.s have become so popular with Silicon Valley billionaires has only added to their intrigue. Society is still reckoning with the dark sides of social media and online privacy, and there is concern that D.A.F.s \u2014 a dream vehicle for the overnight wealthy \u2014 may prove to be another instance of techno-optimists disrupting a system with unintended consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re a fraud on the American taxpayer,\u201d said Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey\u2019re a way for the affluent to have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dApproaching the Silicon Valley Community Foundation after a tech windfall has become a familiar pattern. In December 2012, just months after Facebook went public, Mr. Zuckerberg donated $500 million of Facebook shares to the group. In 2014, soon after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton donated a combined $846 million to the foundation. In both cases, the establishment of D.A.F.s allowed the men to reap a substantial tax advantage just when they needed it most.Some of this money is put to swift use. Mr. Zuckerberg has used his D.A.F. to give away tens of millions to schools and hospitals in the San Francisco area. Mr. Hastings has used his D.A.F. to give to the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley and the United Negro College Fund. In each case, the donors voluntarily publicized their gifts.Organizations that manage D.A.F.s say most of their account holders, anonymous though they may be, are similarly generous. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation distributed $1.3 billion during the last fiscal year to groups including the South San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Schwab Charitable, another big sponsor of D.A.F.s, said it distributed nearly $2 billion during the last fiscal year, making some 420,000 grants to nonprofits including Feeding America, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.Yet in the case of Mr. Woodman, there is reason to question how much money was made available for charity. He established his D.A.F. the day after GoPro stock approached its highest-ever price, about $95 per share. From a financial perspective, Mr. Woodman could not have timed his gift more perfectly.News of his donation sent GoPro shares tumbling as much as 14 percent the next day, as investors interpreted the move as a lack of confidence in the stock. By the end of the year, GoPro had lost more than a third of its value. By the end of 2015, the stock traded near $18 a share. Today, GoPro stock is worth less than $6 a share.\u201cSmart donors have been playing timing games with the charitable deduction for a long time,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a tax professor at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Columbus School of Law. \u201cIn this case, he potentially gets a very large deduction and gives nothing away. That\u2019s a disturbing public policy issue.\u201dOn Reddit, Mr. Woodman suggested that his wealth was reaching charities: \u201cThe Foundation has gone on to fund causes supporting women and children and will continue to do so!!!!\u201d Just how much money has gone to which organizations, of course, remains a mystery.When it comes to D.A.F.s, the United States tax code rewards the promise of good intentions. Wealthy donors \u2014 including many of the Silicon Valley billionaires who have asked the public to trust them with their digital lives \u2014 pledge to distribute their funds to charity once they get their tax break. But in the absence of rules requiring donors to give their money away, it is hard to know what public good comes in exchange for those lucrative write-offs.Skeptics see a system ripe for abuse. Donors might wait years to engage in meaningful philanthropic activity, or decide to simply leave the fund for their children to manage.\u201cWe\u2019ve put this rule in place that says you get maximum tax benefits when you make a donation,\u201d said Ray Madoff, a professor at the Boston College Law School and a vocal critic of donor-advised funds. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do anything with it.\u201dMs. Norley of Fidelity Charitable argues that on balance, account holders are generous. At her organization, roughly a quarter of the assets held in D.A.F.s have been distributed to nonprofits in each of the past two years. Other sponsor organizations report similar distribution rates.Yet such statistics can be skewed. In many instances, these figures include transfers from one D.A.F. to another. In the most recent fiscal year, for instance, Vanguard Charitable sent more than $15 million from its D.A.F.s to Fidelity Charitable. Sponsor organizations say this is simply a matter of wealthy donors adjusting their accounts. But it also creates the illusion of meaningful philanthropic activity where there is none.And while the overall payout rate at an organization that manages D.A.F.s may be substantial, the numbers could be warped by a few donors who give away huge sums, while a majority of donors give away virtually nothing at all.Critics argue that some sponsor organizations even have an incentive to keep funds undisbursed to charities. That is because D.A.F.s have emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for financial firms.For example, Fidelity Charitable, which is structured as an independent public charity, pays millions in annual fees to Fidelity Management, the big asset manager. Fidelity Management then invests the billions of dollars held in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s D.A.F.s, making money there as well. Vanguard, Schwab and Goldman Sachs all get millions in fees from their affiliated public charities. The more money held in D.A.F.s, the greater the potential earnings for the financial groups.The fact that D.A.F.s have become a profit center for Wall Street firms is a perversion of the philanthropic system, critics say.\u201cThe charitable deduction is not meant to give tax breaks to very wealthy people. It\u2019s meant to encourage giving to worthy nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, an attorney who worked for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, when Mr. Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got instead is a huge warehousing of funds with massive amount of fees being extracted by Wall Street.\u201dFidelity and Goldman brush off such criticism as misinformed, arguing that they are simply providing a valuable service to their clients by streamlining their charitable giving and offering them legal tax benefits. Some D.A.F. sponsors have rules in place that require accounts to disburse at least some money every few years.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Karey Dye, president of the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund, where Laurene Powell Jobs and the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer recently established D.A.F.s. \u201cPeople have irrevocably given money away to charity. Most often they are wanting to give money away to things that are meaningful to them and make a difference.\u201dAt the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the drive to accumulate assets appears to have been particularly intense. Former and current employees said the former chief executive, Emmett Carson, wanted to make the organization one of the largest sponsors of D.A.F.s in the country, and engaged in an arms race of sorts to woo big donors.In spite of his ouster, Mr. Carson appears to have succeeded in his goal. Thanks to big gifts from tech billionaires like Mr. Woodman and Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and the relatively new practice of accepting highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation is now one of the largest such groups in the country, with more than $13 billion in assets.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Washington has tried to take action. The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, was the first law to specifically address D.A.F.s. It established some basic rules that barred self-dealing, but stopped short of more fundamental changes, such as mandated distribution requirements or less generous tax breaks.\u201cWe were basically trying to undo a giveaway by the government,\u201d said Mr. Zerbe, who worked on that bill while he was at the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I\u2019m never convinced we can totally keep the weasels down the hole.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And these new Netflix movies aren\u2019t afraid to trumpet that influence in clever ways.\u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d directed by Susan Johnson with a script adapted by Sofia Alvarez from a novel by Jenny Han, kicks off by introducing us to the three funny, feisty young females of the Covey household. Kitty, the youngest (Anna Cathcart), announces \u201cI hate when Dad makes Korean food,\u201d and uses an amusing vulgar simile mocking what his cooking tastes like.Dad is a widowed gynecologist played by John Corbett who apparently never inherited the culinary skills of the girls\u2019 mom, who was of Asian descent. In any event, the oldest sister, Margot (Janel Parrish), is soon off to college in Scotland. That leaves her middle sister, Lara Jean, our heroine, played by Lana Condor (of \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d and the coming \u201cAlita: Battle Angel\u201d), to ponder what will become of her relationship to Josh (Israel Broussard), her childhood best buddy who became Margot\u2019s boyfriend when adolescence kicked in.This question might be enough to fuel an ordinary plot for a young-adult film, but wait, there\u2019s more. Lara Jean\u2019s secret stash of unsent love letters to Josh and four other crushes winds up being mysteriously stamped and sent to the addressees. Confrontations ensue, one of which bears unexpected fruit.The hot-yet-nice jock Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), after hearing Lara Jean\u2019s explanation that these letters were mementos for her delectation only and that her crush has passed, sees an opportunity nonetheless. What if Lara Jean were to pose as his girlfriend to make Peter\u2019s snooty ex jealous? And so a plan is born. We know it\u2019s not going to work out the way the kids think it will, but we also know it will end in a way that everyone finds much more satisfying.Ms. Condor and Mr. Centineo are charming and their banter is diverting. As an older man (around John Corbett\u2019s age, actually) who has no children, I watch such movies from a position of personal disinterest: I don\u2019t relate, at least not immediately. Yet it\u2019s fascinating to observe how a pop culture product of this sort processes and depicts adolescence. The semiotics are off the charts, really.Which is of a piece with the film as a whole. Aside from the real estate porn on display here \u2014 Lara Jean\u2019s house is a cozy and capacious American colonial, but all the other kids in this movie seem to have internet billionaires for parents, given the party scenes \u2014 the salient feature of this movie\u2019s Y.A. worldview is exceptional self-awareness. Not even John Hughes\u2019s creations were quite so sharp.The unpopular kid is the title character, played by Shannon Purser of Netflix\u2019s series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d She\u2019s sweet, smart (brilliant, actually) and beloved by her sweet, smart parents, both played by veterans of John Hughes films. The dad is a famous author portrayed by Alan Ruck, so memorable as Cameron in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d while Mom is Lea Thompson of \u201cSome Kind of Wonderful\u201d (directed by Howard Deutch but written and produced by Mr. Hughes). Sierra is expected to be some kind of literary whiz kid, but what she really wants to do is sing.And to be liked by a boy. She has no particular boy in mind, at first. But mean girl Veronica (Kristine Froseth) pranks hunky nice guy Jamey (Noah Centineo again \u2014 this fellow\u2019s going places!) by giving him Sierra\u2019s phone number after he asks for Veronica\u2019s, and soon Sierra and the unsuspecting Jamey are texting each other and getting along.Once again, a strange alliance suggests itself: Sierra offers to help Veronica win back a creepy object of desire (by making her look \u201csmart\u201d) if Veronica will masquerade as Sierra by sending cute selfies. It\u2019s kind of \u201cCyrano de Bergerac\u201d with smartphones. And of course it gets more complicated once face-to-face meet-ups are scheduled.As mean girls go, Veronica is plenty mean, but this is one of those compassionate Y.A. tales with a \u201churt people hurt people\u201d lesson. Veronica\u2019s damage is explained by her overbearing mom (Chrissy Metz, in a broad performance that\u2019s a big contrast to her role on the series \u201cThis Is Us\u201d) who in turn reveals damage of her own. The main point is that Veronica\u2019s collaboration with Sierra makes her a better person, and also helps Sierra\u2019s confidence, although both have to clear some big ethical hurdles to arrive at the happy endingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Ozark\u2019: What to Remember Before Watching Season 2", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom about halfway through the first episode of \u201cOzark,\u201d the financial planner Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) and his family have tiptoed the razor\u2019s edge, surviving certain death through guile, ingenuity and plain old luck. After learning that his partner embezzled $8 million in Mexican cartel money, Marty first slips the noose by successfully pitching the cartel on Lake of the Ozarks as a new haven for their money-laundering needs. From there, the Byrdes are given just a few days to liquidate $8 million in assets, leave Chicago and set up shop in Missouri \u2014 where, under threat of execution, they have three months to launder all that cash.And that\u2019s only the beginning of their troubles.Let\u2019s break it down, threat by threat:Omar Navarro\u2019s cartel is the second-biggest in Mexico, and its willingness to assert its power from afar is made clear in the first episode, when the cartel boss Camino Del Rio (Esai Morales) has four of Marty\u2019s associates executed for embezzling its money and nearly kills Marty, too. Marty\u2019s Hail Mary pitch to bring their laundering operation to Lake of the Ozarks \u2014 which, as he is keen emphasize, gun to head, has more coastline than California \u2014 is just enough to persuade Del to spare his life. But it also puts him and his wife, Wendy (Laura Linney), as well as their teenage children, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) and Jonah (Skylar Gaertner), in immediate jeopardy.Del tosses Wendy\u2019s not-so-secret lover from the balcony of his luxury apartment partly to keep her and the kids from bailing on Marty, and the cartel micromanages their affairs thereafter.When Marty makes their deadline on the $8 million, the cartel ships another $50 million to him immediately \u2014 the first part of the $500 million Marty has promised to launder. Del won\u2019t be around to terrorize the Byrdes in Season 2 \u2014 more on that below \u2014 but the Navarros aren\u2019t going away.Don\u2019t call them hillbillies or rednecks: The Snells, Jacob (Peter Mullan) and Darlene (Lisa Emery), have occupied this sprawling resort area for generations, and they control a sizable poppy field for the manufacturing and distribution of heroin. Marty accidentally runs afoul of the Snells while trying to convince a local pastor and his pregnant wife, Mason and Grace Young, to take their ministry off the lake and into a proper church. But the Snells have been using Pastor Young\u2019s boat services to move drugs using hollowed-out hymnals, and in one of the season\u2019s most disturbing moments, it is implied that they kill Grace and leave her infant son for Mason to find. In one great masterstroke of financial chicanery, Marty manages to convince the cartel and the Snells to invest together in a riverboat casino that would allow drugs and bad money to flow freely. But Del uses the word redneck in Darlene\u2019s presence and she shoots him in the head.The Langmores are trailer-trash crooks who come into the Byrdes\u2019 orbit when the 19-year-old Ruth (Julia Garner), the smartest of the lot, swipes a chunk of the cartel\u2019s money from their motel room and Wyatt (Charlie Tahan) takes Charlotte on a joy ride in a stolen boat. Although Marty gets his money back, the Langmores aren\u2019t going away so easily. Ruth\u2019s malevolent father, Cade (Trevor Long), tries to call the shots from prison, but she enters into a friendlier partnership with Marty and the Byrde family, who entrust her with operating one of their businesses \u2014 a strip club called Lickety Splitz. At one point, Ruth tries and fails to carry out a plan to electrocute Marty, but she succeeds in electrocuting her uncle Russ (Marc Menchaca) and her brother Boyd (Christopher James Baker) before they can get a piece of Marty themselves. Her complex loyalties stand to be a major inflection point for Season 2.The rogue F.B.I. agent Roy Petty (Jason Butler Harner) poked around in Marty\u2019s business all season. Going undercover, he initiates a clandestine sexual affair with the closeted Russ Langmore (Marc Menchaca) \u2014 and promises him the fanciest bait-and-tackle business the Ozarks have ever seen \u2014 as means to flip him into doing his bidding. The operation goes embarrassingly awry, which will have Petty seeking redemption. Meanwhile, the local sheriff, Jon Nix (Robert C. Trevelier), seems to know that the Snells have him outgunned, so the Byrdes get the bulk of his side eye.The Byrdes are doing great! Or as great as a family in danger from a violent cartel can be. Back in Chicago, Marty and Wendy were keeping secrets from each other but the constant fear of gruesome destinies for them and their children have unified them, like an extreme form of couples therapy. It\u2019s a fragile bond \u2014 Marty and Wendy still have trust issues, Charlotte is still moody and unpredictable, Jonah is still a gun-crazy weirdo \u2014 but they enter Season 2 together. And alive.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Death, Betrayal and Greed in a Gripping \u2018Henry VI\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHalftime was ticking down at a marathon performance of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry VI\u201d when the guys in front of me returned to their seats and I fell a little in love with them. Riffling through plot points and names of characters they vaguely remembered were coming up (\u201cWho\u2019s Edmund? Or am I thinking of \u2018King Lear\u2019?\u201d), they were like soap opera fans preparing to dive back into an engrossing serial.Fast-paced and gripping, this is an unusually lucid staging of a bloody history play, whose surfeit of schemes and villainy could make a daytime-drama writer blush. Yet for all the battles and beheadings in Stephen Brown-Fried\u2019s handsomely designed production, never does it take death lightly. That\u2019s one of the remarkable things about it.The sheer heft of the play, which Shakespeare wrote in three parts and Mr. Brown-Fried has condensed into two, ensured its consignment as an also-ran, less famous and more rarely seen than the history plays that bookend it, \u201cHenry V\u201d and \u201cRichard III.\u201d As \u201cHenry VI\u201d begins, Henry V is dead in a coffin before us.And Henry VI himself? An infant when he inherits the crown, this king (Jon Norman Schneider in a lovely, understated performance) grows into a placid, passive, pious man \u2014 reasonably decent, albeit comically effete in the manner of those pampered from birth. Intelligent yet callow, he is dependent on the wisdom of the Duke of Gloucester, protector of the realm before Henry comes of age.The redoubtable Mia Katigbak plays Gloucester, and one of the rewards of this production is watching the battle for influence between Gloucester and the Bishop of Winchester, played by Wai Ching Ho (Madame Gao in the Marvel/Netflix television universe) \u2014 just two of the standout women in an impressive 16-member cast that does a lot of doubling. When Gloucester\u2019s fortunes fall, sunk in part by his own imperious wife (the excellent Sophia Skiles), Ms. Katigbak imbues him with a desolate poignancy.Power is the shiny object nearly all of these characters are grasping for, whether to attain what they don\u2019t have or to cling fiercely to what they do. And so to war, first with France and a fantastically lively Joan of Arc \u2014 or Joan la Pucelle (Kim Wong), as she\u2019s known here. There\u2019s also a popular uprising to quash (\u201cThe first thing we do, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers,\u201d one rebel says), and the War of the Roses to wage, with the Duke of York (Rajesh Bose) pitted firmly against Henry. His vengeful son Richard (David Huynh) will carry on that enmity, determined to seize the throne.To the factions in \u201cHenry VI,\u201d no assault on human life is too barbaric if it will feed their craving for dominance. That\u2019s as true of the rabid mob in the populist rebellion as it is of the combatants in the War of the Roses, better heeled but just as greedy and as cruel.So much slogging through battle might make heavy going if not for Queen Margaret, Henry\u2019s wife, one of Shakespeare\u2019s most riveting characters. She\u2019s the royal you love to hate: duplicitous and nakedly ambitious from the get-go, but a savvy tactician and as ferociously brave as she is vicious. It\u2019s a magnificent role, and Mahira Kakkar gives a smart, muscular performance flecked with humor.There is also the exciting shape of the battles themselves, played out on Kimie Nishikawa\u2019s spare set, its color scheme redolent of blood and ashes. These are no sword fights; instead, under the movement direction of Orlando Pabotoy and Kimiye Corwin, the actors borrow from martial arts, wielding long bo staffs and short eskrima sticks.They leave quite a trail of carnage. Each time a character has been killed in front of us, Mr. Brown-Fried slows time, turning us from bystanders into witnesses, forced to register the death. Toward the end, when even his slimmed-down adaptation can\u2019t help dragging, he pulls back from this a little, as if he were worried about moving things along.Yet it\u2019s in his lingering on still-warm corpses that we feel the full grotesquerie of these royal power games. Body piles on body, and we tabulate the cost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I wasn\u2019t studying at all at the beginning and when I realized that I needed to know these lines, I buckled down, learned the lines, delivered them with my flavor as Rev Run. Was it easy? No. Was it enjoyable? Yes. Do we look natural? I would say very much.The story line hews pretty closely to your real life. How much input did you have?The day I walked into the office and had eight or however many writers around me, I spoke for one hour, crazily. I just talk and talk and talk and talk about what\u2019s really going on in me and my wife\u2019s life, and for some reason on this day I was on fire. And everybody was just laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. We threw out everything against the wall we could think of until we were out of breath.There\u2019s a scene where Joe\u2019s son Wesley, played by Anthony Anderson\u2019s son, Nathan, implies that you\u2019re out of touch as a rapper. Are you really?I am the most up-to-date rapper at my age you will ever meet. I listen to everything from Drake to Young Thug. I know what\u2019s going on. Nicki Minaj has a new record with 6ix9ine, and I listened to that the day it came out. I\u2019m waiting on DJ Khaled\u2019s new record that hits today at 1 p.m. with Justin Bieber and Quavo. I\u2019m all over Instagram, I\u2019m all over Twitter, I\u2019m all over everything. I\u2019m young. I\u2019m not, \u201cOh, the way rap used to be.\u201d I\u2019m not that guy. Who\u2019s your favorite young rapper?My total favorite is Drake. He reminds me of Run-DMC. We came through with rock and rap mixed. He has singing and rapping mixed, and it works very well for him. He\u2019s doing something different. He\u2019s fascinating to me.Your alter ego on \u201cAll About the Washingtons\u201d is retiring. How about you?If I could retire tomorrow I probably would, but my wife says, \u201cYou\u2019d go crazy.\u201d The joke on the show is I would probably be on Instagram showing everybody that I\u2019m retired, and I can retire the best, so it\u2019s a retired competition going on in my mind. You\u2019d see me every day saying: \u201cLook at my new boat. It says Justine on the side. Hi, here\u2019s a selfie of me in the South of France.\u201d So I\u2019d probably be fake retired.What brought you to religion? Can rap and religion coexist? Look at what\u2019s going on. The top rappers are married. Kanye West, married. Jay-Z, married. People just wanting to have an image of, as they get older at least, \u201cI love my children, I love God, spirituality means something.\u201dI\u2019m well respected by everybody, from Shaquille O\u2019Neal to Diddy. They respect my marriage, the way I conduct myself. I\u2019m the \u201cafter rap.\u201d And it\u2019s pretty funny: We now have a retired rapper that\u2019s going to have a television show talking about \u201cI\u2019m done rapping\u201d \u2014 and rapping is so new.It may be too soon to ask, but what do you see as your legacy?I think overall my image as Rev Run is as important as my image as Run-DMC, if not more. People know me. When I walk the streets they don\u2019t go, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Run?\u201d They go, \u201cHello, Reverend.\u201d I want to be known as a good man. I want to be known as a husband and a father and a compassionate human being that loves to inspire. I inspired as a rapper in my youth, and I hope to inspire by doing the right thing as I move on.Advertisement"}

The Netflix spokesperson would not provide further details on Netflix\u2019s relationship with the film.Mr. Farrakhan and representatives for the Nation of Islam did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In light of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s announcement, a number of Jewish organizations and people spoke out in media outlets and on Twitter, or said they reached out to Netflix directly. Rabbi Marvin Hier, the founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an organization dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, said he immediately called up the Netflix chief executive, Ted Sarandos, who told him that a \u201cglitch\u201d had occurred, and the movie would not be released.Rabbi Hier said it would be terrible to give Mr. Farrakhan \u201clegitimacy\u201d on such a national level by streaming this documentary.\u201cDocumentaries should always be screened,\u201d Rabbi Hier said. \u201cBut not by bigots and haters.\u201dGary P.

{"Headline": "Two Netflix Original Dads, Incarnated by TV Favorites", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingTwo new Netflix Original comedy films offer family dysfunction enacted by veteran television performers. \u201cFather of the Year,\u201d starring David Spade, the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d and \u201cJust Shoot Me\u201d alum, had its premiere on July 20, while \u201cLike Father,\u201d which debuted Aug. 3, features Kristen Bell, once the well-loved teenage detective of \u201cVeronica Mars,\u201d as the estranged daughter of Kelsey Grammer, who should need no introduction.\u201cLike Father\u201d is the stronger of the two. Directed by Lauren Miller Rogen, it\u2019s a predictable comedy of reconciliation. But it boasts substantial pleasures, largely on account of the performers.Ms. Bell\u2019s Rachel is a workaholic advertising exec who\u2019s still setting up meetings on her cellphone on the day of her wedding, at Central Park\u2019s scenic Bethesda Fountain. Rachel\u2019s husband-to-be can\u2019t take it anymore, and he cracks up and leaves her at the altar. Observing all this, flowers in hand, is Harry (Mr. Grammer), an uninvited guest. He\u2019s Rachel\u2019s father, who abandoned his family when she was 5, the better to pursue, you\u2019ll never guess, his career.Rachel is at first indignant on meeting the father she never really knew, but he persuades her to go out for drinks with him. Drinks, not talk, she insists \u2014 and so the two wind up drinking quite a bit. The next day, they\u2019re sharing a suite on a cruise ship \u2014 the one Rachel\u2019s husband-to-be had booked for their honeymoon. They resolve to leave the ship at its first port of call and fly home, though you know that\u2019s not going to happen.There is no small amusement value in the comic hook Ms. Rogen works for all its worth in a few subsequent scenes, which has Rachel and Harry being mistaken for newlyweds by many of their fellow passengers. An ensuing onboard \u201cgame show,\u201d a sort of \u201cNewlywed Game\u201d-style competition, is a great set piece; Harry concocts a scheme that allows them to win, albeit awkwardly. The funny stuff sells itself, and it expands with the introduction of Jeff, played by Seth Rogen, a single on the cruise whose interest in Rachel brings out Harry\u2019s protective side. (The director is married to Mr. Rogen, whose character is given the in-joke trait of never having smoked marijuana in his life.)The movie hews to conventional structure to a fault, right down to the characters\u2019 inevitable reconciliation. But Ms. Rogen has a lot of good sense as a director, making the most of the floating-amusement-park atmosphere of cruise ships. Because Mr. Grammer is a first-rate actor who, since his distinguished stint on the sitcom \u201cFrasier\u201d hasn\u2019t had many meaty screen roles come his way, he really sinks his teeth into Harry, and Ms. Bell is no slouch playing against him. They make the movie.Instead, this film, directed by Tyler Spindel, splits the difference between post-teenage romantic comedy and lower-versus-middle-class-war farce. Ben (Joey Bragg), a recent college graduate, visits his hometown on his way to New York, dropping in on his dad, an aggressive loser named Wayne, played by Mr. Spade. Ben\u2019s best friend, Larry (Matt Shively), has problems of his own at home, including a pushy science-nerd stepfather, Mardy (Nat Faxon). Rivalries between the households, such as they are, lead to Wayne\u2019s challenging Mardy to a fight.All this has just about as much narrative import and urgency as you might imagine, as well as a lot of third-tier Farrelly-brothers-influenced gross-out humor. There\u2019s a scene at the beginning in which Mr. Spade\u2019s character skinny-dips in a kiddie pool cobbled together in the back of a pickup truck. This goes bad when the truck\u2019s owner gets in and starts driving. I admit, I laughed. I was also charmed by Bridgit Mendler as Meredith, Ben\u2019s feisty hometown love interest. As for the rest, it\u2019s a typical production from Adam Sandler\u2019s outfit, Happy Madison, easygoing, vulgar and reliant on its audience\u2019s good will toward its lead performer.Watching it compelled me to finally get around to \u201cThe Week Of,\u201d the wedding comedy starring Mr. Sandler and Chris Rock that debuted on Netflix back in April. That picture had a \u201cthe day of\u201d review embargo, so I assumed it had to be pretty bad, and the reviews seemed to bear me out. Still, as someone who occasionally enjoys Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, the abrasive character created by Robert Smigel, who wrote and directed \u201cThe Week Of,\u201d I was still curious. How bad could it be?Well, as the popular \u201cMad Men\u201d meme goes, it\u2019s \u201cNot great, Bob!\u201d This story of Mr. Sandler\u2019s financially insecure Long Island common man putting on a brave face before the affluent father of the groom (Mr. Rock) is a familiar one. They say that familiarity breeds contempt, but in this case, it doesn\u2019t do a lot more than elicit weariness.The movie\u2019s tone does have at least a consistent tinge of Mr. Smigel\u2019s acerbic perspective \u2014 an early scene shows a couple of kids watching the classic film \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d on TV with the sound off while their offscreen parents scream at each other. \u201cThe Week Of\u201d has a sharp running joke about the casual racism of the white family here and its inability to remember the names of any of the groom\u2019s relatives.While the movie is ultimately more of the same old same old, it is at least not as appallingly sexist and culturally insensitive as \u201cThe Ridiculous Six,\u201d Mr. Sandler\u2019s dreaded 2015 Netflix Original western \u201cspoof.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Diagnosis Update: A Young Woman\u2019s Extreme Muscle Pain Persists", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiagnosisIn an interview in the spring, Angel explained that she has had episodes of pain in her muscles for as long as she can remember. As a child, she was told that they were just growing pains. But one night, at age 14, she suddenly developed excruciating pain in the muscles of her leg, worse than anything she had ever experienced before. Her parents rushed her to the hospital in her hometown, Las Vegas. Doctors there found that the pain was caused by the destruction of her muscle fibers \u2014 something known medically as rhabdomyolysis, or rhabdo. During this episode, as well as most of those that followed, her urine turned as dark as Coca-Cola, from pigments that make muscle red. This pigment, along with other byproducts of the destroyed muscle, are removed from the body through the kidneys, a process that can damage these essential organs. There was nothing the hospital could do to stop the muscle breakdown. That process stopped on its own. But the hospitalization was essential; she needed intravenous fluids to flush out these destructive pieces of broken-down muscle to prevent any permanent injury to her kidneys.Rhabdomyolysis is not an uncommon problem. Anything that destroys muscle tissue, like trauma or even excessive exertion, can cause some degree of rhabdo. And after that initial hospitalization, she and her parents were told that it was unlikely to happen again. But it did \u2014 over and over. It took several hospital admissions for her doctors to acknowledge that these episodes of muscle pain may represent some underlying disease.Today, Angel has had dozens of admissions to her local hospital to be treated for her repeated episodes of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis. She isn\u2019t sure what triggers these painful crises. Sometimes it seems to be set off by illness. But other times, Angel has been ill and hasn\u2019t been crippled by subsequent muscle pain. Other times, strenuous exercise might bring on the muscle pain and blackened urine. And yet she has been able to run and hike and play soccer many times without that happening.I told Angel\u2019s story four months ago and asked New York Times readers to help us find the cause of these terrible episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The results were amazing. Within hours, hundreds of individuals submitted their thoughts on possible diagnoses for Angel. Others offered sympathy and advice on how to manage her symptoms. Still others heard echoes of their own experiences in Angel\u2019s story and wrote to share their stories and reassure Angel that she was not alone. Over the next few weeks more than 2,000 suggestions came to us.Many readers offered recommendations on where to look for the underlying disease process. One of the most common observations was that this disorder, whatever it was, seemed to be genetic, as the first symptoms started so early in life. Others suggested that Angel\u2019s symptoms could be a reaction to her environment \u2014 either her physical environment, or a food she ate or medications she was exposed to. Another popular approach was to suggest possible mechanisms underlying her disorder, of which autoimmune disease was the most common suggestion. And finally, a significant number of you suggested either specific diseases or classes of diseases. Of these, diseases affecting the processes that provide energy to muscles, disorders known as metabolic myopathies, were the most popular. Disorders caused by difficulties getting rid of the waste products of cells, including diseases like porphyria, were also suggested.Angel was surprised and moved by the response. She reached out to several individuals whose stories touched her. She also spoke with doctors and patients who suggested diseases they knew well through professional or personal experience.I spoke to Angel recently, and she confessed that getting a diagnosis still seemed to her like a long shot. Until this year there were so many doctors, and so few answers. But she was excited by the many strong leads the crowdsourcing process brought to her. She is still following up on several with her doctors and the documentary team. It has been a nerve-racking process \u2014 so many ideas, so many possible answers \u2014 but she has been buoyed by the support she has had from everyone she has talked to. The results of Angel\u2019s search and all the diagnostic twists and turns will be featured in the Netflix documentaries when they air next year.In the meantime, life goes on. Just weeks after her story appeared here, Angel completed her studies to become a nurse. Her friends and family joined her as she received her nursing pin from Altierus College.This summer she passed the exam to get her nursing license, and she is now a nurse at Montevista Hospital in Las Vegas. Being a nurse is a goal she has worked toward for years, and she is relieved and proud. She is determined that the episodes of pain in her legs, arms and back will not keep her from being the nurse she has dreamed of becoming. She and her boyfriend, Mac, continue to work toward having a normal life. Recently they traveled to Seattle to visit friends and family. She will not allow this disease to limit her or define her. Still, she wants a diagnosis. She longs to understand what\u2019s going on in her body and, if possible, to prevent the pain and destruction of her muscles.If you have any suggestions, please share them in the comments section. Let me know what you think, and see if you can help Angel on her medical journey.Advertisement"}

Whatever you call the Whitney installation by the label Eckhaus Latta, you\u2019re likely to leave with more questions (and clothes) than answers.Labels. Can\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t live without them.At least not in today\u2019s milk-glass world of vanguard culture, where the once-distinct disciplines like dance, fashion, art, photography, food and performance have begun melding together like never before. In some quarters, it\u2019s now blurry enough to recall the Newton disc, a wheel of the color spectrum that when spun at high speed turns white (or at least a nice dove gray).Is it art? Fashion? Here\u2019s the thing, and it applies whether you are talking about Eckhaus Latta or their Whitney show (or about Mr. Eckhaus or Ms. Latta themselves): If you are trying to pin them down as being one thing or another, you\u2019re already out of the game. Defying categorization isn\u2019t a goal or a gimmick; it\u2019s a given. And it\u2019s one that everything else is built upon. \u201cThis is something we get asked a lot,\u201d Ms. Latta said earlier this week, after having flown in from Los Angeles to install the show. (Mr. Eckhaus lives in New York, so even their base of operations is blurry.) \u201cFor us, if it wasn\u2019t getting asked of us, we wouldn\u2019t ask it of ourselves ever. That gray area is always where we\u2019ve been the happiest, and not needing a definitive label.\u201dArticulate as Mr. Eckhaus and Ms. Latta are, they falter in describing their own style. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had this issue when people want us to describe the clothes or ask \u2018What is Eckhaus Latta?\u2019\u201d Mr. Eckhaus said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t necessarily know how to answer those questions, but I think that\u2019s a really exciting thing rather than a detrimental one. Why does everything need to be a one-liner or an elevator pitch? Why does everything need to be so easily understood?\u201d That one design gave rise to a handful of others, which they showed at a friend\u2019s gallery on Bowery, and they were on their way. One of the early hallmarks of their line, and their approach, is what the artist and performer Kembra Pfahler has called \u201cavailabism,\u201d the practice of using what\u2019s on hand or at least easily procured.Most strikingly, that meant plastic \u2014 the kind not really meant to be worn next to the skin. One early look that generated some buzz was a high-waist pair of pants knit from tan plastic and mohair worn with mint-green patent leather-covered woodblock shoes and a double-faced cashmere vest.\u201cWe were very into outdoor upholstery materials,\u201d Ms. Latta said.\u201cIt was very Home Depot,\u201d Mr. Eckhaus added. But if that sounds even more airily arty and self-indulgent, a no-nonsense marketing professional might disagree. In an age when there are 1,500 names on the Vogue.com runway show list, finding a voice that resonates with people outside the Wintour circle is of paramount importance. With a canny mix of inclusiveness and exclusiveness, that is just what Eckhaus Latte has done, as borne out by their Whitney show.The charm of this approach is that it has allowed the pair to take an abstract and personal approach to runway clothes that can change from season to season without ever hewing to one aesthetic or rule. It really is almost impossible to define the Eckhaus Latta style, though in 2015 Women\u2019s Wear Daily came as close as anyone has to pinning it down: \u201ca look that melds utilitarianism, pansexuality, streetwear and thrifted silhouettes into a unique, counterculture aesthetic.\u201d And yet if that suggests that pragmatism isn\u2019t part of the mix, that would be wrong. Indeed, the most surprising thing about Eckhaus Latta isn\u2019t the edgy-chic clothes on the runway; it is the clothes in the showroom, where there are full-fledged collections of denim, knits and accessories as well as one-of-a-kind collection pieces.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing \u2014 we\u2019re not artists,\u201d Ms. Latta said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re serious about our business and changing the ways this industry works and working within its limitations. We can talk to you about tailoring and bias-cut dresses and knit structures all you want.\u201dSo in an age in which binary systems, like male/female and young/old, are being rejected left and right (sorry), maybe it\u2019s also time to retire the old canard that art is above commerce while fashion revels in it. That\u2019s very much the message of the Whitney show. \u201cThis concept of blending, allowing commerce to happen within the context of art, all came from them,\u201d said Lauri Freedman, the Whitney\u2019s head of product development and a co-curator of the show, with Christopher Y. Lew. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they know how to put on a fashion show, it\u2019s not just that they have this amazing group of artists they work with. They are stewards of their ideas in a way that is fully holistic.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t something they set out to do but rather that their intuitive approach led them to \u2014 the same mind-set that brought them together when they were students as RISD and the internet was still up for grabs.\u201cIt really felt like a different time in terms of how we related to stuff and images and buying things,\u201d Ms. Latta said. \u201cNow we hang out with our interns, and they all talk about the same Netflix shows. It\u2019s this homogeneous culture that they participate in. We were always into our esoteric stuff.\u201dSo let others try and put themselves into a box \u2014 Mr. Eckhaus and Ms. Latta will be out browsing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At The Athletic, a Hiring Spree Becomes a Story in Itself", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Athletic, the hyperlocal sports website and app, is growing quicker than any sports media company in recent memory. This month, hardly a day passes without the announcement of a new hire. Or four.Just 10 months ago, when The Athletic celebrated its second birthday, the subscription-only website had 65 editorial employees in 10 markets. By the time the N.F.L. and college football seasons open next month, it will have more than 300 editorial employees, and sites focused on 38 markets.Backed by $28 million in venture capital, The Athletic long ago moved past simple questions like what to cover and where, to more existential ones: Can its rapid growth be sustained? Will it eventually make a profit? And why do its investors believe it will sail counter to the prevailing winds in media?Those answers are not easy to find, but the business plan at The Athletic is largely a bet that it will emerge as a Netflix-like solution to the decline of local sports coverage by newspapers decimated by budget cuts, and that it could eventually win over millions of subscribers. Its current hiring surge, then, is more a doubling down on that bet than a tangible payoff on it.Daniel Leff, the founder of Luminari Capital, which has invested in The Athletic, argued that the website is already worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and the only remaining question presently is how large it will grow. \u201cThis is a company that has already achieved escape velocity,\u201d he said.Without subscription figures or internal financial reports, Leff\u2019s optimism is impossible to validate. Media companies like Netflix, Spotify and Sirius XM have tens of millions of subscribers paying monthly for their services, but few journalism companies approach those numbers. The New York Times leads newspapers with 2.9 million digital-only subscribers, and several magazines have circulations in the millions.Taylor Patterson, a spokeswoman for The Athletic, said the company has \u201cwell over\u201d 100,000 subscribers, each paying about $5 each month. Leff, the investor, said it had \u201cmany multiples\u201d of 100,000.Brian Grey, who was the chief executive of Bleacher Report when the sports media company raised $33 million in investment capital and later was acquired by Turner Broadcasting for around $200 million, wonders if the Netflix or Spotify comparisons are accurate. \u201cVideo and text are two different animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe subscription and consumer willingness to pay for content may not map completely.\u201dBut to Leff, small-bore questions about expansion or profitability are missing the forest for the trees. \u201cJust to get to 100,000 subscribers is a huge endeavor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may or may not need additional capital to do it, but if so, so what? There are a multitude of capital sources that want to put money into this company.\u201dWhen asked if The Athletic was already worth the $200 million Bleacher Report was acquired for six years ago, Leff responded: \u201cAbsolutely. We wouldn\u2019t take that.\u201dStill, The Athletic has received heavy criticism from the industry it hopes to dominate. In several markets, The Athletic has hired multiple writers away from the same newspaper, decimating the sports staffs at papers like The San Jose Mercury News and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others.\u201cYes, you can go into new markets and get sports fans,\u201d Kosner said of The Athletic\u2019s recent growth. \u201cBut it may not be as easy to continue to grow in these markets than it is to get started.\u201d He predicted the end goal for The Athletic would be acquisition by a major media company, not a long-term future as an independent company.Patterson, the spokeswoman at The Athletic, said even converting just a percentage of die-hard sports fans into subscribers \u201cwould result in a very healthy business for us.\u201d She said the company has not seriously entertained any acquisition offers.Leff also believes there is a crucial difference from other subscription companies: Though Netflix increasingly produces original shows, it and Spotify are still mostly licensing companies. Combined, they have to pay billions to stock their services, while The Athletic creates 100 percent of its content.That content may be the crux of the challenge.Most of The Athletic\u2019s writers, including many of its most recent hires, earned their following over years, or decades, at newspapers, a following they \u2014 and their new bosses \u2014 turn into Athletic subscribers. But stocking the site with newspaper veterans (there is also a very strong contingent of former \u201cSports Illustrated\u201d journalists) means The Athletic often doesn\u2019t read that different from a newspaper sports section.At Netflix and Spotify, the compelling product is the video and the music. But in sports, the most compelling product isn\u2019t the writing. It is the games themselves, and Grey, the Bleacher Report veteran, wondered if that might be what The Athletic needs in order to truly scale its audience.\u201cFacebook is buying rights to live games. Twitter is buying rights to live games,\u201d Grey said. \u201cThe Athletic may need to find itself moving in that direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Netflix\u2019s \u2018Insatiable\u2019 as Offensive as It Looks? Let\u2019s Discuss", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the petition, \u201cInsatiable\u201d will be released on Friday. Is it really as offensive as the trailer has led many to believe? Here, Eleanor Stanford and Aisha Harris, TV editors at The New York Times, discuss the first season. Major spoilers follow.I don\u2019t want to discount Ms. Gussis\u2019s experience, because I know Patty\u2019s story of her physical transformation is partly inspired by her own life. But I was so confused by what this show thought about the relationship between outward appearance and personality. Almost every episode finds Patty declaring, in the voice-over narration, that being thin doesn\u2019t matter after all because she\u2019s still evil inside. Tonally, it seemed to be going for the subversive wit of \u201cMean Girls\u201d but instead landed closer to \u201cFamily Guy\u201d \u2014 empty, scattershot provocation for its own sake. And what in the world was that scene in which Patty and the random trans woman we never see again commiserate over body dysmorphia in the bathroom?You also raise something I keep coming back to as I think about this show: the tonal whiplash. In a promotional teaser for the show, Ms. Gussis says \u201cthere are moments of broad comedy, and also moments where you cry.\u201d But bouncing from marginalization played for laughs to tender, emotion-driven moments frayed my nerves. There were some well-written moments: a conversation about coming out as gay as an adult, a first kiss between two best friends, a wife struggling to find her identity outside of her marriage. But viewers have to wade through too much absurd plot and incoherent moral messaging to find the rare meaningful moments, and I don\u2019t think many will make it.Frequently, Patty\u2019s inner monologue sounded like a middle schooler, not a 17-year-old (At one point she muses: \u201cMaybe Pastor Mike was right: With God, all things were possible. I could save my soul and win the crown.\u201d) I was frustrated by the implication that not only did her life not start until she became thin, but also that being fat had kept her in a state of perpetual immaturity, of incompleteness. Maybe this was how Ms. Gussis felt when she was younger, but it translates in this show as a statement of ubiquity. The show\u2019s ongoing obsession with the before and after moments of her weight loss is, I would guess, one of many nods to the makeover rom-coms of the \u201980s and \u201990s, but c\u2019mon. Haven\u2019t we moved past that tired construct yet? Did you also find the show felt weirdly dated, rather than nostalgic?I agree that there are some charming and moderately successful moments in the show, but they come way too late, and I wouldn\u2019t call them redeeming, either. I liked Nonnie\u2019s slow progression toward self-discovery about her sexuality in the later episodes, which leads to some heartfelt and honest moments about fluidity. But before you get to that, you have her being weird and borderline predatory toward a somehow oblivious Patty \u2014 her lifelong best friend, remember \u2014 like when she convinces Patty to re-enact an intimate moment she had with someone else, so Nonnie can feel her up.The tone is equally off in the way it handles subjects as delicate as revenge porn and domestic abuse \u2014 which brings me to the last few episodes and Christian, the bad boy. As the show goes on, his obsession with Patty takes on an unhealthy tenor; he refuses to accept that she no longer wants to be with him, stalks her (and attempts to follow her with a GPS tracking device), and at one point even shoves Nonnie for standing up to him. Yet all any of the characters do, including Patty, is acknowledge that he\u2019s being abusive and then shrug it off (except for Brick, who gets to play hero every time Christian shows up where he\u2019s not wanted).And this is all without getting into the ending, when Christian kidnaps Magnolia, stuffs her into a trunk and then tells Patty she has to kill her. I don\u2019t even know what to do with that.Advertisement"}

On the whole, it\u2019s a surprisingly O.K. addition to the genre. Directed by David M. Rosenthal from a script by Brooks McLaren, it begins the way several apocalyptic movies used to end \u2014 with the discovery of a pregnancy.A young lawyer, Will (Theo James, whom I last saw as a charming robot in the sci-fi romance \u201cZoe,\u201d now streaming on Amazon Prime), and his fianc\u00e9e, Samantha, who both live in Seattle, find out that they\u2019re expecting right before Will is set to meet with his future father-in-law, Tom (Forest Whitaker). Tom lives in Chicago and sure wishes his daughter still lived there, too. A decorated military man, now retired, he has a forceful way of making his opinions known to Will. Their Chicago dinner does not go well, despite the intervention of Tom\u2019s wife, Paula (Nicole Ari Parker).The next day, while Will is recounting the dinner to Samantha over FaceTime, there\u2019s a huge noise in Seattle. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says, and the line goes dead. Soon, flights are canceled, power grids are down, and nobody knows what\u2019s going on. Her father decides to pack up the Cadillac S.U.V. and head West, and Will can come with him or not.As it happens, down the long road they must travel, the prevailing rule is survival of the most heavily armed. They pick up a female Native American auto mechanic along the way, but her survival smarts, and her ethics, run up against the increasing atavism they encounter. For Tom and Will, it\u2019s simple: They have to get to Samantha, despite not knowing whether or not she\u2019s alive. Along the way, Will picks up more than a little of Tom\u2019s ruthlessness as they move forward, never piecing together whether what\u2019s happening was caused by an act of war, a seismic event or something else. It\u2019s during the middle section of endless dark roads and run-ins with gas pirates that the movie builds a most convincing sense of dread.The opposing factions are male dominated in the worst ways. There\u2019s a gang rape, and at a crucial point one of the young men in Custance\u2019s party announces that he\u2019s making the older man\u2019s daughter his consort (that is, sex slave), and that Custance can either accept it or take a bullet. And there\u2019s not a single pretty frame in the movie. It\u2019s unfortunately very convincing. I doubt that in real life, when the party\u2019s over, anyone surviving will have much opportunity to enjoy a view.That\u2019s the thing with futuristic movies: They seem to never be pleasant. \u201cAnon,\u201d a Netflix Original that had its premiere just before the start of the summer, depicts a future in which you see the world, literally, via the intervention of the internet. That is, we humans walk around with an embedded eyepiece that not only records all we do, but also displays giant ads in front of buildings, lets us see how a watch in a shop\u2019s window looks on our wrists, lets us instantly buy that watch if we like it, and more and more and more. It also tells us who everyone we see on the street is.Except for one afternoon, when the lead character, Sal Frieland (cute name), played by Clive Owen, sees a striking young woman (Amanda Seyfried) whose face brings up an error message. This discovery coincides with a series of murders committed by an unknown person who\u2019s somehow able to \u201cswitch\u201d the eye on the victims, recording their deaths from the killer\u2019s point of view. Is there a connection? Sal, who happens to be a detective, thinks so, and goes undercover to lure the woman he saw on the street, who eventually answers to the name \u201cAnon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

In June, AT&T completed its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, which includes HBO, Warner Bros. and the Turner cable networks.\u201cThey look at Otter as strategically key to several things they are trying to do, including serving customers with every type of content delivered through every possible distribution channel,\u201d Mr. Chernin said of AT&T, which has been a minority investor in Otter since its founding in April 2014.Tony Goncalves, Otter\u2019s chief executive, declined to say whether Otter was profitable.

Otter will give AT&T more digital advertising inventory to sell the same way.But the Chernin Group had a theory. \u201cWith every new wave of technology, great new brands emerge, and we wanted to own those brands,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cThey certainly weren\u2019t going to be incubated inside the large media companies,\u201d where they would have to compete for resources.Mr. Chernin declined to comment on the speculation. He said, however, \u201cI think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands.\u201dAbout six years remain on that deal, Mr. Chernin said.

Here are some winners, losers and survivors as Hollywood\u2019s summer wraps up.Box-office watchers were agog when \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d (made for $30 million) put up second-weekend numbers that were virtually the same as its $26 million opening weekend. That sort of hold is unicorn-rare in Hollywood, and taken in concert with the record-breaking business posted by \u201cBlack Panther\u201d earlier this year, it ought to serve as ample proof that there is a financial upside to reflecting the world as it actually looks.Another lesson that I hope Hollywood will learn from the success of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d is that audiences are starved for a good romantic comedy. The genre that minted stars like Reese Witherspoon and Sandra Bullock has fallen into disrepair: As studios began squeezing midbudget movies out of summer slates stocked with expensive superhero movies and dirt-cheap horror entries, the rom-com was first to go.No one expected \u201cSolo,\u201d an origin story for the iconic space smuggler once played by Harrison Ford, to perform this badly, and the film\u2019s foreign take was similarly weak: Though the 2016 stand-alone \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d made $523 million overseas without any recognizable leads, \u201cSolo\u201d sputtered out at $179 million.

Usually, that sector is in great shape if even one documentary becomes a hit; this summer, there were three.First, \u201cRBG\u201d told the story of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to great success, grossing nearly $14 million, an enormous personal best for its distributor, Magnolia Pictures. In June, the Fred Rogers documentary \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?\u201d became an even bigger success. It has drawn $22 million so far, the best a nonconcert or non-nature documentary has fared in more than five years. Yet the Rogers movie didn\u2019t cannibalize the market: Just weeks after it was released, Neon put out the twisty \u201cThree Identical Strangers,\u201d which has also passed the all-important $10 million mark at the box office.Given these results, will real people become summer-movie stalwarts just like superheroes? While it\u2019s certainly a boom time for documentaries, I\u2019d point out that the three that broke through were not unlike the sort of viral videos that flourish on social media: \u201cThree Identical Strangers\u201d feels like a \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it\u201d Buzzfeed post come to life, while the trailers for \u201cRBG\u201d and \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?\u201d play very much like those feel-good montages that can rack up millions of shares on Facebook. Documentaries may be big business right now, but only if the films feel like something you could click on.Not even the summer films themselves could offer the darkly comic twists and turns of MoviePass. The disruptive company made headlines last summer for offering a $9.95 monthly plan letting subscribers see one movie a day, the sort of eyebrow-raising bargain that had people wondering how MoviePass could turn a profit.Indeed, as moviegoers began signing up in huge numbers, MoviePass amended the plan nearly a dozen times, struggling to make the company financially feasible instead of a money-bleeding operation. Certain theaters or films would fail to show up on the MoviePass app, depending on who the company was warring with at the time, and blockbusters were increasingly locked out altogether or tagged with a surge fee. This month, MoviePass announced a deal that\u2019s decidedly more limited: Subscribers can now see just three movies per month, and those picks still come with tremendous caveats.Yet if there\u2019s something MoviePass was successful at, it\u2019s demonstrating that people still want to go out and see a movie, even in the age of streaming. They simply want different options other than a single, high-priced ticket, and already, companies like AMC and Sinemia are rushing to fill the gap with new plans. In an era when consumers pony up a monthly fee to access all that Spotify, Netflix or Hulu can provide, why shouldn\u2019t theatrical moviegoing offer a similar subscription model?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Riz Ahmed Acts His Way Out of Every Cultural Pigeonhole", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "From HBO to \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to Shakespeare, he has discovered how to excel beyond tidy genres.He arrived a few minutes late, speed-walking toward me in apologetic haste and grabbing my hand with enthusiasm. He was dressed in a gray kurta-inspired top, black slacks and a perfectly disheveled royal blue jacket with the sleeves rolled to midforearm \u2014 an ensemble that, along with the suede baseball cap pulled low over his eyes, gave him the look of a very well-read semiretired pro skateboarder. Onscreen his presence can be almost comically malleable \u2014 he can come across as pliant or stalwart, frank or cagey \u2014 but in person there is a distinct and direct energy to him, a keenness bubbling under the surface.It comes out not only in how he talks but also in what he talks about. Tribalism, for example, which we explored at length over breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong instinct,\u201d he told me from across the table at a crowded Fort Greene restaurant. \u201cAnd that can be a really healthy instinct. The organization of marginalized groups relies on tribalism, to some extent. If you\u2019re trying to move uphill against injustice, I can understand that. But when you\u2019re already at the top of the mountain, tribalism is just a way of [expletive] on people and excluding them from power.\u201dOr the Mughal Empire, with which he has found himself low-key obsessed of late, and on which he just might, if you\u2019re open to it, deliver a full-throated disquisition. \u201cUnder the Mughals, you have this multicultural empire, which is basically Muslims, Hindu majority, and there\u2019s a certain pragmatism that comes from ... \u201d \u2014 here he stopped, midthesis, to re-form his thoughts \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a mongrel empire, it\u2019s a multicultural empire, and they intermarry between Hindus and Muslims. It\u2019s like a pragmatism emerges when you have to abandon the idea of purity or a monolith, where it\u2019s like, we just present things as they are. Then you start getting realistic depictions as opposed to idealized depictions. ... \u201dOn an intellectual flight like this, Ahmed seems self-assured, fueled by his knowledge and his quest for more of it. There are other moments when he feels, still, completely powerless. Like when it emerges that people are calling him a Renaissance man \u2014 which, of course, he hates. But why? He does, in fact, excel at a lot of different things. He has become a go-to actor for unique secondary characters in Hollywood spectacles, like the \u201cStar Wars\u201d film \u201cRogue One,\u201d the Jason Bourne film \u201cJason Bourne\u201d and the forthcoming Marvel film \u201cVenom.\u201d He has won an Emmy for his devastating lead role as an American Muslim railroaded by the criminal-justice system in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d in which he mesmerized audiences with his evolution from delicate na\u00efvet\u00e9 to delicate violence without ever seeming to change the expression on his face. Hollywood appears to be fully buying in: In addition to \u201cVenom,\u201d Ahmed stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, John C. Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the macabre western comedy \u201cThe Sisters Brothers,\u201d opening this month; he is in preproduction for the title role in a \u201cHamlet\u201d adaptation that will appear on Netflix; and he has created and sold the sweeping multigenerational immigrant-epic series \u201cEnglistan\u201d to the BBC, with preproduction set to begin soon.As if that weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s also one half of the critically acclaimed, if niche, rap duo Swet Shop Boys and a solo artist whose 2006 song \u201cPost 9/11 Blues,\u201d released in the wake of the 7/7 attacks in London, was banned by some English radio stations for being too controversial. He is an Oxford graduate, a classically trained actor and maybe the only person I\u2019ve ever seen recite a poem on an American late-night show to thunderous applause. The poem, called \u201cSour Times,\u201d was delivered two nights after Heather Heyer was killed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., and it sparked a miniwar on the Facebook page for \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d over whether Fallon was divisive for introducing politics into his show.This is another thing Ahmed takes issue with: being called political. \u201cA lot of mainstream movies, they\u2019re steeped in their perspective,\u201d he told me. \u201cEvery story, every decision, who you prioritize, what your perspective is. That\u2019s what your politics is.\u201d He wonders too why some artists have their work labeled political while others don\u2019t. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to express yourself authentically, doing that becomes somehow perceived as a struggle, as picking a fight. When really I\u2019m just going from A to B. It\u2019s like Ferris Bueller\u2019s going from A to B.\u201dI ask him what that means.\u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s just lawless out here, man!\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just a white dude skipping class and being lawless.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell him, \u201cI see what you\u2019re saying.\u201d And then I repeat the sentence, word for word, because it\u2019s not true: I don\u2019t actually see what he\u2019s saying. It will be at least 24 hours before I see what he\u2019s saying.At Merchant Taylors\u2019 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the face of \u2014 well, wait. Ahmed pauses here, breaking the flow of our interview, his voice dropping half an octave: He\u2019s conscious of the fact that he\u2019s told these stories before, and he doesn\u2019t want to bore me, or come across like ... you know. Not at all, I remind him, but he pauses before going on \u2014 he found himself among a wave of Asian kids changing the formerly white face of private education. There he witnessed and experienced racism from students and teachers. \u201cThe teacher would be talking about evolution and would just wander over and stand next to the one black kid in class, gesturing to him.\u201d It made an impression. He also found himself immersed in the stuffy, old-white-man literature that would, against his better judgment, affect him forever. Literature like the now corny World War I poems he had to study, about \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land,\u201d the empty, apocalyptic, unclaimed space between enemy trenches where no humans belonged. Verses like:That kind of stuff, likewise, stuck with him.He also had inspirational teachers who encouraged his talent and curiosity and, I\u2019m guessing, insatiable energy. Teachers like Mr. Roseblade, whom Ahmed describes as seeming, even at the time, like something out of an inspirational high school movie: \u201cHe was this Jewish guy from the north, this English teacher who spoke Punjabi. He just took a lot of those kids under his wing and made us realize, like: \u2018Look, you\u2019ve got to get these credits. You\u2019ve got to go and join the debating society. Otherwise, you ain\u2019t gonna be able to get into a good university. Because you\u2019re not on the rugby team, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019\u2009\u201dLast year, many years removed from Mr. Roseblade\u2019s class, Ahmed found himself standing before the House of Commons, having been selected to deliver the second annual Channel 4 lecture on diversity in media. In his speech, clear and eloquent, he delivered a warning. Either let English people like him participate fully in English society, or they might just go do it with ISIS. \u201cIn the mind of the ISIS recruit, he\u2019s a version of James Bond, right?\u201d Ahmed asked the assembled members. \u201cHave you seen some of those ISIS propaganda videos? They are cut like action movies. Where is the counternarrative? Where are we telling these kids that they can be heroes in our stories, that they are valued?\u201d In watching the footage, something struck me about it: Ahmed was using the word \u201cwe\u201d to describe the country that colonized his ancestors.\u201c\u2009\u2018We\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 changes and shifts constantly,\u201d he conceded when I asked him about it. \u201cThat was my biggest experience going to Merchant Taylors\u2019. Extreme code switching. The most confusing conversation is to have to talk about the colonization of our continents.\u201d We laughed a little at the ridiculousness of sentences like \u201cwe colonized us,\u201d or \u201cwe took us into slavery.\u201d But then his face turned serious. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are. We are the inheritors of the scars of Empire, but also the spoils of Empire. And that kind of inside/outside state is totally ingrained in us. Which is why, at a time like now, where everybody\u2019s being asked to pick a side, everything is binary, it\u2019s a confusing time to be us.\u201dWe were sharing food, which he had all but insisted on. I had been a tad unsure about it, not certain that it was entirely professional to be digging into a subject\u2019s meal minutes after we met. But he seemed hampered by no such considerations. \u201cGet in there, bro,\u201d he said, gesturing to his plate in between discussions of whether or not people of color can be gentrifiers (his black female optician did not think so) and whether or not N.W.A. was, by any definition, \u201cconscious rap\u201d (an argument can be made, perhaps). I felt aware of a duality. On one hand, I was a professional reporter, trying my best to look as if I belonged where I was, doing what I was doing: sharp questions, clear thinking, research prepared. On the other hand, I was a black American man hanging out with a British-Pakistani man in a white cafe in what used to be a black neighborhood, chopping it up at a high level. On the third hand, I was a writer for a national magazine sharing a platform with an international film star while we talked about all the serpentine machinations of oppression and how they\u2019ve woven and buried themselves in the very flesh of our lives. To dig haphazardly into his plate of quinoa or not?Instead, we were interrupted by something else. Beside us on the road there appeared a battered black jeep, on monster tires, with huge steer horns glued to either side of the hood. And a shark\u2019s fin coming from the roof. And radioactivity stickers. And what seemed like a thousand headlights. And a personalized license plate that read \u201cMOVE AWAY.\u201d And while I was thinking, \u201cLOL, New York, amirite? Back to my interview,\u201d Ahmed was saying, \u201cPete\u201d \u2014 our driver\u2019s name, which he had clearly made a point of remembering \u2014 \u201cpull up next to him, and let\u2019s see exactly who this is. Let\u2019s have a little chat quickly.\u201d Pete obliged.We pulled up, only to find the vehicle was being driven by an Orthodox Jew.\u201cWhoa!\u201d we said, all three of us, at precisely the same time. None of us saw that coming.Now Ahmed had to talk to him.Man: \u201cI chase them.\u201dMore was revealed. The man was French. He\u2019d been in the States for five years, along with his brother. They were children\u2019s entertainers, performers and low-key stuntmen and were in the process of making a kids\u2019 DVD that was based, somehow, on this Zombie Proof jeep. (Their act is called \u201cThe Twins From France,\u201d and they are available for bar mitzvahs.)After the light turned green and we\u2019d gone our separate ways, Ahmed was glowing, bouncing and rocking in the back seat. \u201cNone of you expected that!\u201d he was yelling. \u201cNone of you expected it!\u201d He seemed to consider the incongruousness of the whole scene something of a personal victory.And he was right: I was not expecting it. I was quietly thinking about how sure I\u2019d been that, if we pulled up alongside that truck, I\u2019d see, somewhere on its body or its driver, a Confederate flag.As we crawled through Midtown traffic, the conversation turned to music, a topic by which Riz Ahmed is perpetually enchanted, and as he schooled me on the history of the U.K. garage and jungle scenes, I watched him transform from a political thinker to an excited dorm-room music bro. He made me listen to the track he claims was most seminal to his entire worldview: \u201cOriginal Nuttah,\u201d by Shy FX featuring UK Apachi. It is a song better heard than described. Suffice it to say that in the early 1990s, British-Jamaicans started singing reggae melodies and rocking the mic over absurdly sped-up beats, and the results were as manic as they were marvelous. Except UK Apachi was not Jamaican. His father was Iraqi, and his mother was Indian and South African. Abdul Wahab was a British Muslim who grew up getting called \u201cPaki\u201d and eventually aligned himself with whatever his conception was of Native Americans to create a persona doing British-Jamaican music. And it was fire.Dunham took an interest in the actor after seeing his performances in \u201cThe Night Of\u201d and in \u201cFour Lions,\u201d a dark comedy about a group of men trying, ineptly, to commit an act of terrorism; she calls it \u201cas iconic and cozy a comedy as \u2018Wedding Crashers.\u2019\u2009\u201d Ahmed, she says, takes his work seriously: \u201cHe\u2019s such an academic.\u201d She remembers how, in preparation for his time on \u201cGirls,\u201d he researched surfing, scouted the Montauk area and used an American accent through all five days of shooting. \u201cThen at the end we wrapped, and he was, like, \u2018Alroight, bruv, see you lata, bruv,\u2019 back into his rude-boy deal. And people felt, like, betrayed \u2014 like, \u2018We partied with him, we danced with him, we went out for lobster with him, he spoke in an American accent the whole time!\u2019\u2009\u201d She also tells me about the time she fell ill, and he left a dinner with \u2014 she thinks \u2014 like, Salman Rushdie, just to sit by her hospital bed and talk until she fell asleep. \u201cHe\u2019s a very tenderhearted person,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to forget, because he has the bravado of someone in the hip-hop world and the intensity of someone who\u2019s an activist.\u201dWe had come to the Met because, in addition to being a rapper and an actor and a budding producer, Ahmed has also been spending his Sundays in one-on-one study sessions with Navina Haidar, a curator in the Met\u2019s department of Islamic art. She led us upstairs, past various security doors and card scanners and cloistered offices into a small, cool conference room. The walls were lined with reproductions of Islamic art from eras spanning the last thousand years. While we waited to begin, Ahmed stepped out for a moment, and Haidar confided in me about why she agreed to spend her Sundays talking art with this particular movie star. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, a moral core. And he\u2019s intellectually very active and quite creative, and curious and very dedicated to what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Ahmed returned, but she didn\u2019t stop; instead, she just turned her praise to him. \u201cIt\u2019s been very impressive to see how you have been really dedicated to wanting to learn about this, and to have these tutorials, and really explore the subject in depth. That commitment, I think, is really inspiring for me as a curator.\u201d Ahmed kept his eyes down, scanning the page in front of him, while she lavished him with praise, and then, when she was done, said: \u201cShe\u2019s a G.\u201dSometime around 1600, in the Ottoman court of what is now Turkey, a book was created. Perhaps it is better described as an album. In fact, it is often called the Bellini Album, after the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini, who served as a point of cultural connection between Venice and the Ottoman Empire and whose portrait of Mehmet II hangs in the National Gallery in London. (He also created an image of \u201cthe East\u201d for \u201cthe West\u201d and as such was, in a sense, ground zero for Orientalism.) The complete origins of the Bellini Album are not entirely known. Experts suggest it cannot be attributed to Bellini himself but speculate it was so named because of the European art scattered throughout, some of which was once rumored to be Bellini\u2019s work.The album is, in essence, a scrapbook, each page featuring a form or piece of art, from sources all over the Ottoman Empire and beyond \u2014 Persian calligraphy, an ink-and-watercolor goose attributed to China, collages of devotional scenes attributed to Italy and the Netherlands. On one page, you find a painting of a person falling into a well; on another, a peacock whose tail is actually calligraphy, and whose calligraphy is actually a poem. There is even a page on which the disembodied head of Jesus appears on what may be the Veil of Veronica. Each page is itself a meditation on adornment, with the image in the center hemmed by borders of intricate flowers and the detailed marbling of lapis lazuli and rose. All of it without an owner, all of it a mashup of something prior. If visual symbology were music, then the Bellini Album would be a mixtape.What made that transition particularly tough for Ahmed was that, in the \u201990s, it seemed to him that British South Asians were enjoying a kind of aspirational freedom. The economy was good. It was O.K. to live well. The South Asian sketch-comedy show \u201cGoodness Gracious Me\u201d was enjoying huge success. South Asian culture was rippling into U.K. music, as well, in genres like bhangra and jungle and with pop acts like Cornershop. There was something of a multicultural moment for British South Asians. Growing up, Ahmed believed that the flag of Britain should and would obviously include him.But he soon found himself at Oxford University, just after 9/11 \u2014 a brown kid surrounded by the acolytes of seemingly ancient white wealth, who sometimes did have a way of talking to him as if he were a shopkeeper. Rather than retreating into Oxford, he decided to make Oxford come to him. He started organizing parties that celebrated his music and cultural touchstones, parties where he would get on the mic over drum \u2019n\u2019 bass records. Soon enough, the event he co-founded, \u201cHit and Run,\u201d moved to Manchester and became one of the city\u2019s leading underground music events. Ahmed also performed as a vocalist with a 12-member jazz/electro/drum \u2019n\u2019 bass ensemble called \u201cConfidential Collective.\u201dHe invited me back to the apartment he was subletting in Fort Greene, in a spacious brownstone with hardwood floors and sunny high ceilings. There was at least one other roommate floating around. It seemed strange to think that Riz Ahmed had just found a room sublet on Craigslist, or whatever, but that seemed to be the case. He wanted me to hear music \u2014 not the music he was making, necessarily, but the music he was thinking about, that was inspiring him.He also looked for connections between the two of us, adroitly comparing and contrasting the black American experience and the British-Pakistani one. The quest for him, it seemed, was to prove that although people have a hard time seeing certain things as connected, reality has a much more expansive view. \u201cHis thing\u201d is to make everything his thing. Or perhaps that\u2019s not quite right: He is not out to co-opt the world to him. Rather, he is looking to elbow out a space for himself in the world, to prove that it should exist.I asked him what kind of art he liked the most in the Islamic collection. It was not the meticulously crafted objects, carved by hand, floral patterns seeming to move as fluids, and it wasn\u2019t the deeply attentive nature drawings, each barb of the feather\u2019s vane painted with microscopic care, sometimes by a brush made, according to legend, with a single hair. These he found beautiful. But they were not his favorites; the miniatures were. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my own weird way of looking at things,\u201d he told me at the museum, \u201cbut what I really appreciate about lots of miniatures and lots of things like this is, you get a God\u2019s-eye view. You get the schematic.\u201d Details are nice. But for him the best way to see anything is to see everything.In an odd way it made me reflect on \u201cCashmere,\u201d the first LP from Ahmed\u2019s Swet Shop Boys project. (His opposite number in that duo, Himanshu Suri, is from Queens, and sounds like it; Ahmed is from London, and sounds like it; and yet somehow they also sound like they\u2019re from South Asia, only by way of Jamaica, and also by way of a sweat-filled Brixton rave in 1999, and finally by way of a musty bedroom, a lone red lamp, a laptop and a severe lack of sleep.) On this album, Ahmed wrote a song, \u201cHalf Moghul Half Mowgli,\u201d the title perhaps a reference to the British-Indian singer Susheela Raman\u2019s 2003 fusion track \u201cHalf Shiva Half Shakti.\u201d In it, he delivers three verses mostly about not quite fitting in anywhere \u2014 or, depending on how you look at it, fitting in just a little everywhere.The first two are straightforward evocations of his past: \u201cMy only heroes were black rappers/So to me, Tupac was a true Paki.\u201d On the third, though, he does something different. He addresses himself from four different perspectives, four different ways he is interpreted and received, attacked and praised. First there\u2019s the grateful South Asian fan (\u201cOur young ones need someone like you to look up to\u201d). Then he embodies the voice of someone calling him a \u201cterrorist Paki\u201d and a weak rapper. Then comes a young rap fan, saluting him in a mix of Asian and Caribbean argots (\u201cSalaam, wagwan bruv\u201d) and says \u201cbecause of you I went to uni\u201d \u2014 and, last, a disgruntled elder who warns him that he\u2019s going to hell \u201cfor the sex and the swearing\u201d and should obey the Quran. All of this in one dizzying verse, each voice rushing in to replace the last.The first time I heard this, it struck me so deeply that I paused the song and sat quietly. The verse was simple: It was just four different ways people look at you. But the reason it unraveled something so deeply inside of me was that it also represented four different ways you can look at yourself. All completely opposite one another, and completely isolated, and yet completely validated by the world you live in. And when there are so many versions of self, maybe the only way to maintain safety is to develop a view that can see, literally, everything.A few weeks later, we met in Boston. Ahmed was running late, having spent all day on the set of the forthcoming film \u201cThe Sound of Metal.\u201d In it, he plays a rock drummer who is losing his hearing. He had been learning sign language, practicing drumming and, as he does, just generally molding himself into the role \u2014 or rather, accessing the part of him that already was the role.Ahmed is still doing independent films, because he loves the genre, loves the work. But he is also hoping for bigger and bigger opportunities. He has talked about playing James Bond, if for no other reason than the sense of arrival such a casting would represent \u2014 an acceptance of the fact that Riz Ahmed, in all his contradictory glory, is in no way a contradiction. He is a human and a Brit and capable of being seen as a hero.Advertisement"}

Yet he added, \u201cIf we were to do our mission well, we are to think seriously about how to do more in China.\u201dThe problem is Monsanto\u2019s signature weedkiller, Roundup:\u25a0 A California jury awarded a terminally ill groundskeeper $289 million because of his exposure to the product.\u25a0 California\u2019s Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal to have its main ingredient removed from a list of carcinogens.The good news, says Bayer, is that it\u2019s prepared to fight, and can now become \u201cactively involved\u201d in the legal cases. It\u2019s unclear whether that will stem the flood of red ink from one of the most immediately value-destructive takeovers in recent memory.To be clear, that number is 168,000, and Fidelity has 16.1 million customers. But it\u2019s another sign of the U.S.\u2019s relative economic health. (One more: Fewer Americans are borrowing from their retirement savings.)As worries grow that the stock market\u2019s hot streak will end soon, however, so should fears of that paper wealth largely evaporating, as it has done in previous transitions from boom to bust.More from Natasha Singer of the NYT:\u201cIt has essentially weaponized ad technology designed for consumer products and services,\u201d said Sarah Golding, the president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, an industry organization in Britain.

{"Headline": "Norm Macdonald, Still in Search of the Perfect Joke", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "FeatureHe has won a cult following by playing the wise fool, but his comedic ambitions are much greater than that. If he could only hold down a job.Supported byMacdonald used to linger after his nightclub performances to talk to fans, he explained, but the stalker made him stop. She lived in Florida and was convinced that they\u2019d been conducting a secret affair for decades. Her psychiatrist contacted Macdonald\u2019s manager to warn that she might be planning to harm him. His manager did not write down the psychiatrist\u2019s number, though, so Macdonald learned only that she was out there, somewhere in Florida. Later, when his manager offered him some Florida dates, Macdonald cited her as a reason not to go. His manager dismissed this concern.\u201cThat loony tunes?\u201d Norm recalled him saying. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the point!\u201d Macdonald protested. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play chess with her.\u201dBy all outward appearances, stand-up is thriving. The number of shows and specials, as well as the critical attention devoted to them, has reached heights not seen since the 1980s. This rising tide has also lifted Macdonald, who is still best known for anchoring the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d from 1994 until January 1998, when he was fired during the Christmas hiatus \u2014 not by the show\u2019s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, but by the NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer. The reason has always been a subject of debate. The popular explanation was that Ohlmeyer, who died in 2017 and was a close friend of O.J. Simpson\u2019s, resented a string of jokes about Simpson\u2019s murder trial that continued long after the former football star was acquitted.In retrospect, the Simpson trial was eerily suited to Macdonald\u2019s sense of humor, in that it centered on an assumption widely held but politely denied. While the news media was obliged to withhold judgment, Macdonald gave voice to the popular belief that Simpson was guilty, delivering joke after joke about how he was obviously a murderer. Macdonald made the number and intensity of these jokes a kind of gag in itself, even after he left \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Hosting ESPN\u2019s Espy Awards one month after he was fired, he congratulated Charles Woodson on winning the Heisman Trophy: \u201cThat is something that no one can ever take away from you,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you kill your wife and a waiter.\u201dHis refusal to stop saying things like that on TV fits his image, among his fans, as a comedian who prioritizes the joke above all else \u2014 even his career. Since \u201cS.N.L,\u201d that career has been aesthetically pleasing but commercially uneven. The dedicated fan will identify two patterns in his television work: It is invariably funny, and it is invariably canceled. His longest-running show, the sitcom \u201cNorm,\u201d aired on ABC between 1999 and 2001. \u201dA Minute With Stan Hooper\u201d was canceled after six episodes. \u201cSports Show With Norm Macdonald\u201d lasted nine. He also played the KFC mascot Colonel Sanders in a handful of commercials.Mostly, he does nightclub comedy. He estimates he was on the road 44 weeks last year \u2014 a grueling schedule for a 58-year-old man who doesn\u2019t drink and describes himself as never having been \u201cpromiscuous.\u201d Between his stand-up, his short-lived but distinctive TV projects and a series of memorable appearances on late-night talk shows, he has captured an audience that is dedicated and, in many cases, influential. Jon Stewart described him to me as \u201ca master of stand-up\u201d; David Letterman, who is credited as \u201cspecial counsel\u201d on Macdonald\u2019s new show and helped sell it to Netflix, likened him to a \u201cpitcher with five out pitches.\u201d\u201cIn my mind, I\u2019m just a stand-up,\u201d Macdonald said at brunch, interrupting his thought to thank the waitress for bringing his eggs. He is scrupulously polite. In conversation, he seems to make a point of following other people\u2019s remarks with notes of encouragement, saying \u201cthat\u2019s interesting\u201d or \u201cexactly right.\u201d Even on the set of his own show, he speaks quietly, almost to the point of diffidence. He looms at over six feet, though, and he has that voice \u2014 flat but resonant, drawn, the comedy version of Buffalo Bill in \u201cSilence of the Lambs.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut other people don\u2019t think that. They go, oh, the guy from \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 is doing stand-up now.\u201dTwo decades later, he has yet to recapture the fame he enjoyed when he left that show. To his thinking, though, he has moved steadily closer to his own ideal of what comedy can or should be. Macdonald speaks often about a kind of Platonic form of a joke whose punch line is identical to its setup. He feels he came close in 1995 on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d: \u201cJulia Roberts told reporters this week that her marriage to Lyle Lovett has been over for some time,\u201d he said, as a picture of the country singer\u2019s asymmetrical face appeared behind him. \u201cThe key moment, she said, came when she realized that she was Julia Roberts, and that she was married to Lyle Lovett.\u201dAt that time, Macdonald was better known for shocking punch lines than for elegant writing, although the elements of his mature approach were already in place. Over the last two decades, he has grown more devoted to the pure joke, even as comedy has turned away from it. Contemporary stand-up increasingly positions the comedian either as a relatable personality whom audiences can follow from role to role or as a righteous truth-teller. Macdonald is neither. He is resolutely nonpolitical in an industry bent on producing new versions of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d an ironist working on the same platform as \u201cNanette.\u201d At a moment when comedians work for applause as much as laughter, by being vulnerable, honest, outspoken, socially relevant, Macdonald is still pursuing the laugh \u2014 and nothing more. This anachronistic approach might be limiting his audience, but it could also explain his enduring appeal, because it lends him a kind of moral authority. He is something like a comedy ascetic, demanding a purity that temporal jokes cannot achieve. He seems vital and transgressive again, but pushing 60, he also seems tragic. One thing that makes him a captivating figure onstage is the tension between his refusal to do material about himself and the sympathy you feel for a craftsman who has not been rewarded in proportion to his talent.At brunch, he cited the \u201970s stand-up Robert Klein as saying that when he started, there were 50 stand-ups, and five were funny; suddenly, there were 500 comedians, and five were funny. Macdonald thinks the dynamic Klein described has continued apace, and now the ratio is something like 500,000 to five. He rejected the idea that he was just getting older. \u201cI don\u2019t understand abstract art, but I\u2019m not stupid enough to think it\u2019s worthless,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think comedy, though, is that complicated.\u201dMacdonald is not an anti-comic. He despises anti-comedy, but that has not stopped people from mistaking his work for it, sometimes to his benefit. In 1992, after touring the clubs of his native Canada for the better part of a decade \u2014 including a four-month stint opening for Sam Kinison in 1984 \u2014 he moved to Los Angeles. There, he heard from another comic that Dennis Miller liked one of his jokes. Macdonald reached out to Miller, who asked him to submit a packet for his new talk show. Macdonald bought a copy of USA Today and went through it article by article, struggling to come up with topical material. He wound up submitting exactly one joke: \u201cJeffrey Dahmer went on trial today for murdering and cannibalizing 15 men. But I don\u2019t like his chances after hearing what his defense strategy is going to be: They started it.\u201d Miller hired him, thinking his single-joke packet was, as Macdonald puts it, \u201csome Andy Kaufman move.\u201d He wrote for several episodes, then joined the writers\u2019 room of \u201cRoseanne\u201d after the titular Barr saw him doing stand-up. The next year, he got a call from Lorne Michaels.None of these details appears in Macdonald\u2019s 2016 book, \u201cBased on a True Story: A Memoir\u201d \u2014 which, despite its title, is actually a novel. It recasts the events of his life as the exploits of a drug-addled sociopath desperately recycling the same joke about answering machines. (The joke, mentioned repeatedly, is never revealed.) This kind of strategic withholding is a central element of Macdonald\u2019s act. Although he is unmistakably intelligent in real life \u2014 Letterman told me he was \u201cmaybe the smartest guy in comedy\u201d \u2014 he likes to establish a position of ignorance and then lecture his audience from it. Jerry Seinfeld described this approach to me as \u201csophisticated dumbness\u201d \u2014 a technique that makes any glimpse of the real Macdonald feel thrilling. In those rare moments when he chuckles at his own joke or otherwise breaks character, we feel a rush of empathy, as though we have caught the playwright watching from the wings.This awareness of an amused Macdonald lurking behind the deadpan Norm is what animates his forays into meta-comedy \u2014 not the smug refusals of anti-comedy, but genuinely funny subversions that exploit what audiences have come to expect from the form. Consider the moth joke. During a now-infamous appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d in 2009, Macdonald told a long joke about a moth who goes to a podiatrist\u2019s office. He described in dramatic terms the moth\u2019s complaints \u2014 from the boss who delighted in exercising power over him, to the aged stranger he once recognized as his wife, to the son that, he feared, he no longer loved. After nearly three minutes of Tolstoyan elaboration, the podiatrist finally says that he sympathizes, but what the moth really needs is a psychiatrist. \u201cWhy on earth did you come here?\u201d he asks. The moth answers, \u201cBecause the light was on.\u201d After delivering this punch line, Macdonald stared at O\u2019Brien, only just perceptibly smirking, while the audience cheered.The moth joke is not a shaggy-dog story, one of those ambling anecdotes with no point. As anti-comedy, the shaggy-dog story congratulates the audience for being in on the absence of a joke. The moth joke resembles a shaggy-dog story structurally, but its wrenching punch line reveals Macdonald\u2019s mastery of craft. \u201cBecause the light was on\u201d is classical. It resolves the tension Macdonald has built up by situating the moth within the dynamics of human psychology and misery, slamming us back into joke territory with a reminder that, actually, it\u2019s just a moth. That\u2019s what makes us laugh, but what makes us cheer is the audacity of telling this joke on network television for three minutes, when you might be expected to use that time to promote your own career.The moth joke rewards a type of person whose lifestyle was not viable 20 years ago: the comedy nerd. Macdonald\u2019s talk-show appearances, previously misremembered as anecdotes or entombed as home VHS recordings, are now collected on YouTube. His 2016 appearance on \u201cConan,\u201d in which he plugged his book for 30 seconds and spent the next three and a half minutes doing Catskills-style jokes about how his wife was \u201ca real battle-ax,\u201d has over 1.5 million views. Shareable digital archives have allowed casual Norm fans to become cult Norm fans. YouTube also allowed Macdonald to fulfill what seemed like his destiny in narrowcasting with \u201cNorm Macdonald Live,\u201d a video podcast with the co-host Adam Eget that featured guests like Tom Green and Caitlyn Jenner, which he uploaded directly to the site between 2013 and 2017.That podcast became the proof of concept for his new Netflix show. On a set whose sparseness and simple lighting evoke Charlie Rose, Macdonald interviews a single guest each episode. There is no studio audience, although the crew can periodically be heard laughing in the background. The conversational format reveals the friendly autodidact Macdonald has made a career of hiding. \u201cNorm just kind of twinkles, even when he\u2019s not playing the dumb guy,\u201d Letterman told me. \u201cHe\u2019s deadly funny, he\u2019s incredibly smart, he\u2019s wildly personable and he\u2019s peculiar.\u201dThe program is descriptively titled \u201cNorm Macdonald Has a Show.\u201d It offers to fulfill the promise his book subverted: Here Macdonald will be himself, talking with other celebrities about things that actually happened. There is another way to read that title, though: as fatalistic disillusionment with show business. \u201cMy idea was \u2018The Latest Show,\u2019\u2009\u201d Macdonald told me. \u201cThat\u2019s a clever little title.\u201d Norm Macdonald has a show, and we all know what happens next.Macdonald is a creature of habit, and many of those habits are not conducive to the advancement of his career. He doesn\u2019t go to parties. He doesn\u2019t schmooze. He doesn\u2019t drive, which in Los Angeles is like being confined to an iron lung. He used to live in West Hollywood, which made it easy to drop by the Comedy Store for surprise sets. But now he lives in a planned community with his adult son, Dylan, next to the home he bought for his mother. He\u2019s deep in the wad of office parks and car dealerships near LAX and has to take a hundred-dollar Uber to get to the Comedy Store, so he rarely does. By his own admission, he spends a lot of time at home, going down what he calls \u201crabbit holes\u201d on YouTube or watching sports on television. The night before our dinner, he stayed up until dawn live-tweeting the World Series of Poker.Macdonald\u2019s life seems characterized by routines that shade over into compulsion. He quit drinking as a teenager, after an initial foray into weeklong binges and blackouts. He was a chain smoker before he stopped 10 years ago \u2014 stand-up footage from his youth shows the telltale gesture of index and middle fingers toward mouth \u2014 and he said that, if he found he had a few cigarettes left in the pack around bedtime, he would stay up to finish it. He seems to love carbohydrates; in his dressing room after the taping, I watched him consume the better part of an economy bag of SweeTart Ropes. At the Daily Grill, he ate a heroic amount of bread before telling me he would have done \u201cWeekend Update\u201d forever.\u201cI told Lorne I would hire on like Walter Cronkite, and just take the money as it exists, and never ask for a raise, and just do it until I was 65,\u201d he said. He paused a moment before adding, \u201cHe didn\u2019t like that idea.\u201dAs our pasta arrived, Macdonald said he rejects the O.J. hypothesis and has come to believe that he was fired for his material. \u201cWe were doing experimental stuff, non sequiturs,\u201d he said. \u201cOhlmeyer would watch Leno kill every night for 15 minutes. Every joke, huge laughs, and then I\u2019d do 10 minutes a week and sometimes not get laughs.\u201dAt that time, \u201cS.N.L.\u201d was at a critical and popular nadir \u2014 Macdonald told me of watching in astonishment as the live audience booed the final installment of the \u201cIt\u2019s Pat\u201d sketch \u2014 and the \u201cUpdate\u201d writers were trying to break out of it. He hired Frank Sebastiano, a delivery man who had submitted hundreds of handwritten jokes along with his packages, whom Hoekstra credits with the blunt tone \u201cUpdate\u201d developed during Macdonald\u2019s tenure. (After Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley filed for divorce: \u201cAccording to friends, the two were never a good match. She\u2019s more of a stay-at-home type, and he\u2019s more of a homosexual pedophile.\u201d) Such acerbic jokes felt increasingly at odds with the rest of the show, which was moving toward silly sketches like Cheri Oteri\u2019s cheerleaders and Chris Kattan\u2019s Mango.Macdonald often skipped the curtain call, he said, because it made him feel foolish. \u201cWhen I got \u2018Update,\u2019 I\u2019d just leave right after \u2018Update,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me. How did the rest of the cast feel about that? \u201cEh,\u201d he said, \u201cnot great.\u201d He rarely attended the show\u2019s famous cast parties, either. Instead, he would take the studio-provided limo to Atlantic City and play craps.A six-figure win on one of these trips changed his relationship to gambling forever. Instead of cashing out, he took the chips home in a paper bag and stashed them in his refrigerator. He couldn\u2019t go back to playing $25 craps after that. Macdonald has had long runs of compulsive betting on poker, craps, blackjack and sports book. Although he spoke candidly about his tendency to gamble in problematic ways, he hasn\u2019t quit. At one point he went to Gamblers Anonymous, but he said listening to all those stories about gambling only made him want to gamble more. As the check arrived, he talked about other people\u2019s tales of hitting bottom, losing their houses or their children\u2019s college funds. \u201cI never got close to that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you never went broke?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, I did go broke,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cBut I always had a job, so it was different.\u201dIt is tempting to conclude from this kind of statement that Macdonald is sad. When he says he doesn\u2019t care about money, it must be a mechanism to defend himself from regret over his gambling losses \u2014 because who wouldn\u2019t regret that? Likewise, when he laments the state of contemporary comedy, it is easy to assume he is lamenting the state of his own career. But to make these judgments is to succumb to the fallacy that he values what most people value. Maybe Macdonald really is just in it for the jokes and the admiration of his peers, and what looks by other standards like a series of disappointments is, to him, success enough.It was after 1 in the morning, but Macdonald was amped up. As we drove back to his place, he talked about the Henny Youngman one-liner \u201cTake my wife, please.\u201d Youngman delivered this joke without a pause before the last word, which, Macdonald pointed out, does not make sense. The terminal \u201cplease\u201d is funny because it shifts the meaning of \u201ctake my wife [for example]\u201d to \u201ctake my wife [away from me.]\u201d He wondered whether Youngman intentionally removed the pause to further increase the efficiency of an already stunningly economical joke, or if it became so popular he delivered it as a catchphrase. The latter possibility seemed tragic to him, a joke\u2019s equivalent of death.We stopped in front of his condo, where Macdonald opened the door, put one foot on the curb and talked to me for the next 90 minutes. He talked about how bewildered he felt when he heard that Mo\u2019Nique got $10 million for a Netflix special \u2014 a rumor that the actor and comedian debunked only recently \u2014 when he was paid a fraction of that. He discussed the galling experience of being asked to \u201caudition\u201d for his own comedy special \u2014 \u201cHitler\u2019s Dog, Gossip and Trickery,\u201d released last year \u2014 by having content executives attend one of his performances. (Netflix initially passed on the special, only to reverse its decision later.) He talked about his desire to overcome these kinds of attachments, and the satisfaction he found in working on his next book, a 600-page straight novel that he plans to publish under a pen name. The process was maddeningly difficult, but he liked the way it organized his days. \u201cIf I can not watch sports and not gamble, so much time opens up,\u201d he said.At 58, he said, he was having the disturbing experience of recognizing some of his own opinions as the thinking of an old man. There were new ideas about gender identity that he knew were right but couldn\u2019t quite get his head around. He recounted what Dylan said to him when he broached this subject: \u201cWhy do you always need to feel you understand things?\u201d The question had set him thinking, and he related it to me with a father\u2019s uninhibited pride.Many of these remarks he prefaced with the caveat that he knew he shouldn\u2019t say them in front of a reporter. He couldn\u2019t help it, though; he seemed compelled to speak honestly, the way he once felt compelled to finish a pack of cigarettes at bedtime. He even talked about politics. Mostly, though, he talked about his desire to transcend such things \u2014 current events, popular wisdom, even the quotidian details of his own life \u2014 to operate in the realm of the pure joke, one that\u2019s still funny 100 years from now.\u201cMaking people laugh is a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cPreaching to them is not a gift. There are people who can do that better.\u201d His eyes seemed to glimmer in the light from the dashboard before he completed the thought: \u201cPreachers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This May Be the Most Polarizing Comedy Special of the Year", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyMr. Michael has taken apart the building blocks of stand-up and refashioned them into a fragmented and meditative psychological drama, a sarcastic club set improbably aiming for the feel of the French new wave. The tone is sober, even solemn, and while there are some good comic bits, they serve as a means to create a moody snapshot of the corner of his psyche that specializes in sabotaging relationships. This will seem impossibly pretentious to some, thrillingly subversive to others. (I am the oddball who falls in both camps.)Adding to the degree of difficulty, Mr. Michael\u2019s comedy belongs to the tradition of Dave Chappelle and Louis C.K., making provocative, even reckless arguments while generally keeping you on his side. He aims to give voice to those weird, messed-up thoughts that other people have but keep to themselves.During 49 minutes onscreen, Mr. Michael defends contracting herpes as a life choice: \u201cA lot of my friends got married. I got herpes. At least mine is going to last forever.\u201d He also argues in an aside that \u201cSept. 11 was just Occupy Wall Street done right\u201d and, in a virtuoso bit of comic rhetoric, takes the Freudian theory of the Oedipus complex \u2014 that all men want to sleep with their mothers \u2014 and makes a very funny logical case for it. These are all jokes, it must be said, but subtract the laughs, and they seem less like only jokes. Unlike so many other comics who wallow in their wrongness, Mr. Michael isn\u2019t looking just to create unease. He is fleshing out a character \u2014 his own \u2014 and is doing so by inviting you to look (and laugh) hard at his reasoning and the dark, even ugly side of what\u2019s behind it.Mr. Michael\u2019s central subject is his own failure at romance. Early on, he says he doesn\u2019t know how to make a relationship work, and that all of his follow the same dysfunctional pattern, detailing his phobia of commitment. This is familiar territory for single-guy stand-up, which is partly what justifies his unusual tactics. For while we have seen many comics skewer themselves in ways that slyly let themselves off the hook, Mr. Michael goes further than most to make himself unlikable and his arguments ring hollow.They do have chemistry, and while Mr. Michael is a more limited actor, their flirtation effectively captures those overheated, intense moments of falling in love. When telling jokes, he digs deep into ideas, but with her, he\u2019s guarded, coy, evasive. Alternating with his stand-up, the conversations at first complement and play off the jokes, but then the dialogues comment on, and eventually overwhelm, the comedy. These scenes not only give us another perspective on his thoughts on relationships, but they also refute them, to devastating effect.Mr. Michael has a perpetually adolescent, sardonic attitude, and he subtly mocks his own arrested development with some of his jokes. \u201cRemember when we were kids, and brussels sprouts were the worst thing, and now we all love them,\u201d he said. \u201cSellouts.\u201dMs. Waterhouse\u2019s character tries to match this tone, but it\u2019s a stretch. Their humor operates at different frequencies. Occasionally, in between monologues, a buzzer sounds; that she is wearing a hoodie and he is often pacing only add to the boxing-match mood.You might conclude that these scenes are just a more elaborate way to get at the same old comic self-deprecation. But Mr. Michael is committed to something more than laughs, so much so that some of his choices come at the expense of humor. He wants to use the tools of narrative movies to turn a stand-up persona into something more three-dimensional. And he succeeds more than he should. He hits emotional notes that stand-up rarely does, an impressive feat for a cerebral comic who, by his account, has trouble being vulnerable.This is a heady special whose insight is that intellect divorced from emotional engagement can be corrosive. At the end, Mr. Michael tells the camera that he\u2019s just trying to be honest. Then you hear his girlfriend interject, the camera shifting its focus to her. \u201cThat\u2019s the funniest thing you\u2019ve ever said,\u201d she says.What follows is not a punch line but a punch out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toward a Different Language of Size", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedThe new Netflix series \u201cInsatiable\u201d is putting the spotlight on the issue of fashion sizing once again.On Friday, \u201cInsatiable,\u201d a drama about an overweight, bullied teenager who slims down after a punching incident leaves her with a jaw wired shut, becomes a clich\u00e9d object of desire and proceeds to enact her revenge fantasies on the classmates and society who wronged her, will have its premiere on Netflix. This, despite a flurry of protests from people who feel it \u201cperpetuates not only the toxicity of diet culture, but the objectification of women\u2019s bodies.\u201dWe\u2019ll see if viewers agree, but either way size-ism, and body positivity will be at the center of the conversation once again. And with it, questions of what is valued in society, how women perceive their bodies (and how their bodies are perceived) and how fashion perpetuates the problem by engaging in seemingly illusory, inconsistent and exclusionary sizing that ignores an enormous part of the population, discombobulates the rest and fosters a negative culture of judgment.It\u2019s a fraught, intensely personal discussion. But one way to begin to address it may be to ask whether, as far as the size issue goes \u2014 the way bodies are numerically labeled \u2014 it\u2019s time to rethink the whole thing. After all, as we all know, it long ago ceased to make any sense.\u201cWomen\u2019s sizing is arbitrary,\u201d Janice Wang, the chief executive of Alvanon, a Hong Kong company that uses technology to update fit patterns to adapt to contemporary body types, wrote in an email. \u201cEach size sort of falls within a range of 1 to 1.5 inches, in the smaller sizes, 2 to 2.5 inches in the larger sizes. The range varies depending on the age demographic of a brand, depending on the lifestyle tribes that the brand is aspiring to, depending on the silhouettes of the creative designer.\u201d Wait, 15? Yes. A size that until now did not exist.\u201cWe discovered that between 14 and 16, we were seeing 50 percent more returns than in any other size range,\u201d Ms. Grede said. \u201cSo we started to look at the data and realized that this was the tipping point between missy sizing and plus sizing, and that step change in patterns was too extreme.\u201d So, because there is no absolute in sizing, or has not been since World War II, the women were free to invent it. It took a full year, around eight prototypes and 200 sample women who were measured, tested and assessed.So why not throw out the numerical size scale entirely and replace it with something else? Not throw out the system \u2014 we do need different options. We have different bodies, after all. But jettison what has become poisonous, politicized and generally confusing terminology. The #Droptheplus movement was a beginning, but what if we took it the natural next step? There are lots of potential options for an Esperanto of fit, but the simplest may be to take another cue from math and replace the numbers with the alphabet. Render them variables, which they pretty much are. There\u2019s not a lot of baggage associated with that. \u201cI wear a K\u201d sounds a lot more abstract than, say, \u201cI wear a 10.\u201d I\u2019m a G? It sounds, in many ways, as meaningless as it actually is.Yes, everyone would have to try things on to figure out what actually fits. But we have to do that anyway. At least this way, we\u2019d all know exactly how little we actually knew. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facing Losses, Cond\u00e9 Nast Plans to Put 3 Magazines Up for Sale", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "Anna Wintour is staying, but the once-flush company behind Vogue and The New Yorker lost roughly $120 million last year.Supported byCond\u00e9 Nast, the company behind Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, became one of the most successful magazine publishers by charming readers and advertisers alike with a formula built on old-world glamour and all-American pizazz. But now, even after having taken measures to cut spending and make itself more digitally savvy, the company is expected to adopt a more radical strategy to ensure that it does not fade away.Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., the chief executive of Cond\u00e9 Nast, plans to address senior staff members on Aug. 8. The meeting will come in the wake of an extended visit from Boston Consulting Group, which recently concluded a monthslong examination.It does not promise to be a cheerful gathering. According to more than a dozen current and former Cond\u00e9 Nast executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal matters, the measures instituted at the company over the last decade \u2014 closing Details and the print versions of Self and Teen Vogue; laying off some 80 employees last year; combining the photo and research departments of different magazines \u2014 have not been enough to stem the bleeding.The company lost more than $120 million last year and plans to put three of its 14 magazines \u2014 Brides, Golf Digest and W \u2014 up for sale, three executives said. The marquee titles, including Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, are safe.In a cost-saving measure, the company will also soon begin the process of leasing at least six of its 23 floors at 1 World Trade Center, the Lower Manhattan tower that has been its headquarters since 2015. The New Yorker and Vanity Fair will be among the magazines that will eventually be moved to make room for new tenants.While the company\u2019s troubles are not so severe as those hitting other media organizations in recent days \u2014 the Tronc-owned Daily News lost half its newsroom last month \u2014 they are unsettling to veterans at a company where top editors once had roomy offices designed to their own specifications, the everyday use of chauffeured cars and, for a favored few, no-interest loans to ease the purchases of Manhattan brownstones and even second homes.Some longtime Cond\u00e9 Nast employees are wondering how much of the company\u2019s decline can be attributed to the diminished state of print media and how much is the result of self-inflicted wounds.Contributing to low morale at 1 World Trade was a sense that the company\u2019s leadership was in flux, which resulted partly from a recent spate of articles and items speculating on the future of Ms. Wintour, the editor of Vogue since 1988 and the company\u2019s artistic director. The gossip had it that she was looking to make an exit from Vogue after publishing her next September issue, with Beyonc\u00e9 on the cover.Mr. Sauerberg tried to stifle the chatter on Tuesday, when he released a statement that Ms. Wintour \u201chas agreed to work with me indefinitely in her role as editor in chief, Vogue, and artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast.\u201dIt will take more than corporate stability, however, to reverse the company\u2019s slide.The $120 million loss in 2017 came about because of a sharp decline in ad revenue generated by the print magazines. Gains in the digital arena have helped offset the loss, but not enough to make the company profitable. Cond\u00e9 Nast reached its decision to entertain offers for Brides, Golf Digest and W partly on the recommendation of Boston Consulting Group, the three executives said.Cond\u00e9 Nast declined to comment for this article.John Wagner, who oversees ad spending with publishers at the media agency PHD, questioned the company\u2019s strategy, saying that Cond\u00e9 Nast can be \u201cquick to close things, versus trying to find a solution.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them continue to invest \u2014 keep the brands alive, even if you have to change their rate base or publishing frequency.\u201dExpense budgets, already less than what they were in the days of leisurely lunches, are getting tighter. One publication recently informed its contract writers that their fees had been cut, according to two people at the company.The $120 million loss \u2014 for a publisher once accustomed to hundreds of millions in annual profits \u2014 has put pressure on Mr. Sauerberg, who joined Cond\u00e9 Nast as an executive vice president in 2005 and rose to the top position in 2016.Cond\u00e9 Nast is a subsidiary of a Newhouse company, Advance Publications, which is controlled by Donald Newhouse, 89, and his son, Steven O. Newhouse, 61. Jonathan Newhouse, 65, a cousin of Si, is the chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, home to British Vogue and dozens of other international editions. That arm is something of a corporate oasis, given that Europeans, unlike Americans, have yet to give up the magazine habit.While many of the roughly 30 newspapers in the Newhouse chain have endured layoffs and other cost-saving measures, the Newhouses\u2019 fortunes have not suffered, thanks to the family\u2019s $10.4 billion sale of its cable businesses to Charter Communications in 2016. A provision in the deal gives Advance an additional annual payment of $150 million, cushioning the parent company from any recent losses.Cond\u00e9 Nast has gone through fits and starts as it has sought to revise its corporate identity for the digital age. Dawn Ostroff, the head of Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment, left for Spotify last month with little warning. The company also lost another top lieutenant last month with the exit of Josh Stinchcomb, who oversaw 23 Stories, the company\u2019s in-house advertising unit.The business Ms. Ostroff oversaw, which got its start in 2011, is focused on the development of digital video, film and television projects. It is very much on the rise and will significantly narrow the company\u2019s losses this year, two executives said. Mr. Sauerberg highlighted the division earlier this summer in a companywide email. \u201cWe crossed an important milestone,\u201d he said. \u201cOur web and video businesses have grown so significantly, their revenue surpassed print for the first time in the company\u2019s history.\u201dEach month the company produces an average of 417 videos that play on YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat and its own websites. Some tackle subjects not often associated with Cond\u00e9 Nast. \u201cLast Chance U,\u201d a documentary series focused on college athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds, stands out from the rest. Produced by Cond\u00e9 Nast, it appears on Netflix.The main obstacle, though, has been the loss in print readers and advertising dollars. Circulation continued to fall through May of this year. And as iPhone-entranced pedestrians drifted past newsstands, the company lost more than 20 percent of its ad pages last year, according to figures from the research firm Kantar Media.Starkly designed, with a heavy white border, it featured the actress Melissa McCarthy under the theme, \u201c#the money issue,\u201d hashtag and all. The verdict? A few editors were not impressed, according to several people familiar with the matter. It looked like a facsimile of a magazine, one said.But that same cover elicited a different reaction from younger staff members, who are at a great remove from the company\u2019s mythos.\u201cAwesome!\u201d a young editor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just 21 People Are Known to Have This Rare Genetic Condition. Can You Help Us Find More?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.This is the sixth of the 10 patients I will present here in The New York Times Magazine as part of our collaboration with Netflix, seeking your help. Usually I ask for assistance in making a diagnosis, but this time we are asking for something a little different. Below is the story of a little girl named Kamiyah. She\u2019s 6 years old now. But around the time she turned 1, she began to have strange spells, which can be seen in the video below. As I explain in the story, she now has a diagnosis. But she is the first child to receive a diagnosis of this genetic abnormality from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Undiagnosed Diseases Network. We are looking for others with the same kind of spells. If you recognize Kamiyah\u2019s symptoms \u2014 if you have seen this in someone you know or if this child reminds you of a patient you haven\u2019t been able to find a diagnosis for \u2014 please let us know.The toddler zipped across the room on her hands and knees. She had only recently started crawling and clearly loved the sense of speed and independence that her newfound mobility gave her. Go, baby, go, her mother called out encouragingly. Suddenly the child stopped; her head dipped toward the floor. Her arms bent, lowering her upper body to the floor. Kamiyah? Her mother called out. Baby? She hurried toward where her daughter knelt, head on the floor, eyes closed. But before she got there, the child\u2019s eyes popped open; she lifted her head, straightened her arms and immediately raced across the floor, as if nothing had happened.What was that? the young mother asked her husband. Is that normal? The baby, their first, now seemed fine. Maybe it was O.K., the father suggested. Then it happened again, and again. A total of 10, maybe 20 times in the hours she played on the floor. The mother had never seen anything like it before. Neither had the father. Maybe this was just something that babies did? She had an appointment with her pediatrician in Sioux Falls, S.D., in a couple of weeks. She could ask him then.After that day, the little girl\u2019s mother began to see the strange spells all the time. Sometimes it was so quick that it was almost as if she imagined it. Her beautiful daughter\u2019s eyes would flutter shut, and she would seem to be asleep \u2014 but just for a second or two. Then her eyes would open and she would be back in the room, back with them, as if she had never been away. Was is something that just started? Or was it that they had never really noticed it until she was moving. The baby had some developmental delay \u2014 they had been told that \u2014 but was this part of whatever it was that caused her delay?The strangest part of these little spells was that she was most likely to have them when she was happy. That first time, the delight in her own speed had been so clear on the little girl\u2019s face. Other times, she would be smiling, even laughing, when suddenly she would draw her arms close to her body stiffly. Then she would blink, once, twice, and her eyes would close. Sometimes you could hear her breathing change, becoming raspy and slowed, before she drew her arms in and her eyelids fell. If she was sitting up, her head would drift forward until her chin was resting on her chest. And then her torso would take up the movement, sinking forward, almost in slow motion. Sometimes her mother would catch her before her forehead made contact with the floor, but often enough before she even got close, the child would wake up and sit back up as if the past 10 to 15 seconds had never happened.\u2193The mother brought it up at their next appointment. The doctor, a young-looking guy with an eager smile, listened as she described Kamiyah\u2019s strange episodes. It looked as if she was a little dizzy, the mom suggested, as if she were putting her head down to let the dizzy spell pass. The doctor thought a moment. Maybe she has an earache, he offered.He looked in her ears. She\u2019d had several ear infections that spring. And, sure enough, though the ear canal wasn\u2019t red, he could see fluid behind the ear drum. He prescribed a few days of ear drops. That should take care of it, he said. Mom was hopeful, but the medication didn\u2019t make a difference. Kamiyah had dozens of these little spells every day, before, during and after she took the medication.\u2193When the day of the appointment with the neurologist finally came, the child\u2019s mother brought all Kamiyah\u2019s favorite toys. She knew that if she could make her laugh, she would trigger one of these spells and the doctor could see what was happening. The neurologist did see. It looked to her like an absence seizure, a type of epilepsy usually seen in children and characterized by brief episodes of a loss of awareness, without a loss of consciousness.\u2193They started the little girl on Keppra. Nothing. The seizures kept coming, and the medicine made the child sleepy. They tried a second drug, which seemed to make the spells a little less frequent, but she still had them. What about sending her to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., the first neurologist suggested. They would try anything, the parents told him. So when Kamiyah was 2 years old, she and her mother went to the Mayo Clinic. The pediatric neurologist there saw several of Kamiyah\u2019s spells. Her first thought was also that these were some sort of seizures, and she ordered still another EEG with video monitoring. Other possibilities on her list was some sort of movement disorder \u2014 either a type of dystonia, a transient stiffening of the muscles, or dyskinesia, a loss of voluntary muscle control.\u2193The following year, Kamiyah\u2019s neurologist suggested that the child be referred to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Undiagnosed Diseases Network. This is a program developed by three branches of the N.I.H. \u2014 the National Human Genome Research Institute, the Genetic and Rare Diseases office of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the N.I.H. Clinical Center \u2014 to help provide a diagnosis for patients with mysterious symptoms who have remained without one even after a thorough evaluation. The application process is rigorous, requiring medical records from all the physicians who have seen the patient and results of all the studies done. Even so, the program accepts only a fraction of those who apply.Kamiyah\u2019s mother recognized the challenge. She described for me her understanding of what the N.I.H. was looking for: \u201cYou had to be sick enough to go, rare enough to be appealing and well enough to not die before you got there. That\u2019s a hard boat to rock. We\u2019re really, really sick, but we\u2019re not dying. Please take us.\u201dThey sent in their application, and then they waited. The response took months, but finally the letter came that said that Kamiyah was one of the few, one of the chosen. And so, in January 2016, she and her mother traveled to Bethesda, Md., for an evaluation at what Kamiyah\u2019s mother knew was the diagnostic center of last resort \u2014 the Undiagnosed Diseases Network.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.When mother and child arrived at the N.I.H., they were given a schedule of the dozens of tests to be performed and specialists Kamiyah would see over the next five days. She would be evaluated by a team including a neurologist, a dermatologist, an ophthalmologist, an immunologist and a specialist in rehabilitation medicine. She would have studies done on just about every part of her body \u2014 her skin, her heart, her blood, her brain.At the end of the five days, the child and her mother met with the team so that the available results could be explained. The experts still didn\u2019t have a diagnosis, but they were hopeful. It could be that the child actually did have some kind of seizure disorder, one that couldn\u2019t be picked up on EEG. They were also testing the child again for narcolepsy. And finally, it was possible that genetic testing might reveal the cause of these strange spells. But, they reminded Kamiyah\u2019s mother, most of those who came to the U.D.N. did not get a diagnosis.\u2193And so mother and child returned to South Dakota, hopeful, but trying to remain realistic. Kamiyah\u2019s mother waited, and waited, for an answer, but none came. She had practically given up when she finally heard from the U.D.N. just six weeks ago. The email said they had an answer for Kamiyah, now 6 years old. The whole team wanted to be there to discuss the results. When would she be available the following week? The young mother almost exploded. When she recovered herself, she emailed back, How about now? I mean, I\u2019ve waited more than two years, and you call me with an answer that I have to wait another week for? The team couldn\u2019t get together before then, the reply said.It was one of the longest weeks of her life.\u2193Finally, the call came. It was good to hear the voices of the doctors she and Kamiyah had gotten to know during their trip to Bethesda. Dr. Cynthia Tifft, the pediatric geneticist who led the team, broke the news. Kamiyah had a genetic defect that was causing these strange spells. It was not something she inherited from either of her parents but was what is called a de novo, or new, mutation. This particular mutation caused a slowdown of one of the mechanisms controlling activity in the brain and spinal cord, and that, in turn, caused her episodes of slowing down, or what the U.D.N. team called paroxysmal dyskinesia.There are a number of types of paroxysmal dyskinesia, triggered by a variety of problems. Although many of those with this kind of rare disorder experienced unexpected movement, Kamiyah\u2019s mutation actually causes a suppression of movement leading to her transient episodes of weakness. And while Kamiyah was the first to receive this diagnosis at the U.D.N., a handful of patients around the world were known to have the same abnormality. Most of these young people had, in additional to the paroxysmal dyskinesia, some combination of seizure disorder, intellectual disability or developmental delay.So Kamiyah was something of an outlier, even here. They were certain that Kamiyah did not have a seizure disorder or intellectual disability, and Tifft thought that much, perhaps all of Kamiyah\u2019s very mild developmental delay was caused by these frequent episodes of dyskinesia, which stole developmental time from her. Treating these episodes \u2014 probably with some type of anti-seizure medication \u2014 so that they became less frequent, could allow Kamiyah to catch up to her normal developmental age. She doesn\u2019t have epileptiform seizures, but those medicines can affect brain activity, and that\u2019s what she needs \u2014 a medication that can affect her brain in a way that lets it work more normally.Which seizure medication? Kamiyah\u2019s mother wanted to know. The answer was, We can\u2019t tell you. While science is still learning about how this gene works \u2014 knowledge that may someday help doctors choose the best type of medicine for Kamiyah \u2014 it still isn\u2019t clear which medicine or combination of medicines will be most effective. You\u2019ll have to work with a neurologist to figure that out. The mother had heard that Gillette Hospital in Minneapolis had expertise in dealing with children with complex medical problems. Would they refer Kamiyah there? They would.And then the call was over. And mother and child were left to try to understand what this new information might mean for Kamiyah. Kamiyah\u2019s mother has hope, and a few ideas. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not the only ones,\u201d she started. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s something somewhere that somebody tried that I haven\u2019t found? Because I am only one person, and as far as I reach and as hard as I try, it takes a village to raise a kid. Now, I\u2019m looking for that village.\u201dAnd that\u2019s where you may be able to help. There have been 21 patients with this exact genetic abnormality published in the scientific literature. But there are probably many more than that here in the real world. Does your child, nephew, granddaughter, patient have a disorder that looks like Kamiyah\u2019s? Let us know. If possible, send us a video, with the patient\u2019s consent, naturally. Let\u2019s help Kamiyah and her mother build their village and, with luck, find a treatment that works well for Kamiyah.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Illustration by Andreas Samuelsson.

{"Headline": "Peloton\u2019s New Infusion Made It a $4 Billion Company in 6 Years", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor Peloton\u2019s first two years in business, venture capital investors didn\u2019t get it. The company\u2019s founders struggled to convince them that blending stationary bikes and streaming live video classes would work. It had to cobble together money from a network of more than 200 angel investors to get off the ground.But six years and a quarter of a million bikes later, the company is the toast of Silicon Valley. On Friday, Peloton announced it had raised $550 million in financing from prominent investors led by TCV, a firm known for investing in Facebook, Netflix and LinkedIn. Peloton has now raised $1 billion and is valued at $4 billion.The combination of hardware and software that initially turned off investors is now viewed as an advantage. After Peloton sells customers a bike for $1,995, the company charges a $39 monthly subscription for the live video classes. Jay Hoag, general partner of TCV, compared the business model to Apple\u2019s iPhone and App Store. And he said Peloton\u2019s repeat revenue from subscriptions reminded him of Netflix, where he\u2019s a board director, and of Spotify, a TCV portfolio company.\u201cThey have a similar-sized opportunity to reshape fitness,\u201d he said.Peloton is on track to bring in $700 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in February, said Jessica Kleiman, vice president of global communications for Peloton. It plans to go public in 2019.Peloton\u2019s slug of capital comes during an influx of so-called mega-rounds of funding of $100 million or more. In July, 55 companies raised mega-rounds, the highest amount in the last decade, according to data site Crunchbase.Peloton\u2019s new influx of money will partly be used to fend off new competitors. Investors, seeing Peloton\u2019s fast rise, are fearful of missing out again on an exercise start-up.Flywheel, NordicTrack and a brand called Echelon all offer stationary bikes with video classes. A start-up called FightCamp is pitching itself as \u201cthe Peloton of boxing.\u201d And Mirror, a company making home fitness devices that stream yoga and Pilates fitness routines, has raised $13 million even though its product has not yet gone on sale.The money going to Peloton will also be used to expand Peloton\u2019s offerings. Fitness is a faddish industry, as anyone who owns a dusty set of Tae Bo tapes can attest, and indoor cycling is not immune. In May SoulCycle, a boutique indoor cycling company, withdrew its plans to go public, citing \u201cmarket conditions.\u201dThe company has plans to expand outside the United States as well, including in Canada and Britain, starting in the fall.The company has not yet shipped bikes overseas because it hasn\u2019t had music licenses in other countries. That hasn\u2019t stopped some enthusiasts from getting their hands on them. Last year, according to Mr. Lynch, a duchess in Sweden sent the company a photo of a bike being delivered to a countryside chateau.\u201cWe had this tsunami of demand from Europe and Canada from consumers asking if they could get the bike,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s Streaming Service Starts to Come Into Focus", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Very little is known about Disneyflix, as some people in Hollywood are calling the Netflix-style streaming service that Disney plans to introduce late next year.How much will subscriptions cost? Disney has given hints but no specifics. The name, rollout strategy, precise menu of movies and television shows \u2014 all still a mystery.But one aspect is becoming clear: The service\u2019s initial success or failure will depend a great deal on an ascendant Disney executive named Ricky Strauss, who was recently given \u2014 to the surprise of many in Hollywood \u2014 creative oversight of the service\u2019s programming. He has the power to \u201cgreenlight\u201d new episodic series and movies and will develop, according to Disney, the service\u2019s \u201cstrategic content vision.\u201dBut standout success on the production side of the film business has been more elusive for Mr. Strauss.In his new job as president of content and marketing for Disney\u2019s streaming service, Mr. Strauss will be responsible for steering hundreds of millions of dollars in production. As he put it in a brief phone interview, \u201cQuality is going to be critical.\u201dMr. Strauss will need to court other top filmmakers, writers and stars to make content for the service \u2014 at a time when Apple, Amazon and Netflix are going after talent with wheelbarrows full of money.\u201cThere\u2019s a big, big opportunity for storytellers inside and outside of Disney to help us,\u201d Mr. Strauss said when asked what he wanted to communicate to Hollywood\u2019s creative community.\u201cI do believe that this is the future, which is one reason I wanted the job,\u201d he added.\u201cThis as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the Disney-branded streaming service last year.The urgency has only grown.The number of cord-cutters \u2014 adults who have canceled cable or satellite hookups and continue without it \u2014 will hit 33 million this year, a 32.8 percent increase from 2017, according to a new report by the research firm eMarketer. The annual increase in cord-cutters had been projected at 22 percent. Most of those people are subscribing to streaming services instead.Programming from National Geographic, which is part of the Fox acquisition, will probably be offered on the service. Disney has not decided whether family films from the Fox library (\u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cIce Age\u201d) will be included.

Disney is remaking two musicals from its animation library as live-action films: \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d (1955) and \u201cThe Sword in the Stone\u201d (1963). Other films headed to the service include \u201cTogo,\u201d a period adventure about a sled dog, and \u201cNoelle,\u201d starring Anna Kendrick as Santa\u2019s daughter.Most series will cost $25 million to $35 million.

{"Headline": "Freed From a Gilded Cage, a Famed Saudi Investor Returns to the Markets", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia\u2019s best-known investor is back in the market.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a longtime investor in international businesses including Citigroup, Twitter, Lyft and the Four Seasons hotel chain, announced a $270 million transaction with the French music-streaming company Deezer on Thursday.The Deezer investment is the prince\u2019s first big international deal since January, when he was released from a three-month detention at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton hotel by Saudi government officials. That lockup, from which the prince emerged grayer and thinner, was part of what Saudi officials called an anti-corruption crackdown that ensnared many of the kingdom\u2019s elites.Under the terms of the deal, the prince will receive shares of Deezer in exchange for exclusive audio and video content from the Saudi media company he controls, Rotana Group. In a statement, Prince Alwaleed said the agreement \u201crepresents one of the many premium investments that we have always sought for our shareholders.\u201dThe deal was made through the prince\u2019s investing vehicle, Kingdom Holding Company, whose business he had said he was able to conduct during his stay at the Ritz. Still, his detention raised sharp questions about Prince Alwaleed\u2019s future autonomy, including whether he could continue to invest freely in international companies and property.Going forward, Prince Alwaleed is primarily interested in investments in media and technology, said Kacy Grine, an investment banker and adviser to the prince. \u201cI think the next step for the prince would be to do the same on the TV and movie side,\u201d Mr. Grine said, adding that Netflix or Amazon were potential deal partners.The Deezer deal, Mr. Grine said, is \u201cby definition a comeback, compared to the situation a few months ago.\u201dPrince Alwaleed could not be reached for comment.Advertisement"}

Aside from the fact that he\u2019s white, and a man, what\u2019s his point? What does it signify when people use this now ubiquitous formula (\u201cAs a such-and-such, I \u2026\u201d) to affix an identity to an observation? Typically, it\u2019s an assertion of authority: As a member of this or that social group, I have experiences that lend my remarks special weight. The experiences, being representative of that group, might even qualify me to represent that group. Occasionally, the formula is an avowal of humility. It can be both at once. (\u201cAs a working-class woman, I\u2019m struggling to understand Virginia Woolf\u2019s blithe assumptions of privilege.\u201d) The incantation seems indispensable. But it can also be \u2014 to use another much-loved formula \u2014 problematic.Being a black lesbian, for instance, isn\u2019t a matter of simply combining African-American, female and homosexual ways of being in the world; identities interact in complex ways. That\u2019s why Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a feminist legal theorist and civil-rights activist, introduced the notion of intersectionality, which stresses the complexity with which different forms of subordination relate to one another. Racism can make white men shrink from black men and abuse black women. Homophobia can lead men in South Africa to rape gay women but murder gay men. Sexism in the United States in the 1950s kept middle-class white women at home and sent working-class black women to work for them.Let\u2019s go back to Joe, with his NPR mug and his man bun. (Or are you picturing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tank top and a high-and-tight?) Having an identity doesn\u2019t, by itself, authorize you to speak on behalf of everyone of that identity. So it can\u2019t really be that he\u2019s speaking for all white men. But he can at least speak to what it\u2019s like to live as a white man, right?The switch in identities can be the whole point of the joke. Here\u2019s Chris Rock, talking about his life in an affluent New Jersey suburb: \u201cAs a black man, I\u2019m against the cops, but as a man with property, well, I need the cops. If someone steals something, I can\u2019t call the Crips!\u201d Drawing attention to certain identities you have is often a natural way of drawing attention to the contours of your beliefs, values or concerns.If someone is advocating policies for gay men to adopt, or for others to adopt toward gay men, what matters, surely, isn\u2019t whether the person is gay but whether the policies are sensible. As a gay man, you could oppose same-sex marriage (it\u2019s just submitting to our culture\u2019s heteronormativity, and anyway monogamy is a patriarchal invention) or advocate same-sex marriage (it\u2019s an affirmation of equal dignity and a way to sustain gay couples). Because members of an identity group won\u2019t be identical, your \u201cas a\u201d doesn\u2019t settle anything. The same holds for religious, vocational and national identities.And, of course, for racial identities. In the 1990s the black novelist Trey Ellis wrote a screenplay, \u201cThe Inkwell,\u201d which drew on his childhood in the milieu of the black bourgeoisie. A white studio head (for whom race presumably eclipsed class) gave it to Matty Rich, a young black director who\u2019d grown up in a New York City housing project. Mr. Rich apparently worried that the script wasn\u2019t \u201cblack enough\u201d and proposed turning the protagonist\u2019s father, a schoolteacher, into a garbage man. Suffice to say, it didn\u2019t end well. Are we really going to settle these perennial debates over authenticity with a flurry of \u201cas a\u201d arrowheads? Somehow, we can\u2019t stop trying. Ever since Donald Trump eked out his surprising electoral victory, political analysts have been looking for people to speak for the supposedly disgruntled white working-class voters who, switching from their former Democratic allegiances, gave Mr. Trump the edge.So we might do well to ease up on \u201cas a\u201d \u2014 on the urge to underwrite our observations with our identities. \u201cFor me,\u201d Professor Spivak once tartly remarked, \u201cthe question \u2018Who should speak\u2019 is less crucial than \u2018Who will listen?\u2019\u201dBut tell that to Joe, as he takes a sip of kombucha \u2014 or is it Pabst Blue Ribbon? All right, Joe, let\u2019s hear what you\u2019ve got to say. The speaking-as-a convention isn\u2019t going anywhere; in truth, it often serves a purpose.

{"Headline": "Finding Alarm and Consolation About the Apocalypse in Two New Books", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesPhooey.In \u201cWe\u2019re Doomed. Now What?,\u201d Roy Scranton writes with angry passion about the various ways we fail to confront reality. \u201cRight-wing denialists insist that climate change isn\u2019t happening, or that it\u2019s not caused by humans, or that the real problem is terrorism or refugees,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhile left-wing denialists insist that the problems are fixable, under our control, merely a matter of political will.\u201dOne of Scranton\u2019s previous books had the even less cheery title of \u201cLearning to Die in the Anthropocene,\u201d the Anthropocene being the era marked by \u201cthe advent of human beings as a geological force.\u201d This new collection of essays, many of them previously published, covers some of the same dispiriting ground.His raw concern about the environment is greater than his expertise. Perhaps because of this, his writing about the subject can be as overheated as the planet. One bit that (astonishingly) recurs goes like this: \u201cGod was rock in the beginning and rock is rock and rock is dead and space is dead and light is dead and life is dead, life rock and water and God, dead, dead light, dead heat, dead rock, dead space, dead rock, dead God.\u201d Dead reader.It\u2019s Scranton\u2019s pieces about war (an Army veteran, he served a 14-month deployment in Iraq) that best ground his philosophy, and his prose, in experience. He writes clearly and convincingly about the emotional, existential challenges that attracted him to war, and how he was changed by the time he returned home.There are repetitions and a general bagginess to the essays, taken together, but Scranton at his best is an incisive dispenser of tough love.The bad news in his book comes across loud and clear. But the answer to the question in the second half of his title is not really provided. He predicts increasing devastation, but has little to say about how we might realistically avoid it. He argues that the collective action needed to properly address global warming at this stage would require radical redistribution of wealth, the dissolution of nations and the establishment of one world government with a \u201cmonopoly on force.\u201d Given both the scale and the totalitarianism of that blueprint \u2014 and the inconvenient fact that the opposite of political unity is happening all the time \u2014 even Scranton admits that he\u2019s \u201cpretty sure we\u2019re going to keep fumbling along toward our doom.\u201d One finishes his book with little hope.But why hope? Another choice, philosophically speaking, is to steer into the skid; to go, as Jack Donaghy on \u201c30 Rock\u201d might recommend, \u201cinto the crevasse.\u201d After all, people \u2014 and I\u2019m looking at every last one of you, as well as straight into the mirror \u2014 are stupid and shortsighted, about matters small and large. Brilliant thinkers (all of them stupid in their own way, no doubt) have been saying this for centuries, well before the advent of human-fueled global warming; even before the geological appearance of Reddit.Eugene Thacker has thrown a party for all of these eloquent cranks in \u201cInfinite Resignation,\u201d and he is an excellent host. The book, a collection of fragments that takes its title from Kierkegaard, is a survey of the pessimism and dark quips of the Danish philosopher and his ilk, combined with Thacker\u2019s own aphoristic thoughts on the subject. The last third of the book is a series of short biographical essays about the \u201cpatron saints of pessimism.\u201dThacker, a professor at the New School in New York City, is the author of many previous books, including a trilogy about the \u201chorror of philosophy.\u201d In the first volume of that series, he wrote, in a line Scranton would likely endorse, that it is \u201cincreasingly difficult to comprehend the world in which we live and of which we are a part.\u201dThacker calls pessimism \u201cthe most adequate\u201d and \u201cthe least helpful\u201d of philosophies. He delineates two varieties of it: \u201cThe end is near\u201d and \u201cWill this never end?\u201dWerner Herzog would be ideally suited to narrate certain passages of this book. \u201cFew sights are more awkward (or embarrassing) than that of human beings in nature,\u201d Thacker writes. He finds self-help books not just \u201cineffectual\u201d but \u201codorous.\u201d Along those same lines, he expresses disappointment in Samuel Beckett for writing \u201cFail better,\u201d the line of his most likely to be quoted by aspirational writers on social media. \u201cThe therapeutic function soon gets the better of us all,\u201d Thacker laments.\u201cInfinite Resignation\u201d is also a timely reminder, especially after reading Scranton\u2019s hopes for a global takeover, that pessimists have always had a tough go organizing. The infighting about philosophical purity can be hilarious, for readers used to such bickering in 2018. Nietzsche wondered how much of a pessimist Schopenhauer could really be given that he played the flute.In order to get the most from Thacker\u2019s book, it\u2019s probably best if you already agree with this sentiment of his: \u201cThere are writers who are so depressing it\u2019s inspiring.\u201d He quotes a lot of them. This book provides a metric ton of misery and a lot of company. Even if you already have a long shelf of these writers at home, your reading list will grow exponentially after finishing this compendium. (You\u2019ll have to track down the pessimistic women out there on your own; Thacker hasn\u2019t made room for them. Though it may also be true that this crabby brand of pessimism is a quality found mostly in perpetually adolescent men.)And yet, the book is not exactly a defense of this school of thought. Thacker is pessimistic even about pessimism. He approvingly quotes the Scottish philosopher R. M. Wenley, who called it, among other things, the resort \u201cof the knave, who knows just enough about life to deem himself able to laugh at it.\u201dThe same blinkered inability to think long term that got us into this mess \u2014 whether you think the mess is global warming, continual war or just life itself \u2014 is perhaps our saving grace when it comes to emotionally coping. \u201cGiven projected increases in global population and projected decreases in resources, the human species could become extinct by the year 3000,\u201d Thacker writes. \u201cNext week, you have plans.\u201dAn earlier version of this review misstated the title of a previous book by Roy Scranton. It is \u201cLearning to Die in the Anthropocene,\u201d not \u201cHow to Die in the Anthropocene.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then he came for the science-fiction adventure. Now he\u2019s back for the medieval fantasy, and he\u2019s grabbing the Disney princess movie while he\u2019s at it.The characters resemble their predecessors from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFuturama\u201d but the world they inhabit lacks the screaming primary colors and free-floating surrealism we\u2019re used to. It\u2019s an only slightly exaggerated cartoon gloss on the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d (That show\u2019s King\u2019s Landing, and the elevator on its ice wall, are referenced in the \u201cDisenchantment\u201d landscape.)The visual and verbal gags still come fast, but now they\u2019re in the context of a more earnest and straightforward style of storytelling. They feel more illustrative than essential. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFuturama\u201d offer constant, explosive payoffs; here the jokes are more muted, and they\u2019re in the service of a continuing story whose major payoffs have to be delayed. That is not Groeningesque.Some of the difference in tone and style in \u201cDisenchantment\u201d certainly has to do with the presence, from the beginning, of Josh Weinstein as Mr. Groening\u2019s collaborator and the series\u2019s showrunner. Mr. Weinstein worked on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFuturama\u201d but he\u2019s also developed live-action comedies and wrote for the Disney Channel animated series \u201cGravity Falls,\u201d which was aimed at a younger audience.But the biggest factor \u2014 beyond Mr. Groening\u2019s own evolution \u2014 is probably the Netflix effect. Not that the company invented serialized seasons (see \u201cWiseguy\u201d and \u201cLost\u201d) or mandates a particular format (see \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d). But it\u2019s done more than anyone to make that the norm, and the 10 episodes of \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d seven of which were available for review, follow a narrative structure that\u2019s the opposite of what Mr. Groening\u2019s been doing for the last 30 years.The effect doesn\u2019t play out the way it usually does \u2014 other creators find themselves padding to fill a serialized Netflix season, while with \u201cDisenchantment\u201d it feels as if Mr. Groening and his writers and artists are holding themselves back, resisting the impulse to pack in more gags and visual curlicues that might interfere with the story.(This could also be in deference to another streaming difference: The density and pace of a \u201cSimpsons\u201d or \u201cFuturama\u201d episode, with 22 minutes of material broken up by commercials, might not work as well in an uninterrupted 30-minute Netflix episode.)The story being told is charming and familiar in equal measure. Bean, the princess of Dreamland, is an entitled teenager with daddy issues who just wants to be in charge of her own life. That desire runs up against both the usual teenage issues and the particular challenges of royalty. It\u2019s hard to find a boyfriend who\u2019s a good listener when your father\u2019s trying to marry you off to form new alliances.Like other rebellious young women in coming-of-age stories, but unlike most princesses, Bean acts out by drinking to excess and hooking up with Viking marauders and hot guys she picks up at donkey auctions. After an uncondoned party at the castle leads to a number of her father\u2019s subjects being slaughtered, she\u2019s packed off to a convent \u2014 Our Lady of Unlimited Chastity \u2014 for punishment.The bigger adjustment, though, has to do with tone and emotion. The characters in \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFuturama\u201d were lovable and horrible, but almost never sentimental. \u201cDisenchantment\u201d is the first Groening show where making you sympathize with the characters appears to be as much of a goal as making you laugh at them. Ay caramba.Advertisement"}

In the case of \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d that process is very gradual, stretching across the eight episodes of the show\u2019s first season (available Friday). The story\u2019s thinness is balanced by its stylishness, its broody romanticism and its charming leads, however, and it\u2019s likely to find a large and enthusiastic audience.The two story lines converge almost immediately, and June and Harry\u2019s flight \u2014 which carries them to London and then off across the North Sea \u2014 becomes a season-long quest to figure out what\u2019s wrong with her. The audience is on that same quest, because \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d for this season anyway, is one of the myriad ration-out-the-clues past-tense mysteries \u2014 as with \u201cWestworld,\u201d say, or \u201cMarvel\u2019s Cloak & Dagger,\u201d it\u2019s less about what\u2019s happening now than about what happened then. Much of the story is a slow buildup to some key flashbacks that take six or seven episodes to arrive.Though build isn\u2019t quite the right word. The story spins in place, with people chasing each other around in scenes and episodes that amount to stall tactics, until it\u2019s finally time to bring everyone together for the answers.The show\u2019s creators and primary writers, Hania Elkington and Simon Duric, are new to the showrunning game \u2014 he\u2019s a longtime storyboard artist producing his first series, and she\u2019s a writer of short stories and hot but unproduced screenplays who\u2019s also bringing her first project to the screen. On the evidence of \u201cThe Innocents,\u201d neither of them yet knows or cares much about how to establish character through action. With the exception of the brave and impossibly noble Harry (Mr. Ascott gives the show\u2019s most touching performance), people define themselves through talk, talk, talk, and the story isn\u2019t developed so much as uncovered.Ms. Elkington and Mr. Duric could also be a little more rigorous when it comes to narrative contrivances. One aspect of the shape-shifting premise \u2014 that shifters still look like themselves in mirrors or other reflections \u2014 is central to the plot but never explained, and feels like an irritating storytelling shortcut. (It\u2019s also awfully convenient that Harry\u2019s mother is a detective with a cold case that connects her to June\u2019s family.)These various quibbles largely arise from the creators\u2019 choice to situate \u201cThe Innocents\u201d far to the teen-angst side of its particular scale, rather than the action-adventure side. It could fit easily on CW or Freeform, where it would be even more swoony and mopey than the rest of the lineup, though with a measure of British understatement.Scene by scene, as June and Harry beautifully dither to a soundtrack of mournful pop (Phoebe Bridgers, Sigrid, Autograf), the show is quite easy to watch. The shape-shifting premise proves a flexible, even powerful frame for the usual teenage quandaries \u2014 feeling different, being misunderstood by clueless parents, wanting to explore other, kinkier modes of life. A scene in which June encounters another shifter and risks losing her own identity altogether delivers some real emotion. In the highly likely second season, perhaps the pace will pick up.Advertisement"}

But if you feel like you\u2019ve burned through the big, serialized cop shows and want something more episodic \u2014 but still smart and darker than a \u201cLaw & Order\u201d \u2014 try this. The first few episodes are wobbly and should be skipped, but after that the show settles into a solid rhythm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did Elon Musk Violate Securities Laws With Tweet About Taking Tesla Private?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseElon Musk had better be right.At two sentences and just 53 characters \u2014 \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d \u2014 it was probably the shortest offer ever. (General Motors\u2019 prospectus in 2010 was over 230 pages.)The announcement came via Twitter at about 12:48 p.m. from Mr. Musk personally, not, as is customary, in a news release or regulatory filing from the company.Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Mr. Musk offered no basis for the $420 offering price, which would ordinarily be arrived at after reams of analysis by investment bankers and negotiations with a committee of independent Tesla directors.Given the offbeat sense of humor that Mr. Musk has sometimes displayed in his Twitter posts, there was immediate speculation that the $420 figure was a reference to a widely used numerical code \u2014 420 \u2014 that refers to marijuana. (April 20, 4/20, is celebrated by some people as a kind of national marijuana holiday.)But it was Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d statement on Twitter that may put the iconoclastic founder most at risk. He provided no details about how much funding had been secured, from whom or under what conditions. His email to employees did not mention anything about the funding.\u201cThat\u2019s a clear factual statement,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in corporate law and securities fraud. \u201cIf it\u2019s not fully secure, that\u2019s potentially a very material misrepresentation, and a very straightforward violation of Rule 10b-5\u201d of the securities law \u2014 in short, securities fraud.It is illegal for a director or officer of a public company \u201cto knowingly or recklessly make material misstatements about that company,\u201d said John Coates, a professor at Harvard Law School who teaches mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201ctweets seem cryptic at best, and it is hard to see how he has complied with his duty to not be misleadingly incomplete.\u201dA Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.The Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla on Wednesday to inquire about the accuracy of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets and why the announcement was not made in a regulatory filing, according to a person briefed on the inquiry, who was not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the S.E.C. Such questions typically precede the launch of any formal investigation.Even at a time when Twitter is the preferred medium for presidential communiqu\u00e9s, this is no way to commence a takeover bid. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cIf I assigned this scenario to my students, the list of legal issues would fill many pages.\u201dFor one thing, it is doubtful that a private Twitter account provides adequate notice for a public announcement of a $72 billion deal that is likely to move a stock\u2019s price. (By the end of the day, Tesla shares had shot up over 10 percent.)In 2013, the S.E.C. ruled, in a case involving the Netflix founder Reed Hastings, that companies can announce important news via social media as long as they have previously told investors they might do so, and simultaneously announce that news to the broader public.Mr. Hastings was not sanctioned for the relatively innocuous remark at issue in the matter: that Netflix subscribers had surpassed a viewing milestone of one billion hours. That\u2019s a far cry from Mr. Musk\u2019s announcing what would be the largest private buyout offer ever, one that could very well run afoul of the commission\u2019s guidance. (Tesla did say in a 2013 S.E.C. filing that it might use social media to make material information public.)\u201cThis approach doesn\u2019t even come close to adhering to S.E.C. rules,\u201d Professor Coffee said.Then there is the question of the price, for which Mr. Musk offered no rationale.\u201cA chief executive can\u2019t just say he\u2019s taking the company private at a price he determined, without any explanation and without any attempt to negotiate a deal,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cHe has to go to the board, which needs to appoint a special committee of independent directors, which would hire investment bankers and lawyers to help negotiate a deal. There must be some attempt at an arms-length transaction.\u201dProfessor Coates predicted a \u201cwelter\u201d of lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders and short sellers who lost money on the big jump in Tesla\u2019s stock price on Tuesday. And if the shares plunge on subsequent disclosures, disappointed buyers will sue, especially if no buyout materializes.Professor Coffee agreed. Short sellers, he noted, lost over a billion dollars on Tuesday and may be eager to sue, especially given Mr. Musk\u2019s frequently hostile comments about them. Punishing short sellers would be no justification for false or misleading statements.\u201cAnd you can be sure there will be people who sold their Tesla stock before the price ran up, who will say they didn\u2019t follow Musk on Twitter and didn\u2019t know about his tweet,\u201d Professor Coffee added. \u201cThere are plenty of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who would be happy to take that case.\u201dMr. Musk has also put the company itself in an awkward situation. \u201cIf I were their lawyer, I\u2019d tell them to have an 8-K filing at the S.E.C. the first thing in the morning,\u201d Professor Coates said, referring to a regulatory filing used to disseminate information that may be important to shareholders. \u201cIt needs to explain if this was a joke or a mistake, and if not, what he really meant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What I Learned in Secretarial School", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are many paths to discipline and confidence. I typed my way there.Opinion ColumnistI hate to break it to parents who just sent their college-admission-minded progeny to the Tibetan Plateau to churn yak butter, but the smartest summer I ever spent was in secretarial school. This was back when I was 17, and it wasn\u2019t grist for an essay about a transformative communion with people outside my clique. I wasn\u2019t ripping the blinders from my eyes. I was typing \u2014 hour upon hour, day after day, with my shoulders back and my spine straight and my hands just so.My mother had decided that she could no longer bear the tortured stutter of my peck-peck-pecking at her electric typewriter and my histrionic begging that she, with her superior dexterity, take what I\u2019d composed in longhand and type it for me.\u201cYou like to write?\u201d she said. \u201cThen learn to write.\u201d She meant type, and she told me that she was willing to pay for a proper course if I was willing to go. I\u2019d be in a sunless room with strangers. I\u2019d have nothing exotic to brag to my friends about, no grand tales to tell.But I\u2019d have a skill, she said, and it would be more useful than I expected, not just in college but beyond. I\u2019d be able to catch all those sentences and phrases swirling in my imagination and pin them down before they floated away.So I accepted her offer \u2014 or, really, took her dare. More than 35 years later, my memory is foggy, but I recall that I was in school from something like 8:30 a.m. to noon and had my afternoons free, so my summer tan wasn\u2019t an entirely lost cause. The course lasted four weeks, I think. The dozen or so other students were all women and all older, and I was too shy to do more than exchange greetings with them. They regarded me with obvious bafflement before they stopped noticing me at all.What\u2019s not foggy is what I gleaned, which was even more than a skill. It was a mind-set. It was an understanding that mechanics sometimes matter as much as fancier, loftier stuff. It was a discipline in the truest, best sense of the word.That standard is outmoded. Today, few children are prodded toward typing classes, and that\u2019s for the very sane reason that few children need to be. They use computers in lieu of typewriters and have grown up on smartphones and tablets and laptops, developing an organic fluency with keyboards.I\u2019d argue that she should still feel some \u2014 not for the typing but for what it represents, which is an act of fierce concentration in counterpoint to the stimulation-promiscuous, staccato nature of many children\u2019s lives now, especially online.I brought a tiny electric typewriter with me to college in 1982, and I reliably finished my term papers faster than my classmates did, thanks largely to the velocity of my typing. Computers came along and only quickened my pace: I didn\u2019t sweat errors, which were easily fixed. If only life had a backspace key.But journalism was where my typing really paid off. I\u2019m sure that Trubek\u2019s Oberlin students were nimble typists, but I doubt that they were like me in my youthful prime. I could take notes almost as fast as the person on the other end of the phone could talk. I could transcribe a televised debate in real time, or just about. I developed a reputation as a fleet writer when really I was a fleet typist. The talents were somehow intertwined. Confidence in my typing gave me confidence in everything else.The emphasis today is often different, Twenge said: \u201cDo it your own way, everybody\u2019s unique, there are no rules.\u201d It can feed a runaway individualism. My mother, long gone, was all for adventure and personal expression, but she was also for drudgery and humility, and I bet that she trusted secretarial school to acquaint me with both. I\u2019d have plenty of time later to jet off to faraway lands. First, I should sit still and train my fingers to fly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matt Groening Goes Medieval With New Series, \u2018Disenchantment\u2019", "Date": "2018-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Speaking as someone who has created two hit animated TV shows and is about to introduce his third series, Matt Groening has some advice to ensure a successful pitch meeting.\u201cThis is my Hollywood tip,\u201d he said earlier this summer. \u201cYou can say, \u2018It\u2019s \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 meets anything\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s anything meets \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 and you\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d\u201cDisenchantment\u201d is more like Mr. Groening\u2019s comic amalgam of fantasy franchises like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d and the animated epics of Hayao Miyazaki, to name just two of its dozens of influences.It is also Mr. Groening\u2019s first show created for a streaming service \u2014 its initial 10 episodes can be consumed in a five-hour binge \u2014 as well as, consequently, his first to have a serialized narrative.\u201cI\u2019ve been working for 30 years in sequential, weekly, prime-time animation,\u201d Mr. Groening said. \u201cTo suddenly have a bunch of episodes that go up at the same time, you have to tell a big story. And it\u2019s been really fun. However, it\u2019s its own torture.\u201dAnd part of the difficulty \u2014 and part of the pleasure \u2014 is doing something different from \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the decades-old behemoth that is constantly judged by the standards it set, and against which every subsequent creation of Mr. Groening\u2019s is measured.As of 11 a.m. this June morning, Mr. Groening, 64, had already visited the \u201cSimpsons\u201d offices at the Fox studios in Los Angeles to give a couple of notes on an upcoming episode, and had dropped off his 5-year-old son, Nathaniel, at summer camp.His wife, Agustina, an Argentinian-born artist, was home with their newborn twins, Venus and Sol. As Mr. Groening explained: \u201cSpanish is the primary language in my house. I don\u2019t speak a word, but I can tell when they\u2019re talking about me.\u201dMr. Groening was presently working from his personal office here in Santa Monica, a boxy building that does not exactly broadcast its Simpsons affiliations. Inside, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s bathroom doors are subtly distinguished with wavy lines suggesting the spiky haircuts of Bart and Lisa, and Mr. Groening\u2019s second-floor work space is minimally decorated with Simpsons memorabilia, a few Frank Zappa albums and some dusty Emmy Awards.The artifact he was most eager to show off this day was a weathered notebook in which, for the past eight years or longer, he\u2019d scribbled down his ideas for \u201cDisenchantment\u201d: lineages of fictional royal families, lists of more movies to emulate (\u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d \u201cJabberwocky\u201d) and sketches of a goofy elf named Elfo that he said he\u2019s been drawing since the fifth grade.\u201cBy the way, every character I draw is based on what I drew in the fifth grade,\u201d Mr. Groening said. \u201cThey all have the big, round eyes, little nose and big overbite.\u201dFrom these disparate data points, Mr. Groening has built \u201cDisenchantment\u201d into a series about the misadventures of a rebellious princess (voiced by Abbi Jacobson of \u201cBroad City\u201d), that aforementioned elf (Nat Faxon) and a mischievous demon (Eric Andre).Though each episode of \u201cDisenchantment\u201d tells a stand-alone story, Mr. Groening said: \u201cEvery single thing connects to things that will pay off later. There are moments from the very beginning \u2014 hints and clues and Easter eggs \u2014 that we lay in there for the people who really care.\u201dWhen Mr. Weinstein joined \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in its third season in the early 1990s, he said the show was starting to perfect its comedic voice, one unlike anything on TV at the time.\u201cYou might have thought Matt was Mr. Underground Cartoonist,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said, \u201cbut he had a very organized mind for what he wanted.\u201d\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d became a critical, cultural and commercial success, one that, in a pre-Internet era, was largely insulated from the opinions of its audience.\u201cWe had no idea, really, what people were thinking, so we had total freedom,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. On \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d he added, \u201cWe have that feeling again, of absolute freedom to do what we want, which is so rare.\u201d\u201cThey haven\u2019t heard of Mary Tyler Moore,\u201d Mr. Groening said of these younger writers. \u201cBut I forgot to watch TV in the \u201980s, so there\u2019s an entire generation of references that have passed me by.\u201dBill Oakley, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s former writing partner, worked with him as a \u201cSimpsons\u201d showrunner and a \u201cFuturama\u201d producer. He said the directive from Mr. Groening on \u201cDisenchantment\u201d is that it shouldn\u2019t \u201crequire the viewer to know anything about fantasy or even like fantasy,\u201d adding that Mr. Groening \u201cwants the show to be about the characters, about them growing up and going forward.\u201dIt\u2019s a lesson Mr. Groening said he learned, in part, on \u201cFuturama,\u201d which was set in a 31st century cohabitated by robots, aliens and lobster-people, and which was as much a sendup of genre conventions as it was of human interaction. On \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d he said, \u201cWe have to get past the fantasy jokes and into real emotion.\u201d\u201cAs you watch those first 10, 15 seasons, they really wrote up to those characters. They wouldn\u2019t sacrifice the integrity of a character for a joke,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019d occasionally be surprised \u2014 oh, wow, I actually feel emotion for this cartoon.\u201d\u201cI think particularly right now, people feel so aggrieved and crazed and powerless that they\u2019re picking the wrong battles,\u201d Mr. Groening said.Having become the longest-running scripted prime-time series in the history of television, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d often faces questions about whether it remains as incisive as it once was, and whether it still has anything new to say. But Mr. Groening emphatically believes that it does. \u201cI\u2019m still crazy about the show,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not what it was back in its surge of insane popularity,\u201d Mr. Groening said. But \u201cit makes me laugh because it still surprises me.\u201dMr. Groening said his interest in creating \u201cDisenchantment\u201d and showing it on a nontraditional platform came simply from a desire to try something new. \u201cI just wanted to see what it was like to go someplace else,\u201d he said.But his colleagues suspect there is a bit more at stake for Mr. Groening, and that he wants to show he is as vital now as he was in past eras of his career. \u201cIf I had created \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 and \u2018Futurama,\u2019 I might retire,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cBut he\u2019s somebody who loves to work, to his credit. He wants to be judged for what he\u2019s doing now. He wants to keep contributing.\u201dMr. Groening has plenty to keep him busy: He is already working on a second 10-episode batch of \u201cDisenchantment,\u201d which Netflix will likely release next year. And he continues to contribute to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 and is waiting to see how the Walt Disney Company\u2019s acquisition of Fox might affect his best-known creation.On the one hand, the deal triggers his innate suspicion of all things corporate. But if it means that \u201cSimpsons\u201d characters could someday appear at Disney theme parks, maybe he could live with it.\u201cIt\u2019s unknown territory,\u201d he said. \u201cI am dubious of synergy, creatively. But boy, I\u2019d love to see a Simpsonsland.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeffrey Katzenberg Raises $1 Billion for Short-Form Video Venture", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJeffrey Katzenberg has a billion to play with for his new short-form video platform.His holding company, WndrCo, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $1 billion in its initial investment round, including funds from 10 American media companies and the Chinese technology giant Alibaba.Mr. Katzenberg, a onetime chairman of Walt Disney Studios and a founder of DreamWorks, hired Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and eBay, to run the show.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like this, but I keep saying we\u2019re two old dogs who have a new trick,\u201d Mr. Katzenberg, 67, said in a phone interview, as Ms. Whitman laughed in the background.Because of Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s track record, which also included a stint as the head of production at Paramount Pictures, any move he makes is regarded seriously.But Hollywood has remained skeptical in the year since he announced his venture. Several executives have argued that there is little evidence to support the notion that viewers are craving short programming. And beyond the initial hype, Mr. Katzenberg has been short on specifics.But now the project is coming into focus. Mr. Katzenberg announced on Tuesday that 10 major studios had signed on as backers: the Walt Disney Company, Entertainment One, 21st Century Fox, ITV, Lionsgate, Metro Goldwyn Mayer, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Viacom and Warner Media.Strategic partners include Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Global. Ms. Whitman said the biggest investor was Madrone Capital Partners, which has connections to the Walton family of Walmart fame (the retail giant is not itself an investor).And perhaps most intriguing: Mr. Katzenberg has managed to land an investment from Alibaba, although China has remained off limits for many media companies, including Netflix.The $1 billion from investors allows NewTV to begin licensing original programs, particularly from the media companies that have come aboard. Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s company will not own the content it streams for on-the-go viewing.NewTV has also rented out a few floors at a co-working space in West Hollywood, Calif. There are seven people on staff, and Ms. Whitman said she expected that number to move past 200 by 2020.

Rather than competing with Netflix or HBO, it will target viewers looking for quick-hit fare to help them pass the time when they are, for example, on the subway or waiting in line at Starbucks.Higher production values will distinguish NewTV\u2019s programming from the majority of video shorts that gain traction on YouTube, Mr. Katzenberg said.

{"Headline": "Uber Hit With Cap as New York City Takes Lead in Crackdown", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislation passed overwhelmingly by the City Council will cap the number of for-hire vehicles for a year while the city studies the booming industry. The bills also allow New York to set a minimum pay rate for drivers.Uber has become one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest success stories and changed the way people across the globe get around. But it has faced increased scrutiny from government regulators and struggled to overcome its image as a company determined to grow at all costs with little regard for its impact on cities.The proposal to cap ride-hail companies led to a clash among interest groups with taxi industry officials saying the companies were dooming their business and Uber mounting a major advertising campaign to make the case that yellow cabs have a history of discriminating against people of color.Mayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said the bills will curtail the worsening traffic on the streets and improve low driver wages.\u201cWe are pausing the issuance of new licenses in an industry that has been allowed to proliferate without any appropriate check or regulation,\u201d Mr. Johnson said before the vote, adding that the rules would not diminish existing service for New Yorkers who rely on ride-hail apps.Mr. de Blasio praised the bills and said he planned to sign them into law. The cap on new for-hire vehicles would take effect immediately.\u201cMore than 100,000 workers and their families will see an immediate benefit from this legislation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said, referring to the city\u2019s army of for-hire drivers. \u201cAnd this action will stop the influx of cars contributing to the congestion grinding our streets to a halt.\u201dBut Uber has warned its riders that the cap could produce higher prices and longer wait times for passengers if the company cannot keep up with the growing demand. Ride-hail apps have become a crucial backup option for New Yorkers swept up in the constant delays on the city\u2019s sputtering subway, as happened on Wednesday when signal problems again snarled train lines across a large swath of the city. Ride-hail services have also grown in neighborhoods outside Manhattan where the subway does not reach.New York is the latest city to grapple with questions over how to regulate the company. In London, Uber\u2019s most lucrative European market, Uber recently regained its taxi license after the company agreed to stricter regulations, including providing the city with the trove of traffic data that the firm collects and has often been reluctant to share. Uber has also faced regulatory battles in American cities, like Austin, Tex., and in countries like Canada, Brazil and Italy.Uber criticized the Council\u2019s decision to approve the cap, but said the company would work to keep up with the increasing appeal of its service despite the limit on new vehicles.\u201cThe City\u2019s 12-month pause on new vehicle licenses will threaten one of the few reliable transportation options while doing nothing to fix the subways or ease congestion,\u201d Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a software company that examines technology trends, said the cap could impact Uber\u2019s public offering if it reduces revenues and emboldens other cities to take similar action.\u201cIf it changes their growth trajectory, that could have an impact on their valuation and the narrative around the company,\u201d Mr. Sanwal said.Uber said the company would immediately reach out to tens of thousands of for-hire vehicle owners who are already licensed but work for other local car services and try to recruit them to work for Uber. The company said it would also continue to press for another solution, known as congestion pricing \u2014 a proposal to toll drivers entering Manhattan\u2019s busiest neighborhoods and that would require approval from state lawmakers.Many experts believe congestion pricing is the best way for New York City to fix congestion and secure the funds needed to fix the subway. Mr. Johnson supports the idea, but Mr. de Blasio has opposed it. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the subway, has said he will push for congestion pricing during the next state legislative session to help pay for an ambitious, multibillion dollar overhaul plan for the subway.The City Council approved the cap in a 39-to-6 vote. Councilman Eric Ulrich, a Republican from Queens, said he opposed the cap, arguing that limiting Uber to help yellow taxis was similar to regulating Netflix, the streaming service, to help Blockbuster, the video rental chain.The legislation allows for the city\u2019s taxi commission to add more licenses if there is a clear need for more vehicles in some neighborhoods. In New York, many Uber drivers work full time and the city regulates Uber vehicles as part of the for-hire vehicle industry, which is different than other cities.Lyft, the second most popular app in New York, also criticized the vote: \u201cThese sweeping cuts to transportation will bring New Yorkers back to an era of struggling to get a ride, particularly for communities of color and in the outer boroughs,\u201d Joseph Okpaku, a vice president at Lyft, said in a statement.The vote was a moment of vindication for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, who lost a bruising battle with Uber over a proposal for a cap in 2015. Since then, the number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 63,000 in 2015, according to the city.Elizabeth Cassarino, a yellow taxi driver, said she supports the cap and hopes it will improve business for taxis. As she drove a taxi through the clogged streets of Manhattan on Wednesday, she said her credit cards were maxed out and she had trouble making enough money to pay for food.\u201cFinally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re starving to death.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Seething, Ms. Gadsby said: \u201cA 17-year-old girl is never in her prime. Ever! I am in my prime.\u201d She is 40.In it, researchers studied the \u201cdesirability\u201d of male and female users, based on how many messages nearly 200,000 users, all of whom were seeking opposite-sex partners, got over one month on a \u201cpopular, free online-dating service\u201d \u2014 and if those sending the messages were desirable based on the same criteria.The researchers determined that while men\u2019s sexual desirability peaks at age 50, women\u2019s starts high at 18 and falls from there.In other words, not so far from the ages of Walter and Picasso.\u201cThe age gradient for women definitely surprised us \u2014 both in terms of the fact that it steadily declined from the time women were 18 to the time they were 65, and also how steep it was,\u201d said Elizabeth Bruch, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Michigan and an author of the study.The study results echoed data shared by the dating behemoth OkCupid in 2010, in which the service found that men from the ages of 22 to 30 focus almost entirely on women who are younger than them.OkCupid also reported that as a man gets older, he searches for relatively younger and younger women, while his upper acceptable age limit hovers just above his own age.\u201cThe male fixation on youth distorts the dating pool,\u201d OkCupid concluded.Michelle Drouin, a developmental psychologist who focuses on technology and relationships, was not surprised by the new study \u2014 in part because they \u201calign with evolutionary theories of mating\u201d in which youth suggests fertility, she said.Dr. Drouin pointed out, though, that there are also theories that suggest that \u201cmen are just less interested in earning potential or power, and more interested in physical attractiveness.\u201dSpeaking of earning potential, Dr. Bruch also found that a man\u2019s desirability increased the more education he attained.For women, that benefit ended with an undergraduate degree \u2014 and postgraduate education, in fact, made them less desirable.Dr. Drouin said that educational dynamic might also be related to \u201cbeliefs that higher degrees among women translate into more work commitment and less relationship and family commitment.\u201dDr. Drouin stressed that the preferences of people seeking mates online reflect aspiration, not necessarily what people want in real life. A key finding of the study was that most users sent messages to people who were more desirable than themselves. Twenty-five percent more desirable, to be exact.\u201cThese messages sent by online daters can be likened to slot machine play in Vegas,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle investment on the front end might pay out big on the back end \u2014 so why not opt for a chance at the biggest win?\u201d\u201cIn the real world, the woman with a graduate degree who knows your favorite Kerouac passage, speaks a few languages or discovers new ways to cure disease might be undeniably attractive,\u201d she said. \u201cThink of Amal Clooney.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Beats Watching Netflix\u2019: Graft Scandal Engrosses Argentina and Heralds Change", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Corruption investigations in Argentina historically have moved at a glacial pace, slogging through a labyrinthine judicial system often seen as beholden to the powerful and unwilling to hold them accountable.But in recent weeks, Argentines have been stunned by a series of head-snapping developments in an enormous corruption inquiry: at least 26 high-profile arrests, with 15 of those detained still in prison.This was quickly followed by an unprecedented race by 15 prominent business leaders and two high-ranking government figures to strike tell-all deals with prosecutors.Then, just this past week, investigators raided homes owned by Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Argentina\u2019s former president.\u201cThis whole process is completely novel for Argentina,\u201d said Manuel Garrido, a former corruption prosecutor who resigned in protest in 2009 after many of his cases had reached dead ends. \u201cWe really have no idea where it could lead.\u201dSince news of the notebooks became public, powerful figures in business and the government, implicated in the scandal, have come forward, describing to prosecutors a vast system of kickbacks involving government contracts said to have proliferated during the administrations of former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner and his widow and successor, Mrs. Kirchner, who governed from 2003 to 2015.Argentines have been so riveted by the revelations since the notebooks emerged in late July that President Mauricio Macri compared the case to a binge-worthy television series.But what has kept Argentines engrossed is the large-scale collaborations with the law by such well-known figures, a novel development. This legal deal-making was made possible only recently by a law signed in November 2016 that established a mechanism for criminal suspects to negotiate leniency in exchange for cooperation with law enforcement officials.Known as the \u201cley del arrepentido,\u201d or the \u201claw of the remorseful,\u201d it allowed plea bargains in a number of crimes, including corruption, drug smuggling and human trafficking.The investigations that arose from Mr. Centeno\u2019s notebooks, which contained lists of names of contractors, public officials and others, seemed tailor-made for the new law, experts said.Confessions of wrongdoing started as a trickle, with business leaders the first to come forward \u2014 including a cousin of Mr. Macri\u2019s, \u00c1ngel Calcaterra. News reports said these leaders initially had tried to explain that the cash was nothing more than forced campaign contributions.Then people started racing to talk to the authorities.\u201cBusiness leaders in Argentina simply aren\u2019t used to explaining their actions in court,\u201d said Natalia Volosin, an Argentine lawyer who specializes in corruption. \u201cAs soon as they saw there was a risk of going to prison, they started talking \u2014 and that changed everything.\u201dA key turning point came when Carlos Wagner, who led the Argentine Construction Chamber, a trade group, was reported to have disclosed to investigators that up to 20 percent of the value of public works contracts was funneled back to the government officials who approved the deals.Public transportation contractors described a similar unspoken rule: in their case, news reports said, it involved kicking back 5 percent of public transportation subsidies to the government officials who approved them.In a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost of all this corruption, Ariel Coremberg, an economics professor at Buenos Aires University, estimated the total amount of bribes could have totaled at least $36 billion between 2004 and 2015.\u201cBribery was like an additional tax that increased the total cost of any project or investment,\u201d Mr. Coremberg said.Claudio Uberti, the former head of the agency that oversees highway concessions, described the Kirchners as obsessed with cash, and claimed he had to collect $150,000 a month from every holder of a concession.Some business leaders claimed they had to pay off government officials to simply do their jobs.In one of the most stunning developments, the Italian-Argentine business leader Paolo Rocca, head of the conglomerate Techint Group and one of Argentina\u2019s richest men, admitted at a business conference that his company paid bribes.Mr. Rocca said his organization did this to ensure the safety of its employees and their families and to make certain that the Argentine government would keep Techint afloat after Venezuela nationalized one of the group\u2019s companies.In another revelation reported in the press, Gabriel Romero, the owner of the industrial conglomerate Emepa, confessed to having paid $600,000 for a presidential decree that extended Emepa\u2019s concession to operate an important commercial waterway.\u201cNo one ever paid me to sign this or any other decree, nor to move forward with any measures in my government,\u201d Mrs. Kirchner wrote in an Aug. 17 statement posted on her website.Polls suggest that many Argentines, particularly among Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters, are skeptical of prosecutor impartiality. She has been charged in several corruption cases since her term ended in 2015, and has frequently maintained that the current government is using the judiciary for political ends.Mrs. Kirchner is a senator, which affords her a degree of immunity. In a fiery, 45-minute speech before the Senate, which voted unanimously on Wednesday to allow the raids in her homes, Mrs. Kirchner seemed to imply corruption was a way of life in Argentina that preceded her and her husband and would continue under Mr. Macri\u2019s government.\u201cWe are in the Argentina that is led by Mauricio Macri, the son of Franco,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Macri\u2019s father, Franco Macri, who made part of his fortune through public contracts.Despite lingering skepticism, the possibility of change has appealed to many in Argentina.\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty about what could happen in the short term,\u201d said Miguel Kiguel, a former finance secretary who runs Econviews, a consultancy. \u201cBut if we manage to get a country with less corruption in the long term, it will be positive for Argentina.\u201dAt a protest Tuesday night, when tens of thousands rallied outside Congress and across the country to demand an end to Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s immunity, there was optimism that the scandal would mark a before-and-after in Argentine politics.\u201cThis can\u2019t be covered up anymore,\u201d said Patricia Basald\u00faa, a 59-year-old psychologist. \u201cIt\u2019s way too big.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They buckled helplessly against the roaring sonic tempest coming from the room\u2019s speakers, before it abruptly ended. The sun came out. But then the storm returned, louder and more ferocious.\u201cWe\u2019ve all suffered quite a lot, at varying levels,\u201d Josie Underwood, a member of the company, said of the group\u2019s mental health. \u201cI think it\u2019s been therapeutic to make a show about it.\u201dThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe is the biggest arts festival in the world, a sprawl of multidisciplinary entertainment that transforms Scotland\u2019s capital for several weeks every August. This year, there are over 3,500 shows, mostly theater and comedy, in more than 300 venues. The Fringe is open to all performers, who pay a registration fee for a spot on the program.The dark paradox is that for all the opportunities the Fringe provides to stage works about mental health, it is taxing for the mental health of its performers. The hours are long and the costs are high. The entertainers have to drum up their own audiences as well as put on their shows. And many are just starting their careers, unused to the actors\u2019 life, hundreds of miles from home.Camilla Whitehill, a playwright, said she was worried about some of those she had seen perform. \u201cI worry it\u2019s not safe for them,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey look like they\u2019re really struggling. Are they really O.K.?\u201d\u201cI just feel like mental health in the black community is not discussed,\u201d Ms. Whitehill said. \u201cI want this show to start a conversation about it.\u201dMr. Eaton-Lewis also noted a generational shift: Younger people talk about mental health more openly, he said, and are more interested in works on the subject.Ms. Underwood has seen similar reactions. When handing out fliers for her show, she said, the reaction of many older people was, \u201cOh God, that sounds horrible.\u201d On the other hand, \u201cYoung people light up. They\u2019re excited by it.\u201d\u201cDoing an intimate show about a traumatic experience on the Edinburgh Fringe is the most stressful environment for a show, probably in the world,\u201d he said.The Fringe provides one of the best opportunities in the English-speaking world for an unknown theater or comedy act to forge a reputation. Nobody will stop you from booking a slot. But there may be nobody to look out for you, either. It\u2019s a long shot at success that thousands are willing to take.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Shows to Watch This Week", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis documentary series about the marching band at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida follows the quintessential sports-story arc: Arduous auditions where some veterans are surprised to be cut, a grueling practice schedule not everyone can endure, a few squabbles that ultimately lead to increased closeness, and finally the big competition everyone\u2019s been waiting for. The show\u2019s 12 episodes clock in around 10 minutes each, but it still manages to be absorbing and compelling.The second-season finale of this deeply silly, surprisingly sincere comedy finds Sam (Sam Richardson) on the brink of fatherhood \u2014 which means he thinks he has to quit the ad agency he co-founded and find more reliable work. His BFF and business partner, Tim (Tim Robinson), of course feels crushed and betrayed. \u201cDetroiters\u201d is refreshingly earnest, and in an era of cerebral but quietly depressing comedies, it\u2019s a welcome change of pace to have a show so gleeful.

(They also made their way to PBS.) Bill Nighy stars as Johnny Worricker, an MI5 spy not always sure of his place in the modern political world.

{"Headline": "The One Thing A.O. Scott Doesn\u2019t Use to Review Movies (No Spoilers!)", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow have tech and online publishing changed the way you review movies?When The Times started reviewing movies regularly \u2014 back in the 1930s, long before I was hired \u2014 the film critics emulated the theater critics. They went to see the movie on opening night, then raced back to the newsroom to file copy for the next day\u2019s paper. (The review would always name the local theaters where the movie was playing.)By the time I got here, almost 20 years ago, some things had changed. Critics would see the film at a press screening a few days before release, and the review would appear in the paper on the first day \u2014 usually Friday \u2014 that readers could go see it.What hasn\u2019t changed?I still go to screenings! We never review from links, and only rarely, when there\u2019s no other option, from DVDs. It still matters to my colleagues and me that we experience a film in aesthetically optimal conditions \u2014 projected on a big screen in a dark room with no distractions \u2014 even if many of our readers will end up watching at home.Some movies don\u2019t even release in theaters \u2014 they release on streaming services like Netflix.What does your setup look like at home to review those kinds of movies?Tech has profoundly changed the way movies are made. What are your favorite uses of tech in movie production, and what are your least favorite?I often think computer-generated special effects are used as a crutch rather than a creative tool \u2014 so many digitally enhanced action sequences strike me as unimaginative and phoned in.Hasn\u2019t social media made it impossible to keep a lid on movie spoilers ahead of a film\u2019s theatrical release?Social media also amplifies the hysteria about spoilers, which I find kind of depressing. There is so much more to movies than plot, or at least there should be, but the studios have so little faith in their products that they mystify banal and obvious story elements. Rosebud is the name of a sled. \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d is still a great movie.When you\u2019re not reviewing movies, are there any tech products you are currently obsessed with?A few years ago, when I was struggling to finish writing a book, I decided I needed to tune out the distractions of Twitter and email and New York Times news alerts so that I could make my daily word count. I started leaving the house for a few hours with no laptop or phone \u2014 just a ballpoint pen and a 5-by-7-inch notebook, the same setup I\u2019d been using for years to take notes in dark theaters.It works like a dream, and now I write all my reviews that way. It also works for poems, to-do lists, phone numbers and scraps of dialogue. The only problem is my penmanship, which almost got me held back in fourth grade and has only declined in the years since. Also it\u2019s hard to insert hyperlinks in the text.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019 Tops Box Office, Proving Power of Diversity (Again)", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d powered by jubilant reviews and pent-up demand for a major Hollywood film led by Asian stars, took in a strong $25.2 million at North American theaters over the weekend, easily enough for No. 1.\u201cThis shows \u2014 once again, with emphasis \u2014 that true diversity matters,\u201d Brad Simpson, a \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d producer, wrote in an email on Sunday. \u201cAudiences are tired of seeing the same stories with the same characters. And we have to give people a reason to get off their couch or devices. We have to give them something different.\u201dAbout 38 percent of ticket buyers for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d were Asian, according to Jeff Goldstein, Warner\u2019s president of domestic distribution. Asian moviegoers typically make up less than 10 percent of the opening-weekend audience for a film. About 68 percent of the audience was female.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d which cost an estimated $30 million to make and tens of millions more to market, took in $34 million since arriving on Wednesday. (The film will roll out overseas in the weeks ahead.) To compare, the hit romantic comedy \u201c27 Dresses,\u201d starring Katherine Heigl, took in the same amount over its first five days in domestic theaters in 2008, after adjusting for inflation, going on to collect $200 million worldwide.The movie business has changed dramatically in the last decade, however, making the turnout for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d all the more impressive. As living room entertainment services like Netflix and Amazon have grown in popularity, filling seats in theaters has become much harder. To compete, studios have moved to the extremes: horror movies made on shoestring budgets, and lavishly expensive franchise films aimed at the broadest possible audience.In turn, studios have largely abandoned mid-market movies like romantic comedies and uplifting sports dramas.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d offers an extreme example of prosperity, but a study shows that Asian-Americans are the most economically divided racial group in the United States.For the weekend, \u201cThe Meg\u201d (Warner) placed second, collecting $21.2 million, for a two-week global total of roughly $300 million, according to comScore, which compiles box-office data. Third place went to \u201cMile 22\u201d (STXfilms), which took in $13.6 million, a bit below what most analysts had expected. \u201cMile 22,\u201d which cost about $35 million to make, stars Mark Wahlberg as an elite intelligence officer.Also of box-office note: \u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d an indie film starring Kevin Spacey, was released in 10 theaters and took in $500 \u2014 a humiliating result that cements Mr. Spacey\u2019s status as a Hollywood pariah. Last year, more than a dozen men accused Mr. Spacey of sexually harassing, groping or assaulting them; he denied some of the accusations against him while also saying he would seek unspecified \u201ctreatment.\u201d\u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d which was already available as a video-on-demand release, is about affluent high school boys in Los Angeles who get involved in a Ponzi scheme. Filming was completed before accusations against Mr. Spacey surfaced in October. The film\u2019s distributor, Vertical Entertainment, justified the release by saying the rest of the cast should not be penalized.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Crazy Rich Asians\u2019: Why Did It Take So Long to See a Cast Like This?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 In January 2017, the director Jon M. Chu announced an open casting call for Asian and Asian-American actors for his movie adaptation of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d Recorded in the kitchen of his West Hollywood home (you can see his fridge in the background), the online plea instructed anyone interested in joining his all-Asian cast, from aspiring actors to \u201ccool personalities with hidden talents,\u201d to post a two-minute video of themselves on social media. \u201cWe are looking for you,\u201d he beamed.For Asian and Asian-American viewers, the film, which opens on Aug. 15, is important not just as something of a cinematic Halley\u2019s comet \u2014 before \u201cJoy Luck Club,\u201d there was \u201cFlower Drum Song\u201d in 1961, and then, what? There\u2019s also an eager hope that if this movie succeeds, it just might stave off another quarter-century drought. Producers use something called \u201ccomps\u201d \u2014 recent films similar to the ones they\u2019re pitching \u2014 to help sell studios on their ideas and budgets. For the producers of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d there weren\u2019t any. For scores of Asian-themed films to come, the hope goes, \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d could be that comp.Pretty hard, as it turned out. The talent was there. But as roles were considered and cast, the filmmakers contended with questions about identity amid the Asian diaspora. Could an Asian play an Asian-American? Could a Malaysian play a Singaporean? And what about an Asian guy with a white mom or dad \u2014 could he even be in the running?Many of these debates wouldn\u2019t be nearly as fraught \u201cif there were enough roles to go around,\u201d said Nancy Wang Yuen, the author of \u201cReel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism.\u201d She added: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be fighting over scraps. We should be fighting for the system to expand, so that all of us can get access to roles.\u201dOn a recent morning, Mr. Chu was here in his West Hollywood home, recounting the joys and struggles of casting his all-Asian feature. Sporting a white baseball cap and gray T-shirt, he talked about hiring legends (Michelle Yeoh) and relative unknowns (Henry Golding), Asian stars (Singapore\u2019s Fiona Xie) and Asian-Americans on the rise (Awkwafina).Mr. Chu also explained why he had cast such a wide net in the first place, supplementing the usual Los Angeles and New York casting calls with a five-continent search and an online open call. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t want to miss anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted this to be the \u2018Avengers\u2019 of Asian actors.\u201dThe search began in 2013, when the producers Nina Jacobson (\u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d), Brad Simpson (\u201cPose\u201d) and John Penotti (\u201cAwake\u201d) secured the rights to Mr. Kwan\u2019s book. In the story, Rachel, a Chinese-American professor at New York University, travels with her London-bred professor boyfriend, Nick, to Singapore, where he was born. Once there Rachel discovers two things: Nick\u2019s steely mother, Eleanor, thinks Rachel is beneath her, and Nick \u2014 and the rest of his family \u2014 is obscenely, stupefyingly wealthy.As it turns out, there were questions about casting even before the book hit stores. Mr. Kwan said a producer who wanted to option the book had suggested that he make Rachel white. Mr. Kwan refused.\u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d said Constance Wu, the Chinese-American actress who ultimately secured the role and who has been a vocal critic of Hollywood whitewashing. \u201cI\u2019m just glad that Kevin stuck to his guns. It takes a lot of courage to say no to something, especially if you\u2019re scared that everything might slip away if you don\u2019t say yes.\u201dEarly on, Ms. Jacobson and Mr. Simpson had certain actors in mind, like Ms. Yeoh, who was on everybody\u2019s wish list for Eleanor. Unlike most of her castmates, Ms. Yeoh had appeared in dozens of films with all-Asian casts, like the Jackie Chan classic \u201cPolice Story 3: Super Cop\u201d and the Oscar-winning \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d so, in some ways, this was nothing new. But those weren\u2019t Hollywood productions. \u201cIt was very important for me to see an all-Asian cast here,\u201d she said. \u201cTwenty-five years? I don\u2019t even understand why it\u2019s taken so long.\u201dFor other roles, the producers sought the help of veteran casting directors with connections to actors throughout Asia, like the Canada-based PoPing AuYeung (\u201cThe Forbidden Kingdom\u201d). They also looked at stage actors in New York and London, and checked in with some of the world\u2019s top drama schools, particularly in their search for the man who would embody Nick. \u201cOrdinarily when you\u2019re casting and maybe looking to break somebody, you go to the big theater programs,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said, adding, \u201cBut they were like, we have not had a male Asian graduate in years.\u201dWhen Mr. Chu announced his open call, thousands of videos poured in. Working actors from the United States, Singapore and elsewhere submitted auditions alongside those outside the industry who figured they had nothing to lose.Among the hopefuls was Cheryl Koh, better known as the YouTube singer Cheryl K, whose videos have garnered more than a million views. Although she was trying out for a role, any role, it was her 15-second, a cappella snippet of Jessie J\u2019s \u201cMamma Knows Best\u201d that convinced the filmmakers to give her a shot at singing the song under the opening credits, a Mandarin and English version of the Beatles hit \u201cMoney.\u201d\u201cWhen I got the news that Jon wanted me to do it, I couldn\u2019t stop screaming,\u201d she said.The cast soon became increasingly international. There was Gemma Chan and Jing Lusi from Britain; Chris Pang and Remy Hii from Australia; Pierre Png, Ms. Xie and a host of others from Singapore; Ronny Chieng and Ms. Yeoh from Malaysia; Lisa Lu and Jasmine Chen from China. Nico Santos had spent his childhood in the Philippines before moving to the United States and co-starring on \u201cSuperstore\u201d; Mr. Chieng was born in Malaysia and had gone to school in Australia before getting a regular gig on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Among the American-born crew, there were actors who hailed from Detroit (Ken Jeong); Queens (Awkwafina); and Richmond, Va. (Constance Wu).\u201cKen Jeong had to fly out to Kuala Lumpur just to shoot for a couple of days, and it wasn\u2019t a ton of money,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said. \u201cBut he was like, I want to play any part that you have for me in this.\u201dWith the entire world to pull from, the filmmakers faced several concerns about who they could cast to play what. There were the accents, of course. Whoever played Nick had to nail a British accent, which left out many of the Chinese box-office draws under consideration.And then there was the Singaporean sounds of Nick\u2019s friends and family. \u201cThis is the only accent I can do,\u201d said Mr. Chieng, who grew up in Singapore. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard many people with this accent, but it\u2019s pretty specific, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201dWith much of the action taking place there, there was a push to get as many Singaporeans as possible. If that wasn\u2019t possible, the producers said, they wanted to understand when a non-Singaporean could fill a Singaporean role.\u201cWe definitely always had \u2018Memoirs of a Geisha\u2019 in our heads,\u201d said Ms. Jacobson, referring to the 2005 film that starred three prominent Chinese actresses as Japanese women. (Unlike \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d that film, directed by Rob Marshall and based on a book by Arthur Golden, was a period piece, set in Japan before and after World War II.)In the end, only a handful of YouTube hopefuls got parts in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d \u2014 a woman in a text messaging scene here, a groomsman there. But now, said Mr. Chu, he has \u201cthe most amazing database of Asian talent that can speak English.\u201dOne of the last actors to be hired was Henry Golding, who auditioned for Nick. On paper, he was perfect. He was handsome and charismatic. Born in Malaysia to a mother from the Iban tribe there and a white British father, he had grown up in London, where he had acquired the requisite British accent, then spent much of the rest of his life in Asia, where he had worked as a travel host for BBC and Discovery Channel.The fact that he had never acted before seemed to only add to the Cinderella charm of his story, which went something like this: With just a few months to go before filming started and no Nick, an accountant with the production in Malaysia told a line producer about this sexy travel host \u201call the girls were gaga over.\u201d From there, Mr. Golding\u2019s name went up the chain.Ms. Chung walked back her comments soon after \u2014 \u201cI am sincerely sorry about the ignorant comment I made earlier in the year,\u201d she tweeted \u2014 and apologized to Mr. Golding.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to question motives of why they\u2019re choosing me instead of someone else,\u201d Mr. Golding told me. \u201cIt ensures that the studio knows, that everyone creating the story knows, that people are watching.\u201dEven so, he said, \u201cI never felt I wasn\u2019t suitable for the role because I was half-white. I\u2019ve always seen myself as Asian, so I never had any qualms about that. I was much more concerned if I could act.\u201dFor a while, Mr. Chu admitted, the questions about casting disturbed him, particularly the questions about Mr. Golding. \u201cAnd then I realized that I was only getting angry at the people who felt that they had been burned. They were people like me who had watched Hollywood whitewash things, and watched roles go away because someone said an Asian man can\u2019t be the lead of this or that.\u201dMuch of the current whitewashing, Ms. Yuen said, stems from manga and Marvel films that \u201cdraw from these Orientalist tropes, whether it\u2019s Asians in the past or Asia in the future. But Hollywood doesn\u2019t know how to incorporate Asians or Asian-Americans into that. It\u2019s like they want our look and our stories and our martial arts, but they don\u2019t want Asians.\u201dWith more and more people talking about diversity in casting and calling out examples of whitewashing, Mr. Chu sees positive developments, particularly for Asian-Americans. This week Netflix will begin streaming \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d a coming-of-age tale starring the Vietnamese-American Lana Condor. And on Aug. 24, two years after #StarringJohnCho began hyping the actor as \u201cthe star we deserve,\u201d there\u2019s \u201cSearching,\u201d a thriller starring, yes, John Cho.\u201cIf we make a decent showing on that first weekend, there are like six Asian-American lead movies set up at different studios,\u201d Mr. Chu said. \u201cThey\u2019re not greenlit. Everyone\u2019s waiting to see how this one does. But if this one does well, we\u2019ll immediately have more chances. And if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll just have to do it again.\u201dAn earlier version of this article omitted one of the producers who secured rights to the novel \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d He is John Penotti.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}

Now, the event is one of the largest annual gatherings of crossword enthusiasts. In \u201cWordplay,\u201d the director Patrick Creadon follows a handful of dedicated solvers who are competing to see who can complete the puzzle the fastest. Puzzle constructors explain their approaches to tackling the grid, and Mr. Shortz sheds light on the editing process, allowing viewers to see how he has infused the pages of The Times with his lifelong dedication to puzzles.\u201cObit,\u201d Vanessa Gould\u2019s 2017 documentary about The Times\u2019s obituaries desk, centers on the reporters and editors who summarize the lives of some of the biggest newsmakers of the day. Viewers watch as Bruce Weber, a veteran obituary writer, calls the bereaved, delicately gathering details on the deceased in time to make his deadline. The camera also travels inside The Times\u2019s morgue, a repository of historical newspaper clippings and photo archives, where Jeff Roth, its caretaker and a longtime employee, works closely with obituary writers to pull relevant images and research for the articles at hand.The documentarian Liz Garbus camped out at The Times for 16 months for this four-part series that debuted in May on Showtime. The film toggles between the paper\u2019s newsrooms in New York City and Washington, but focuses much of its energy on the nation\u2019s capital, where reporters chase leads on the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The film puts a face to bylines like Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt and Mark Mazzetti and offers viewers a sense of the personal sacrifices required for the job.Advertisement"}

Few felt it deeper than Edwin\u2019s thousands of fellow deliverymen, some of whom couldn\u2019t help but draw parallels between the \u201cjovencito de Guatemala\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe youngster from Guatemala,\u201d as they call him \u2014 and their personal stories.Like Edwin, these young men are constantly faced with the physical dangers, strenuous hours and facelessness of the job. But they also, like other aspirational New Yorkers, are balancing their gigs with why they came to the city in the first place: a better life. For them this means, besides making money, dining on chicken wings and pi\u00f1a coladas in Times Square, or going to superhero movies or heavy-metal stadium concerts, or taking photographs from the Brooklyn Bridge.With the immigration debate taking center stage this summer in a city that\u2019s seen a pizza deliveryman turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the threat of deportation has become increasingly real. At the same time, the outpouring of public support for undocumented New Yorkers facing expulsion has also brought a certain amount of recognition toward those who work the often thankless and dangerous job of meal delivery.Recently some deliverymen agreed to discuss the nature of their jobs with The New York Times. They all requested that their last names be withheld because of their immigration status.\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many accidents, and each time I think, \u2018This could have been me,\u2019\u201d said Fabi\u00e1n, a 21-year-old deliveryman from Mexico who donated money to Edwin\u2019s parents in Guatemala. Fabi\u00e1n vividly remembered the first time a driver, opening his car door, knocked him off his bike.\u201cHe looked down, saw me and left without even asking if I was fine,\u201d he recalled in Spanish.A co-worker once dislocated his arm after being hit by a car. According to Fabi\u00e1n, their employer, a Midtown Manhattan restaurant, refused to pay for medical expenses. This is standard treatment for \u201cdelivereros,\u201d he said. \u201cThe restaurant just told him: \u2018When you feel better, you can go back to work.\u2019\u201dLike Edwin, Fabi\u00e1n came here illegally and immediately started working. He was 16 then, and had come to New York to reunite with his father. It took him two weeks to reach the city. He hid from \u201cla migra\u201d (the United States Border Patrol) while climbing the border fence along Arizona with a group of migrants assembled by his smugglers. They walked for days across the rocky desert until they reached Tucson, where he was ordered to hide in the back of a truck. After another three days on the road and only one meal \u2014 \u201ca small McDonald\u2019s hamburger\u201d \u2014 Fabi\u00e1n arrived in New York, only to discover that his father had a new family here and that he was not welcome in their home.Some cousins from Queens found him a delivery job, one of the most accessible ways to earn a living for immigrants who do not speak English and have no documentation. This allowed Fabi\u00e1n to repay his father the $8,000 lent to him to pay the smugglers, while regularly wiring whatever extra money he could to his mother in Mexico.On a recent lunch shift, Fabi\u00e1n was just coming out of a building after a food delivery near Grand Central Terminal when it started raining. Without hesitating, he mounted his black Cannondale and began wending through the torrent of cars on 42nd Street toward his next drop-off location.Upon arrival, he waited, half-soaked in the office building\u2019s entrance on Madison Avenue. Minutes later, a man wearing a suit came out of the elevator and swiftly took the plastic bag out of his hands, without tipping him.\u201cIt happens fairly often,\u201d Fabi\u00e1n said after the incident. He used to clock as many as 12 hours a day, six days a week at his restaurant, which specializes in locally sourced American food.To blow off steam after his shift, Fabi\u00e1n often meets his five best friends \u2014 all deliverymen or construction workers \u2014 for cocktails at Dallas BBQ in Times Square. Sometimes they go to an action movie at the Regal multiplex next door \u2014 \u201cI now understand 80 percent of the dialogue,\u201d Fabi\u00e1n said.Other nights, he wanders the city with his old Nikon digital camera to take artistic pictures, often stopping at the Brooklyn Bridge. He edits his shots on his smartphone, sharing his favorite ones with his friends. And while he finds New York\u2019s pace relentless, Fabi\u00e1n said he loves it here.\u201cProvided that you work and make money, life is good,\u201d he said.The plethora of recent reports that ICE officers are clamping down on illegal immigrants, including in New York, hasn\u2019t changed his perspective.\u201cI know I\u2019m in this country illegally and there\u2019s a risk to be deported any day,\u201d he said in July. \u201cEven if Trump wasn\u2019t president, the risk would still exist, unless I become legal.\u201d\u201cOftentime, people treat us poorly \u2014 the streets are dangerous, the cars don\u2019t pay attention to us \u2014 but with the news coming out, they\u2019re starting to consider us a bit more,\u201d Fabi\u00e1n said. \u201cThey\u2019re realizing we\u2019re actual people.\u201d\u201cWhen you walk in the desert without any family to care for you, you\u2019re just terrorized of getting shot or running out of food and water,\u201d Fabi\u00e1n said.But far from being discouraged, Fabi\u00e1n said the current political climate motivates him even more to show that undocumented immigrants can elevate themselves. He is currently studying for his G.E.D., and has ambitions to go to college to study either marketing or video editing \u2014 he isn\u2019t sure yet which subject. But he does know he wants out of the delivery business.\u201cIt\u2019s too risky a job,\u201d he said.Arguably, delivery workers are at the bottom of the food chain in terms of safety and employment status.Of course, if a deliveryman is hit by a car on the job and the driver is at fault, he can sue the driver in court on his own. This rarely happens, though, because undocumented deliverymen are scared, isolated and, according to Mr. O\u2019Dwyer, often happen to be the ones at fault. Meanwhile, he added, the family of a deceased construction worker \u2014 another profession drawing undocumented immigrants but with a strong union affiliation that contributes to a more worker-friendly environment \u2014 can get millions in settlement money by suing the general contractor or the owner of the construction site, who, unlike a restaurant\u2019s landlord, are required by law to provide employees with a safe work environment.\u201cLawyers want these cases because they are very lucrative,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Dwyer, adding that, for the opposite reason, firms tend to turn down undocumented deliverymen cases, which may be worth only $50,000 for a fatal accident on the job.\u201cNow that\u2019s discrimination!\u201d Fabi\u00e1n said, triggering bursts of laughter among the other students.\u201cIsa\u00eda\u2019s life is just more valuable,\u201d Mr. Magallan went on, prompting another round of laughter, while pointing to the shy-looking student bent over his textbook.Isa\u00eda used to work as a deliveryman. About a year ago, he said, he was entering an intersection on his bike when he almost got hit by a car. For him, it was a turning point.\u201cI became increasingly scared after that, and that\u2019s when I decided to get a new job.\u201dIsa\u00eda came here illegally at 18, traveling with his 10-year-old brother from Mexico to join their mother after a decade apart from her (he hardly recognized her at first, he said). He now renovates apartments for a construction company and no longer has to risk his life, while being paid roughly the same as a deliveryman \u2014 $600 per week, in cash.But the work isn\u2019t consistent. A few months earlier, as business was slowing down, his company had asked him to sit tight for a while.\u201cThe rent and bill for my English classes were coming up, so I started to panic,\u201d Isa\u00eda said. Luckily, his company hired him back the following week.To take his mind off things, Isa\u00eda, whose goal is to study cooking and open a restaurant, practices dancing by himself to rock and hip-hop songs in the apartment he shares with Fabi\u00e1n and three others. He then shows off his moves at various live-music events around the city, which he attends with his group of friends from Zoni Language Centers, the private institute where he takes English classes every evening after work. To hone his language skills, he watches \u201cThe Flash,\u201d a superhero series on Netflix, with subtitles.And while he wished he had more privacy at home, Isa\u00eda also said he relishes the moment when he and Fabi\u00e1n can savor an iced coffee in the bedroom they share in Harlem, laughing and venting about their days after work.That sense of camaraderie is what Jer\u00f3nimo, a 27-year-old deliveryman from Mexico, misses about his early days in New York, when he shared an apartment with five other deliverymen.\u201cWe just partied all the time,\u201d he said.A decade later, Jer\u00f3nimo, who still delivers food for a deli in Greenpoint, but now lives with his wife in Sunset Park \u2014 they met at a restaurant where they both worked \u2014 said he\u2019s often too tired to go out regularly.Instead, Jer\u00f3nimo saves his outings for special occasions. A heavy-metal fan, he had one dream come true last year, when he saw Metallica play at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.Jer\u00f3nimo, who came here illegally, said he used to live in fear of being deported. \u201cI ran home every night after work to avoid getting caught,\u201d he said.These days, he is still running after work, but mostly back and forth in McCarren Park, where he and his co-workers often play soccer in the afternoon.Yet what he fears more consistently is getting into a bike accident on the job.Every morning, Jer\u00f3nimo rides past the Fifth Avenue intersection where Edwin was hit. A makeshift memorial of flowers, pictures and candles erected during a community vigil is now gone.Each time, he\u2019s reminded of what could happen to him.\u201cYou leave your house,\u201d Jer\u00f3nimo said. \u201cBut you never know if you\u2019ll be back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comedy Clubs Are Ready for Louis C.K.\u2019s Return. Is Everybody Else?", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe would, at this point, let Louis have stage time,\u201d Gina Savage, the general manager of the West Side Comedy Club in New York City, said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019ve known him many years. My interactions have been nothing but professional, which isn\u2019t to say I condone any aspect of what he did. But I do believe in my heart of hearts, he is remorseful.\u201dAl Martin, the owner of Broadway Comedy Club as well as another club in Greenwich Village, said in an interview that he\u2019d also include Louis C.K. in a lineup: \u201cWhat he did was wrong, as the father of three daughters. When I heard about it, I said it was not right.\u201dHowever, he continued, \u201cHe was disgraced in the eyes of a lot of people. I think he\u2019s really paid a pretty serious price.\u201dAs for comics, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Michael Che said in a series of posts on Instagram that were the subject of an intense backlash, \u201ci don\u2019t know any of his accusers. i dont know what hes done to right that situation, and its none of my business. but i do believe any free person has a right to speak and make a living.\u201d (Mr. Che declined to be interviewed for this article.)Similarly, the comedian Michael Ian Black announced his support on Twitter for Louis C.K., a stance that was also immediately criticized: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been long enough, or his career will recover, or if people will have him back, but I\u2019m happy to see him try,\u201d he wrote.He apologized on Wednesday, saying this position was \u201cultimately, not defensible.\u201d (A representative for Mr. Black didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.)In a statement at the time in which he admitted that \u201cthese stories are true,\u201d he said, \u201cI will now step back and take a long time to listen.\u201d The set on Sunday, according to the Comedy Cellar\u2019s owner, Noam Dworman, involved \u201ctypical Louis C.K. stuff,\u201d including bits on racism, waitresses\u2019 tips and parades. If he had gained insight from his time away from the stage, he didn\u2019t say so. Critics, including fellow comedians like Paul F. Tompkins, questioned why not, especially given Louis C.K.\u2019s reputation for self-deprecation to the point of discomfort.\u201cHe made a career out of embracing the uncomfortable. Suddenly this is beyond his powers to tackle?\u201d Mr. Tompkins said in an email, adding, \u201cWhere is the evidence that he cares at all to redeem himself? That he understands what he did was wrong? That he has learned anything? That he has tried to pay for his abuses with more than an enforced vacation? Show me.\u201dStill, other comedy denizens gave him the benefit of the doubt. Ms. Savage said not addressing his misconduct \u201cmight have been an oversight.\u201dThe fact that he dropped in unannounced on Sunday was also a much discussed topic among those connected with the scene. In New York City comedy, it is notoriously difficult for comics, especially up-and-comers, to find stage time at reputable clubs. Many have to rely on bringer shows \u2014 that is, they have to turn out a minimum number of audience members before they can get behind the mic. Kathy Griffin, in a post on Twitter, said this particularly affects women and minority stand-ups. \u201cAnd Louis just gets to glide back in on his own terms?\u201d Ms. Griffin wrote. \u201cGosh, does it payoff to be in the boys club ... the white boys club.\u201dBut some gatekeepers have a different view. Many comedy shows are independently produced and the producers operate at the whim of owners who need to generate buzz \u2014 and ticket sales \u2014 for their club.\u201cI have to put him on because that\u2019s what the owners are going to want to do,\u201d said Ray Gootz, a veteran comedian who produces multiple weekly shows around the city and has often welcomed drop-ins. \u201cAt a club, the owners are going to want to put him up because there\u2019s still money to be made with him and he\u2019s still a name. The other thing is he\u2019s one of the greatest comics of all time.\u201dMr. Gootz added, however, that if he were a club owner, he wouldn\u2019t let Louis C.K. onstage. \u201cThere\u2019s so many comedians,\u201d he said. \u201cI just feel that somebody who messed up this bad, regardless of how good they are, there\u2019s no reason to keep using him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d have to say no at this point,\u201d Mr. Humphrey said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the nine or 10 months he has gone through has been the proper atonement.\u201d But he added a caveat: \u201cIf he reached out to us at our show and said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m doing this new material about everything that\u2019s been going on in my life and I want to talk about it. Can I have a forum?\u2019 For sure.\u201dMs. Yang also said that Louis C.K. should \u201ctake a full accounting of all the earnings these survivors missed had they hypothetically continued on their career trajectories without your enablers. Pay them that amount.\u201dIf there\u2019s any profession that would easily allow a comeback in the #MeToo age, it\u2019s stand-up. In the end, Louis C.K. doesn\u2019t really need a studio greenlight or a network deal; he just needs a microphone and a space to work in, Mr. Tompkins noted.\u201cHe can definitely make a living doing standup again, as this shows,\u201d Mr. Tompkins said. \u201cHe can do comedy clubs and he can go back to theaters, I\u2019m sure. He can release his own specials even if Netflix or HBO don\u2019t want to carry them. I think he has a real opportunity to transform his life and the lives of other people for the better, to be an example that people can change if they want to, but this set doesn\u2019t indicate to me that he\u2019s headed that way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.HBO announced last week that the long-fabled \u201cDeadwood\u201d movie had been greenlighted and that it might air as soon as spring 2019. We\u2019ll see about that, but in the meantime, this calls for a \u201cDeadwood\u201d rewatch \u2014 especially since there isn\u2019t a ton of substantive drama on TV this summer anyway. These 36 episodes, about the fledgling Deadwood, S.D., of the 1870s, are among the best, most artful hours of TV in living memory, all the more rewarding upon multiple viewings. Try watching with the subtitles on to appreciate better the poetry and profanity, particularly from Al Swearengen (Ian McShane).This isn\u2019t technically a rom-com, but it does move and work exactly like a good, reliable one: A wedding goes wrong, a drunken montage leads to a surprise moment of bonding, someone chucks a cellphone into water out of frustration, and someone else buys a last-minute ticket at the airport. Except that Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer are playing a daughter and her long-estranged father, not would-be lovers. Brace yourself for the cruise commercial that takes up a chunk of the movie, but give in to the fun, easy rhythms and the inevitably excellent karaoke scene.Behold the hazy cinematography, slow pacing and saxophone riffs that were everywhere in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s. This British drama from that era has them all. Zo\u00eb Wanamaker stars as Tessa, who decides to revamp her entire life after her boss and lover jilts her for a younger woman. She swears off love only to encounter Frank (Adam Faith), a total charmer. If you like human-scale dramas, sweet love stories and pleated pants, try this.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andie MacDowell, Still Worth It", "Date": "2018-08-11", "News": "at home with \u2026One of the original 1980s model-actresses on her very modern maturity.Supported byThis early examination of digitally mediated relationships is worth a revisit: The success with which the protagonist\u2019s camera unzipped his subjects makes the Kardashians seem like pikers.The sex in that film was suggested. But in \u201cLove After Love,\u201d which entranced reviewers during an earlier theatrical release, Ms. MacDowell has the first nude scene of her long career.Hearty chuckle. With projects including playing a madcap American in the fifth season of \u201cCuckoo,\u201d a British farce, out later this year, and a bohemian hippie sidekick to Richard Dreyfuss and Chevy Chase in \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d for early 2019 (both on Netflix), Ms. MacDowell can afford to relax this summer. If only she could.It was teatime late last month, and Ms. MacDowell was sitting on a well-worn sofa upholstered in a faded cabbage rose print in the living room of her modest ranch house, mildly exasperated by her inability to recall the names of two current movie stars. A wheezy, nervous, rescued Chihuahua-Boston terrier mix named Ava Gardner clung to her lap as the actress, whose beauty still startles, explained how a 2016 film, \u201cCertain Women,\u201d was an exemplar of the kind of work she\u2019d like to be doing. Though she couldn\u2019t actually remember the title.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrific movie,\u201d she said, \u201cLaura Dern is in it and that girl from the vampire movies, what\u2019s her name? And that actress from Montana. Names! What the hell is that all about?\u201d(Why not Google? Because at a certain age, there is honor in eschewing that mnemonic short cut.)\u201cMichelle Williams!\u201d she said triumphantly, referring to a star of \u201cCertain Women.\u201dMs. MacDowell herself has passed in and out of stardom, as a model turned actress who never quite got her due, especially for her calm comic presence (she was marvelous in \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d). Often she was cast as a somewhat elusive, well-scrubbed ideal (as in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u201d in which she somehow made a fisherman\u2019s sweater seem sexier than a bikini). As has been the case for many beautiful women, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s extraordinary face has sometimes confused those seeking to employ her as an actress. Born in Gaffney, S.C., she came up as a model in the late 1970s, her rosy cheeks and untamed hair a welcome alternative to the sleek blondes \u2014 Cybill, Christie and Cheryl \u2014 who had dominated that decade. Since 1985, she has been under contract to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, that company\u2019s longest reigning spokesperson. In ads for Calvin Klein jeans, Ms. MacDowell improvised a naughtier sort of down-home girl. She is proud that Ram Dass is one of her over 45,000 followers and amused that Deepak Chopra followed her for one day. (He wanted to invite her to an event by direct message, she said. \u201cThen he unfollowed me. Whatever. I don\u2019t care. I have Ram Dass!\u201d)Yet in 2016, she was slammed as an elitist when she posted a selfie from an American Airlines flight that carried this caption: \u201cHELP, I paid for first-class and they put me in tourist because of my dog that I pre-booked and paid for.\u201d She was carrying Ava Gardner, whom she had just rescued, from Los Angeles to Charleston, S.C., and a steward bumped her to coach, saying there wasn\u2019t enough room in first class. Twitterers didn\u2019t like the word \u201ctourist,\u201d nor did they like a complainer, they complained.Ms. MacDowell\u2019s gracious response, offering to donate her refund to charity and noting how she\u2019d let the flight attendant\u2019s rudeness rub off on her, may serve as primer for more impulsive celebrities. She is lately more sanguine about the trolls, she said. \u201cPeople tell me I\u2019m not relevant anymore, blah, blah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut who wants to be relevant? It\u2019s a lot of work, to stay in that place forever. I\u2019ve never wanted to sell myself. All I ever wanted was for someone to take me seriously.\u201d\u201cShe was of the stature and the sort of person I wanted to impress,\u201d Ms. MacDowell said. \u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t want to sell myself now, either. I\u2019m 60, for godsakes! There\u2019s this artist I saw at the Tate, a video artist, and she was so like me. She\u2019d set up her camera and come down in the morning and lean in like this,\u201d \u2014 Ms. MacDowell leaned forth, solemnly, and dropped her voice an octave \u2014 \u201cand say, \u2018Good morning.\u2019 And then in the evening she\u2019d come back and say, \u2018Good night\u2019. If I knew how to do my Instagram, I\u2019d be just like her. And if I could remember her name and meet her, I think she would like me and we\u2019d be friends.\u201dMs. MacDowell has quietly been part of this flowering.The experiences of her character in \u201cLove After Love\u201d \u2014 her sexual explorations, her sometimes hapless dating encounters and adult sons \u2014 dovetail somewhat with her own. Her son, Justin Qualley, who works in real estate in Montana, is 31; her daughters Rainey Qualley, a pop singer, and Margaret Qualley, an actress, are 28 and 23. Their father is Paul Qualley, a former model and contractor from whom Ms. MacDowell has been divorced for nearly two decades. She was married briefly to Rhett Hartzog, a businessman, whom she divorced in 2004. Having raised her children first here in Montana, and then in Asheville, N.C., where she was known as Rose Qualley, she is newly an empty nester and experimenting with life in Los Angeles, her first true immersion in that company town.\u201cYou know what\u2019s great?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a nobody there. Nobody cares that I\u2019m a movie star, whatever that is. Because everyone else is, too.\u201d Regarding solitude, she said, \u201cI do know from experience what\u2019s it like to be alone, but I am good at it. And I do know sadness. You can\u2019t get to my age without having felt some kind of intense pain.\u201dAt 23, Ms. MacDowell was working as a model in Paris when her mother died of heart failure. She was 53, and had been a severe alcoholic. Ms. MacDowell, the youngest of four daughters, had been her mother\u2019s caretaker: plucking the smoldering cigarettes from her fingers when she passed out on the floor and covering her with a blanket. When Ms. MacDowell was 16, she staged an intervention, which failed, and when her mother was fired from her job at the McDonald\u2019s where they both worked, it was Ms. MacDowell who drove her to work on that last day because her mother had lost her driver\u2019s license. \u201cInterestingly enough,\u201d she went on, \u201cwe had a good relationship. I had a lot of empathy for her. I was the last one home, and I didn\u2019t want to leave her like that.\u201dA few months before she died, Ms. MacDowell\u2019s mother wrote her a letter. \u201cShe told me she quit drinking,\u201d she said, \u201cand that she was very proud of me and that I deserved to have a mother who was sober. I was supposed to go home for Thanksgiving, but I did not. I really regret that. I\u2019m always trying to grab ahold of my children and spend time with them. I have to remember it\u2019s natural at that age to want to experience the world on your own.\u201dA few years ago, Ms. MacDowell was on another flight and began talking with her seat mate. \u201cWe had a nice chat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end she told me, \u2018I\u2019m a mindfulness therapist and I just wanted to tell you that you have a lot of anxiety.\u2019 Yeah, no kidding!\u201d Indeed, she said, being anxious is her legacy and that she\u2019s been amusing herself by trying to break down her tics (the constant motion of her hands, for example), so she can use them in her work. Russ Harbaugh, the 34-year-old director of \u201cLove After Love,\u201d said his first choice for the role was a more conventional bet, an older actress with three Oscar nominations who left before he was able to secure financing. There was some pressure to cast a surer box office wager, but all along Mr. Harbaugh felt that Ms. MacDowell would be, as he put it, transformative. On the night before filming was to begin, she called him into her hotel room. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d he recalled Ms. MacDowell saying.\u201cI think she was honestly feeling not good enough,\u201d Mr. Harbaugh said. \u201cSo I told her the story of how she was cast. In this business, you don\u2019t want people to feel like they\u2019re not your first choice but she didn\u2019t need me to lie to her. I wanted her to know that I sought her out.\u201dMs. MacDowell remembers the exchange differently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I could do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that the relationship between Russ and Chris\u201d \u2014 O\u2019Dowd, who plays one of her sons \u2014 \u201cwas so strong, I felt left out. There didn\u2019t seem to be any room for me. I didn\u2019t have any reservations about the role. I needed to know that he wanted me. I wanted to know that I was supposed to be there. I felt like the seventh child in a family that nobody notices. I guess I wanted to know that he loved me, and once I had that, I felt safe.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New York Times Reviews Neil Simon", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA look at the work of Neil Simon over the decades reveals a prolific chronicler of New York City life who examined angst, romance and ambition through a comic lens, whether for the stage, film or television. Critics, like audiences in general, were mixed in their response to Mr. Simon\u2019s comedy, which tended toward shticky one-liners and heart-squeezing monologues. Here is a look at his most notable works, how The New York Times reviewed them and (when available) where you can stream them.\u201cMr. Simon evidently has no aspirations except to be diverting, and he achieves those with the dash of a highly skilled professional writer,\u201d Mr. Taubman wrote.In his review, Mr. Taubman wrote of Mr. Simon: \u201cHis skill \u2014 and it is not only great but constantly growing \u2014 lies in his gift for the deliciously surprising line and attitude. His instinct for incongruity is faultless. It nearly always operates on a basis of character.\u201dThe film was remade in 1999 with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, but without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.Mr. Simon, he wrote, \u201chas taken the trouble to trouble his people, tease the laughs to see what real woes lie beneath them. He has made a magnificent effort to part company with the mechanical, and his overall success stands as handsome proof that humor and honesty can be got into bed together. But in winnowing out the last traces of contrived situation comedy, Mr. Simon may also have thrown away situation itself.\u201dThe Farrelly Brothers remade the film in 2007 with Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan and Malin Akerman, without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.That same month, CBS aired a new TV movie of the play, again adapted by Mr. Simon and updated to the 1990s, with Woody Allen and Peter Falk in the leading roles.Two years later, Mr. Simon and the director Robert Moore teamed up once again with Mr. Falk and Ms. Brennan for \u201cThe Cheap Detective,\u201d in which (as in \u201cMurder by Death\u201d), Mr. Falk starred as a Humphrey Bogart-style private investigator.Mr. Simon received his third Academy Award nomination for this original screenplay, in which a newly dumped single mother (Marsha Mason) is forced into an \u201cOdd Couple\u201d-style relationship with a guitar-strumming, yoga-practicing new-to-New-York actor (Richard Dreyfuss). They initially drive each other crazy but, of course, eventually fall in love. Mr. Dreyfuss won the Oscar for best actor; in addition to Mr. Simon\u2019s script, the film was nominated for best actress, best supporting actress (for Quinn Cummings) and best picture.In a reversal of his usual migration, Mr. Simon subsequently adapted the film script for the stage. The Broadway musical version of \u201cThe Goodbye Girl\u201d debuted in February 1993 and ran 188 performances, with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short in the leads.Nine years later, Mr. Simon removed the music and rewrote the script again for a TV movie adaptation, directed by Richard Benjamin. Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton took over the leading roles.\u201cAs adapted by Mr. Simon himself and directed smoothly and adroitly by Martha Coolidge,\u201d Janet Maslin wrote, \u201cNeil Simon\u2019s \u2018Lost in Yonkers\u2019 is sometimes more picturesque than powerful. But it conveys all the warmth and color of the original material.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Performs First Stand-Up Set at Club Since Admitting to #MeToo Cases", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe appeared around 11 p.m., said Noam Dworman, the owner of the Cellar, the Greenwich Village club with a long tradition of surprise appearances by famous comedians. Dressed in a black V-neck T-shirt and gray pants, he did a 15-minute set that touched on what Mr. Dworman called \u201ctypical Louis C.K. stuff\u201d \u2014 racism, waitresses\u2019 tips, parades. \u201cIt sounded just like he was trying to work out some new material, almost like any time of the last 10 years he would come in at the beginning of a new act.\u201dMr. Dworman said Louis C.K. \u201cwas very relaxed,\u201d and the audience, a sold-out crowd of about 115, greeted him warmly, with an ovation even before he began. (Mr. Dworman was at home asleep, but club staff texted him about the appearance, and he later watched a tape of it, he said.)One audience member called the club on Monday to object to the surprise set, the owner said. \u201cHe wished he had known in advance, so he could\u2019ve decided whether to have been there or not,\u201d Mr. Dworman said. But several other patrons responded to a standard email follow-up from the club to say they were happy they caught the show.Mr. Dworman said that as a business owner, he was in a difficult position. \u201cI understand that some people will be upset with me. I care about my customers very much. Every complaint goes through me like a knife. And I care about doing the right thing.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cthere can\u2019t be a permanent life sentence on someone who does something wrong.\u201d The social standards about how to respond to errant behavior are inconsistent, he said, and now shifting ever faster, and audiences should have the leeway to decide what to watch themselves. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be better off as a society if we stop looking to the bottlenecks of distribution \u2014 Twitter, Netflix, Facebook or comedy clubs \u2014 to filter the world for us.\u201dYet he too said he was surprised that Louis C.K. re-emerged so quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to happen as soon as it did,\u201d he said. \u201cI had thought that the first time he\u2019d go on would be in a more controlled environment. But he decided to just rip the Band-Aid off.\u201dJason Zinoman contributed reporting to this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Tweets on Tesla Started a Tizzy. Someone Should Hit the Brakes.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhy do people say the craziest things on Twitter?What is it about social media that makes powerful, accomplished individuals say things that they later need to recant, walk back or at least explain?This isn\u2019t about President Trump (although it could be). It is about chief executives.For years, companies and their executives were limited to disclosing market-moving information in news releases that were widely distributed over services like Business Wire or in interviews with media outlets. That is, until Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, broke ranks in 2012 and wrote on his Facebook page that the company\u2019s video-streaming service had \u201cexceeded 1 billion hours for the first time.\u201dThat, in turn, led to what\u2019s known as the Reed Hastings Rule, when the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted such use of social media. \u201cMost social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors,\u201d said George S. Canellos, the agency\u2019s acting enforcement chief at the time.But given the brevity Twitter requires \u2014 its character limit was doubled to 280 characters last year \u2014 it is perhaps inevitable that people will be misunderstood, even when they tweet with the best of intentions.\u201cAll tweets are misleading with such a short character limit,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be encouraging the use of Twitter for its executives. They should forbid it.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld said such a prohibition should be a company guideline, not a legislative requirement, adding he did not believe the government should get involved in what constitutes a news release.But still, regulators could at least encourage companies to remind their executives that Twitter is better used as a place to offer idle musings rather than corporate missives.Individuals are responsible for their own behavior \u2014 or what comes out of their mouth or keystrokes. Still, all too often, boldface-name executives, politicians and celebrities have needed to \u201cclarify\u201d their comments on Twitter. (I\u2019ve had to do it myself.)Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, once tweeted about \u201cscumbag celebrities\u201d only to return to Twitter with a clarification: \u201cI never referred to any particular people, just some \u2018dodgy\u2019 self promoting celebrities. Repeat apology for language.\u201dRob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, defended the company on Twitter over the role that Russia-linked advertisements played in the 2016 United States presidential election. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal,\u201d he wrote. The company ended up issuing a clarification.For reasons that remain inexplicable, Twitter seems to create an impulse control problem for too many \u2014 and when billions of dollars of investors\u2019 money is on the line and the credibility of the markets are at stake, that seems like a risk not worth taking.Regulators may end up not having a problem with Mr. Musk\u2019s message, but the existing rule has an important caveat that involves the audience it reached.In discussing enforcement of the Reed Hastings Rule, Mr. Canellos said social media was not an appropriate vehicle for announcements \u201cif the access is restricted or if investors don\u2019t know that\u2019s where they need to turn to get the latest news.\u201dThat means if companies and their executives want to use Twitter to disseminate news, they should not be allowed to block people from following their accounts, including those who manage to get under their skin. Mr. Musk has repeatedly blocked such trolls on Twitter.This issue is a variation of a theme that emerged in a court case this year in which a judge found it inappropriate for Mr. Trump to block users, given his public role.Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter has illustrated the danger of disclosing market-moving information, exemplified by his tweet before the employment report in which he seemed to hint the numbers were going to be good.It is perhaps an irresistible temptation, but one that companies have seen fit to punish in the past. Gene Morphis, chief financial officer for the specialty women\u2019s retailer Francesca\u2019s, was fired in 2012 for his use of social media posts like, \u201cBoard meeting. Good numbers=Happy Board.\u201dPerhaps the original executive maverick on Twitter was Alan Meckler, chief executive of WebMediaBrands. He started sending tweets in 2011 that would regularly move his company\u2019s stock.\u201cGood chance we will be making a few acquisitions by middle of March,\u201d he would write. Or he would send a tweet pointing out that the company\u2019s earnings report would be out in a week, with a winking reference to promising revenue numbers: \u201cRev. Growth big.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission inquired about Mr. Meckler\u2019s use of Twitter, but eventually closed the case.It shouldn\u2019t have, or at least it could have sent a warning. Maybe Mr. Musk would have heard it.Advertisement"}
